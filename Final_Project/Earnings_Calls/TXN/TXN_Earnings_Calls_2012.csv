As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available to the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 8. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. 
There are a number of important things taking place in our market and inside of TI. Similar to our October call, we will provide additional detail during today's call to help you understand our results and outlook. So let me start with the market environment. 
As you can see, the fourth quarter revenue of $3.42 billion was significantly stronger than the reduced outlook we had provided during the mid-quarter update. Higher than expected revenue came in all our major product lines. We believe this strength well to our outlook is consistent with the historical bottoming pattern in the industry. The slowdown that began in the third quarter continued in the fourth during which customers and distributors were significantly reducing inventory. 
In December, with low levels of customer inventory and short TI product lead time, we experienced significant strength compared to what our backlog indicated at the start of the month. Our belief based on historical trends is that the semiconductor market bottomed in fourth quarter '11 or else will bottom in first quarter '12. Our important market indicators were consistent with this belief. New orders declined 7% sequentially, book-to-bill was 0.84 and distribution inventory dropped to historically low levels. So despite low levels of backlog and visibility, we are forecasting that our first quarter revenue will decline only about 2% compared with the seasonal average decline of about 4% excluding baseband. 
Second, as we enter 2012, we are beginning the final phase of our baseband business. Baseband revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect it will fall to about $75 million in the first quarter and remain between $50 million and $100 million per quarter during 2012. At that level, it will be only a couple percent of our total revenue. I believe investors will be pleased to see our company results driven by our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing and not the decline in baseband. 
Third, the fourth quarter results include a full quarter of the National Semiconductor operation now called Silicon Valley Analog. Our confidence in accelerating the revenue growth from the National portfolio continues to grow as we spend more time with customers and see the impact of our larger sales force. Kevin will detail the accounting charges associated with National, both in the fourth quarter and the first, and provide an outlook across the remainder of 2012. 
Finally, we announced today our plans to close 2 older manufacturing sites. Kevin will detail both the charges and planned savings from these changes. Let's now walk through the fourth quarter results. 
Total revenue of $3.42 billion declined 3% from year ago and was down 1% sequentially. The positive contribution from a full quarter of Silicon Valley Analog revenue and growth in wireless revenue, especially from OMAP applications processors, helped offset declines elsewhere. 
Earnings per share were $0.25 on a GAAP basis or $0.48 when total acquisition-related and restructuring charges are excluded. Analog revenue of $1.70 billion grew 12% from a year ago and 9%, sequentially, reflecting the inclusion of a full quarter of SVA revenue. 
Our other 3 Analog businesses, HPA, Power and HVAL declined sequentially with HPA down most. Last quarter, we provided historical data for SVA on our website. If you compare its July through September revenue with the fourth quarter, it would have trended in a downward range similar to the remainder of our Analog businesses. 
Like HPA, SVA has exposure to the industrial market, which has been weaker than the overall market recently. I realized there's also interest in the impact of the Thailand floods. Our area of most direct exposure is our Analog storage product line. This revenue declined over 20% compared with the year ago period and sequentially. Encouragingly, the month of December was our strongest month of the quarter as our customers began to recover. 
Embedded Processing revenue declined 18% in both comparisons. As we indicated in our mid-quarter update, communications infrastructure was especially weak in the quarter with revenue down about 40% sequentially and compared with the year ago quarter. This decline was a result of market weakness especially due to particular service providers in the U.S. that has put a temporary hold on their capital spending. Our position within our customer base remains strong. And by the end of the quarter, we began to see some recovery in their demand. Nonetheless, these products are highly complex and are some of our more profitable products, which also negatively affected our mix in this segment and the company overall. 
Embedded Processing catalog products with their exposure to the industrial market were also weak with double-digit percentage declines in both comparisons. Products for automotive applications grew double digits from a year ago and were about even sequentially. 
In Wireless, revenue declined 6% from a year ago but grew 24% sequentially. Sequentially, all the product lines grew including OMAP applications processors, connectivity products and baseband. 
OMAP made up the strong majority of this growth, as we benefited from new product introductions at multiple customers and their associated channel sales. In our Other segment, revenue declined 20% from a year ago and declined 29% sequentially. Calculated revenue declined seasonally a little more than $100 million compared with the third quarter. 
DLP revenue was also relatively weak following our strong third quarter recovery from supply issues associated with the earthquake earlier in the year. Custom ASIC products declined, reflecting their high exposure to the communications infrastructure market. 
I will note that the fourth quarter was the last quarter that we will receive revenue from Spansion as part of our transitional supply agreement following our purchase of the Aizu fab in Japan in 2010. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter from this agreement was about $30 million. In distribution, resales or sales out of the channel declined 8% sequentially. Growth was about the same whether SVA was included or excluded from both periods. Inventory distributors, which now includes our SVA inventory, declined by about 0.5 weeks in the quarter to 6.5 weeks. 
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",1155
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2012",2012-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3697.0,209586.0,12306637.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter. Total charges in the quarter were $0.23 including $0.16 of total acquisition-related charges and $0.07 restructuring charges. Let me explain each. 
As you will recall, we said in October that our total acquisition-related charges would be in 2 separate income statement lines in the fourth quarter. We consolidated most of those costs, such as restructuring costs, transaction costs, retention bonuses and amortization of intangibles, on the income statement line that we've identified as acquisition charges. 
In the fourth quarter, we had $153 million of acquisition charges on this line. Also, we discussed last quarter accounting rules required that we write up the inventory that we initially acquired as part of the acquisition to fair value and then recognize this expense as part of cost of revenue as the inventory is sold. 
In the fourth quarter, we had $103 million of acquisition charges, primarily associated with the write up of inventory. Going forward, although we have now depleted the inventory we acquired directly from National, we will have one additional quarter of acquisition charges included in cost of revenue. This is associated with our discontinuance of one of National's distributors. In this case, we acquired the distributors' entire SVA inventory at fair value. Therefore, cost of revenue in the first quarter will include a $20 million acquisition-related charge. After the first quarter, we expect the ongoing acquisition-related expenses and cost of revenue to be immaterial and we will not call these out separately. 
So the total acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter are the $153 million on the acquisition charge line with the income statement plus the $103 million, including cost of revenue, for a total of $256 million. This negatively impacted EPS in the fourth quarter by $0.16. Also, in the quarter, we have restructuring charges associated with our planned closure of 2 factory sites. 
We announced today that we will close 2 older 6-inch wafer fabs in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas. Both of these sites have made significant contributions and demonstrate the tremendous cash flow potential associated with Analog products where factory lives are literally measured in decades. 
Our Hiji fab is 32 years old and our Houston fab is 45 years old. And we are now at the point where it makes financial sense to transition the remaining products to more advanced factories. Combined, these 2 factories supported about 4% of TI's revenue in 2011 and each employs about 500 people. 
The charge for these closures is estimated at $215 million, of which $112 million was taken in the fourth quarter and the remainder will occur ratably over the next 7 quarters. Annual savings will be about $100 million once the transition is complete. You could find the $112 million charge on the restructuring charges line of the income statement. This same line will carry the remaining charges in future quarters. 
The EPS impact in the fourth quarter of the $112 million charge is $0.07. So in summary, total acquisition-related and restructuring charges in the quarter reduced our reported EPS by $0.23. When you review our segment results, all of these charges are carried in our Other segment. 
Gross profit of $1.55 billion declined 11% sequentially. There were 3 items that negatively impacted gross profit and gross margin in the fourth quarter. First, underutilization was significant in the quarter as we reduced production buildings [ph] to avoid excess inventory. We were utilizing just a little over half of our total factory capacity in the quarter, and the amount expensed with this underutilization was about $110 million, which is about $20 million higher than the third quarter underutilization charge. As demand returns and we increase factory utilization again, this expense will reduce. 
Second, there was the recognition of the $103 million acquisition-related write up of inventories [ph] as described. Third, we took a charge of $44 million for excess baseband inventory. 
Gross margin in the quarter was 45.3%. It's interesting to adjust this amount to exclude the impact of the acquisition-related charge and the baseband inventory charge. In that case, our gross margin increases 430 basis points to almost 50%. The closest recent utilization comparison is 2Q '09 when utilization was in the mid-50s or about 5% of the expense higher than the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter of 2009, gross margin was 4 to 5 points below the adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter despite the higher utilization level. This improvement in gross margin reflects a combination of improved mix and more efficient and cost effective factory operations. And as our utilization improves from here, so will our gross margin. 
Operating expenses of $918 million increased $135 million compared with the prior quarter. Most of this increase was the result of including a full quarter of Silicon Valley Analog results compared with only a few days in the last quarter. There was also a negative transitional effect associated with the catch-up adjustments that were made to the variable components of our compensation plans in the third quarter that did not recur in the fourth quarter. 
Our annual effective tax rate was lowered from our 25% estimate to 24%. The accumulative adjustment for this change had a net discrete tax benefit of $11 million, lowered our tax rate for the quarter to 15%. Net income in the fourth quarter was $298 million or $0.25 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restriction stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the fourth quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $5 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be as any higher than we have reported. I'll leave most of cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release; however, let me just make a few comments. 
Cash flow from operations was $970 million, down $170 million from last quarter. Capital expenditures were $152 million in the quarter, down from $193 million in the prior quarter. We used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 10.4 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $193 million. We reduced our inventory by $177 million in the quarter. The decline is primarily due to the recognition of the fair value write up of the acquired inventory as well as our action to reduce production loadings. It also includes the baseband inventory charge. Inventory days were 86 or 91 if you exclude the impact of acquisition charges from cost of revenue in this calculation. And 91 days is comparable to the 92 days that we discussed in the third quarter. 
Orders of $2.86 billion in the quarter were down 7% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.84 in the quarter. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.02 billion to $3.28 billion in the first quarter or down 12% to down 4% sequentially. Keep in mind that we expect baseband revenue to decline from $279 million in the fourth quarter to about $75 million in the first quarter. This means at the middle of our guidance range, we expect the remainder of our revenue to decline about 2%, which is a little better than the seasonal average. 
As Ron said earlier, we expect baseband revenue to remain in a $50 million to $100 million range per quarter for the remainder of 2012. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.24. We expect EPS will be negatively impacted by about $0.09 associated with total acquisition-related charges including about $150 million of acquisition charges and additionally about $20 million of charges included in cost of revenue. Also, restructuring charges associated with the planned factory closures that I previously discussed will be about a $0.01 impact on EPS. 
For 2012, our estimate for R&D is $2 billion. For capital expenditures, it's $700 million; and for depreciation, it's $1 billion. Our estimate for our annual effective tax rate in 2012 is 28%, 4 percentage points higher than in 2011, reflecting our expectation of higher profits in 2012 and the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. Our estimates for total acquisition-related charges for the remainder of 2012 are as follows: After about $170 million in the first quarter, we expect the charge in the second quarter to drop to about $110 million and then continue to decline by about $10 million per quarter until we reach $80 million, which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles amount that will continue for 8 to 10 years. We will continue to update you on our expectations as we move forward and we will make these charges visible for you as we report. 
To help you understand our transition from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, let me provide you some visibility this quarter beyond our traditional guidance. First, at the middle of our guidance range, revenue will decline about $270 million in the fourth quarter or 8%. The decline is mostly due to the decline of baseband revenue, although the completion of our Spansion contract is also a contributor. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit should fall about $70 million to $1.48 billion. This includes the acquisition-related charge of $20 million that will be included in cost of revenue. This charge is about $80 million lower than what it was in the fourth quarter. Also, if you are comparing with the fourth quarter, we do not expect to repeat the $44 million charge for excess baseband inventory in the first quarter. 
Cost of revenue will reflect some seasonally higher expenses as employees take less vacation holiday time in the first quarter and as annual pay and benefit increases take hold. Also, the first quarter will include some additional cost as we move from attrition to hiring manufacturing employees in anticipation of stronger demand ahead. We expect operating expenses of about $975 million in the first quarter or about $50 million to $60 million higher than the fourth quarter level. Again, this will reflect seasonally higher expenses due to the less vacation and holiday time in the first quarter as well as annual pay and benefit increases. 
Restructuring costs will decline to about $15 million in the first quarter. This will be about $100 million less than the fourth quarter level. The remaining acquisition charges that are not included in cost of revenue will be about $150 million, about the same as the fourth quarter. 
Other income and interest expense will be about the same in the first quarter as the fourth quarter. And finally, as I previously described, our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2012 is 28%, and that is the rate that you should model for the first quarter as well. Therefore, net income in the first quarter should be about $235 million or about $0.20 per share. 
In summary, the market continues to show promising signs and the bottom has formed and that demand could begin to improve soon. When it does, we intend to be well positioned with capacity and inventory. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",1885

Right now, as I mentioned or Ron mentioned, we have drained about $850 million of backlog over the last few quarters, so our visibility in the first quarter is quite low. But looking at just the classic signs of what we've seen in many cycles in the past, we do believe we are at  or near the bottom of the cycle. Our distributor inventories are at record lows of about 6.5 weeks, so we would call that very lean. And it certainly looks like our customer inventories are very lean also, especially as evidenced by the unexpected uptick in demand that we had in the second half of December. From the standpoint of how quickly it soaks   back up, that's probably a little bit hard to quantify with any kind of precision given the visibility due to our backlog. But I would point out that from a inventory standpoint, our days of inventory are well staged. If you compare that to the last time we saw a cycle that was probably somewhat similar was back in first half of '09. At that point in time, we came out of first quarter '09 into second quarter '09 with a days of inventory that was down in the mid-70s. This time, we're looking to about 91 days. In addition, as I mentioned, we're beginning to increase our manufacturing staff in anticipation of increased demand. So we will be well positioned for when the demand does come back. Just how steep that slope is a little bit tough to call. Ron, you might add some color.",277

Our view is that distribution inventory is on the low side and probably does need some replenishment. They're not at that point yet where they've begun to replenish, but history would suggest that, in fact, that will occur. And just in general, regarding the slope, we don't really know. But if you just look at history, our industry clearly doesn't have a history of a smooth, low-slope transitions in terms of how it recovers. So we'll be prepared accordingly.

We see the demand, but it's very difficult for us to be able to kind of see through all the customers' channel to understand is that –- does it reflect a movement on in demand or is it just that their inventory correction is beginning to slow. And as you heard us say even back in third quarter, our customers, we believe, were reducing inventory. So even if demand were to remain stable, if the customers just slowed their inventory reduction, that would translate to growth on our end. So again, what we saw late December was very broad-based growth. And again, beyond in terms of is that in demand or just slowing of inventory correction, we don't know. By end market, to be honest with that, we don't have at the mid-quarter update a detailed cut. But I would say based upon the breadth that we saw upside in our product lines, our view is that it really went across almost all end markets as well as almost all regions as well. So I don't have a lot of precision. But again, the feeling is that it was very broad-based across product lines, regions as well as in markets. Do you have a follow on Vivek?",213

If I look at -- I mean, what I would like to understand is just the trajectory of OpEx in 2012. But more importantly, I think you're guiding R&D up 5% in 2012 if I just compare it to an annualized Q4, that number. And I'm trying to align that with the cost synergy that you were expecting with the NSN integration before. Is the spending higher than what you had expected before? Or were those cost synergies more in SG&A rather than R&D?",85

So to put another way, in 2012, of course, we'll have 4 quarters of National in there. Whereas in 2011, we only had one quarter, so that may be kind of what you're seeing on that front. As far as where OpEx is going, I think the best thing to do is probably just use the fourth quarter guidance that we've given and then go ahead and model from there using the kind of seasonal history that you can pretty clearly see when you take a look at our reported financial results. And as we talked about, we expect OpEx to be up fourth quarter to first quarter in the $50 million to $60 million range. So if you start there and then model that out, that will get you to a pretty good estimate, I think, over 2012 in mind [ph].",174

And I realize there's a lot of mix that goes into that as well, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the model now with National included and the baseband business unwinding?",101

To the question of what revenue level gets us to the kind of model GPM, I'm kind of a -- defer that until we can actually produce an actual to represent that to you. Clearly, it's higher than we're at right now. If you just go back and take a look in history, you can see there were a couple times where we approached the 55% kind of gross margin. You can go back into late 2010 and see those kind of numbers that were showing up. So that might be one point of reference for you to just take a look at to anticipate where we'd need to be as we get back to those kind of gross margins.",175

So RFAB utilization is about 25% currently. And that includes all the equipment that we purchased, even though some of it may still be shrink-wrapped and in storage. So all the equipment that we purchased for RFAB in that consideration, we have 25% utilization. And again, the equipped capacity that we're talking about today from a revenue standpoint is about $2 billion. So that means we have roughly $500 million of annual revenue in the form of starts that we have loaded at RFAB currently.",103

I mean, as baseband becomes smaller, baseband is probably a product line that was more depressed in first quarter. So, therefore, that would tend to maybe mute out some of the normal seasonal lift that we would have going into second quarter. I don't really -- we haven't done kind of a detailed analysis of national seasonality and what impact that would have, but probably the bigger piece would be what we just talked about, which is less baseband, therefore, less or just depressed seasonality or decline in the first quarter, and that impact then on the second quarter transition as well. Keep in mind, a big part of our second quarter seasonality is a significant growth in calculators in that quarter, which typically will add about 3 points of growth to the company level on top of what semiconductors do. And semiconductors historically, including baseband, historically would have been up about 5. So again, historical all-in seasonality for TI just on a 5-year average would be 8% at the company level with about 3 of those points coming from calculators. Do you have a follow on, C.J.?",216

And as we looked at it, we expected it would probably continue to under grow the market for the first year, by the second year probably approaching the market growth rate and then by the third year exceeding market growth similar to the expectations we had with our other Analog businesses. At this point in time, of course, at the design win cycle and the design-in cycle and then how long it takes for those design-ins to actually turn into production revenue, I don't think that we will suggest that you change your expectation from what I just described. That's not to say that we're not being a lot more aggressive internally to try and go off and do better than that. But I'd say it's too early for us right now to go off and change that expectation.",169

We thought there were some considerations that customers would probably be pleased with our acquisition of National.

We're going to turn it into a lot of revenue growth. And we'll let you know probably as it happens more so than trying to project it out too far in advance. Do you have a follow on, Ambrish?",92

Clearly, that market has not recovered. I mean, it was down 40% for the quarter, so we didn't see recovery in the fourth quarter. I think you heard us say even at the mid-quarter update that part of what we had seen was that certain service providers in the North American market had slowed or put a temporary hold on some of their capital spending. So that's not to say there may not be some inventory correction taking place as well, but it was also service providers putting a crimp on capital spending. And again, we saw -- late in the quarter demand is probably too early for us to say with that, those service providers turning on again or was it just the OEM customers that we serviced directly wanting -- coming out of their inventory correction. We don't know that. I think probably our expectation clearly is, as we get into kind of the mid-part of the year, the North American market overall sees recovery. But again, I don't know how to translate what we saw in the few weeks late in December into an overall statement.",202

So it sounds like things are bottoming here and clearly getting a lot better, but the book-to-bill was pretty low at 0.84.

Or can you just talk about that a little bit?",70

Again, we're kind of looking back to our classics signals that we have seen in inventory cycles in the past. And that is a couple quarters of negative book-to-bills and declining of orders, which tend to then bottom out and then be followed by just some fairly nice revenue growth on a sequential basis. So from that standpoint, we've seen in a couple quarters now of negative book-to-bill, a couple of quarters declining orders. That's not to say that the fourth quarter was necessarily the bottom or the first quarter is the bottom. But we believe we're darn close to it whichever direction it's in. And from that standpoint and as evidenced by the demand that we saw in December and going to January, that's lead us to the guidance that we've offered.",145

We came out of downturns into very robust growth. I mean, just go look at second quarter '09 as an example where we came in to that quarter with a pretty weak book-to-bill and obviously had some pretty robust growth. So again, we don't lean too heavily on book-to-bill. I mean, it's a consideration, but it's not the only one. And the other thing I would just ask you to keep in mind that we have 40% of our revenue and our largest customers, our highest volume programs, on consignment where book-to-bill almost by definition in a consignment program runs at 1.0. So again, there we rely more on those companies' -- those customers' forecasted build rate as opposed to what you would see, for example, externally in the order trends or in the book-to-bill. Do you have a follow on, Chris?",170

I think it was 55% gross margin and 30% off margin. And I think you guys pretty much hit that and maybe you've even exceeded it a little bit in -- towards the end of 2010. Now that the baseband is down to about 2% of res and now that you're folding in the -- a higher-margin National business, can we assume that your peak gross margins and peak operating margins and even maybe your OpEx should be higher now?",97

And in fact, as you pointed out, we exceeded that during certain points of the recent past. And right now, we're operating or about to operate below that given what we’re -- our outlook we’ve given for the first quarter. But all that being said, certainly, where we've got a portfolio that continues to get -- to average itself up with the fact that the lower margin business is becoming a smaller and smaller percent. I think it's probably too early for us to predict whether or not our peaks on the next cycle will exceed the peaks in the last cycle. But certainly, we have put together a manufacturing cost model, and we're building a product portfolio model that should allow us to continue to be very reliable when it comes to maintaining that model. I would also remind you that we continue to be very focused on growth, and that is really on our near-term objective as opposed to trying to predict when and by how much we would break out of the model we talked about.",212

Can you talk about how you view the sustainability of the upward [ph] growth we've seen in the OMAP business, which obviously is a reflection of solid design wins you had recently?

And then also in connectivity, the weakness there, how much of that was due to any specific end customer weakness or how much was socket loss?",90

Let's get back part of your question because I think it leads into the other one. Connectivity, the decline that we saw in, let's just say, the year overall for 2011, we believe, reflects almost wholly the success or in some cases lack thereof by our customers in that marketplace. And the reality is our 2 largest connectivity customers probably underperformed the smartphone market in 2011. And we love our customers, but our connectivity revenue is going to reflect the success of our customers. So that would be the consideration. Our share in connectivity has done well and I would say has been reasonably consistent. And I think you take that same thing over to OMAP. OMAP, there's nothing that says the customer cannot change processors even applications processors, even application processors where they might have a pretty significant software investment developed. But our goal is to make sure they have no reason to change. And so to the extent that we continue to develop industry-leading products and I mean that from a performance standpoint, from a power consumption standpoint. And as long as we continue to treat that customer with the respect they deserve as a customer, we think that business is sustainable over the course of time. And whether it's applications processors or embedded processors in general or our deep history in DSPs, that business over time had tended to be relatively sustainable and those customer relationships have tended to be strategic and long lasting. And again, if a supplier gives a customer a reason to change, that customer will change. But we've been fortunate on that front and we intend to continue to operate accordingly. So again, connectivity in OMAP, the reason we're enthusiastic about it is, it’s a great growth opportunity from the standpoint of the outlook for smartphones and we believe our position within the customers where we're engaged is a sustainable one.

Separate question for Kevin. Kevin, how should we think about your priorities for use of cash going forward? Obviously, the buyback rates has come down sharply from what it was last year: a, because the stock probably has gone up; and b, all the cash usage you've used in terms of National Semi. So between dividends and buyback, how should we think about your use of cash for this year?",73

We have, in fact, stepped down the amount of dollars we've allocated towards the buyback. And we indicated we will do that as a consequence of the acquisition of National Semi so that we can begin to allocate certain cash balances, for repaying  the debt when it comes due. Our use of cash remains unchanged from a priority standpoint though. That is, first and foremost, we're directing the cash at the activities that we believe can result in growth. And the most obvious areas where you see that is in R&D, in  capital, as in CapEx, and then followed by acquisitions. And most of those acquisitions once again aside from National are usually quite small acquisitions. To the extent that we have cash then beyond our needs after that, then we do allocate it of course to dividends. You saw us increase the dividend fairly significantly here, almost 30% in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter and we also allocate it to buybacks. So that will be the order of cash use but, first and foremost, is focused on opportunities that we believe push the top line for growth.",197

There's a lot more that we're missing than we have. And so will a competitor pick up a TI historical opportunity here and there? Probably.

A lot of LTE's product is coming through the design cycle now for this year. QUALCOMM's got probably the leading LTE solution. ST-Ericsson is still struggling, who you partnered with often in OMAP and Infineon. When you go down the list, there aren't that many LTE solutions and, in fact, Samsung and Motorola worked on their own, I think, paired with maybe one of your products. Are you feeling -- is there a risk that not having a baseband, especially a 4G baseband, could imperil that business? Is it something that you're working with your partners on? Or do you think it's also going to equalize out in the next year or so and that will be a robust merchant market for LTE and not one dominant supplier?",142

I guess part of that question comes with, if there are limited suppliers of LTE basebands, will they be able to successfully through heavy-handed approaches leverage that into application process or business. And I guess what I would say is I think the customers in the space tend to be pretty powerful and those types of approaches by -- where suppliers try to bundle and leverage and all that kind of stuff tend to be pretty short-term successes with those customers. So I don't think -- we think the momentum clearly is toward integrated applications processors first -- I'm sorry, to discrete applications processors versus integrated and bundled chipset, we put that in the same category. I don't think that's a good long-term success for a supplier in terms of an approach to take. So we'll see, but we don't view that as a significant threat today. Do you have a follow on, Ed?

I would also remind you that the first quarter exceeds this normal paying benefits increases in our manufacturing operation as well as our other support groups and, plus, we've moved from an attrition environment in manufacturing to an increase in staff and environment manufacturing. So those things are going to be adding manufacturing costs from 4Q going into 1Q. To your question as to some algorithm, frankly, we're sitting right now at the utilization level and in the low 50s. Any incremental revenue is going to follow through quite well when you got utilization levels like that. And I think that we'll see our gross margins begin to step back up rather nicely with fairly modest revenue growth. There is a particular algorithm I can offer to you, but I'll just simply say you can pretty much model it through on a delta basis as you have in the past. That is, take your delta revenue assumption quarter-over-quarter and drop that through. I think many people drop that through to 60-odd percent. And that's a pretty good way to get to what you think the gross margins are going to be going forward.",195

It sounds like and I guess first part of my question, correct me if I'm wrong in the assumption that it sounds like it's really trying to put the manufacturing assets in place, at least the variable assets to prevent that from occurring again. And what does that mean kind of going forward as we look through this next cycle? What point do you guys decide to ramp up the manufacturing a little bit more, perhaps put some more inventory in place to avoid what happened during that cycle?",140

Chris, again, just kind of to look back one of the easy metrics to look at and although it is backwards looking, but it's still somewhat instructive is days of inventory. And we were in the mid-70s back as that cycle began to the spring back, this time, we're sitting at about 90, 92 days. So clearly, we've got more available inventory on hand. Also, if you go back and recall the history from back in that point in time, we, like many others, fairly significantly reduced our total workforce leading into that downturn. And so consequently, when demand did snap back, it took some time to bring work force back on and get them trained and get them productive. In this example that we've just gone through, we have not taken that same action. In fact, what we did is we slowed our factories, our idle factories for a few days where it made sense, but we've maintained -- other than attrition, we've maintained that staff on hand so we have a trained workforce already in place. So as demand does snap back, we will have the benefit of a largely already-trained workforce and just having to add incrementally, and we'll have the benefit of starting out with more inventory because there will be more inventory than we had the last time. So you put those together and we think we're a much better position this time to meet strong snapbacks and still be able to deliver in reasonable lead times with our customers and deliver revenue and profit to our shareholders.",264

I guess as a follow on about the OMAP business and you talked about the view of the business going forward with respect to your success in that business. Perhaps, you could talk about what you're feeling is still about the synergies of that business with the Analog business. And I'm sure that you're getting some Analog sockets as a result of having the OMAP business. But I'd also assume that perhaps some of your competitors are more reluctant to put you on reference designs because you're having that business. How do you guys balance that internally?",98
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2012",2012-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3697.0,209586.0,12306698.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,63,"Chris, all of the above are probably the cases where by being in OMAP we'll pull through Power Management products just because this -- we have the insight, first of all so, therefore, we can have the companion Power Management ICs ready to go when we introduce the new OMAP products. In many cases, the customer just finds it easier to use TI. We also have competitors that will use TI as part of their reference design and might they -- the fact that we're a competitor, is that a consideration. I don't really know when they don't have an Analog capability internally but that could be the case. But when it comes down to it, whether we're in OMAP or not, we don't look so much at potential synergies, I would say, between Analog and OMAP. Rather, we look at just the smartphone opportunity is a great growth opportunity. And it aligns well with the capabilities that we have in connectivity, in OMAP and then also in Analog. But we really don't go so much across, well, do we get the pull through of Analog product because we're in OMAP? Some of that may occur, but we sure don't try to rationalize the OMAP business plan based on synergies with Analog is probably the best way to describe it.",220

Thank you for joining our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through to the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for more complete descriptions.
Before we begin, let me remind you that TI will host an Investor Meeting in New York on May 3. At this meeting, our CEO, Rich Templeton, and Kevin March, will provide an update on TI's strategy, market positions and goals. If you have not already registered, please do so as soon as possible. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 11. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. 
Let me start with the market environment. The first quarter's results landed close to our expectations and were consistent with our belief that our business cycle bottomed in the first quarter. Analog revenue was about even. We were especially encouraged by the progress we continue to make with the former National Semiconductor product line, now called Silicon Valley Analog, as it gains traction with customers and holds a strong position in the important industrial market. Early signs point to the industrial market strengthening in the near term as opposed to the delayed recovery that we saw in the last cycle. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew in the quarter, led by strength in automotive and the beginning of a recovery in communications infrastructure. In wireless, revenue fell sharply as we had expected. Baseband revenue declined to less than 3% of our first quarter revenue and we expect it to remain at very low levels throughout the remainder of 2012.
Our Other segment was up as a result of about $65 million of insurance proceeds associated with the Japan earthquake that were received in the last few days of the quarter. The proceeds were part of an ongoing settlement process with the insurance companies and were not included in our earlier guidance due to the uncertainty over their timing.
Core products were 78% of our first quarter revenue, up from 71% a year ago and 66% two years ago. As these products continued to make up a higher proportion of our revenue, our business is becoming more diversified across customers and markets. For example, in 2009, we had a single customer that made up more than 20% of TI revenue. In first quarter '12, it takes the combination of our top 6 customers to exceed 20%. We now have more than 90,000 customers and no single customer comprises more than a mid-single-digit percentage of our revenue.
We believe this expanding diversity is strong evidence that our large sales force and broad customer footprint are paving the way, not only for TI share gains, but also for results that will be determined more so by our own execution in the years ahead and not swung by the fortunes of a particular customer or a narrow market segment.
Consistent with our view that the first quarter was the bottom of our business cycle, we believe growth will resume in the second quarter. In fact, at middle of our guidance range, sequential growth would hit 10% when compared with the first quarter's results without the insurance proceeds. Supporting this forecast was order growth in the quarter of 13%, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 and our first quarterly expansion in backlog since the second quarter of 2011.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 0.84. We saw a broad-based order growth across the geographical regions and many of our end markets. We believe TI is very well-positioned as our markets rebound in the quarters ahead. Our product portfolio is strong and our design position with customers is excellent. Our acquisition of National Semiconductor should contribute revenue and share gains as customers across the world embrace the strength of this portfolio, combined with the attraction of TI's market channels and our customer-oriented business approach.
As you know, we have been anticipating this upturn, and as a result, we have our inventory well-staged and production in our factories ramping. Our manufacturing capacity is strong, and our teams are poised to drive growth and capture share gains as the market strengthens.
So let's walk through the specifics of the first quarter. Revenue of $3.12 billion declined 8% from a year ago and 9% sequentially, mostly due to lower wireless revenue. Analog revenue was up 10% from a year ago and was about even with the fourth quarter. Growth from the year-ago quarter was due to our acquisition of National, and therefore, the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue. Sequentially, SVA revenue grew, HPA was about even sequentially, as was power. HVAL was lower due to declines in a number of markets, including consumer, which was seasonally slower, and handsets.
Embedded Processing revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 7% sequentially. From a year ago, automotive grew, while communications infrastructure and catalog products declined. Sequentially, we saw strong growth in automotive, as well as double-digit gains in communications infrastructure revenue. Revenue from catalog products was about even sequentially. As a reminder, communications infrastructure was exceptionally weak for us in the fourth quarter, so it is encouraging to see this revenue begin to recover.
In wireless, revenue declined to $373 million in the first quarter or 12% of TI's total revenue, down from 19% a year ago. As we had expected, baseband revenues declined sharply to $87 million. This revenue was down $247 million from a year ago and down $192 million sequentially. Revenue from OMAP applications processors was up strongly from a year ago but declined from the fourth quarter level, when we benefited from several customer product introductions ahead of the holidays. Connectivity revenues declined in both comparisons.
Strategically, our plan for both applications processors and for connectivity products is to significantly broaden our market reach in areas outside of smartphones and tablets. We have the right products for many of these applications and the customer relationships in place to engage. Although it will take time to significantly diversify this revenue mix, we have begun to shift our investments accordingly and are already well-positioned with some key customer programs.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 5% sequentially. The decline from year ago was driven by lower DLP revenue, as well as the end of our transitional supply agreement, most notably our agreement with Spansion that expired at the end of 2011. Sequentially, weakness in these same areas was more than offset by the insurance proceeds and higher custom ASIC revenue.
In distribution, resales were about even sequentially. Distribution inventory remained at about 6.5 weeks, about the same level as we ended the fourth quarter.
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",1215
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2012",2012-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3683.0,287153.0,14123804.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter. Total acquisition-related charges in the quarter were $174 million. These charges relate to our acquisition of National Semiconductor and include $21 million in cost of revenue, with the remaining $153 million all on the income statement line identified as acquisition charges. The charges included in cost of revenue were associated with the termination of a National Semiconductor distributor contract. After this quarter, the acquisition-related impact to cost of revenue will be minimal and we do not expect to call those expenses out. All remaining charges should be specifically included on the acquisition charges line.
Also in the quarter, we had $10 million of restructuring charges associated with closing 2 factory sites that we announced in January. In total, these charges impacted EPS by $0.10. Gross profit of $1.53 billion was 49% of revenue and declined 1% sequentially. There were a couple of items that impacted gross profit and gross margin in the first quarter. First, the underutilization expense in the quarter was essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. Although we increased our wafer starts in the first quarter, wafer output declined compared with the fourth quarter as the effect of our lower production starts in the fourth quarter worked its way through our manufacturing operations. The net result is that average utilization levels of our manufacturing operations, and therefore, the associated underutilization expense, were essentially unchanged in the quarter.
Of course, the underutilization expense should start to decline in the second quarter, as the effect of our higher production starts in the first quarter works its way to our manufacturing operations. Also, as I discussed earlier, we incurred $21 million of acquisition-related charges in cost of revenue in the first quarter. This negatively impacted gross margin by about 70 basis points.
Finally, gross profit and margin benefited from the insurance proceeds. Because this insurance was largely for business interruption, it moved all the way through the income statement, starting with revenue. So if you're analyzing the effect these proceeds had on gross margin, be sure to adjust both revenue, as well as gross profit. You should calculate about 100 basis points of gross margin benefit from these proceeds.
On a segment basis, while we don't normally discuss gross margin at this level, it is important to recall that our transition services agreement with Spansion, which was previously reported in our Other segment, ended in the fourth quarter. As a result, the portion of the Aizu factory that was used to support Spansion is now available for analog products and this underutilized cost is now recorded in the analog segment. Operating expenses of $971 million were above, as we had expected, and the increase in the last quarter is mostly the result of seasonal increases associated with the timing of the holidays and employee vacation time in the fourth quarter, as well as annual pay and benefit increases that occurred in February.
Other income and expense was lower in the quarter, as we took charges associated with the discontinued business. Net income in the first quarter was $265 million or $0.22 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to letting unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the first quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $4 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we've reported.
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $449 million, down $67 million from a year ago and down $521 million from the prior quarter. As a reminder, cash consumption is typically higher in the first quarter as we pay accrued annual profit-sharing and performance bonuses. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter, down $91 million from a year ago and down $49 million from the prior quarter. In fact, this is our lowest quarterly level of capital spending in almost 3 years, as we benefit from having pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.
We repaid $300 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the remaining balance of this obligation down to $700 million. We also used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.1 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $195 million. We increased our inventory by $65 million in the quarter, bringing inventory days to 105 as we prepare for higher shipments in the quarters ahead. Orders of $3.24 billion in the quarter increased $380 million or 13% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.22 billion to $3.48 billion in the second quarter, for growth about 3% to 12% sequentially. If you eliminate the first quarter's insurance proceeds from the comparison, growth is expected to be 5% to 14% or about 10% at the middle of our range. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.38. We expect the second quarter's results will be negatively affected by about $100 million in acquisition charges and about $10 million in restructuring charges. Combined, these items will impact EPS by about $0.06. For 2012, our estimates for R&D, capital expenditures, depreciation and our annual effective tax rates are unchanged from what was provided to you last quarter.
In summary, our markets have bottomed and are in the early stages of recovery. As we talked about this last quarter, we anticipated this and are well-positioned to service our customers' rising demand as they end their inventory correction and ultimately, begin to replenish their inventory from current low levels. We're looking forward to a year of growth.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",1007

If I could start in the other wireless category. Obviously, one of the sort of back-and-forths over the years has been what will happen to connectivity as the baseband business kind of falls off. Obviously, baseband we all knew about, Other was a little weaker this quarter, too. Is there any way to say how much of that was just the market or is the customer exposure being a little bit softer versus any impact from kind of the basebands pulling the connectivity along with it?",93

I guess I could say there's an indirect tie in that we sell connectivity products to some of the same customers where we sell baseband, to the extent that those customers' business is not particularly strong as you see both on the baseband line, as well as would show up on some of the connectivity demand products -- demand for some of our connectivity products also. But then, we also have, separately, customers that use connectivity products that do not use our baseband products. And in some of those cases, we've also seen declines as well, totally independent in that case of the baseband.",124

I'm also wondering, from that margin standpoint, does it actually make sense to be in this business at all?

As far as the margins are concerned, we've talked about in the past that the margins in that non-baseband portion, certainly not as rich as what you would see over in analog or even in better processing space, but still quite attractive. The real focus in that area at this point is that clearly, we're spending enough to be able to develop the products that we need. What that team is heavily focused on now is driving the revenue growth and taking it beyond just as single source, Ron, mentioned in his opening remarks, where the diversity of our customers is such that we would expect less impact to the company on single markets or single large customers, and wireless following through on a similar strategy, where they are trying to deliver the technology from their non-baseband products into adjacent markets that can give us more diversity, both of markets and customers. And those will include spaces such as automotive and certain other applications that they've gained some interest and traction on here recently. So the focus there is really now on driving the top line. There's certainly enough spending already in place to be able to meet the R&D requirements.",222

So you asked what level of revenue does it take. That's the recent data point as Kevin said, those core products were profitable at the operating margin level last quarter. So we're nipping on profitability, we just need revenue that will be sustained. And certainly, what we're doing in these embedded areas, by no means do we consider that capitulation, but actually a means by which we can further enhance revenue on what should be a -- basically leverage the investment we've already made for smartphones and tablets and be able to go reach into some of these other market segments as well.",121

So how does long does it take to actually ramp meaningful revenues in those other kind of markets? What's the sort of, I guess, design in lifetime?

I think the core question was how long does it take to drive meaningful revenue in these other areas. And I guess what I would say is, it will take a while. This is not something that, in some of these other areas, where the product lives can be very long. The design in aspect of them tends to be a little longer than some of the high-volume verticals is as well. So we don't expect -- this is not a strategy to go address things over the next 1 to 2 quarters. This is something that we build on what we have today. And over time, we will increase the diversity, and therefore, the stability of that revenue mix. I don't think -- Kevin, you can comment, but I think we believe the investment level that we have today will take us into these new spaces. This is not a big incremental investment to be able to go drive these products into new areas. I mean, think about the biggest infrastructure investment is the sales force, which is already in place today. And by the way, that's the biggest competitive advantage we likely have as well. I mean, clearly, we have to have the right products. Once you have the right products, you have to be able to have the right reach into the customer base and that's the sales force that's in place today. But it's not a big incremental R&D spend to go somehow develop new products or different products for these other adjacent markets.",267

And so that is clearly -- that's allocated into the analog segment and clearly is a drag. But in addition, flat revenues in analog, like some of the other businesses also had seasonally higher paying benefit increases that began in February. So you had the GPM drag that I just mentioned as a result of the utilization, but you also have higher OpEx. So as that revenue builds there, I think it will be able to absorb that just fine over the next couple of quarters, John.",110

And as you noted, John, bringing on board National, where 70%, I believe, of their revenue moved to distribution. Very similar to our catalog analog areas, such as HPA and to a large part, the Power, and a lot of the catalog Embedded Processing businesses. So much of that goes through distribution -- I'm sorry, over 45%. Of that 45%, about 1/3 of that revenue is supported by consignment programs. So I mean 1/3 of the distribution revenue is supported by consignment. I should note, at this point, none of the SVA business through distribution is on confinement because we needed to get IP systems in place to be able to support that. However, that is in fact something that we will do and that we're working toward to put in place. And again, for the broader audience, when you have a distribution program on consignment, our revenue recognition approach sell-in tends to look more like sell-out because it moves the revenue recognition closer to where the distributors pull the product from the hub and actually ship it to their customers. And then if you look more broadly, about 40% of TI's total revenue, and this includes distribution as well as our direct OEM customers, are on consignment. So I hope I got all the pieces you'd asked there, John.",236

And so you wind up with, frankly, an anomaly like you're describing, where the days of inventory compute higher than what you'd normally expect to see. But when we look at the mix of inventory, we are extremely comfortable with it and it's lined up quite well with generally the demand that we see. I recall that we talked about our book to bill went positive in the fourth quarter, our orders increased by 13%. That gave us better visibility into actual end demand than we've had in several quarters now, and that gave us the ability to build and stage inventory in anticipation of when that demand needs to be delivered. So I would say that the inventory is positioned quite nicely for what we're trying to do for the second quarter.",184

And the other thing I would say is just even over the weekend, reviewing some other transcripts of conference calls that have taken place, I mean you're already hearing at this very early stage in the upturn, where certain players are finding their own inventory too short or out of mix and having difficulty meeting up with or fully meeting customer demand. We are delighted with our inventory position at this stage in the upturn. So we think it's going to be great. Of course, it will play out as the market grows here over the next few quarters.",134

So we've got a number of companies last week talk about issues with wafer availability from foundry and there's some talk that lead times might stretch out over the summer. Can you comment on how your availability is for foundry wafers? And then also, your own lead times, are they stretching out? Do you anticipate that, that could happen over the summer?",82

Right now, again, one of the things that we have as a takeaway on the last inventory correction cycle was the fact that we probably entered that growth period with less inventory than what was necessary to meet, that would turn out to be quite as strong pullback or snapback in customer demand. So we're coming into this quarter certainly with more inventory availability than we had a couple of years ago, when the last upturn occurred. So with that in mind, we have most of our lead times are quite normal at 8 weeks or less and we have higher levels of inventory than we did during the last industry cycle upturn. Plus, we have considerably more capacity than we had last time. Those combined, lead us to feel that we are going to be well-positioned to be able to meet customer demand even on pretty strong growth basis. As far as wafer foundry availability is concerned, again, a declining portion of our revenue is actually sourced from foundries, especially as you consider the baseband is winding down quite a bit, because that was largely sourced from foundries. But non-baseband portion of wireless also sources lots of foundries. But clearly, with the volumes that they're at right now, we are not experiencing any availability issues.",224

I mean, even if you look at recent [indiscernible] boards, et cetera, total industry utilization is actually at a pretty high level. And you've seen a lot of semiconductor companies over the past few years not need to, and therefore, they did not invest in new capacity. So whether it's the foundries or whether it's the IDM's own capacity, our suspicion is that if we get into much of an uplift at all in terms of demand, we very likely, as an industry, will see shortages and lead times accordingly stretch out. So, at the same time, like Kevin said and what I said before, having a very good inventory position coming into this upturn, plus having a lot of open capacity, we think, is going to serve us very well.",154

I made probably the most substantial comments already just in terms of our view of what was helping. But clearly, automotive is an area of strength. It's one of the few areas where year-on-year, as I noted, we had growth and that probably partly had to do with some of the automotive industries overall. Globally, we're impacted by supply-chain issues early last year from the Japan quake and tsunami. And so there's a very good recovery. Maybe even some pent-up consumer demand on top of a trend for increasing electronics content and semiconductor growth. Wireless infrastructure, our view is the excess inventory that had tended to build in that channel has essentially been eliminated. We're seeing stronger demand now and we expect that we'll continue to grow from here. Again, we ended up better than fourth quarter but well below both the year ago, as well as even the third quarter revenue levels. In that market, you've heard us talk about before, as consumers with their smartphones and tablets, demand more mobile data. There are just some really positive trends that are taking place there in terms of carriers need to deploy more capacity. And even the type of capacity they're deploying, historically it's been macro cells with -- in both mostly, WCDMA but even to some degree, some LTE. Going forward, you will see more and more of that shift to a small cell type of structure, where our percent of that content, just small cell almost by its very definition, is going to require System-on-a-Chip implementation and we have a great position both in terms of the scalability from what we've done with the same equipment manufacturers from the macro cell and then trying to scale down into the small cell but also just even expanding our position from there. So just a really strong trend, secular trend, overall in wireless infrastructure that we think will play to our advantage, literally, in the years ahead. Handsets, less and less of a direct tie there for TI in terms of the size of that business. But absolutely, we think smartphone market 2012 is healthy. Growth probably in the 25% range for smartphones this year compared with last year. Just some good healthy trends there. Industrial, I think from an end-demand standpoint, probably not a lot of change. But again, I think what we're encouraged about is whereas in that upturn in 2009, we had a lot of the verticals that were lifting in the second quarter, but literally, it wasn't until fourth quarter, if I remember right, before we started seeing industrial really start to recover. We're already seeing industrial markets recover. So again, a lot of it may not be end demand driven, it may just be the fact that they are no longer reducing their semiconductor inventory that's creating the lift on TI. But again, it's healthy for us. Consumer, I think I noted that we had seasonal weakness there and that was in several different consumer areas. I think we had to get out of the first quarter and into what would be a seasonally stronger quarters ahead to really know what's going on in that space. And then probably the last one I would comment on is on computing. We noted earlier that HDD was in recovery mode. We see that continuing into second quarter '12, such that whatever bottleneck HDD has played in terms of the supply side of the PC market, we think, will essentially be lifted. And then, at that point, we'll understand better what PC end demand really looks like.",605

So again, where ever since, I would say, third quarter of last year through probably first quarter of this year, where we had been undershipping our customers, now that they have their inventory position where they need it, they will start ordering again consistent with their own production rates or their end demand, and that will create a pretty significant lift for us based on our views of how far below that end demand we have been shipping. So, of course, that's going to be broader than just Texas Instruments. But I think we've been busy through the course of the last few quarters, and especially with the National product line, very aggressively working design in position, such that when the market began to lift again, we would disproportionately benefit. And then I think you've also heard us talk about that on the capacity side, we think we will be competitively advantaged, as well as when these markets go back into growth mode.",229

And then how we should think about the walk back towards the mid-50s gross margins model that you had established before?",70

But directionally, we would expect our gross margins to be up. I would suggest that maybe when you folks put the models together, maybe they're not quite estimating some lines correctly when they look into the future. One of the things I would point out is that our OpEx will probably be up another 1 or 2 points in the second quarter. And that's just simple math rolling out. In other words, our benefits increase occurred in February of the first quarter. And so the second quarter we'll see a full quarter's effect of that, and that may be where people are having a little trouble on their gross margin analysis. To as far as our overall gross margin model, I would just perhaps remind you that our focus is on revenue growth, and frankly, it's on revenue growth to grow faster than markets and earnings to grow faster than revenues so we can continue to make healthy cash returns to our shareholders as we have been in the form of dividends and buybacks over the last few years. We're not projecting actual margins greater than 55 and 30 and we're also not concluding this from happening as margins are going to be dependent upon product mix and utilization as you pointed out. I think as you heard from Ron, 78% of our revenue now is from our core products and clearly, analog is now more than 1/2 of our revenue, and that's very encouraging from a product mix standpoint. So I think as we watch that mix continue to shift, we're going to like the results, not just on gross margins and operating margin but importantly, on bottom line cash and what we can do with that for shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.",310

Because when we look in the market, and I think all of these questions have been asked before but when we look in the market, we do see, at the high-end, Apple and Samsung really taking a lot of the high-end business and then at the low end, there's just substantially more competition coming online. So how do you get the comfort that this is a business that you should be investing in over the long term? And even if you take it into some of these embedded markets, would these really add value or will they be lower ASP, lower margin-type market?",131

One I can just throw out because I'm thinking about it, a release that happened, I want to say, about a month ago, with iRobot, using OMAP for robotic imaging applications. And that's just an example, but in some cases, customers are amenable to having their names discussed. In other cases, they want to -- they'd rather be a little more discreet until they get their products in the market. I think also, we've announced customers in the automotive infotainment space using, again, OMAP. But, Vivek, I would also say this a case where I think our management team has a pretty strong track record of if a business or an operation, the outlook is not what we think it needs to be, you've seen us not be shy about adjusting our strategy accordingly. And so, this is one way, hopefully, we can get some credit just based on a very long solid track record of making those appropriate strategic moves and it will be management driving that change from inside of the company as opposed to, frankly, convincing Wall Street and getting Wall Street to nod or shake its head on where we're headed.

I mean, [indiscernible] has described that market as additive as opposed to cannibalizing macro-based patients. It sounds like you think the opposite. So let me just understand how that plays between your current quarter and your guide and your competitive positioning?",118

I mean, think what you're going to see is that it's kind of the next wave of technology, I might say, in terms of base stations and we will see a significant part of this spend move to small cell, we believe, as the carriers are doing their best to keep up with just the consumers' data capacity needs. And small cell is one of the most cost-effective means that they can do that because basically, they can deploy these cells with minimal installation costs and even considerations like their electricity usage are much more straightforward than continued deployment of macro level base stations. So I think we're going to see both but we think over time, and this is looking forward, Uche, more so than anything that happened in the first quarter, over time, we're going to see it represent a much more significant piece of the dollar content. In terms of position, a lot of people -- I mean, obviously it's an attractive market, everybody wants to claim success. I guess all I would say is we have a very strong position in macro and we expect that our position in small cell will meet or exceed what we have in terms of macro. So just in terms of where there were known programs that were put out for bid, I shouldn't say that way. Of the total available programs, various carriers, et cetera, not all of which are determined at this point, we've already had design positions in more than, what I would call, half of the small cell opportunity. And those are a number of programs, the market share position actually is higher than that because some of these players are more important than others. So again, we're off to a great start. This is a system-on-a-chip technology, it's going to -- you may see the very first generation be somewhat, what I would call, not integrated. But this is about cost power, a lot of things that because of the form factor, will very, very quickly drive full-up system-on-a-chip implementations. And we're going to be very well-positioned there. So I'll just say we've got great design position, our content, these systems, is going to be very high and we think the market outlook there is really good and it's just going to be one where, again, kind of like what we were saying in previous Q&A, the results will show when the results show. We've got great position but to the extent others claim they have a really great position and create confusion there, we may just have to wait until that translates to revenue and profit growth for TI.",456

I know you describe the environment as where destocking has stopped but we've seen the orders go up a lot. Do you think the environment, at this point, is enough for us to feel comfortable with basically where these key lead indicators out of Europe and China are still not essentially clear. I mean, the U.S. is strong. That's fantastic, but to what extent do we need all these order markets to show enough for us to feel comfortable that the orders that we're seeing is going to be sustained?",154

You were breaking up a bit on your question there, but I'm going to assume that's what it was. So let me take it from there. As Ron mentioned, what we believe we're seeing is not so much the customers are restocking per se, as that they've stopped reducing their inventories. And so even if they just hold their inventories at lower levels, that's going to result in higher orders for us because they've depleted the pipeline in their prior shipments. From an overall standpoint, we do expect to grow in 2012, which means that we're anticipating the economy is going to do okay to support that. And that's a reference to the global economy. There will probably be some stronger pockets than others. One could reasonably expect the Americas were probably stronger than Europe. One could also look at Asia, China in particular, and say that it may -- they may have purportedly slower growth rate than recent, but it's still growing at an extremely fast rate compared to the Western economies. And that rates against a very large economy itself. It's already the second largest economy in the world. So when we put it all together, I'd say right now, we're not seeing or we can't necessarily prove a point to any evidence of customers restocking. What it appears to us is more like at this stage, customers have stopped draining and are now at least holding their inventories and we'll have to make a few weeks or a few months, perhaps, to report to see if we actually see evidence of restocking.",273

What I'm trying to figure out is how much of that utilization dropped from wherever that peak was due to adding the supply versus the revenues coming down? Or said differently, what revenue do you need to get back to, to have the same amount of utilization-driven goodness with your current manufacturing footprint versus where you were prior?",115

I don't think we gave -- excuse me, fourth quarter. We haven't discussed what this quarter is just yet other than to say that we have increased our starts in the factories and it takes a while for those starts to become outs. And so our average utilization is about even. But the starts-based utilization actually increased in the quarter. It is worth noting, as you pointed out, the incremental capacity we put in place. Clearly, over the last couple of years, between the factories we acquired and the acquisition of National Semiconductor, we have added $7 billion worth of incremental revenue generating capacity. And so all things being equal, by definition, we've got a lower utilization than we would be at the same revenue levels in the past. And that alone, of course, will cause a larger utilization charge as I think is what you were alluding to. But we clearly have room to increase our revenues substantially with that capacity we've brought on board. And I think the simplest way to think about it is, all-in, it's about $7 billion of incremental revenue generating capacity. From there, I'll leave it to you to kind of model where you think that takes us but frankly, I'm pretty optimistic that's going to not only be attractive from letting us grow revenue rapidly as the markets come back but also do so at very attractive margins given the cost of that capacity when we acquired it.",281

Because remember in fourth quarter, we had some distribution channel changes where we discontinued one of their major distributors. We added TI distributors. So I would say first quarter, the compare is relatively easy against fourth quarter. So I don't know that I want to draw a lot of real strong conclusions about this market or that market as opposed to just saying at this point, we would say it was an easy compare and put the challenge in front of that team to let's see if they can do it again.

In fact, you'll see us on the spending, actually spend it closer to when we actually bring the equipment in, with the front end of wafer fab capacity required over the last couple of years, a larger portion of our CapEx is aimed at the assembly test sites. And generally speaking, the lead times on that type of equipment is shorter, and so we can order it and install it closer to when we actually have the revenue need for it. So as a result of that, we still are holding to our prior estimate of a $700 million CapEx for the year. I would just remind you, if you take a look at our actual CapEx spend over the last 12 months, it's been a little over 5% of our total revenue and that's translated into a little less than 7% depreciation total revenue over the last 12 months. So clearly, the spend that we did the last few years bringing on the wafer fabs that we did has been at very little cost to us from a fixed standpoint and is allowing us to actually operate at much lower CapEx levels than we had in the past. We've previously indicated that we would be a 5% to 8% of revenue kind of CapEx model given the wafer fabs that we bought over the last couple of years. Over the next foreseeable future, we'd probably run up the lower end of that range, closer to 5% than 8%.",263

Thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 11. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
Let me start with the market environment. Revenue in the second quarter landed in the middle of our guidance range, with sequential growth of 7%. Orders grew and backlog expanded, although at a slower pace overall than in the first quarter. Also, there was a clear downshift in our order momentum in the month of June. 
Even though we believe inventory of TI products is low at our OEM customers and distributors, both are reluctant to place new orders and commit to backlog given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment. This, combined with lead times that are largely below 6 weeks, has resulted in our window of backlog coverage narrowing. 
Although backlog for July and August has filled in consistent with a typical third quarter, at this point, our visibility is somewhat reduced for the month of September. This could reflect a range of reasons and potential outcomes. On the one hand, customers could be anticipating their own businesses to slow. On the other hand, customers may simply be waiting until the last minute to place orders, given short lead times. Regardless, as a result of this increased uncertainty, we are being more cautious ourselves in planning for the third quarter and are currently expecting a below-seasonal quarter, with revenue at the middle of our guidance range projected to be about even with the second quarter.  If customer demand builds as the quarter progresses, we are well positioned with short lead times, strong inventory and available manufacturing capacity to support a higher level of shipments.
Let me now walk through the second quarter's results. Revenue of $3.34 billion declined 4% from a year ago and grew 7% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 13% from a year ago and was up 7% sequentially. The growth from a year ago was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor and, therefore, the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue in the second quarter that wasn't included a year ago. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in Power Management. 
Embedded Processing revenue declined 15% from a year ago, with both communications infrastructure and catalog products down. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 8%, primarily driven by strong growth in communications infrastructure.
Wireless revenue declined 39% from a year ago, primarily due to lower baseband revenue. Sequentially, Wireless revenue declined 8% due to lower OMAP revenue. Baseband revenue ticked up a few million dollars to $90 million in the quarter, although we expect it to step down to about $50 million in the third quarter as we continue to wind down this product line.
Our other segment revenue declined 4% from a year ago and grew 16% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue declined due to the expiration of our transitional supply agreements from previously acquired factories in Japan and China. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by higher demand for DLP products as well as the seasonal increase in calculators.
In distribution, resales sequential growth of 7% matched the pace of TI's overall revenue growth. Distributors reduced inventory levels by a day and are holding a little less than 6.5 weeks of inventory. Most are waiting until there are clear signs of higher-end demand before they are willing to carry more. 
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",687

As I've done in the past couple of quarters, let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the second quarter were $104 million. In the prior quarter, total acquisition-related charges were $174 million, consisting of $153 million in acquisition charges and $21 million in cost of revenue.  In addition, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million in the second quarter compared with $10 million in the first quarter. 
In total, the EPS impact of these charges was $0.06 in the second quarter compared with $0.10 in the first quarter. Gross profit of $1.65 billion was 49.5% of revenue, and increased 8% sequentially. Recall that in the first quarter, we benefited from about $65 million of insurance proceeds that helped gross profit and gross margin. 
Operating expenses of $936 million declined about 4% from the first quarter. At 28% of revenue, operating expenses have moved back into the 20% to 30% range that we target over the course of the cycle.
Our second quarter results included a cumulative adjustment for a revision in our annual tax rate as well as a $10 million discrete tax benefit. 
Net income in the first quarter was $446 million or $0.38 per share on a GAAP basis before charges. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the second quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $8 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported.
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $675 million, up $226 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter, up $43 million from the prior quarter. I should note that year-to-date, capital spending has been about 4% of revenue as we benefit from having pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.
We used cash to repay an additional $200 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the remaining balance of this obligation down to $500 million. We also retired $375 million of maturing debt that we assumed in the acquisition of National Semiconductor. We used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.6 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $195 million. 
We increased our inventory by $32 million in the quarter, although inventory days declined to 101. Orders of $3.41 billion in the quarter increased $174 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.21 billion to $3.47 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would be about even with the second quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.42. We expect the third quarter EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.07 of acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%.
For the year, our estimate for R&D expense has been reduced to $1.9 billion from our previous estimate of $2 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures is unchanged at $700 million, and our estimate for depreciation is also unchanged at $1 billion. Our estimated effective tax rate has been reduced to 26%, down from our prior estimate of 28%.
In summary, although our financial results for the second quarter were consistent with our expectations, our visibility into the third quarter's demand has been reduced. We remain focused on strengthening our long-term position in Analog and Embedded Processing, while also staying responsive to the twists and turns of near-term demand. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",663

I think implicitly, we don't normally forecast that. But implicitly, with the revenue guidance being flat and inventory being at desired levels, about 101 days right now, I don't expect our utilization level to be going up at this stage, and in fact, it might even decline a little bit as we go into the quarter. As to the second question on the cost benefit of shutting down strategic capacity, you may recall that back in January, we did announce the closure of 2 older factories that from a cost benefit standpoint, the economics of upgrading or trying to improve those factories to compete with some of the newer factories we brought online just didn't pay. So the decision was to go ahead and wind the operations at those factories down. That's one factory in Houston which we expect to close by the middle of next year and another factory in Hiji, Japan, which we expect to close by the end of next year.",176

Stacy, I think what we're -- when you build your models and make the adjustments for various things we were just talking with Ron about, I think, let's say [ph] that gross margins are probably going to be a little bit better. We'll have a bit of a better mix, we would expect, in 3Q. Recall the seasonality of our calculator business, for example. Third quarter tends to be the strongest quarter. That has fairly good margins. As Ron mentioned, we'll see the baseband drop to probably about $50 million, coming off of $90 million last quarter. And so the remaining revenue that will fill in that gap has slightly higher margins. So between those things, I think you will see the margins probably up a little bit quarter-over-quarter.",130

And for my follow-up, so you mentioned, I guess, limited visibility in September in regard to your customers. What kind of September outlook do you actually have baked in right now to your flat guidance, and where could this go if you would had a normal September, as we seem to have like a normal July and August orders right now?",65
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2012",2012-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3671.0,328970.0,15906633.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,16,"Well, Stacy, normal seasonality for us in the third quarter is to be up on average, seasonality is to be up 6% quarter-over-quarter. So one could say that if, in fact, September fills out in a more normal fashion, we might see growth rates approaching that sort of number. But as Ron mentioned, and as we've been talking about in the press release, given the profile of the backlog that our customers have scheduled on us, we clearly have less demand scheduled in September right now than we would normally have at this stage in the quarter, and that's caused us to be cautious on our guidance, because we're -- it's really not apparent to us why that is the case. Again, is it because customers fear their end demand? Or in fact, did they just got increased confidence that if their demand goes up, we have added with inventory that we could with [ph] short lead times.",158

In terms of July, the rate of new orders in July, really, Sumit, is consistent with what we saw in the month of June. So we haven't really seen a pickup, but we also haven't seen a further slowdown. So our guidance does comprehend those order trends.",66

So that was consistent. And their inventory dropped about a day. So they continue to that [ph] hold very lean levels of inventory, which suggest to us that similar to our OEM customers, they're holding only as much inventory as they feel they need to have for a relatively short windows of time, 6.5 weeks, as I mentioned. So it goes back to what Ron was saying earlier, our customers across the board seemed to be carrying very lean inventories, expecting us to be able to meet very short lead times, which we presently have available. And so we should have better insight as to what their final demand will be in the third quarter when we get to the mid-quarter update.",157

This is a revenue-dependent business that we talked about for a while. There's a large R&D built going on inside that segment as they develop new products for the end markets they're aiming at, and it really has been one that requires more revenue than it obviously has today to absorb that much R&D. It has clearly got our attention, something we're looking closely into. As it relates to a breakeven number, I would just remind you that back in fourth quarter that revenues at that segment turned in -- was actually above breakeven at that point in time, if you adjust it for baseband. So that's probably your best reference point. I won't try to forecast going forward. As you probably well know from our conversations here in the recent past, we're looking at the opportunities for that business to expand product offerings into the embedded processing space, and that, clearly, will have a different profile of needs as we get all that timing worked out.",188

But as Kevin mentioned, clearly there's a seasonal trend where our calculator business tends to grow third quarter compared to second quarter.

You'll recall, in those quarters, we were talking about that we had made some distributor changes. I think in fourth quarter, we had eliminated one of their traditional distributors and then brought on -- brought them onto additional distributors that had previously supported TI in the first quarter, which resulted in some just inventory adjustments in the channel. So think about first quarter for SVA benefited from some channel fill with inventory, and therefore, the comparison is just a little more complex or unfavorable than going into second quarter. So really that's the only difference. If you look from a resale perspective, SVA resales were very consistent with what you saw or what we described for the rest of TI. So again, it's just more noise associated with the changes fourth quarter and first quarter with respect to distributors. And, Kevin, was there an additional part of the question that...",171

Could you elaborate a little bit on that comment now, the way you see things now? And is there any market at all that could potentially be up sequentially in the September quarter?",55
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2012",2012-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3671.0,328970.0,15906655.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,38,"Sure, I can talk about the comms infrastructure. I think automotive, we ended up just from a sequential standpoint with second quarter being down slightly, so that shifted a little bit during the month of June from our prior expectations. But comms infrastructure had very strong sequential growth in the second quarter.  And it's really more of what we've described previously, which is in the North America market, there is a very aggressive build continuing to take place as carriers just try to stay up with consumer demand for data. And so with everybody having smartphones and tablets consuming lots of data, the carrier's under a lot of pressure just to be able to stay up with that demand. Given the strength of our position across almost all of the equipment manufacturers, we're a prime beneficiary of that. So again, it's -- you can say that LTE is starting to come into play a little bit, but really, this is mostly being driven by 3G, really, WCDMA builds here in the North America market. We see that trend on a secular basis continuing going forward, although once we get really towards the end of this year, you'll see more of the carriers' spends start to shift to small cell. Macro doesn't go away, of course, because those base stations are still required. But on the other hand, a bigger part of the carrier spending will likely begin to shift towards small cell, where we have an extremely strong position with our system-on-a-chip, and we look forward to that. But again, that will start here in the North America market. I think it's already begun in some markets like Korea. It will start here in North America late this year, and really, we think we'll ramp nicely from there. So again, a good secular trend for us there ongoing. I think in the automotive space, the only thing I would say is I think that, that market, as you might expect, with economic uncertainty, consumers expressing more concern on where they spend their money, especially on large purchases like automotive, we're starting to see some of that, as well as, I assume, other players will as well. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?",372

July in terms of new orders coming in really is about the same level that we saw in June, so it hasn't picked up, nor has it slowed down. What I did say is that our backlog coverage, meaning orders that are scheduled to ship in the month of July, looks pretty typical. But in terms of new orders, they fell from May to June, and July is running at about the same, just call it daily run rate that we felt for the month of June overall. So not a change one direction or the other. But again, it's a combination of what we saw in the month of June as well as what we've seen month to date in July that has led us to give the sub-seasonal guidance that we provided. Do you have a follow-on, Glenn?",154

I mean, there were some markets that shifted maybe a bit more than others. I don't know so much from an order standpoint. Maybe this is a little different twist on your question, but from a revenue standpoint, probably -- let me just kind of walk through the regional results. The North American market, from a sequential growth standpoint, was strongest, followed by Asia, followed by Japan, and then Europe actually was the only region that was down a little bit. At mid-quarter update, I believe I described that at that point, we were expecting some growth out of Europe. So at least from a revenue standpoint, there was a little bit more of a downshift in Europe. Probably no real surprise there. I don't know, Kevin, is there anything that jumps to your mind from a product-line standpoint or from an end-market standpoint? I would describe it as more broad-based, Glenn, as opposed to any particular area of weakness that was pronounced.",169

If you look across the whole quarter, you could probably say most of the end markets were up a bit. Auto and TV were down a bit, as Ron mentioned earlier.

Yes. But we do not disclose specifically what our utilization is. I think Kevin said our utilization overall was up slightly second quarter to -- compared with first quarter. Similarly, the utilization -- the underutilization charges were, therefore, down a little bit. But frankly, as we got into the month of June and saw orders fall off, we changed our loadings, we pulled back on our loadings. And as a result, the underutilization expense did not fall quite as much as we had expected, which you see in the gross margin, which, frankly, was not quite as strong as we had expected in the quarter as well.",115

In the fourth quarter of last year, you had a big high-profile tablet win that helped OMAP business, and I have that business down -- x baseband, I had Wireless down a couple of hundred million from -- in the last couple of quarters. I may be wrong on those numbers.  But do you have the types of OMAP opportunities in the next 2, 3 quarters that can get you back to that level? Or is this more of a kind of waiting for the embedded business to fill in those gaps to get back to that level?",109

I mean, clearly, in the tablet space, we have other customer wins that you can assume will be ramping into production using new products, new OMAP products from TI before the end of the year. And just where those go in terms of actual success in the marketplace is still to be determined. But clearly, there's opportunity there. And at the same time, as you've heard us say now for several quarters, we're not resting, waiting for the tablet or smartphone space to carry us. We are rapidly pursuing opportunities in the embedded space and more horizontal opportunities outside of smartphones and tablets, and those are showing good traction as well. But there's clearly opportunity for growth in smartphones and tablets as well. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?",138

We have win RT, ported over to our OMAP architecture, and we think that will have opportunities not just in the tablet space, but also in some of the embedded opportunities that we're pursuing as well. So a lot of those embedded opportunities are going to be looking for high-level operating systems to run on our applications processor. And the fact that we have the broadest coverage of any applications processor in terms of high-level operating systems that are ported and running on our chip is differentiation for TI and opens a lot of doors for us. So in terms of the customer enthusiasm, I can't speak for the customers other than to say we are still -- we see a lot of activity with those customers in terms of preparing to launch their own products.

Yes, I do. And it's really about gross margins. If we look at gross margins going forward here, it sounds like you guys are guiding margins up slightly here in the third quarter.

As we've been talking about -- we did bring in -- bring on quite a bit of capacity during the last couple of years that we bought for literally pennies on the dollar. And even though it's inexpensive, nonetheless, it does still contribute to our underutilization charges in the quarters. So clearly, the most meaningful way for us to improve gross margins is simply to continue growing our revenues so that we can absorb that underutilization and it will fall through to gross margin. In addition to that, we'll just see a continuation of improvement of mix. As we talked about earlier, baseband will drop to about $50 million, we think, in the third quarter. We still expect that to wind down to essentially 0 as we begin 2013. That will be replaced.  Our revenue that replaces that tends to have higher gross margins. So there'll be a little bit of mix inside there, but I think the biggest driver to point to is revenue growth to absorb the underutilization.",179

I guess what I would say is we saw some growth in disk drives in the second quarter. And that -- there probably was still some residual recovery from the Thailand flooding. But certainly going out of the second quarter, we think that is now fully recovered. Our view overall is that the hard disk drive TAM appears to be softening somewhat, though. And that very well could just be the mix of the types of computing platforms that are shipping. And many of those not using a hard disk drives.  They're using solid-state memory at this point. I think other than that, I think I described that at the mid-quarter that we had seen some mixed signals in the PC space between maybe similar to what we're seeing with analog products, battery management, et cetera and what we are seeing with hard disk drive. And I'd say that, that still held through the end of the quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?",165

Luminary was an acquisition that went into our Embedded Processing side of the house and really gave us a capability in the 32-bit microcontrollers that we previously didn't have a strong footprint in. And we're learning a lot in that space. We simply got a lot more to -- a lot more opportunity, a lot more growth to do there. But clearly, that brought a lot of knowledge to us.

You're talking about assets that are depreciated or not being used. These are mostly noncash. There's going to be some cash, because you're keeping, of course, underloaded clean rooms open, so you're still using utilities and some gases and so on to keep those going, but that's minimal. As it relates to opportunities, when we described in January that we were closing 2 of our older factories, the one in Houston and the one in Hiji, Japan, what we talked about is once those factories were closed, they should save us about $100 million in costs on an annual basis once that's done, so it's by the end of 2013.

Similar to Analog, we would expect the Embedded Processing space to grow kind of at historical average, which would be probably in the 8% kind of range over time. In fact, if you take a look inside the Embedded Processing and where we're aimed at, at the 16-bit and 32-bit, those are growing a bit faster than the 8-bit portion of Embedded Processing. So you might see something compound a little bit faster than that over time just from a market standpoint. And of course, our stated objectives are to grow faster than our markets, and we put the resources down to do that. Clearly, with the operating expenses inside that segment being, all things being equal, being fairly stable, any growth in revenue should fall through pretty quickly and improve profitability. So you would expect growth in revenue to occur at a certain pace.  Growth in profitability will occur at a faster pace, just because it's falling through without too much incremental operating expenditure.",166

On the general and administrative costs, we already have actions under way that we talked about when we acquired and closed on the National Semiconductor acquisition. You may recall that we talked about by the end of the first year of acquisitions, that's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter, that we will be removing redundant costs between the 2 companies such that we should have about $100 million of annualized savings after the end of the first year. We're actually making pretty good progress on that front. You may or may not be aware, but back when we closed on the National acquisition, we put some pro forma P&Ls out on the Investor Relations website that you're welcome to go take a look at that helps you see what the 2 companies would have looked like had they historically been combined. And if you go take a look at those, I think you'd find it somewhat insightful to just take a look at 2Q '11 and compare that to our most recent quarter, and you'll see that we're already beginning to see some of the cost synergies of those -- the merger of 2 companies coming together showing up in those results.",205

And typically, if we look in the third quarter and we're seeing a sub-seasonal third quarter, it's typically because -- that there's some inventory to burn in the channel. When you look at the seasonal businesses, I'd imagine that there's still some seasonal build that's going on. It's just more muted than normal. If we're to get towards the low end of your guidance, that would actually imply somewhat of a seasonal decline -- sequential decline. Could you help me to get there? What potentially could drive that? Is there still some inventory burn going on in the channel? Perhaps there's something going on with pricing or something maybe the nonseasonal market segments?",128
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2012",2012-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3671.0,328970.0,15906712.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,95,"Chris, I'd make a couple of points. I mean, I think inventories are low already. So this is not a case where in second quarter, a lot of inventory was built and now there's potential need to replenish. That's not the situation that we see. We think what happened in second quarter, the growth that came about was not inventory replenishment but was simply customers, for the most part, no longer reducing inventory. And so therefore, our shipments necessarily needed to start moving back up to the rate at which the customers were producing their own product. So not inventory build, but rather the end of inventory depletion. And you can see, as we've said, distribution channel at 6 -- even at 6.5 weeks of inventory, which it's been for the last couple of -- last few quarters was low already, and yet, they did manage to take it down another day, as we mentioned, in the second quarter. So again, I think our third quarter scenario -- I don't think that the downside case or the lower end of the range case has to do with inventory burning. I think it has more to do with if the macro environment weakens and customers take their own production rates down or down from what they are currently expecting, that could come into play. And of course, the upper end of the range just would reflect that customers that today haven't filled in the September orders, just haven't placed those orders yet because they didn't need to based on where lead times were. And so that would drive the upside case. The ""middle of the range"" case is kind of what we see in our backlog now. We're not making a lot of assumptions that we get additional fill-in during the month of September. So hopefully, that helps. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?",313

I mean, just as a follow-up on that, then, embedded in your guidance, assuming the midpoint of the range, then is it fair to assume sort of customer inventory and distributor inventory would be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter in dollars?",41

I don't know that we -- I guess to some degree that may be the case in that we're not seeing signs of -- in the form of backlog, signs of a ramp during the month of September that you might more typically expect just given the upcoming holidays. So I guess you would say at the middle of the range, there's probably the assumption of flattish inventory. But I don't know that we put a lot of assumptions about customer distributor inventory into that guidance more so than just thinking about overall demand.",103

So in other words, OMAP plus Connectivity, kind of a 40 -- a 60-40 split, with OMAP being 60% of that revenue and 40% being Connectivity. So from there, you can probably get pretty close in terms of what those trends were. But clearly, the decline was driven from OMAP. Connectivity was down, but I would describe it was down a small amount compared to OMAP. Do you have a follow-on, Tristan?",87

So I mean, I think their pricing strategy is going to be consistent with TI's own pricing strategy in the catalog space. So it's like High Performance Analog and some of the -- a good part of the power product line, which is we want to be competitive in terms of pricing, but at the same time, those markets you tend to sell into -- not always, but a lot of relatively low-volume applications where the focus from the customer perspective is much more on the product specification, the performance characteristics of the product as opposed to price. These products in general tend to be relatively low-priced products, meaning less than $1 type of ASP. And so as a percentage of the customer's bill of material, it represents a pretty small amount. So customers for these products tend not to be hypersensitive on price. They're more focused on getting the right type of product. And I think with the strength of the product line and portfolio that SVA has, the product -- the focus is much more on getting the word out, getting the support out to a much broader range of customers.  And making sure, of course, we're competitive on price. We're certainly not going to go out and not become -- try to position the product line so that it's not competitive. And frankly, that was part of the issue in terms of that revenue growth before, was reaching for higher levels of gross margin, sometimes the pricing out of National was not competitive in the marketplace.  And you saw their market share loss as a result. So the strategy shift is just make sure you're competitive but, again, make sure we're winning products based on performance and support considerations as opposed to pricing.",297

As I look at Intel, they guided up 6%, which is a couple of points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Xilinx, if you look at their core business, being down a couple of percent, that's also maybe 1 or 2 points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Your third quarter flat. I think it's about 6 to 7 points below what you normally do. So I'm just kind of curious, what is it about this environment that's hurting you guys a little bit more?",118

They certainly are much more narrower in terms of their end market exposure. So I'm not sure that we can do much of a direct comparison there. And then I think similarly, Xilinx, if we were just looking at our comms infrastructure trends, they might be different than what we see for overall. And clearly, they're going to have much stronger part of their mix tied to comms infrastructure. So I think of all the companies that -- at least ones that you've named, our exposure is probably much broader than any of them. And the second point is we really are operating in a more uncertain environment. And as we've said, this is a question not of the backlog that's painting a very clear story, and it's a negative story. This is more a question of we don't have all the backlog visibility that we would normally have. And so in that type of environment -- and I think a lot from what I've seen with other companies, that is not unique to TI. And I suspect there's probably just different means by which different management teams will choose to extrapolate what they see going forward. And so I don't -- we've given you what we've given you. We've -- explained the basis for it and what we've done, and I guess I just need to let you sort it out in terms of how that compares to our other semiconductor peers.

I might also add just to remind you that there's still -- one of the things -- even if we did have a seasonal growth, we still have a unwind of baseband going on. So that's the $40 million sequential headwind, 2 to 3Q. So if you adjust for that, it might not be down quite as sharply as you say, although it is still down versus what our seasonal number might suggest. The seasonal number of 6% actually is x baseband and refitted for the inclusion of National.",98

As you are implying in your question, right now it's more measured in customer interest and in design wins, and those, then, will be precursors to actual revenue growth that will occur later. But we've long said our assumptions coming into this acquisition was that the share losses that National had experienced pre-acquisition likely would continue into the first year of the acquisition, and then we would hope to have the revenue stabilized and running consistent with the market. And then for the next year and then in year 3, basically have it trending faster than the market, consistent with our own Analog growth. So that would imply over the next couple of years, you could see a faster acceleration in SVA growth compared to TI's own revenue, just as it's coming kind of from a hole to moving consistent with our own revenue growth. And I'll also say, those assumptions that I just talked about were what we built into our financial returns and financial assessment on the acquisition. Our internal goals, of course, are much more aggressive than that, and we're confident at this point that just based on traction with customers, the interest with customers, the design-in rates that we're going to be able to do better than that.

Thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. 
Let me start with market environment. Revenue in the third quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. That being said, we expected revenue and demand to be weak, and they were. Similarly, our expectations is that this market weakness will carry forward into the fourth quarter as customers respond to the sluggish macro environment and to poor demand for their products. We continue to believe that inventory levels at OEMs and our distribution channels remain low. Although there could be some adjustments to inventory in light of weak demand, we believe this slowdown is being driven by poor end demand, not a broad inventory adjustment. 
Even in the weak demand environment, our operations have performed well. We were highly responsive to changing demand and lowered our production loadings accordingly, resulting in lower TI inventory. We remain watchful and ready to respond to changes in demand, up or down, in this uncertain environment. Our lead times are short, our inventory is well-positioned and our factories are highly flexible. We also reduced expenses as we described at our September update. 
EPS was $0.67 last quarter. This was favorably impacted by a couple of items in the quarter that Kevin will walk through in detail. These items include a benefit for taxes that contributed $0.14 to EPS and a benefit for changes that we made to our Japan pension program that contributed $0.08 to EPS. Neither of these items was comprehended in the guidance we had provided. In any event, we delivered a solid EPS result that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05, even allowing for these items. 
We also generated a lot of cash in the quarter, with free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Kevin will describe how our opportunistic purchases of capacity over the past few years are now benefiting us on this front. 
Let me now walk through the third quarter's results. Revenue of $3.39 billion declined 2% from a year ago and grew 2% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 18% from a year ago and was up 2% sequentially. The growth from a year ago was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor late in the year-ago quarter. Therefore, the revenue comparison only included a week or so of this revenue in the year-ago quarter. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management, offsetting declines in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. 
I should note that we will soon complete our IT systems integration work at SVA and will begin this quarter to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution on the SVA portfolio. As you will recall, we began to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution in 2008, and our experience has been good in that it creates supply chain efficiencies. In short, it allows the distributors' resources to be better optimized on revenue creation for TI products as a result of fewer resources being tied up in inventory carrying costs. For TI, we believe it translates to higher share at our distributors. 
Revenue per products that are on consignment gets recognized as the distributors pull the products from the hub shortly before they ship to their customers. This means that as we convert part of the SVA portfolio to consignment, revenue recognition for these products will flip out about 2 or 3 months as distributors work down their existing inventory and then start pulling from the consignment hub. In total, about $100 million of SVA revenue will be impacted as we move these products to consignment support over a 2 to 3-quarter period. Since we recognize revenue on a sell-in basis to distribution, during this conversion process, the SVA revenue growth will be negatively impacted. Of course, this is only a timing consideration and will have no effect on resales. It will have minimal impact on TI's overall growth rate. However, it will have a more meaningful impact on SVA growth over this conversion period. 
Embedded Processing declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure applications. Automotive and catalog products were both up from a year ago. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 2%, driven by catalog products as communications infrastructure products declined and automotive was even. 
Wireless revenue declined 44% from a year ago and declined 5% sequentially. Baseband revenue was the biggest factor in both comparisons, falling to $54 million in the quarter. Connectivity revenue declined in both comparisons while OMAP revenue increased. 
Our Other segment revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 3% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue declined due to lower DLP revenue, the expiration of transitional supply agreements and lower calculator revenue. The sequential increase was due to $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the quarter that we discussed in our September update, and that was included in our prior guidance. The sequential increase was also driven by higher royalties and calculator revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was lower DLP and custom ASIC revenue. 
In distribution, resales were about even with the second quarter, and their TI inventory was essentially unchanged. Distributor's TI inventory remains at just under 6.5 weeks.

140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2012",2012-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3753.0,367736.0,17565766.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, let me start by walking through some of the charges and benefits in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the third quarter were $106 million. In the prior quarter, acquisition charges were $104 million. We recorded charges on the restructuring charges and other line of our income statement of $22 million associated with the previously announced planned closure or potential sale of several older factories. In addition, we had a benefit on this same line of $144 million for change to a pension program in Japan. 
Let me briefly explain the pension change. Defined contribution pension plans in Japan have historically provided for both a corporate pension benefit and a government-mandated Social Security type of benefit. The Japanese government has made an option available for companies that provide defined benefit pension plans to return to the government the mandated portion of the pension plan. Under the rules of this option, the pension liabilities we were required to return to the government exceeded the associated assets. The results -- this resulted in a gain to the company, which we recognized in the quarter. 
Let me also address the tax benefit. There were a couple of parts to this. The first was a $90 million discrete tax benefit that was primarily the result of an additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2007 to 2011. The second part, a $67 million benefit, was due to lowering our estimated effective tax rate for the year from 26% to 22% and the associated cumulative adjustment. Most of these rate change was tied to an increase in the impact of non-U.S. effective tax rates, a change that should continue to benefit TI in the years ahead. The EPS impact on these items was as follows: the acquisition and restructuring charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.07 as we had expected; the tax items benefited EPS by $0.14 and the changes to our Japan pension program benefited EPS by $0.08. 
Gross profit of $1.74 billion was 51.3% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially. Gross profit resulted from higher revenue, specifically due to the benefit that the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds provided to our mix of revenue. Operating expenses of $916 million declined 2% from the second quarter. Other income and expense was $24 million of income this quarter, mostly attributable to gains from an equity investment. Net income in the third quarter was $784 million or $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $14 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.69. 
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion, up $526 million from the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $1.05 billion, up $523 million from the prior quarter. Our free cash flow was benefiting from having operations that are already well positioned for future growth. Accordingly, capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter, up $3 million from the prior quarter. Our capital expenditures year-to-date are 4% of revenue, at the very low end of our targeted range of 4% to 7% of revenue. We believe we can continue to operate at the low end of this range for several years given our strong capacity position that resulted from our opportunistic purchases of the past few years. As we fill up this low-priced capacity, the resultant cash flow should be strong. 
We used $500 million of cash to repay all of our remaining commercial paper in the quarter. We also issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, consisting of $750 million of 3-year notes at a coupon rate of 0.45% and $750 million of 7-year notes with a coupon rate of 1.65%. At the time we issued the debt, these were the lowest ever corporate coupons for notes of these durations. More than 2 months later, these records still hold. Given these historically low rates, we are confident that we will be able to generate solid shareholder returns over time by using these funds for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock. We repurchased more than twice the number of shares we bought in the prior quarter. We also paid dividends in the quarter of $194 million. 
We lowered our inventory by $37 million in the quarter. Inventory days were unchanged at 101. Orders of $3.2 billion in the quarter decreased $171 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.96 in the quarter from 1.02 last quarter. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 13% from the third quarter. Please remember that our calculated revenue typically seasonally declines in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect about a $100 million decline, which would negatively impact the company's growth by about 3 percentage points. Also, the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the third quarter was the final Japan earthquake settlement, which, therefore, will not recur. This additionally impacts our fourth quarter growth by a couple of percentage points. 
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.31. We expect the fourth quarter's EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.06 from acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%. For the year, our estimate for R&D expense remains $1.9 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures has been lowered to about $500 million from our prior estimate of $700 million. We estimate -- effective tax rate has been reduced to 22%, down from our prior estimate of 26%. 
In summary, our market has weakened, and we expect it will remain so in the fourth quarter as the overall world economy continues to be soft. Especially in this environment, our operations have executed well as we have reduced inventory and lowered expenses in the quarter. Our business model is now focused to squarely on Analog and Embedded Processing, 2 markets with proven histories of solid cash flows and investment returns. 
We realized there are questions regarding our plans for OMAP and Connectivity products sold into the smartphone and tablets spaces. I can tell you, we are actively working on these plans, but at this point in time, we don't have anything new to share with you. 
Our free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in the third quarter is a testament both to the business model and to the benefits of our opportunistic purchases of manufacturing equipment over the past few years. The benefits to our shareholders of this business model and as long-term cash generation potential are very tangible as we repurchased $600 million of common stock in the quarter, pay dividends of $194 million and announced a 24% increase in our dividend rate. We remain focused on delivering to this potential. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",1233

We expect the factories to close late in the first half of 2013, one of them, and the other one early in the second half of 2013. Right now, our focus is on maintaining the state-of-the-art factories because frankly, their cost is quite low and go ahead and take these older, less economically advantaged factories offline.

With our reduced outlook for fourth quarter, we're further reducing our factory loadings into the fourth quarter.

But the tax rate, we expect to be 22% in the fourth quarter and going forward, starting from that 22% tax rate, as you build your models and you look out into the future for TI and you try to model our earnings, you should tax the incremental profit at 35% and let that fall through to the implied tax rate for 2013. As it relates to gross margin, gross margin in the quarter was 51.3% of the company level, but I'll remind you that we did have a $60 million insurance reimbursement that came through in the quarter. So that definitely benefited the gross margin a little bit in the quarter. As it relates to your question on OpEx, we did bring OpEx down in the quarter. I believe overall, we're down about $20 million quarter-over-quarter. And as we look out in the fourth quarter, I would expect we would continue to bring OpEx down especially in light of a weaker demand outlook that we've given our guidance.",186

The lower effective tax rate, we made the adjustments in the third quarter that would cumulatively get the year to that tax rate.

You talked about the consignment inventory program with SVA. How should we think about, I guess, the impact to revenues from that line item over the next quarter or 2 as that gets built into the model?",41
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2012",2012-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3753.0,367736.0,17565778.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,14,"Well, I don't have a quarter-by-quarter guidance to give you. But what we said was it would be about $100 million in total, that will convert over to the program. And at any point in time, the revenue that is converting basically will shift out about 2 to 3 quarters. So as we step -- I'm sorry, 2 to 3 months, and it will move out about 2 to 3 months and we will complete the entire conversion process of that $100 million in 2 to 3 quarters time period. So again, as we, let's say if in the first quarter, just as an example, please don't take this as specific guidance. If we were to convert $40 million of SVA revenue over to this consignment support, basically that $40 million would not be in that first quarter in this upcoming quarter but would move out to the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, into the first quarter. And then to the extent that we took additional revenue and converted over to consignment, let's say $50 million or $60 million in the following quarter, then there would be another $10 million to $20 million, depending upon the actual amount of additional headwind in that quarter. So again, during the process in which we're converting, so that 2- to 3-quarter time period, there will be a headwind in potentially sequential growth and certainly in year-on-year growth comparisons for SVA. And again, the total amount at the TI level will be pretty minimal. But if you're just looking at the SVA product line, it will be a more meaningful impact to that business.",270

I think the decision to increase is really a function of the emerging model for TI as it continues to evolve, and that is even if you take a look at the most recent quarter, about 70% of our revenues were coming from our Analog and Embedded Processing technologies and business units. And those are areas that not only enjoy a relatively robust margins but, because of the R&D and manufacturing nature of those products, produce very robust levels of cash. And as we have been committed to for a long time, we continue to return that cash to our shareholders in the form of those dividends and stock buybacks, and that increase just represents the ongoing confidence of that business model continue to produce that kind of free cash flow in the future.",135

Certainly, we look at orders, we look at order trends. One thing I would note that is when we look at order linearity through the course of the quarter, the month of September was the lowest month in the quarter. So that called the trend of orders as we move through the third quarter was a consideration. But, Chris, the other thing I would just is recall that only about 60% of TI's revenue operates on traditional backlog and order entry process. We've got about 40% of our revenue that is supported by consignment programs. And so with the consignment programs, we're getting the forecast information from those customers, but it doesn't show up as an order until the customer actually is ready to take the product or for us to ship the product. So again, orders are part of the story but they're not the whole story there. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?",172

On the OpEx front, as I mentioned early on also, we will be expecting to take tighter controls on that certainly as we go to 4Q and reduced outlook. And we'll continue to manage Opex as we traditionally do to what our revenue outlook is.

And then the main question is if I look at your core Analog business and if you look at the profitability of that business, just apples-to-apples, how does it compare with what a linear or an Analog devices or a Maxim are doing?

Probably one of the larger differences between TI today and most of our Analog competitors is that we have quite a bit more available capacity than they do. And so clearly, our various segments, including our Analog segment, is experiencing portions of the end utilization charge that we've got as a result of that capacity. But we also believe that with our continuing share gains, and I might mention we do believe we have been gaining share again this year in Analog, that we would expect to fill up that capacity, and so that capacity continues to be quite valuable to our strategic plans as we look forward.",154

But in general, the margins that we have for comparable products are very similar to that of our competitors is what I suspect because our pricing strategies are similar. It's not our objective to go out and underprice. It's not our objective to overprice. It's basically price the product competitively, and then try to win on features and performance and support that we can offer that customer. And I think from a cost standpoint, a manufacturing cost standpoint, put our costs probably up against any manufacturers in the world in terms of Analog. So I think that bigger difference, when you look at our business overall, is just that we are a much larger player than any of the companies that you named. And when you -- your strategy is to, as it is in some of those cases, is just to run just a very high gross margin business and be selective only for those pieces of business that support that gross margin, that's a fine strategy for that particular company, but it's going to result in a lower revenue level. Our strategy is to generate a very large Analog business that will generate a very attractive cash flow, and that means we're going to participate in a broader spectrum of business than what some of those more narrow competitors would be. So I would suggest probably that's the bigger difference, and in fact, when we go head-to-head with comparable products to those various competitors, margins are probably very similar.",300

As for the rest of wireless, going into those areas, probably going to be sub-$200 million is what we expect in the fourth quarter.",71

And even though we don't generally give guidance further out, we told you for some time that baseband will continue to decline and essentially be gone in 2013. Our expectation is that flat fourth quarter and then probably cut in half sequentially as we roll in the first quarter. And at that point, we're down below 1% of TI's total revenue. So essentially down to 0. Do you have a follow-on, John?",92

We're not -- it's not a big bounce-back that's would cause us to question the numbers we've given nor has it deteriorated such to the point that whether we question those numbers again. So again, probably no real trend change in the month of October that would cause us to revisit one or the other. I guess one thing I could point out, and this is not so much for the month of October, but if you just look back at third quarter, another metric -- we look at our cancellations, and cancellations in the quarter actually were down sequentially. And I would say would be down below what we would consider normal levels. So when we take that data and put it together, we had a small upside in the quarter, it really just kind of points to that view that we have customers and distributors really running lean levels of inventory and continuing to provide us short visibility in orders that they placed in the form of backlog. So at the same time, we're in a position where our lead times are short, our inventory is sufficient. It allows us to operate well in that environment, but it's the nature of the market environment we're operating in.",227

But as you point out, from an R&D standpoint, the engineering teams, that's a bit more of an effort. There are some people devoted exclusively to the Embedded Processing applications of those technologies as opposed to the wireless or the tablet and cellphone applications. And there are some engineering teams that actually cross both areas because there's some commonality. But that's the one that's probably a little more challenging to -- for realignment purposes. As it relates to -- on a go-forward basis, the separation, the -- we find that business is under way. But again, we'll report on that when we have a little bit more behind us in the future.",123

And the answer is it's less on the embedded side. Our -- what we found thus far is that OMAP and Connectivity for embedded applications looks a lot like our other embedded product lines in many ways from an R&D perspective. So for example, a lot of the R&D that we spend on the embedded side is focused on creating derivative, basically looking at different -- just interfaces, et cetera, that you put around on packaging, various qualification options, a lot more in the form of application nodes, software as opposed to in smartphones and tablets where you're on a pretty rapid cadence of introducing a completely new architecture generation. So that part can slow down, and you focus more on spinning off derivative product investment. So from that standpoint, R&D on the embedded side of OMAP and Connectivity is a lower investment than what's needed on the smartphone and tablet side. Do you have a follow-on there, Stacy?",199

Sure. It is basically flat. It really is flat. So I think if you just do a 5-year average, you would see TI revenue down 4%. But that includes a pretty dramatic drop in the first quarter of 2009. So I exclude that as an outlier. Basically, I get TI revenue flat fourth quarter to first. And that holds true for our calculator business as well as business overall. So we don't have any kind of significant calculator seasonality in Q1 that would affect us the way it does in Q4. Okay, Stacy? And again, to your point, that's not -- if you go back and look at the record books, that's not necessarily a -- as a reported number. That is including SVA historical revenue and excluding baseband, and we make both of those adjustments really to try to mirror what our current portfolio looks like and what those historical trends might tell you about revenue trends on a go-forward basis.",164

Glen, I think that, just from a macro standpoint, certainly there's a lot of -- we just kind of surveyed the global environment. We're looking that -- in the U.S., you got a fiscal cliff that people are wondering what's going to wind up happening. You got a potential change in many people in the national government and lots of discussion about regulatory and tax changes, and that's certainly causing people to kind of sit on the sidelines and perhaps wait and see what new rules are going to be. In China, you got this similar sort of thing and they've got a once in 10-year change in their government happening this fall. And you got to imagine that those business people have a similar perspective that some of the rules may change with the new government, and so therefore they would also be inclined to slow down much the same way as we see here in the Americas. And finally, in Europe, again similar. Everybody knows there's a serious debt problem that must be addressed, and that's going to require some meaningful change, certainly in the tax environment and other regulatory elements there. You can imagine a similar sort of thing there. So I'd say that if I tried to compare this environment to some of those doom and gloom ones that you just alluded to in the last 10 years or more, these are certainly 3 examples of things that are probably quite different from any time during those past 10 years.",255

I want -- I'd say that, and on the other hand, I hear from some of these industrial companies, not chip companies, that we could be in this kind of environment for the next 4, 5, 6 quarters. I wonder when you think about 2013 and how you're shaping the business, the cost structure for the business, are you sort of gearing for a flattish kind of environment just to be on the safe side?

And it lasted 2 quarters, and we were back up to the races again. So I think we all need to be aware of how wrong we've been in the past and what that might say about where we are today. Kevin?",99

What I'm about to say is going to be wrong. Let me just say that clearly, what we have done, Glen, is anticipate that we're going to grow TI whether or not the economy rose and prices along with it, will we grow because we're able to compete more successfully against our competitors with better product and better manufacturing remains to be seen. But that's why we invested in the manufacturing capacity that we have, and it's already bought and paid for. So even if we do wind up with a flat environment that's unattractive or a very strong growth environment that's very attractive, our manufacturing footprint is taken care of. Our CapEx bill is basically behind us, and so the result should be either -- whether result of growth is going to be very nice in the bottom line but certainly to the cash generation that, that will deliver for us. As it relates on the OpEx front, clearly in the near term, we're slowing down OpEx expenditures in light of the revenue environment that we're looking at. And we'll look into them and manage those pretty tightly. You may recall that we had talked in the past the model that we have for OpEx was that in periods of relatively weak revenue growth, our OpEx is probably going to be pushing up towards 30%. And in periods of stronger revenue growth, our OpEx will slide down closer to 20%. We're just -- we're probably in the mid to upper 20s right now, and we'll have to see where we'll go. But we will be operating with Opex inside those ranges, and we'll just see where the revenue outlook actually takes us and adjust accordingly.",292

In the second year, after the acquisition, we expected that we would have it running market neutral. So possibly less than TI's overall Analog business but at least running neutral with the market from a market share standpoint. And then in the third year is when we expect it to have it growing faster than the market and consistent with TI's own Analog business. So our expectation is that we will do that, if not better. Certainly, the first year, it lagged the market. We're coming into that period where again, if you look probably more from a resale perspective where it's unaffected by the consignment conversion, then we would expect that we have SVA growing consistent with the overall market.

You talked about wireless, but what's going on with the specific end markets? Are there any that are showing signs of worse deceleration or any geography that is getting worse or better?",47

I can walk through it. What I would say is the weakness is pretty broad-based though with a very few exceptions. If we look at the industrial market, I think you've heard from other companies that have reported as well, the industrial market is weak. It affected TI revenue, especially in areas such as Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog. And I think from a regional standpoint, this shows up especially in the U.S. and European regions. Automotive, I would describe as mixed, where U.S. sales of automobile, so in-sales, continue to grow. But if you look at regions like China and Europe, they're declining. If you look at TI's revenue, our automotive revenue in Embedded Processing was even, and our Analog automotive revenue increased a small amount. Moving over to wireless infrastructure, I think as we talked about even at the mid-quarter update, that revenue was weak for TI, a combination of lower purchases by carriers and even adjustments of inventory as a result from OEMs in that space. I think as it affects TI, WCDMA continues to dominate the air standard demand overall, and TI played there strongly. Although you're seeing probably growth, and you've seen this probably in some other companies' reports, on the LTE side, although I would say that spending is a bit volatile or erratic quarter-to-quarter. And again, we play on both WCDMA as well as LTE. From a regional standpoint there, I would say China continues to be weak, as well as slowdowns in the U.S. are contributing to the weakness as well. If you look over in computing, no surprise there. There is a lot of weakness both on the commercial side as well as public spending. Don't know the impact of Windows 8, don't know the impact that tablets are having on cannibalization. All I know is our revenue, as we sold into that space, generally was weak, including in the peripheral space, so meaning hard disk drives and printers. Probably one area of exception would be in our Analog battery management products, that revenue actually was up in PCs and in notebook chargers. But in both cases, that really is due to share gains from TI as opposed to strength in the market. But last story I would mention would be consumer. There, we're seeing seasonal growth really being driven by gaming and audio type of products, backlog visibility there in -- especially into the back-half of Q4 is pretty short, and we expect fourth quarter to see a seasonal decline, again, driven by the same areas. Okay, your question on the geographic split. U.S. was down, Europe was down, Japan was down. The one area that grew was Asia, and of course, Asia is large enough to offset all those other areas because about 2/3 of our revenue ships into Asia. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?",481

Just trying to tie back inventory and what we're hearing from the industrial guys. So for instance, Caterpillar is now talking about their dealers reducing inventory, how does that -- and I've been also of the view that inventory has been lean in the channel, and maybe I'm wrong as well because now that starts getting flushed back into the system. Does that then translate into inventory getting elevated again, specifically in areas like industrial? And any perspective would be helpful, Ron.",86

So my question is inventory has been low but now the demand decelerating the way it is, it is the 6, 6.5 weeks at a risk of getting elevated over the next quarter or so?",54

Let me first of all say, when we're talking about inventory, of course, we're referring to inventory of TI components. Generally, even at our OEMs much less for customers that purchased through distributors, we don't have a lot of downstream visibility into their end products and  into their inventory. To the extent -- I think distributors are trying just like TI as to really stay on top of the demand trends and make inventory adjustments on a real-time basis, so that they do not get into an excess situation. I think over the last few quarters, you've heard us talking about distributor inventory holding at about or just below 6.5 weeks I think for 3 quarters now. So -- and clearly, revenues have been shifting around, and we've had a few surprises in that environment. So I guess what I would say is I think distributors, OEM customers, TI, ourselves, we're all trying to just really keep aligned with end demand to avoid inventory going one way or the other. There's just a lot of sensitivity there. So hopefully, we do that going forward.",187

How well is your product output lining up with the customer demand as such? How long can we continue to provide these low lead times before you end up with a mismatch to a forecast that drives some extension there?",74

That doesn't always work through, but one of the things you see is that we're running, what, 101 days of inventory? If you compare that back to early '09. I believe we were in the mid-70s or so in terms of days of inventory. So we are carrying a different level of inventory, and part of that is because our portfolio changed. We are much more about standard or catalog product these days where off-the-shelf availability is important. And by the way, the risks of that inventory is also lower because we have lots of different customers that we can sell into with these same products. And typically, these are very long-lived products. So again, just the risk of carrying that inventory is lower. So I would say that's probably our biggest consideration and protection against what you just described, as well as keeping our factories prime to go and flexible up or down. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?",177

When you look at your factories in Q4, how many shutdown days do we have, and is there an expectation that you're going to have to keep some shutdown in Q1? And then my Ross' follow-up really is just looking at your forward guidance. You basically have offered us enough numbers on the other and the mobile group. I'm coming up with about 8% to 9% decline sequentially for Embedded Processing and Analog, if you were to guide by group. Does that -- is that computing properly?",108

So that's -- those kinds of assumptions are what you guys get paid to do. In terms of shutdown, obviously, when our utilization goes down and runs low, there are a lot of different methods that we use to maintain the efficiency of our factories. And so shutdowns and idling and scheduling vacation or holiday times and breaks are part of what we do. But I don't have anything to set here and discuss publicly in terms of how we will deal with it other than those are usually part of the mix.
Before we end this call, let me remind you that we have an upcoming investor meeting on November 1 at our Silicon Valley Analog facility in Santa Clara, California. At this meeting, our Analog manager, Brian Crutcher, and his management team will update investors on our strategy for growth in Analog and our execution progress. So if you have not already registered for this meeting, please do so or contact us if you need additional information. Of course, if you're unable to attend the meeting, we will have it webcast live and available on our website. With that, let me thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.",243
