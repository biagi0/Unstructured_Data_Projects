140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624538.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 5 at 10 a.m. Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll cover 3 topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter; second, I'll provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market, and I'll include some additional color in light of the market weakness we're currently experiencing; and finally, since this is the end of the calendar year, I'll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2018. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and the outlook. We'll then open the call for Q&A.
Starting with a high-level summary for the fourth quarter results. The weakness in demand for our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. The weakness was across most markets and came in about as we expected. There were a few exceptions that I'll cover in more detail when I discuss our fourth quarter segment and end market performance. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 4%, and Analog Processing (sic) [ Embedded Processing ] declined 12% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses' growth decelerated. Operating margins decreased in both businesses. And similar to the third quarter, Embedded remained weaker than Analog, primarily because Analog benefited from increasing content in 5G, while the weakness in other markets became more pronounced in Embedded. It is not unusual for Analog and Embedded to perform differently in the short term, but they are more consistent in the long term. Earnings per share were $1.27, including $0.01 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. 
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6.1 billion, up 30% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 31.2% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or if it's returned to owners. In 2018, we returned $7.7 billion in cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market and offer some additional color on the market. From a year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 4% due to Signal Chain and Power, partially offset by declines in High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue declined 12% from the year-ago quarter due to declines from both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined $31 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded grew 9% and 2%, respectively, and combined were 91% of TI's revenue.
Now given the current market environment, I want to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand in our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although personal electronics and specifically smartphones, was weaker, including Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Automotive and industrial both declined sequentially but still grew single digits from the year-ago quarter. In contrast, Communications Equipment grew about 20% year-on-year, benefiting from 5G deployment. 
On a regional basis, demand in China was weaker than the other regions. End markets within China, though, behaved directionally consistent with the rest of the world. We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions. We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end demand as well as reduced exports, but we do not have the visibility to distinguish between the 2. In addition, I would note that distributors, particularly in Asia, did get more conservative on their inventory positions late in the quarter. 
Finally, as we do at the end and close of each calendar year, I'll now describe our revenue by end market for 2018, which is a good indicator of our strategic progress. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. In summary, industrial, automotive and enterprise systems each grew double digits, while communications equipment was about even, and personal electronics declined low-single digits in 2018. Specifically, as a percentage of revenue, industrial was 36% and automotive was 20%. Personal electronics was 23%, comms equipment and enterprise systems were 11% and 7%, respectively. Other was 3% of revenue, down low single digits.
One of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity. For 2018, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue. We continue our efforts to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage. We continue to focus our strategy on industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to high terminal value of our portfolio. In 2018, industrial and automotive combined made up 56% of TI's revenue, up from 54% in 2017 and up from 42% just 5 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",1142
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624539.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.41 billion or 64.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were [ $814 ] million. Operating expenses for the year were up 1% and were 20.5% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges and noncash expense was $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter and then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. 
Operating profit was $1.52 billion or 40.8% of revenue. Operating profit was down 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 29.6%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.24 billion or $1.27 per share, which included a $0.01 discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter included noncash charges associated with the tax law changes. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.15 billion in the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $323 million in the quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $736 million in dividends and repurchased $2.01 billion of our own stock for a total return to owners of $2.75 billion in the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $4.23 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.1 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.77%.
Inventory days were 152, up 18 days from a year ago and above our targeted range, as mentioned on our last call. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. We have reduced our operating plans starting in the fourth quarter, so we are also working to replenish inventory of low-volume devices. These actions have served us well in the past. In addition, we have made progress on our next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. We expect inventory will continue to run above our targeted range for several more quarters. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2018, cash flow from operations was $7.19 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion or 7.2% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2018 was $6.06 billion or 38.4% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all our free cash flow to owners. Total cash returned to owners in 2018 was $7.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. In 2018, we paid $2.56 billion in dividends or about 42% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.9% in 2018 and has been reduced by 45% since the end of 2004, when we initiated our program designed to reduce our share count.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.21, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. For 2019, our operating -- our annual operating tax rate remains unchanged from our prior expectation of 16%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. In addition, the macro environment, including uncertainty caused by trade tensions, could impact the depth and duration of this cycle. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term while remaining diligent in the short term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",845

I know, Rafael, you mentioned that you have long-lived parts. But how are you managing utilization? And how are you making any distinction by the end market that the specific part is going into? And as part of that, should we continue to assume the same 75% or so incremental gross margin fall-through?",69

So let me answer the last one first, yes, and now let me go back to your question. So as I -- there's a bit of an echo on the call, but as I -- as we talked a lot on the call 90 days ago, we have reduced our wafer starts to align our operating plan better with our revenue expectations. We did that in fourth quarter, and we're doing that again in first quarter. That does drive lower factory loadings, and that does have a P&L effect. But the way we're thinking about it is as owner, is from a cash standpoint. So inventory is a use of cash. As we drive down inventory, that actually helps cash. And most -- more importantly, it sets us up to support our revenue expectations for the coming year. As revenue expectations -- those certain expectations change over time, then we'll adjust the factory loadings and utilization in order to manage that appropriately.",163

We've got tens of thousands of products across 100,000 customers, so you can imagine the complexity of that planning. The strongest signal that we get is the orders from customers as well as the demand signals that we get through our consignment programs. So as we go through with planned wafer starts, that's what we pay close attention to. And obviously in a time like this, we'll be very diligent in watching that and then proactively moving when we need to. So with that, do you have a follow-up, Vivek?",102
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624545.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,8,"Dave, so the second part is I know you mentioned that it's hard to predict when we come out of this downturn. But are there any other signs that you look at, even if they're qualitative, that can give us some indication when whether this is a 1 or 2 or 3-quarter issue? I understand it's very trade-dependent. But have you seen cancellations that are any different or similar to prior downturns? Any other color that you could help -- that you could give us to help us try and at least predict somewhat when we come out of this will be very useful.",104
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624546.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,9,"Yes, Vivek, so maybe just a couple of things. I think when we look at different things that we can look at like cancellations, they were up in the quarter but just up a little. Lead times overall, they continue to be stable. We can always find pockets where we're working aggressively with customers to close. But by and far, they tend to be very stable. So we'll look at all of those signals. I think on a broader view, and I've been in the industry for over 30 years now, we looked at data over that period of time. And I've been through 9 up cycles, and obviously, we're entering into the ninth down cycle. And if you stared at the data, and I've seen in your reports, Vivek, that you've done some analysis on that too, there is no typical or average to those numbers. But if you had to pick a number, it's probably around 12 months that a cycle could last. And things like the trade tensions could lengthen that, but it doesn't mean it has to be that long. As you know, it could be longer or shorter than that. So again, the best signal that we get is those orders from customers. Rafael, you want to add to that?",215
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624547.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,10,"Yes, just to add to that, we are proactively setting the operating plan so that we can manage whatever comes at us. So it's at a level that if we can run sideways for a while, we are prepared to support a potential snapback. Or if it's deeper and longer, then we have to make further adjustments. But we're in a good position to make those adjustments and protect the cash flow and have the company in a good position going forward.",82

I'm just kind of curious, relative to how you see the world today and what action you've already taken on utilization, do you think 152 days will represent kind of the peak in inventory days? Or would you expect it to migrate higher before migrating lower? And I guess as you answer the question, if you could just remind us with the consignment plan, kind of how -- what are the new targets for inventory longer term?",107
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624550.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,13,"Yes, so that's a good question. Let me just give you a few things to think about on that. First, as I said before, at the end of the day, our objective here is to maximize long-term growth of free cash flow. So that's how we think about all these knobs. Loadings and inventory is one of them. CapEx is another one, and then all we're doing is trying to maximize the long-term growth. With inventory, as we say, we see value in owning that inventory. That's part of the reason why we are building that low volume -- those low-volume buffers that we talked about. It's also the reason why we're increasing the consignment inventory. And that does push -- put upward pressure on inventory. At the same time, we -- overall, we have lowered the operating plan. So that is to control the cash that's used for inventory more so than any particular inventory days target. Now to get to the heart of your specific question, it depends, right? So if this thing gets weaker, then inventory days could theoretically go up higher than 152. If it stays above stable, then over 1, 2 or 3 quarters, we'll get back to the -- inside the range.",208

I'm wondering if you could just help us understand kind of from an end market perspective where the discrepancy is sort of the largest. So for example, I know in comms space, there's a really good content story on the Analog side that might not be there on the Embedded side. So when you look at the difference of growth rates, is there any sort of end market color you can give us?",96
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624553.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,16,"Yes. And certainly, both of those segments do have different end market exposure. We talked about the benefit that Analog is seen in comms equipment. Most of our PE revenue is in Analog as well, so that's the difference. We do have some inside of Embedded. But -- and John, if you look at year-over-year growth rates for as long as we've had these segments out there, you'll notice in times that they actually move in opposite directions. And -- but over time, if you look at those numbers, they really do perform more similar. And then also if you look at just industry data for the Analog market and compare that to the Embedded market, those behave differently. So I think that that's just kind of the facts of how those 2 businesses behave.",135

So our book to bill, and I always make this comment whenever it's asked, we've got now 65% of our revenues on some type of a consignment program. So you're seeing that number begin to move up as we implement further stages of our consignment programs with distributors. So book to bill is -- somewhat, you just have to be cautious with the number. But this past quarter it was 0.98. It was 0.98 a year ago and 0.96 in the last quarter. So that's just what the facts are. I think if you look at things like order linearity, orders decreased each month of the quarter. To some degree, that's not completely unusual that in the fourth quarter that you'd see weakness as you got into the third month. But I'd just say that those orders and the demand feeds that we get from our customers has really driven us to give you the guidance that we have. So that's really where we are, Harlan.

Given the growth this year, you guys drove another $1 billion of Analog revenues to your 300-millimeter fabs. You've got probably about another $3 billion left to go. So if I assume kind of high single-digit type of normalized revenue growth for Analog, your 300-millimeter fabs is going to be full in about 1.5 years. It would seem that the team would be having to make a decision soon about your new fab expansion initiatives. So you guys have any updates there?",83

But capacity planning for a new 300-millimeter tranche of capacity, that's something we've got to take very, very seriously and something that has a very long-term horizon. So this is something that is not changed by small fluctuations in short-term expectations. So we are continuing the planning process on that. And right now, we have options to consider, and we'll continue thinking of that. As we have said, I think, 90 days ago, whenever we do decide to go that route, if we do build a factory, that'd probably be a $600 million to $700 million cost on the shell that you're building, and that we'd probably spend over a couple of years. So that's not the only option we have for -- to expand capacity. We can always buy an existing factory, and that's another option that we're considering. And also I would say, the -- if we do build a factory, there are multiple locations that we're considering.",176

That was up from about $4 billion. That's real close to what the Analog segment actually grew.

140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624562.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,25,"Yes, yes. Let me give you some background. First, as I mentioned earlier on the call, all the knobs that we have at the end of the day are to optimize and maximize long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So that's the main objective, as you know very well from knowing us for many years in our capital management strategy. So CapEx is one of those knobs, right? And in -- for CapEx specifically, what is the objective, is to invest and support new technology development, its revenue growth and to expand our low-cost manufacturing advantage. So in 2018, we spent $1.1 billion of CapEx. And as you pointed out, that was 7.2% of revenue. At the same time, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. That was 30% growth on free cash flow from the previous year. So despite that CapEx, we increased free cash flow, that 30%. Now that CapEx is positioning us to grow the top line and free cash flow for a long time to come. Now given, as you pointed out and as our midpoint and our range implies, a decelerating market, then we can do things differently on CapEx going forward. I expect, if conditions continue, a slowdown in CapEx, probably not in the first quarter, maybe not even in the second quarter, but over 2019. But just keep that in mind, keep in mind that, that is all dependent on expectations of growth beyond that for years, not just 2019 or even 2020. So we'll adjust those -- we'll adjust the CapEx plan as those expectations change.",267

And I'd just add, I think when you look at 2019 that we'd expect CapEx to run into the future, even beyond 2019, closer to 6% of revenue, and that's higher than what it's been in the past just because of the availability of use of 300-millimeter equipment on the market. So that's where our expectations there. You have a follow-on, Chris?",63

Can you guys just talk about how the slowdown is impacting your 2 biggest end markets, industrial and automotive?",20

So I think that when we look at them, they both slowed in the quarter. We actually saw industrial, it was really broad-based growth. From a year-on-year basis, it was double digits. But inside of the quarter, it actually grew upper single digits. And then automotive again had slowed, but it grew double digits in total for the year. But for the quarter, for year-on-year quarter, it grew in low single digits. So again, both of those markets are growing, but certainly not out of the range that we have seen over the past few years.",97

I know it's typically up like 5% seasonally, but it's also a little more fixed now than in the past. So is it going to be up a smidge both year-over-year and on a quarterly basis?",47
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2598.0,1640797.0,64624568.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,31,"Yes. So I'll go ahead and take that. First, step back real quick, OpEx is just another knob that we have to optimize long-term growth of free cash flow per share, right? At the end of the day, that is the long-term objective. And in the case of OpEx, it's an opportunity to invest in R&D. So to put more products for industrial and automotive is an opportunity to invest in demand creation on the SG&A side and other things, other initiatives that's going to strengthen our competitive advantages. If you look at 2018, that OpEx came in at about 1% growth versus the previous year and 20.5% of revenue. On a go-forward basis for 2019, on a -- for dollars of OpEx, I would expect somewhere in that neighborhood maybe up a couple of percentage points for pay and benefit increases, something along those lines. But generally speaking at about that same level, all OpEx. You asked specifically about the quarter. We give you a range for revenue, a range for EPS. We don't get in the lines in between, but I'll tell you we're not expecting anything unusual. You can look at a fall-through -- expected fall-through on revenue to GPM and do your own model, and you should get to a reasonable assumption or conclusion for those lines in between.",223

So Rafael, the retail was the biggest in -- as a percent of free cash flow, I think, in about 3 years. I know that you don't think of it that way on kind of a quarterly basis, but it's historically been a little more mechanical than opportunistic. So should we kind of read into that, that you were a little more opportunistic because of the stock pullback?",71

So again, let me step back and remind everybody what's our intent when it comes to repurchases. And our intent is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, and that objective has not changed. We do that through a combination of dividends and buybacks, and we will be -- we have been and will be opportunistic with repurchases as it makes sense. So for example in 2018, as I mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was $6.1 billion. That was an increase of 30% from the previous year, and we returned $7.7 billion throughout the year through a combination of dividends and buybacks. And that year-on-year free cash flow growth was the biggest driver of that increase in returns, as a $6.1 billion increase from $4.7 billion in the previous year.",142

So when we look at China, it was weaker than the other regions. And then when you drop down into the end markets within China, I'd just describe it as really performing very similarly, directionally, meaning that comms equipment was up as it was in other areas. We saw markets of auto and industrial as well as enterprise get weaker from that standpoint. So we did see that difference this quarter. You have a follow-on?",80

And I guess, you had also mentioned in your remarks the impact of the trade issues and tariffs. And obviously, it's very hard to disassociate that from what's going on in the end markets. But with that, have you also seen -- I guess, we've heard this from some others that perhaps there was some activity of either pulling forward orders to get ahead of tariffs or pushing out things because of the tariffs. And obviously, the deadlines have changed, and we've got another deadline coming up. I guess the question is, what effect may have that had on order patterns as you went through the quarter?",108

But the one thing that we did see was distributors did get more cautious on their inventory late in the quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks.

And just to add to that, as we said during prepared remarks and during the call, we think this weakness is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We've grown for third quarters in a -- 10 quarters in a row, and that's the sort of thing that happens in the semiconductor industry. And in addition to that, the macro environment, including the trade tensions, could also be having an impact and could affect the depth and the duration of this downturn.",82

In the past, you have talked about your ability to keep picking up 30, 40, 50 -- 30 to 40 basis points of share across your end markets. As you look at '19, where revenue or broader industry trends are somewhat more challenging, is it easier for a larger analog company to pick up more market share? Or is it more difficult for you guys? How would you kind of stack that up?",75

I think when you look at the quality of the opportunity in the Analog and Embedded space, market share just doesn't move quickly across any of our peers in these marketplaces, and I think that just really speaks to the quality of the opportunity. So we continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are our manufacturing and technology we talked about earlier, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels which includes our sales force and the size of it but also our presence at TI.com and then diversity and longevity. So we're not dependent on any particular customer or product or technology to drive that revenue. So we're working and investing to make those stronger. It's just hard to pick up that market share. I can tell you that everyone here at TI will be focused on that even as we go through the downturn and probably have even more diligence and intensity around that overall. But again, if we could make that number higher, we absolutely would, but it is a hard thing to move. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Rafael to add some final comments.",198

Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the first quarter; second, I'll provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end market; and third, I'll include some additional color in light of the market weakness we're currently experiencing. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results, a brief comment on the status of our next 300-millimeter fab, and then the outlook. Then we'll open the call for Q&A. 
Now starting with the high-level summary of our first quarter financial results. The weakness in demand that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. The weakness was across all markets with the exception of communications equipment. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 2% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 14% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses' year-on-year growth decelerated as we expected at this point in the cycle. 
Similar to the fourth quarter, Embedded remained weaker than Analog, primarily because it didn't benefit from increasing content in 5G. Operating margins decreased in both businesses. Reduced factory loadings affected both businesses, but the impact was greater in Analog since more of its supply comes from internal manufacturing. Overall, revenue in the first quarter decreased 5% from a year ago and earnings per share were $1.26, including a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners. 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up 32.1% from a year ago. We continued to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end market, and then offer some additional color on the market. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 2% due to High Volume and Power, partially offset by growth in Signal Chain. I'll note that the strength in communications equipment minimized Analog's decline. Embedded Processing revenue declined by 14% from a year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 6% from a year ago. 
Now given the current weaker market environment, I wanted to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand for our products that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although communications equipment was stronger-than-expected due to shipments of products that support 5G. 
Next, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive declined mid-single digits due to broad-based weakness. We continued to focus our investments across 13 sectors in industrial and 5 sectors in automotive. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to believe these investments will deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.
Personal electronics declined low double digits due to broad-based weakness, including mobile phones and PCs. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 30% year-on-year, and as we mentioned earlier, benefiting both from 5G shipments as well as an easy compare due to weakness in the year ago period. History would suggest that we should expect this market to be choppy in the future. 
And then lastly, Enterprise Systems declined. Looking at these end markets on a regional basis, generally, all the regions performed consistently, excluding the positive effects of communications equipment. 
So in summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and they also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",957

And good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.26 billion or 62.9% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 170 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $803 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.7% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long-term.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. Operating profit was $1.38 billion or 38.4% of revenue. Operating profit was down 11% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 43.2%, down from 45.4% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.3%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. 
Net income in the first quarter was $1.22 billion or $1.26 per share, which included a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook as we have discussed. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $251 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.99 billion. In the first quarter, we paid $724 million in dividends and repurchased $1.15 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.88 billion. In total, we have returned $8.05 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.09 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%. Inventory days were 144, up 8 days from a year ago and down 8 days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low-volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the second quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and we'll manage it with our long-term objectives in mind. 
Next, as we mentioned earlier, we want to update you on our next 300-millimeter wafer fab. As you may have seen, we have chosen Richardson, Texas as the site for our next wafer fab. The new building will be on our existing site in Richardson. We have not announced a specific construction timetable yet. But as we indicated during the February Capital Management Call, we would expect to get started in the next few years. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI's revenue in the range of $3.46 billion to $3.74 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.32 which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019.
In closing, as we said last quarter, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We have just completed our second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. If you look at history, cycles are always different. But typically, the industry would have 4 to 5 quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. We are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective. 
Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term, while remaining diligent in the short term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",793

One interpretation is that you're not really seeing much recovery off of Q1, right? But just kind of surprising when we hear of China PMI improving and all the optimism about some signs of recovery. The other interpretation is that maybe Q1, you saw the extra benefit from comm equipment. So if I exclude that, then you are seeing some modest pickup going into Q2. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking about your Q2 outlook versus seasonally, which is supposed to be up 7%, 8% sequentially?",100

Vivek, I'd say, certainly, I can confirm the first part of the question, that in first quarter, we did get a benefit from comms equipment. That's just in the numbers. I think when we look at our second quarter outlook and we put that together, again, we base that on the orders that we get from customers as well as the demand fees that we get through our consignment programs. And just as a reminder, about 2/3 of our revenue come through those consignment programs. And for OEMs, we'll typically get 6 months of visibility and there's no inventory that sits in front of us in that manufacturing line. So it really is one of the best signals that we can get.
And I also would caution that, that doesn't mean that, that signal can't change very quickly. But -- so that's how we're basing the guidance for the second quarter and I'll leave the further interpretation to you. Do you have a follow-up?",165

And again, 2/3 of our revenue is coming through on consignment. So we'll get an order. When that product is due to ship, that happens instantaneously. So orders are probably less of the strongest signal that we'll get than versus that demand -- those demand signals that we get from orders.",62

How much of a hit were they to the calendar first quarter gross margins? And I guess more importantly, I know it takes time for utilization actions to kind of go through the P&L. But have utilization rates now bottomed? And how do you think about utilization relative to Q2 gross margins and going throughout the remainder of the year?",78
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2019",2019-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2223.0,1704384.0,67026933.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,11,"Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me try to frame that for you a little bit. Over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about how we were going to decrease our wafer starts to adjust to the expectations of revenue. While at the same time, we're going to increase the portion -- or dedicate a portion of those wafers to building our low-volume industrial consignment or industrial buffer parts and also the transition to consignment. So we did those things. And our operating plan did reduce and we did take a hit to gross margins in the process. And that's what you're seeing in our P&L. 
Now what I would sort of take you back to is look at it from a free cash flow standpoint. Because ultimately, that's what matters, right? What you're seeing from a utilization charges standpoint is a noncash expense. At the end of the day, what we're focused on is allocating capital and allocating cash, right? So by decreasing those wafer starts, what we did was dedicating less cash to that. So in fact, leaving out more cash for the owners of the company. But generating enough inventory or the right amount of inventory to be prepared for the revenue that we want to meet in the future. And also to build those buffer inventory stocks so that we're prepared for future quarters and have that, the ability to meet customer expectations and customer satisfaction, which ultimately is what we're trying to do with that inventory so that it helps us position ourselves to meet those customer demands and help with our goal of continuing to grow the top line for a long time to come.",283

And just a number on that. I think if you look at our first quarter trailing 12-month free cash flows at 38.4%, that was the same that we had last quarter. So it didn't change much.

Just going back to the revenue guidance for the calendar second quarter. If you look at how the business has historically performed, I think I need to go back to 2001, to see a calendar second quarter that was down sequentially. And that was sort of in the wake of the tech bubble. Again, I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing in the bottoms-up business to potentially have a scenario when they're of down sequential revenue? And I guess you mentioned in your prepared comments that the comms business can be lumpy historically. Is Embedded in the Q2 guidance still good lumpiness? Or would you expect bad lumpiness in the comms sector?",118
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2019",2019-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2223.0,1704384.0,67026936.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,14,"Yes. So I'd say, first, if you look over, and you know this very well, John, if you look over 10, 15, 25 years of the comms equipment market, that business is lumpy. It's lumpy because of the way that operators put out tenders and then place the orders and the OEMs, our customers, have to build to those. So history just says that you should be mindful of that and that doesn't make it a bad business, it's just an attribute of it. And so I think in second quarter, I'd remind you that we just completed the second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. It's not -- it's likely that cycles, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, can last 4 or 5 quarters. Sometimes they can be shorter and sometimes they can be longer than that. But we're 2 quarters into that. So -- and for our practice, if there was something significant or unusual going on in our guidance, either by end markets or a particular customer, we would make those things clear to help you understand it.",182

I mean, I guess is the first part of it is, is it fair to say that -- and I think you mentioned this, that the upside versus guidance in the quarter that was all comms? So the rest of business came in as expected? And I guess just secondly, how concerned are you with the possibility that the current strength we're seeing in comm is not actually matched to anything? I know people have been worried about like order pull forwards and that sort of thing from some of the larger customers? Like, what are you seeing around those lines, around the sustainability of the upside that we're seeing in comm? I guess, I'll give you [indiscernible].",135

Last quarter, we characterized that because it was more relevant at the time given the inflection point on our revenue. Now that the midpoint of our revenue is about the same as first quarter, I think it's time to just not focus on that and focus on the other things that we think are more important longer-term, which is our ability to continue to grow the top line as we focus on Analog and Embedded, Industrial Automotive. And with that, as we focus on growing free cash flow for the long term, as Dave mentioned earlier and we mentioned on the call, despite the drop in gross margin and the drop in utilization, our free cash flow on the trailing 12 months was essentially unchanged from 90 days ago. And as a percent of revenue, was 38.4%, right?",139

Got it. And then as a quick follow-up for Rafael. I wanted to get an update on your thoughts on capital return. Your stock is back up to not quite your 52-week high, but pretty close. How should we think about buybacks versus dividends versus other uses of cash going forward?",52
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2019",2019-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2223.0,1704384.0,67026954.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,32,"Yes. No, I'm happy to address that, Toshi. First, let me take everybody back to our capital management strategy. The objectives that we talked about and when it comes to cash return, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. And within that, we recognize that sometimes you strategically build cash, sometimes you strategically drain cash, right? So then you can actually return more than 100% of free cash flow. As frankly, we've done for the last few years. But on the 2 pieces of dividends -- and buybacks and dividends, the goal is to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and we target to be somewhere between 40% to 60% of free cash flow. At the moment, on the trailing 12-month basis, we're 45%. And then on the repurchases, it's the accretive capture of future free cash flow for the long-term owners. 
So -- but that essentially means -- so let me dive a little deeper on repurchases because that's, I think, that's where your question is going. We use reasonable assumptions, not aggressive, not conservative, but reasonable assumptions of our expected growth of free cash flow per share for the company for a long time to come. And then based on that, we develop our assessment on valuation, of intrinsic value of the company and then we compare that to the market price. And depending on the divergence of those, we buy back. So as long as it's below their intrinsic and higher than market price, we'll be buying back shares. And how much, it depends on the divergence, right? So you can see our history, the last 1.5 years or so. We have been returning significantly more than 100% of free cash flow as we do that assessment. But as long as the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, we will buy back shares in the open market. Was that -- do you have a follow-up?",332

I do. So a bit of a longer-term question, I'll break with form on the call. If we look at your ""other revenue"", it's like 8% of sales now, and the operating margin has been sort of steadily trending down over the last few years. And I think the most recent quarter was 15%. So it was about 25% below the corporate average. A, why is that operating margin so low? What's going on there? And then, B, why not just start shutting down or ending life those products?",90

A couple of things on that. Recently, we -- in this last quarter, we did have a decrease inside of that business, within our DLP business but a lot of that was due to this consignment transition that we have talked about. So that's part of what drove kind of the short-term and also maybe some of what the margin issue that you're attributing to. I would also remind you of some of our -- the acquisition charges, for example, restructuring charges, that's all in that other piece. Remember, especially on the acquisition charges, that's noncash. So that's where -- that represents cash that went out the door about 8 years ago. So if you adjust for that, that maybe gives you a better picture. And lastly, we do have the custom ASIC piece there, a couple of hundred million still left per year there. And over the next 3, 4 -- 2, 3, 4 years that will trend to 0. The rest of the business should be fairly steady and inside of others.",175

And the other comment that I would make, Chris, that you can see the seasonality of calculator, not only in the revenues, but you can see it in the operating margins. So almost all of those revenues come for back-to-school. So we'll see that at the end of the second quarter and the beginning of third. But obviously, the expenses for that business carry out throughout the whole year. So you'll see, always, you'll see, because that revenue comes in, in that short period of time, the operating margins in those 2 quarters look much nicer. But -- and the last comment I'll make, and we kind of joke about, we should have come up with a more creative name for other, like other good stuff or something like that. So those businesses generate lots of cash for us and they don't take a lot of resources to maintain them. So that's why they remain in the family.",159

We saw, last year, some of the tightness of things that TI doesn't sell, like MLCC capacitors and things like that, where the lead times got really inflated. And clearly, that's corrected now. I guess as you look back on that, do you think that, that triggered inventory of TI components to get built? And where do you think we are in sort of that cycle playing its way through in terms of shortages of other components that TI can't control?",98

I think, Joe, that's -- as you're describing it, that's kind of what drives semiconductor cycles, right? I think that's -- if you think of a customer, wherever they are in the world, and they start to get notified from their suppliers and our peers that their lead times are going out, and even though ours aren't going out, they may decide to proactively take their inventory position from 6 weeks to 9 weeks over a 90-day period. And that will drive strength in the business overall. And 90 days later, they decide to go from 9 to 12 weeks of inventory because things look like they're going to get even tighter. And then once they get comfortable, it moves back in the other way. So as you watch that play out, we add 10 quarters of very strong growth. Most of that was double digit. I think most people, when they looked at that, would describe that as above trend. And what follows 10 quarters of running above trend is a few quarters that will run below. So do you have a follow-on, Joe?",186

Even through this -- through the period of very strong demand, our lead times have remained stable. I think that you can always find pockets, just as you can today, where we work with customers very aggressively to close. And I think another important metric that we track, Joe, is on-time delivery. And those have remained very, very high. Other customer service metrics remained very high. So meaning that if someone does come and order products that, at lead time, are we shipping them to the commitments that we've got, and those remained high through that whole cycle. So -- and some of the things that we're doing, like building inventory of low-volume parts during this peak period of weaker demand, we're doing that to ensure that we can continue to deliver product consistently to customers. That's really what's driving that. And that and the visibility that we get through programs like consignment, kind of, the combination of those things, we're actually doing other things around inventory positions and order entry, and we've summarized that as really the belief that there's strategic value in owning and controlling that inventory and keeping it on our balance sheet.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the second quarter; and second, some details by segment and end market. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A.
Starting with high-level summary of our second quarter financial results. The quarter progressed about as we expected with revenue decreasing 9% from a year ago due to broad-based weakness. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 16% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses' year-on-year growth decelerated.
Earnings per share were $1.36 including a $0.07 benefit for items not in our original guidance. The benefit includes $0.04 due to the previously announced sale of our Greenock, Scotland fab, with the balance primarily due to discrete tax benefits. With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.9% of revenue, up from 36.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to our owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the second quarter by segment and end market. For the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 6% due to declines in High Volume, Power and Signal Chain. Embedded Processing revenue declined by 16% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.
Next, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive together declined upper single digits due to broad-based weakness. Personal electronics declined low double digits also due to broad-based weakness. In communications equipment, revenue declined sequentially but was about even from a year ago versus a very weak compare. And lastly, enterprise systems declined.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",683

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.36 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $810 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21.1% of revenue, within our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.57 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined processes of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 remaining years. Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our Greenock, Scotland facility.
Operating profit was $1.51 billion or 41.1% of revenue. Operating profit was down 12% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 43.7%, down from 47% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 33.5%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.
Other income and expense was $52 million benefit, up $28 million primarily due to investment gains and tax-related items. Net income in the second quarter was $1.31 billion or $1.36 per share, which included a $0.07 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $284 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.93 billion. In the second quarter, we paid $722 million in dividends and repurchased $863 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.59 billion. In total, we have returned $8.01 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.22 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%. Inventory days were 143, up 8 days from a year ago and down 1 day sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low-volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the third quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory, and we'll manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.53, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019.
In closing, we have just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. As we stated last quarter, if you look at the last 30 years of history in our industry, cycles are always different, but typically you could see 4 to 5 quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. Again, we're not trying to forecast the cycle but simply offer some historical perspective.
Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",730

It's a mix of comms equipment and some handset in there and some other products. And if you look at comms equipment overall, it's 11% of our revenue. We had seen some nice growth in our 5G products, as we've talked about before. 
And if you look from a regional standpoint, I'd say there's nothing unusual going on. We've talked about that in the past when there was. And certainly, if you look at where we ship product, that's not always indicative of actual end demand or end look-through to those economies, meaning we may ship into one region and that may get packaged up and shipped to another region before it's actually consumed. 
So overall, by the regions, they came in as we expected and nothing unusual. We didn't see anything unusual this quarter. So thank you, Vivek.",157

So free cash flow 12 months trailing, which you always point us to correctly, which is kind of in the same ballpark that you had last quarter. But then, inventory was down and the fall-through in the margins is much higher incrementally. And I know it's not the same every quarter, but I was just curious if there's something going on there.

From a -- the way you want to think about it is our fall-through, as we have said before, is about 70% to 75%, and you want to look at that on a year-on-year basis. And even then, this is sometimes a little less, a little more. But that's the right way to look at it, and this quarter is actually right between that 70% and 75%.
The other thing I would mention is over a longer time period, over the last many years and we expect this to continue, you're seeing the benefit of 300-millimeter manufacturing. That is part of our competitive advantage, manufacturing technology. And as we have talked about before, it's just a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost that goes into producing a 300-millimeter wafer versus a 200-millimeter wafer. So we expect that benefit to continue to accrue to gross margins and ultimately free cash flow margin, which is the one that drives value for the owners of the company.",178

Still at about 4.5 weeks and has been steady at that for a couple of quarters now. Order rates, when we look at those, those looked normal as they came through. Cancellations were down a little bit from last quarter but really didn't change much. And then our lead times overall have remained stable. Certainly, they were stable as things got more heated in the industry. But -- and of course, there's always areas that we would still be tight on today, but in general, the lead times have remained very stable. So thank you, Ambrish.",138

You answered sort of generally. But specifically, what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei? Are you still contemplating selling product to them, or are you not? What's in the guidance regarding that customer?",40

Since then we've resumed shipments of the products that we've determined we could ship, that are in compliance with the U.S. regulations. So overall in this quarter, things came in as we expected. As I stated before, that would be inclusive of communications equipment, where Huawei would sit. So in our guidance, we obviously have that in for the quarter. And if there was something unusual that we are keeping out, our practice has been to call that out, and there's nothing unusual that we're planning on. You have a follow-on?",111

Well, the stockpiling and consignment one-off strategy that you've been doing, it's been going on for a while. How much do you think that has increased utilization over the last few quarters as you've been rolling that out? And how much longer do you anticipate driving that strategy before it reaches completion?",55

But we've had an inventory strategy for many years. We just continue to tweak it over time, make it better, stronger. And as the cycle started in the third quarter or so, then we deploy some specific tools during that time to then take advantage of that situation and use what we call our wafer starts. We devoted an increasing share of that to the low-volume inventory strategy. We have built a lot of that but it's not complete. But incrementally, it's going to be less going forward than what it was in the last few quarters because you get to obviously diminishing returns at some point on that.",120

And I'll point out that obviously, you saw our inventory dollars were down sequentially. They're actually down year-on-year. Our inventory days were down sequentially even with those planned builds of those low-volume parts, and we feel really good about being able to do that in our operations.
The second part of your question there was what is the impact of -- consignment have on utilization. It really has no impact at all. Basically, it optically, and by definition, just puts more inventory on our books. But even if the inventory didn't change in the channel, it just would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory, and that's going on as well.",114

Remember what inventory is about, right? What is the objective of inventory? It's not about maximizing utilization or gross margins or anything like that. It's about maintaining high levels of customer service. 
So what we have done is deployed our cash to inventory. And as Dave said, inventory actually decreased. So -- but within that decrease, we built some inventory of low-volume parts. That now puts us in a great position as we move into the third quarter and beyond to have that inventory of low volume that is generally difficult to build, we have it ready. So then we'll be able to serve our customers on the other side of this very well.",125

I think you've said in the last calls -- last few calls that it's upwards of 2/3 of your revenues go through consignment. That's increased substantially over the last 3, 5, 10 years. Why do you think your year-over-year revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if you're controlling that inventory? I would think, all else being equal, you wouldn't have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenues during a period like this.",96

What I would tell you is maybe take into account, in the last, what, 4 quarters or so, 5 quarters, we have gone through the next phase of consignment. And we have added, I want to say, $30 million to $40 million of revenue to that program per quarter during that time, for a total of close to $200 million. We probably still have one more quarter to go where that is -- where that's going to happen and maybe through the end of the year, but it's getting to diminishing point.
But that is revenue that from the P&L, it had sort of disappeared, right? But obviously, the demand hasn't changed. The end demand truly hasn't changed. It's just that now it goes into our inventory and the revenue is delayed. But it just puts us in a much better position to then own that inventory, distribute it better where it's needed, work with our manufacturing facilities better to determine what's needed to be built for -- to replace -- replenish that inventory. So it's just a better way to operate.",196

Sure. So the first is they performed similarly. Industrial was a little weaker. Auto was a little less weak but in the same zip code. And that was the same for the sequential. Together, they grew low single digits, and that same profile was the same. Personal electronics grew high single digits with broad-based seasonal growth. Comms equipment, as I mentioned earlier, had declined, and then enterprise systems actually grew sequentially. Okay. Thank you, Ross.",77

But let me first step back to the objective for inventory to remind everybody and as I said earlier in the call, is to maintain high levels of customer service. We also want to minimize obsolescence of that inventory and improve asset utilization, but the main thing is to maintain high levels of customer service and our target is 115 to 145. 
So last quarter -- 2 quarters ago, we went above that target, 152. But then last quarter, we're at 144 in one -- first quarter, and then second quarter we just finished at 143. So both of those inside of our target.",115

And I'll just add again that even outside of those numbers, we've made really good progress of executing to building those low-volume parts, and we believe that's important so we can continue to service customers well. 
And the second part of your question, Mark, was, yes, it was down a little bit sequentially on a days basis in distribution, still at about 4.5 weeks. That is a healthy level. And I would say that, that number will structurally kind of work its way down as we're implementing more of this revenue on consignment, and that's a great thing for our distributors.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
 
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the third quarter; second, given the additional weakness we've seen, I'll provide some comments about what we're seeing with added insight by segment and end market. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook. After which, we'll open the call for Q&A.
 
Starting with a high-level summary of our third quarter financial results. Revenue decreased 11% from a year ago and came in below the midpoint of our guidance as we saw most end markets continued to weaken further. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 19% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses' year-on-year growth decelerated. Earnings per share were $1.49, including a $0.09 benefit for items not in our original guidance due to discrete tax benefits.
 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners.
 
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 41% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or if it's returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $7.4 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in the business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
 
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the third quarter by segment and end market. For the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 8% due to declines in Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue declined 19% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. All markets declined across Embedded, but the declines were most pronounced in the automotive and communications equipment markets. Other declined by 19% from the year ago quarter due to DLP and custom ASIC.
 
Next, I'll provide some comments on what we're seeing in the market and insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. As we've said, when you look at 30 years of history, semiconductor cycles can vary widely but typically experience 4 to 5 quarters of year-on-year declines before returning to positive growth. We've also said that the current trade tensions could impact the depth and duration of the cycle. We've provided these comments as context, not as a prediction about the current cycle. With the end of this current quarter, we've now experienced our 4th consecutive quarter of negative year-on-year growth. There is an increasing number of reports of macroeconomic weakness with trade tensions as the primary contributor. Consistent with this, the weakness we've seen in the third quarter was broad-based across all markets and most sectors. Industrial, automotive and personal electronics all declined upper single digits from the year ago, as almost all 28 sectors within these markets declined. In communications equipment, revenue declined about 35% from the year ago and 20% sequentially. We saw weakness across all major customers, regions and technologies. And lastly, enterprise systems declined from the year ago quarter.
 
We've learned over the years that staying focused on building the company stronger, especially in the face of a weak market provides great, long-term rewards. We continue to invest in and leverage our competitive advantages. The breadth of our product portfolio, in channels to market, including our direct sales and applications team as well as ti.com, provides us the broadest reach to our customer base, a unique advantage. We've been evolving our distribution network over the years and continue to do so today as we build stronger, direct relationships with our customers. We remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products. We remain focused on industrial and automotive, the best market. They'll be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and the outlook.",907

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points.
 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $778 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.
 
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and will remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $1.59 billion or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46%, down from 50% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 32%, down from 35% a year ago. Despite current weakness, our focused investments on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.
 
Other income and expense was 34 -- was a $34 million benefit, up $11 million from a year ago. Net income in the third quarter was $1.43 billion or $1.49 per share, which included a $0.09 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook as we have discussed.
 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.03 billion. In September, we announced we would increase our quarterly dividend by 17%, marking our 16th year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $721 million in dividends and repurchased $456 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.18 billion. In total, we have returned $7.38 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 48% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.07 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $750 million of debt and issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 2.25% due in 10 years. This results in total debt of $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%.
 
Inventory days were 139, up 8 days from a year ago and down 4 days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low-volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs. Work in both of these areas is mostly complete. Given the weaker environment, we have reduced wafer starts to align with demand.
 
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $1.09, which includes an estimated $5 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019. As a reminder, acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021.
 
In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",696

Because when we looked at some of the SIA data for July and August, it was more positive. So is there anything that is company-specific in Q4 because the guidance is substantially below? We understand the macroenvironment is not that great. But is there anything one-off, company specific, that is impacting your guidance? Is there any share loss issue? Any other color that you could provide would be very helpful.",90

I'd say -- state the obvious. Obviously, the SIA numbers are more backward-looking versus looking into fourth quarter. And I think when you judge share, and we've talked about this when -- in the past that you really need to judge it over multiple quarters. You look at the diversity of our revenue, we talk about one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity. Our last -- our biggest product last year, as an example, was about 0.8% of our total revenue. So just that diversity, I think, has served us well and will continue to serve us well.

I think if you look at the Analog and the Embedded markets, they've got many natural competitive moats that sit around the marketplace overall. I think that we've certainly heard discussions of Chinese customers wanting to ensure that they have alternatives. But it's really different than being designed out. So our customers overall are very pragmatic. They're looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost and the most dependable delivery. So I think we'll continue to focus on those things. And they have served us well in the past and we believe they'll continue to serve us well in the future.",107

We've been in this environment for a while. I think you had your first guide for a cut actually on this call a year ago, but even on that call you had guided Q4 '18 down about 12% sequentially, which is already [indiscernible]. We're a year later, we've had a number of rounds of cuts, so the base is even lower. Now you're guiding Q4 '19 down like 15% sequentially. So it's even worse on a sequential basis than we saw in the year ago quarter when they started.
 
I guess if -- and again, it's not like things have -- things have been weak all along. I guess if you can give us some kind of an indication, maybe what they did immediately worse is this, Huawei pull forward working off, is this something going on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitors? I guess anything you can give us around the tactical near term environment driving the Q4 guide would be helpful, just given what we've seen over the last year or so in those trends.",194

Let me take a shot at that, and then Dave will follow up with other comments. But our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago. And many of them, when talk about their caution, they mention the trade tensions that we know have been happening and have been kind of accumulating over the last 3 or 4 quarters. And the consistency of that breath of weakness supports that this is a macro situation that is driving the further weakness that we're seeing.",102

No, simply in a word, I'd just say no, Stacy. I think establishing a more direct relationship with our customer just yields more rewards than it does risk. And it gives us greater access to those customers. And you've seen us evolve that over the last several years. And we've made investments in order to provide very high levels of service for our customers, especially as we move to a more direct business model. And these investments include the things that you've heard us talk about, the new capabilities and in some cases, improved capabilities to our website, e-commerce enhancements for demand creation, inventory consignment programs that we've talked about on the last few calls and other things like order fulfillment services.
 
So these improved capabilities, combined with our sales and applications organization, which by the way is the largest in the semiconductor industry, just help us provide great products and great support to our customers. And that's really what we've been focused on.",165

But when I look at Embedded, it seems to be demonstrably worse. In fact, if Q4 is down sequentially, equally across all segments, you'll be down, peak to trough, this cycle in Embedded, more so than you were in the '09 financial crisis when financial markets weren't working properly and companies couldn't actually get funding for inventory. So I just want to kind of go back and kind of understand why you think the Embedded business is doing so poorly relative to overall kind of industry trend? Is that really where the comms weakness comes in? Or if you can help me understand that a little bit better, it'd be helpful.",151

But that weakness was just more pronounced. It's directionally the same, but just more pronounced in Embedded. And we did see, and if you look now just inside of Embedded, we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communications.

But the weakness that we saw wasn't limited to any region, so was very broad-based. When we look at the largest customers inside of comms equipment that was across the largest customers.

I know one quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but you guys have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over time. I know you raised the dividend this last quarter, but I think the share repurchase was the lowest since, I believe, the second quarter of 2012 if my model is right. And the aggregate of the two, the dividend and the buyback, were meaningfully less than the free cash flow in the quarter. I know it's not just one quarter, but is there anything that explains why the buyback was significantly lower than it's been in any time in recent history?",117

And as you pointed out, we do that through buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis, which is a better way to look at all these things, to give you just a better trend of what's going on. We have returned $7.4 billion of cash and our free cash flow has been $6 billion during that time. So we've returned 122% of free cash flow during that time. So pretty healthy amount. And in the last quarter, we returned -- or we bought back $456 million. As long as the stock price is below our assessment of intrinsic, we'll be buying back shares and we did buy back a healthy amount in third quarter.",149

I'll make a comment and if Rafael wants to add something to it, certainly jump in, Rafael.
 
But when we look at inventory in the channel, it was actually down a little bit sequentially, still at about 4.5 weeks of really not changing much overall. We still have about 2/3 of our revenue supported by consignment overall. So we know that inventory remains at 0 because of those consignment programs. So continue to be in a very healthy, healthy state.
 
Now the rest of that, we can't see into our customers' inventories and down channel. So our visibility really ends at that point. Rafael?",106

And I understand that. We have close to 100,000 different customers, and we sell about 100,000 different products. It's difficult to pinpoint any one thing, but the sense we get talking to those customers, getting input from them, from our sales people and all the touchpoints that we have, is that the weakness is broad-based, it's due to macro events and specifically the trade tensions. I mean, do you think about when there's tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious, then they pull back. And we are at the very end of a long supply chain, and when the ones at the very front pull back, it becomes a traffic jam. And so our sense is that it's what's happening in the marketplace. But we'll see what other companies will report over time and we'll get a clearer picture over the next several weeks and really quarters, because this thing, we've been in it for now 4 quarters, and it's going to be longer than that.",192

We've talked about 70% to 75% fall through. And that's a guide, it could be a little less, a little more. So that's probably how you want to think about it on a year-on-year basis for fourth quarter. We are -- we did lower wafer starts in third quarter, inside of the quarter, and we have -- we are lowering those further into fourth quarter. And that's our capital allocation decision. When we do that, we save cash, right? And we have, to the largest degree, built the buffer strategy that we had talked about. So we will save cash as we do that, and that makes sense for the owners of the company. That's cash that's freed up for other purposes. That does take -- that does hit -- that will hit the GPM line, but it will do so about as expected. So as I say, you've seen a fall through that we have talked about in the big scheme of things.",176

And these are long-term investments that pay off over many, many years, in many cases, decades. So that's how we think about it. It's not -- we're -- in this environment, we're cautious and we want to be prudent, but we're not cutting back on our -- on those long-term investments.
 
On a trailing 12-month basis, OpEx has been running pretty steady at about $3.2 billion for at least a year or so. If you look at trailing 12-month at the end of every quarter for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and it is -- overall it's down about 1% versus a year ago. But of course, revenue has been dropping more than that, so then as a percent of revenue, it's gone up a little bit. So now it's at 22%. And that's well within our expectation, our guide of 20% to 25% for that metric.

And that is one of our key competitive advantages. We are now in the process of building a parking structure that will be complete in the first half of next year. Once we've build that, that will enable us to build the building for that next 300-millimeter factory. Our plan continues to be to, to build that building within the next few years. And as a reminder, that will cost $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years as we build that building. And it is $600 million, $700 million, it is a sizable amount, but the big expense comes from the equipment that would follow. And in fact, an even bigger one would be the opportunity cost of not having that available if there is or when there is growth on the other side of these things. So we think about all those things. And based on that, we -- we've made our -- we'd laid out our plans at the moment.",198

If I look back at your June quarter, that business was up about 6% year-on-year where everything else was down 1%. And so I guess as you look back and you think forward, do you have the sense that, that was in fact pull-ins in the prior quarters, and that's perhaps exacerbating what you're seeing into the December quarter?",74

But so I certainly wouldn't rule that out as a possibility. But I think more of what you're seeing there is just seasonality as customers prepare on more the PE products, or our products are shipped into China than any other region. So that has an effect that's in there as well. So again, I won't rule that out, but you've got some seasonality that's going on with that. You have a follow-on?",110

You talked broad-based weakness, but was hoping perhaps you could narrow in on auto, and give a little more color on what you're seeing there, either geographically or by subsegment.",32

All the sectors saw weakness. I made the comment that if you look at the sectors across industrial and even personal electronics, that most of those sectors were down. So automotive was no different from that front. And I would say that from a regional standpoint, there's -- we saw weakness across all of the regions. So nothing really significant there to spike out.",75

So obviously, there's been some weakening. And I'm just wondering if you already started to see that this summer? Or was it sort of something more that came later in the quarter?",45

So I would say that it was weak throughout the quarter. It wasn't -- last couple of week or last 30-day phenomenon. I'd also point out, we've got 2/3 of our revenue on consignment. So in those arrangements, we get the order and ship them instantaneously at the same time. So revenues and orders really reflect each other for the most part. You have a follow-on, Tore?",68

I had a follow-on for Rafael. So you've done a tremendous job on gross margin. Revenue is down 12% year-over-year, but gross margin only down 90 basis points, and now your inventory days were down as well sequentially. I know you talked a little bit about factory loadings in Q4. But do you -- should we think about some sort of inventory days target that you want to run the business at the next few quarters?",77

Let me first step back and remind you how we think about inventory.
 
Okay, inventory, the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence and improve our asset utilization. We have a guide of 115 to 145, but those are not concrete barriers, right? It's just a guide there. We're going to do the right thing for the business, so. For example in this situation, in the current environment, even though we have decreased those wafer starts, it is likely that we go above the top of that range. Or it's at least possible that we do, just because of where the revenue midpoint is. Now we're not going to go drive the wafer starts draconian -- in a draconic way, draconian way, to get to -- just to stay within those guidelines. That would not make sense in 1 quarter. But over 1, 2, 3 quarters, then the idea is to, that guideline does provide an area where we should aim at. And we can achieve our objectives, the inventory objectives I talked about, while deploying and allocating capital in the best way that benefits the interest of the long-term owners of the company.
 
So with that, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. We'll remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products, and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. Lastly, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term is what we'll maximize value for the owners of the company.
