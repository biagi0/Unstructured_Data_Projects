140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,1816.0,2181745.0,85404155.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2020 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management on February 4 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and approach to capital allocation.  
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter and next, I'll provide some insight into fourth quarter revenues results. And as we've done the past few quarters, we'll provide details by end market, including sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. I'll also provide the annual summary of revenue breakdown by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into onetime items and our guidance for the first quarter of 2021.  
So starting with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. The company's revenue increased 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in automotive, personal electronics and the industrial markets. Analog revenue grew 9% and Embedded grew 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog revenue grew 25% and Embedded grew 14%. Our Other segment grew 4% from a year ago quarter.  
Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into the fourth quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market continued its rebound following the second quarter bottom, with 19% sequential growth and 25% year-over-year growth. The industrial market was up 7% sequentially and 16% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most market sectors. 
Personal electronics was up 11% sequentially and up 39% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next, as expected, communications equipment was down 28% sequentially and down 8% from the year ago. Enterprise systems was down 2% sequentially and down 13% from a year ago. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2020.  
We break our end markets into 6 categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The 6 end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 37%; automotive, 20%; personal electronics, 27%; communications equipment, 8%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other was 2%.  
Looking at the changes versus 2019, industrial increased 1 percentage point, automotive declined 1%, personal electronics increased 4%, communications equipment declined 3%, enterprise systems was even and other declined 1 percentage point. In 2020, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, about even with last year and up 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",670
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,1816.0,2181745.0,85404156.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.6 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points.  
Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.  
For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.  
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $47 million in the fourth quarter. Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021.  
Operating profit was $1.8 billion or 44% of revenue. Operating profit was up 45% from the year ago quarter. Other income and expense was $162 million in the quarter due to a onetime benefit related to the signing of a multiyear royalty agreement.  
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.80 per share, which included a $0.16 benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the royalty agreement we just mentioned.  
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $212 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $937 million in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 17th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $15 million of our own stock for a total return of cash to owners in the fourth quarter of about $1 billion. For the year 2020, we returned $6 billion, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.  
Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $6.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 123, down 21 days from a year ago and down 14 days sequentially.  
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2020, cash flow from operations was $6.1 billion. Capital expenditures were $649 million or 4.5% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2020 was $5.5 billion or 38% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. And after accretive investments in the business, the remaining cash will be returned over time via dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and purchased $2.6 billion of our shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2020.  
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.79 billion to $4.11 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.66. We expect our 2021 annual operating tax rate to continue to be about 14% and our effective tax rate about 1 percentage lower than that -- a percentage point lower than that.  
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best market opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.  
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",672

Dave and Rafael, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the current demand backdrop. I mean, clearly, we're hearing about lead times stretching out in the semi industry. Many of your peers are talking about raising pricing. I guess, specifically to you guys, can you help us understand what your lead times are doing? What you guys are thinking about doing around pricing? And I guess more importantly, given your inventory strategy and the fact that you ran your fabs a little bit fuller last year, do you think the current results represent your ability to gain some incremental share as some of your peers just are having a harder time supplying customers right now?",124

John, let me take -- you covered a lot of ground with that first question, so let me take some pieces of it. Rafael, if you want to add anything. And if I miss any, John, we'll give you a chance for the follow-up. But the first one, certainly, we've read the same reports and seeing the same releases from our peers on the supply constraints and raising prices. The short answer -- we're doing that, the short answer is no. And I think that, that brings us to one of our foundational competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology, and that really provides two benefits. One is the obvious, which is lower cost, but the second is just greater control of our supply chain. So it's really times like this and really throughout 2020 that, that greater control of your supply chains really becomes a great advantage.",148

I'll just add on the inventory angle of your question, John. Remember, our long-term objective for inventory, as we have talked about in many capital management calls, is to maintain high levels of customer service while we minimize inventory obsolescence. Now part of the reason we can do that is that we are strategically positioned, the way we run the company, our business model and competitive advantages where we -- our parts are mainly catalog parts that sell into industrial and automotive, our focus is on those with very long product life cycle so we can build inventory ahead of demand, we can position that inventory well that served us well in 2020, and will continue to serve us well from a business model standpoint in order to maintain those high levels of customer service with our customers.",139

Rafael, I know you don't specifically guide gross margins, but I was wondering if you could give us some parameters around OpEx for the next couple of quarters. I mean, we're heading into a strong cyclical recovery in revenue off of what was kind of an unusual expense year last year with COVID. And so as we think about the March quarter, can you help us kind of frame the period cost around SG&A and R&D that we should be thinking about? If you want to give us a gross margin target, that would be great but I know you tend to avoid that.",111

On a gross margin, like we have said before, just think of 70% to 75% fall-through. So you figure out what revenue -- incremental revenue you want to play in and just fold that through at 70% to 75%, you get at a good place over the long term, right? Any 1 quarter can be a little higher or lower, right?  
On OpEx, we talked about we can operate between 20% and 25%. The last -- in the last 3 or 4 years, we have been between 21% and 22% pretty much, right? So I don't mean to narrow that range, but that's where we've been running. And I would expect to stay somewhere in that neighborhood for a foreseeable future.",122

Just wanted to follow up on the demand question. I'm curious, even if you are able to supply because of your very strong strategic capacity. Do you think your customers, especially on the automotive side, might be constrained with other parts of the bill of materials that they get from others and maybe those become bottlenecks? I'm just trying to reconcile the very strong demand backdrop that we are hearing from your results and your outlook versus all the news around auto supply chains facing more constraints. What is the true sense of kind of supply and demand across your customer base? It would be very helpful to hear your views.",116

Yes, I think that's a great question. We see the same reports that you're seeing. And I think the best way to maybe describe what we're seeing in the automotive market is just a -- just-in-time supply chain that's restarting from essentially a full stop that happened in second quarter. And just as a reminder, what we saw in third quarter was a 75% sequential increase, followed by this last quarter with a 20% sequential increase. So what I'll say is that those reports are fairly widespread. And -- but we aren't seeing demand signals that would show us that there's anything that's consistent with any of those constraints that you're pointing out or that are in press releases.  
Do you have a follow-on?",126

Good to see the growth in the Embedded segment. And I know you made some changes in that business last year.

I'll give you a few on those ones. So first, we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in Embedded. Our plan has called to first stabilize the business and then start to prove that we can resume long-term consistent growth. We're leveraging our competitive advantages, particularly building a broad base, a more diverse product portfolio that can then deliver long-term sustainable growth. I think it was in second quarter of '20 where we announced -- when we had a restructuring charge related to Embedded and we reallocated resources from some product lines, increased investments some, we decreased, others stayed about the same, and we're seeing the beginning of that stabilization on that front.",114

Yes, I think that when you look at where that business is, I think that we've just come through a -- from cyclical indicators and those types of things. You'd even have to go back to 2018 when the industry had reached a cyclical peak, then you throw in and sprinkle on top COVID-19. And it was really at the beginning of or the end of last year and the beginning of 2020 that we had begun to see signs of stabilization before COVID had hit. 
So inventories really weren't a problem at that point in time, and we had said at that point in time that our shipments were beginning to reflect what customers were beginning to ship overall. So again, I think that what we are shipping today is reflective of what customers are asking us to ship. We have a good availability of product because of the decisions that we've made and our lead times have remained stable. That doesn't mean, of course, that we don't have hotspots that we're working, and we always have hotspots. But that's kind of where we are today.",189

Amidst the strong demand environment, as we all know, foundry capacity is pretty tight, both leading edge and lagging edge. And I know that TI outsources about 20% of its wafer requirements, most of it with your Embedded products, MPUs, MCUs. So because of the foundry tightness, is the team also somewhat constrained on your Embedded products, either Q4 or here in Q1? And also the same thing from an assembly test perspective, where I think about 40% of your assembly and test requirements are outsourced to the subcons? Is this constraining maybe some of your shipments near term?",104

So in the quarter, and thank you for the preamble there, so I won't repeat it. But a year ago, Asia was up, and all of the other regions were either flat or down. And sequentially, all the regions, except for the U.S. were up. And just as another point of color on where we ship our products, 90% of our revenues come from shipments outside of the U.S. and we've got about 20% of our revenues that are based by customers in China. So just a little bit more color on the comment that you made there earlier.",100

But you also have a pretty strong intrinsic value model for the share repo and you'd be pretty good at buying back the stock. So I guess maybe I'll ask you again to just sort of comment on that. Is there anything that we can read into that, given that it's the second quarter in a row?",103

We generated in 2020 $5.5 billion of free cash flow and we generated $6 billion of free cash flow. So clearly, well above the cash flow generation. 
Do you have a follow-up?",61

I guess, can you give us an update on the 300-millimeter, the new fab and sort of the timing around that? And I guess on that, can you qualify for some of these subsidies coming from the government? Or is that mostly going to be leading edge?",57

So the update on the factory is the same as nothing has changed as far as our expectation. The new factory is being built. We expect it to be completed in 2022. So next year. In fact, we should have some level of output in the second half of next year. So that's all going as per plan. When it's fully equipped, it has the potential for revenue of about $5 billion per year. 
On your question on the incentive -- a lot of that remains to be seen. There are 2 legislations, one that was approved but was not funded. Another one hasn't been approved. The chips, I think, is the one that hasn't been approved. But the one that was approved has not been funded. So -- and there's a lot of uncertainties on that depending on how that comes out. So when that comes out, we'll look at it, and we'll decide if it makes sense for us. But the biggest or the highest level, we think semiconductor is a foundational technology and anything that the government can do to strengthen that and to keep us at a level playing field companies in the United States versus other countries that would be a good thing.",210

First question for Rafael. I typically wouldn't ask you this because I know you get a lot of these, but the royalty this quarter was pretty material, $162 million.

So it was about -- inside that $162 million it was more -- most of that $162 million. And we recognize it based on accounting rules. The cash actually comes in not quite like that. It comes in over time. But it's just -- it's a licensing agreement. We've had those for many years. They have become de minimis at the highest level, frankly. So I don't expect that to change. 
From a cash standpoint, it's about $100 million a year. So from the revenue or the income recognition standpoint, sometimes they come in as pops as what you saw, but the cash, which is really what matters, it's more stable than that. And again, like I said, it's about $100 million a year. I don't expect that to change much.",132

Thank you, Dave. So I know your long-term goal is to grow CapEx at 6% or -- to spend 6% of your revenues in CapEx. I think last year, you said it was 4.5%. Were there sort of any COVID-related issues that slowed things down? And as we look at 2021, do you think it will come in close to that range of sort of 6%?",67

So I'll go ahead and take that. So yes, our guidance is 6%. Our guidance continues to be 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue. That's a long-term guidance, includes everything that goes into CapEx as far as building and equipment. Now, of course, that number can fluctuate, right? Like you pointed out, it just fluctuated down in 2020 to 4.5%. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's a little higher than 6% for a year or 2. But for your models, I would suggest you stick with 6% out into the future. It's just -- it's simpler that way and it gets the point across. 
That concludes the call. So let me finish with a few comments on key items that we believe deeply. First, we run the company with the mindset of being a long-term owner. We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Our ambitions and values are integral to how we build TI stronger. When we're successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.",183

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into the first quarter revenue results, with more details than usual by end markets, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into onetime items and our guidance for the second quarter of 2021.  
Starting with a quick overview of first quarter. The company's revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 5% and Embedded Processing grew 7%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 33% and Embedded Processing grew 17%. Our other segment grew 12% from a year ago quarter.  
Moving on, given the current environment, again, this quarter, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market and then some comments on our lead times. First, the industrial market was up about 20% sequentially and up almost 30% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market was about even compared to a very strong fourth quarter 2020 and up about 25% from a year ago. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 levels of fourth quarter '19, our shipments to automotives in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 were up about 25% as we worked to help our automotive customers recover from their supply chain disruptions. Personal electronics was down about 10% sequentially and up about 50% compared to the year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next, communications equipment grew in a high teens sequentially and was about even from the year ago. Enterprise systems grew upper single digits sequentially and was down about 10% from the year ago. Regarding lead times, over 80% of our products have steady lead times and more than 50,000 parts have off-the-shelf availability via ti.com. However, the growing demand in the first quarter of 2021 did expand our list of hotspots, which required extending some lead times. We will continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and the first half of 2022 with additional support from the start-up of our third 300-millimeter wafer fab, RFAB 2, that will come online in the second half of 2022.  
As discussed during our capital management review in February, our competitive advantage of internal manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain which really shows through in a market environment like this. Rafael will now look and review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",559

First quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 29% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $811 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $47 million in the first quarter. Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to 0. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 45% of revenue. Operating profit was up 56% from a year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.8 billion or $1.87 per share, which included a $0.02 net benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit, which was partially offset by about $50 million of utility costs related to the February winter storm in Texas. Most of this expense is in our cost of revenue and reported in our other segment results.  
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $308 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion. In the quarter, we paid $940 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $4.5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. We retired $550 million of debt in the quarter, leaving $6.3 billion of total debt with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $65 million from the prior quarter and days were 114. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.13 billion to $4.47 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be above 14%.  
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",418

I know you have a strategy to build out inventory for customer service. I guess, how do I reconcile that, though with the fact that your inventory dollars are down and you're still getting some pockets of lead time -- of extended lead time. Is that just a function of demand -- the pull that's just so strong you can't keep up? And I guess in that light, how do you parse the quality of those orders that you're getting? How do you know -- are you just -- I mean, are you just shipping whatever is being asked for at this point? And I guess, like what are the plans for loadings in inventories as we go into Q2? Are you going to try to replenish the inventory that's been drained?",140

So thanks for the question, Stacy. So first, let me step back and remind everyone, inventory, our objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize -- well we minimize obsolescence and improve manufacturing utilization. And as you alluded in the question, we would prefer to have higher levels of inventory. In fact, what, 60 days ago at the capital management strategy, we increased the target for inventory to 130 to 190 days, up from 115, 145 prior to that. So yes, we'd like to have more inventory. But in the current environment, we're focusing our capacity on fulfilling demand, not on building inventory. 
Whenever things slow down, which at some point it will, and/or as we increase capacity, which we are increasing capacity incrementally. We have been and we'll continue to do through the balance of this year into the first half of next year. And then in the second half of next year, we'll have a first output from RFAB 2, that as those things come together, then we will be able to build more inventory.

I'm glad you chose that one as a follow-up. I'll just highlight, as you know, we have moved away from distributors over the last couple of years. Really, it's been more of a 10-year process. But in the last few years, more -- we pulled the trigger and actually no longer ship into many distributors that we used to. And now we're going direct with a lot of our customers to the point where we exited last year with almost 2/3 of our revenue shipping direct. That has put us in a great position, particularly in the current environment because we now have more direct access to those customers. We have a better understanding of what they really need. We have -- we don't have that intermediary in between, frankly, clouding things up as, frankly, as the way it happened a lot with the distributors. So then we use that information to better allocate our resources, both inventory, manufacturing, et cetera, in order to fulfill demand from our customers.",170

There's just a lot of moving pieces on that, Craig. I think it's probably premature to try to pick that. Our teams are obviously working very hard with customers to close those demand and fulfill those needs. So it really is just based on technologies and packages and what those customer requirements are. Do you have a follow-on?",59

And then personal electronics, up 50% year-over-year. I know there's been some nice tailwinds from work from home. Any more color in terms of some of the segments that you're seeing growth?

So at a high level, what I'd say, we'll give color by end market if there's something unusual going on. When we look out into a quarter, I can say that there's nothing unusual that we feel the need to call out. When we look back into first quarter and really in the past few quarters in personal electronics, the demand that we've seen there has been very broad-based, both by customer really across the board that we've seen as well as by sectors. And just as a reminder, inside of personal electronics, we'll have things like handsets and tablets and personal computers, including laptops, television, smart speakers, those types of things. So it's a pretty broad category, printers. So it's pretty broad categories. I think there's 9, 10 different sectors that make up personal electronics. So -- and we've seen very strong demand really across all of those.",150

I just want to go back to the question on lead times. And earlier, several people asked about inventory. At the end of the day, things are going to be tied as long as demand is ahead of supply. Things are going to be tight. Lead times are going to be tight. The -- but the key point here is we own our own manufacturing and technology, right? That is a key differentiator versus our competitors. It is one of our competitive advantages. So we are in a strategically -- in a unique strategic position to be able to have that control that inventory, be able to add to that capacity incrementally for the next 1.5 years or so. But then more significantly after that when RFAB 2 is built and it starts to get equipped, so that's a big difference versus our competitors. It really puts us in a much better position to fulfill customers' domain, both short-term and more importantly, over the long haul as we continue to focus on industrial, automotive and all those customers that are in those great spaces.",187

I'm just wondering if this is where you're seeing maybe more of the extended lead times, just given the capacity is tight at your outsourced partners? Or is it spread across both internal and outsourced manufacturers?",72
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2081.0,2259769.0,87626368.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,28,"Yes. It's not specifically there, Harlan. It really is more just based on technology or end market-driven or package types, so we described it as hotspots. So it's kind of the combination of those things when we've got demand that is outstripping the short term supply. But back to Rafael's point, the fact that we do the majority of that assembly test in-house, most of our peers don't do that. Most of our peers have that assembly outside. So even that 60%, 70% is a very large number that we control and do in house. Also because we do 80% of our wafers in-house, we can expand that capacity incrementally. Also, we control the cost to a much higher degree than our peers as well. And those are very important things in times like these. So there's a tremendous advantage on top of the fact that it's 300-millimeter where we're adding capacity, so it's coming in at structurally lower cost in addition to it. So do you have a follow-on?",170

No, thanks for the insights there. So good again to see the year-over-year momentum in the Embedded business. And I know somebody tried to ask a question about this previously. But wondering if you could just -- I know you guys refocused some of the subsegments within embedded last year. Just wondering if you guys could give us a profile of embedded relative to the overall corporate profile? I mean does it have the same end market exposure as the overall business? Or is it more skewed now towards one or particular end markets? And on a go-forward basis, like what end markets within embedded are you spending more R&D dollars?",112

So I think that what the investments that we have in embedded we have directed at the best growth opportunity. So as we took a step back, we wanted to focus them into that direction. They're biased towards industrial and the automotive markets. The largest portion of our revenue are pointed in that -- in those 2 markets as well. We do have a little bit of revenue in communications, enterprise and PE inside of that, but the majority of the revenue is in those 2 markets. So again, as Rafael said, we're in the early stages. Our first objective was to get the revenue stabilized. So we feel very good about the progress that we've made so far. And we're making the investments there because we believe embedded will be a great contributor to free cash flow growth over the long term. So we believe that several years from now, we'll look back and we'll be very pleased with the investments that we've made. We'll be very pleased with the free cash flow growth that embedded will have contributed to the company.",184

But are you seeing that, that customers are looking for commitments to capacity? And then as a result, you're having to change your clauses with the customers in terms of cancellation policy or what have you? Are there any changes on that front?",78

So we don't think that, that's a good idea to go down that path to force customers to tell us what they need a year from now. I don't -- you can demand that they tell you what they need in April or May of 2022, but I can assure you they don't know what they need a year from now. We really want to be in a position where we can supply them what they need and be a supplier that they can count on as well. The competitive advantage of manufacturing technology and owning, controlling that our manufacturing asset also gives us control of our cost there. So we haven't been in a position where we've had to go in and raise prices as many of our other peers have. And we believe that those 2 things combined are translating into share gains, right? So when you look at the revenues in this quarter, we believe part of that is share gains. And I'll quickly also point out that you got to measure that over time. So don't look at or measure it over just 1 quarter. But we do believe that, that will be something that will benefit us for a very long time to come. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?",216

Just quickly on the capacity and the CapEx. So intensity, we should be modeling a different intensity over the next few quarters, correct?

That's about what we've always expected. But now let me answer the first part of your question. As you know very well, you've been following us for a while. We talked about our guide for CapEx as a percent of revenue at about 6%. We did that at the Capital Management Strategy meeting and that's a valid number over the long term. And it's just a model to help you think about our CapEx. But the reality is that in the short term, for 2, 3 years, we're going to run higher than that in absolute terms and also the percent of revenue as we continue to invest both short-term to get ahead of the current situation. But more importantly, longer-term as we continue to strengthen our competitive advantage of having our own manufacturing technology, particularly 300-millimeter that as we talked about, provides such a great structural cost advantage and controlling our own manufacturing supply. They've managed it thoroughly during this pandemic and cycle has proven worthwhile.",174

I know there's some school of thought that because you control your supply chain, and that your model and inventory would sort of drive some share gains and some more upside given what's going on. And I know that you're typically conservative and you have a very tough comp on Q1. But I wonder if maybe customers are not pulling your product because of shortages elsewhere because it just is sitting there in consignment anyway, waiting for them. And I guess the question is, are you hearing that from any of your customers that they're not pulling due to shortages elsewhere? And maybe that's contributing somewhat to your June guidance?",121

First, stepping back, as you alluded to, our goal, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company over the long term. And if you look at our 15, 16-year history on that front, we have been returning all free cash flow and then some of -- to the owners of the company. And we're going to continue doing that over time. Now over time -- over the long term, that means -- that doesn't necessarily mean every quarter, certainly not every quarter, maybe not even every year, right? But over the  long term, we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through both dividends and buybacks and their different criteria that we look at for each of those, and we've talked about that.",140

I'm not sure if I have what you're looking for. But demand continues to be strong. We're still in an environment where demand exceeds supply capacity, right? Now of course, we're -- revenue has continued growing in that environment and both year-on-year, clearly, but also sequentially, right? And we are incrementally adding capacity while we do that. We're also in the -- while we have done that, we have, over this entire cycle, we have focus on making the company stronger, right? So we have -- back if you look at the first phase of this pandemic, back in February or March, when everybody was pulling back, we built through that cycle. 
So that was a tactical decision enabled by our strategic position of our focus on industrial, automotive and catalog parts with low-risk of obsolescence. So we're able to build through that cycle and be prepared for the other stock once the demand started returning pretty quickly as it turned out. We also -- as we did that, we also gained a strategic ground, focusing on auto and industrial. So you've seen how we have grown in those spaces. 
And while we have done that, we have invested for the long term, right? And that's invested in competitive advantage. The most obvious one is manufacturing technology. We already talked playing about that here, but there's also our product portfolio, right? We continue to strengthen the R&D in the best spaces. And then the other one is reach of our channels, which we really haven't talked about today much, but we continue to strengthen that. And maybe the most obvious one is ti.com and everything we're doing there to support our customers with very, very high availability. In fact, immediate availability in a lot of cases with many parts that's inventory there for customers to buy direct from us on ti.com.",318

Thank you. So your operating margin, I think, was just very shy of a record 45.2%. Rafael in the past, you've talked about OpEx kind of being between 20% and 30% of revenue. Now that it's pretty obvious that there's so much demand out there and that it's sustainable, is it safe to say that, that OpEx ratio is going to change going forward and maybe stay at 20%, 25%?",71

So what I'll tell you on that is, in the short term, we run OpEx on a trailing 12-month basis and about $3.2 billion. That's not going to change much in the short term, right, because it doesn't need to, right? We feel very good about those investments. We feel very good about where they're going. They're long-term in nature. Clearly, in R&D, but also part of SG&A is the ti.com example, that's -- where I think of that as an investment, of course, even though it is an SG&A. So I don't see that number in the short-term changing much. But over the long term, over many years, the guidance that we have given you of 20% to 25% still applies, right? So you should still think of it in those terms.",134

So I think that was the last one. So let me go ahead and wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously, at our core we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing in respect to the customers and markets. And I'll also provide details by end market, including some sequential performance, as we have the last few quarters. As sequential data begins to be less insightful, we'll move back to reporting only year-over-year per our normal practice. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, an update of our capacity expansion plans and our guidance for fourth quarter 2021. 
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, driven by demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 2% and Embedded Processing declined 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog revenue grew 24% and Embedded Processing grew 13%. Our Other segment grew 19% from the year ago quarter. 
Now let me comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we're seeing with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in generally as we expected across the product segments, end markets and geographies. Lead times for the majority of our products remained stable, but hotspots continued to exist. However, customers are becoming more selective in their expedite requests, focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior is not specific to any product family, end market or geography. 
Discussions with customers confirm a high-level interest in our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity road map, including 300-millimeter wafer fabs, RFAB 2 and Lehi or what we call LFAB and the associated assembly test expansions. These investments to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage will provide lower costs and greater control of our supply chain. And while there is a growing recognition that the near-term supply-demand imbalance will end at some point, the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to grow. And this requires a robust manufacturing capacity road map for 2025 and beyond. 
Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market. First, the industrial market was down mid-single digits sequentially and up about 40% from a year ago. The changes both sequentially and from the year ago were generally consistent across the diverse set of sectors. The automotive market again grew sequentially and was up more than 20% from the year ago. When comparing to pre-pandemic levels of Q4 2019, revenue is up almost 30%. 
Personal electronics grew low double digits sequentially and was up low double digits compared to a year ago. The strength sequentially and the year ago was due to mobile phones, PC notebooks and tablets. Next, communications equipment was down mid-single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from a year ago. Enterprise systems grew sequentially and from the year ago quarter. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",624

As Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.2 billion or 68% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 360 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $800 million, up 1% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 18% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D. 
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $47 million in the third quarter and will go to 0 beginning in fourth quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $2.3 billion in the quarter or 50% of revenue. Operating profit was up 43% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.9 billion or $2.07 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $486 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $7.1 billion. 
In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 13% effective this month, marking our 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $942 million in dividends and repurchased $139 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $4.2 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 53% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we've issued $1.5 billion of debt in 3 tranches of $500 million each. The first has a coupon of 1.125%, which is due in 5 years; the second at 1.9% due in 10 years; and the last, at 2.7% due in 30 years. This resulted in total debt of $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. 
Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were up $7 million from the prior quarter and days were 112, up 1 day sequentially but still below desired levels. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2.07. The Lehi acquisition closed last Friday, but the costs are not included in our guidance. We will provide those details when we report fourth quarter results. Just as a reminder, the purchase price was about $900 million, and we expect ongoing cost of about $75 million per quarter through 2022. 
We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2021 to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about 13%. As you are looking at your models for 2022, without any changes to tax law, we would expect our annual operating and effective tax rates to remain above what they are this year with a similar quarterly profile of discrete tax benefits that are higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year. 
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. Our investments in our long-term road map for capacity expansion both in LFAB and RFAB 2 are great examples. As a reminder, our CapEx will be higher on an absolute level as well as a percentage of revenue as we strengthen this advantage. We are working through detailed plans of our long-term road map, and we'll have specifics of timing and CapEx spending in our capital management call in February. We continue to believe owning and controlling our supply chain will be of growing strategic importance. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",630

But when you look at the September quarter, I'm just kind of curious, the June quarter came in well above your guidance range. September was well above the midpoint but still within the guidance range. We're hearing of logistical constraints and supply constraints across the economy. I'm kind of curious, when you look at sort of the lower level of upside in the September quarter versus the June quarter, to what extent might have there been supply constraints outside of your control? To what extent do you think it's customers just being more selective about what they're pulling from you? Any color there would be helpful.",121

Yes, I really think it depends on the customers' bill of material. I think that there are supply constraints that are widely reported across different components. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the behavior that we're seeing that's different, our customers are showing up and requesting we have meetings with them rather than showing up with long list of devices that they're asking us to expedite. They're really just shortlists. So they're looking for particular parts that complete those match sets so that they can complete those builds for them. So it is a different behavior that we're seeing this quarter versus the prior quarters. So do you have a follow-on?",120

Just as a follow-on, I know you're going to give us more color about LFAB expenses and RFAB expenses as we get into next year. But I'm wondering if you could just help us set the stage a little bit. Next year is obviously going to be kind of a capacity build-out year for you. And I guess all else being equal, how should we think about the gross margin impact on calendar year '22 as you layer in these investments?",82

I'll take that one. First, as you know, you've known us for a long time, we don't manage the business to gross margins. We manage for the long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that starts with driving the top line. And that's why we're making these investments, right, to support revenue growth, and as we do that, it is extending our low-cost manufacturing advantage that gives us the great structural cost advantage with 300-millimeter. And in addition to that, we're controlling the supply chain. 
And specifically on your question, take RFAB 2, all in, that's about a $6 billion expense. About $1 billion of that is a building which depreciates over 30 years or so. The balance of the rest is equipment, and we're going to be putting in that equipment starting next year and over the coming years.
With LFAB, obviously, a $900 million purchase price. And that -- some of that is building, some of that is equipment. And then on top of that, we'll put about $3 billion of CapEx over a number of years as we ramp that up. So we'll give you additional details on that and the bigger longer-term picture of how we're going to support the longer-term growth. We'll give you those details in February at the capital management call.",221

What I would tell you, our strategy on pricing has not changed. We regularly monitor that, and our goal is to be competitive.

And I guess I'll ask the same question that I've asked the last, I think, 3 calls about share repo. It was pretty low again. I guess is there sort of -- can you help us think through maybe what the triggers might be for you to start to buy back more stock? Is there a target cash level where maybe you'd say that the balance sheet is getting a little bit overcapitalized and you'd start to buy back more stock? I'm just kind of -- obviously, you're not buying back much, but I'm just kind of wondering if you can talk us through what triggers you might be looking for to start that back again.",119

Stepping back and just to remind everybody how we think about returns, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company over the long term, and we do that through dividends and buybacks. If you look at our 18-year history on that, it's really consistent. In fact, we've -- many years -- most years, we've averaged well over 100% of return.
During that time, we have -- I would remind you, we have increased the proportion of the return that comes into dividends. So that also plays into that. But as long as we think the buybacks are accretive to our long-term owners, we're going to have some buybacks. And as you have seen, as you pointed out, in the last 3 quarters, we have -- in fact, I don't think there's been a single quarter in the last 18 years or so that we have not purchased a return cash to the owners through buybacks in one form or another.",168

Finished goods dropped 8% sequentially in Q3, dropped 9% in Q2. They're down 25% from the beginning of this year and down 33% pre-COVID-19, I assume, due to the strong demand profile from your direct customers. So how far below normal are consignment inventories relative to your customers' target levels? And is part of the muted Q4 outlook to replenish these very low inventories? Or does the demand profile backlog and forecast actually reflect a sequential decline here in the fourth quarter?",106
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2476.0,2413241.0,91768185.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,17,"Yes. So I'll start and, Dave, you want to chime in after that. But I think where you're going with that -- let me maybe step back. Yes, obviously, inventory levels are below desired levels, right? We're at 112 days. Our target is 130 to 190 days. So clearly, we're well below where we want to be.
And inside of that, as you pointed out, finished goods -- all finished goods, whether it's in consignment or at our product distribution centers, are the ones that are decreasing most. In fact, even though inventory -- total inventory levels stayed about flat, slightly up second to third quarter, finished goods decreased. And then raw materials increased a little bit to offset that.
So our goal, as soon as capacity increases, if there's an adjustment in demand, we will build those inventory levels back up to be at more healthy levels. And given our business model, it's just a great bet just given the low obsolescence of our inventory, the diversity of positions, diversity of products that we can afford, not only we can afford. It makes sense for us to build that inventory, have it ready for the secular growth that we're confident will happen beyond that.
And I think maybe tactically where you were going on consignment inventory, frankly, those tend to be pretty lean to begin with. That's how that process is designed to just keep a couple of weeks. So I wouldn't expect that by itself to build significantly purely consignment. Where I would expect the build to happen is more at our product distribution centers, and that gives us more flexibility to then ship where the demand is most needed. Dave, do you have...",286

I think just tactically, where we -- whether we keep it in our hubs where we would prefer it or if we push it out to a consignment center, that will just be reflective of our expectation that a customer will pull it. So that's just a tactical decision.
I'd also point out that, as you said, Rafael, we do plan to bring on more capacity incrementally as we have each quarter through this year and through the middle of next year. And in the back half of 2022, RFAB 2 will come online and then that will be followed by LFAB. It's been -- as Rafael pointed out, we did close on that factory on Friday of last week. And so that is on target to come online in early 2023 to support growth in the future.

Yes -- so yes. So we left last year with about 2/3 of our revenue is direct. So we expect that, that percentage will increase over time. We'll provide an update of what we've done with that this year in our February call -- cap management call in February of actually what that looks like. But just to say over time that we do expect that, that will move up slightly over time.
So -- and just the other color with Rafael talking about book-to-bill, as we've got a lot of our revenue on consignment, we've got ti.com, the actual backlog isn't quite as meaningful as what it used to be. So as he said, it's just not a number that we look at or measure or we've talked about in some time. So it isn't quite as helpful as what it used to be.",148

I know you said $75 million in cost impact in the model next year. Those costs don't go away, right? That $75 million a quarter is people, correct? And does it include depreciation or anything else or is it just people, does it? Like how do you think about that, like what that incremental cost long term?",70

Good direct question. So yes, that $75 million is mainly people and direct costs, not depreciation. Depreciation will not start until about first quarter '23 when we start production, just the way the rules work on that front.
And that $75 million, we're still working through the details, but we currently believe that the most likely scenario is that most of that cost will go to the restructuring charges/other line until we start production, right? And then at that point, the majority of the cost would go to the COR line.
Now the costs actually do increase over time as we increase production, right? But I think where you're going is that as that happens and those costs are then absorbed by revenue, right? Now how quickly those are absorbed beyond utilization, underutilization, et cetera, that just depends how quickly we ramp that factory, right? Clearly, at the beginning, there won't be 100% absorption, and we'll get to that at some point.
But we'll -- we're not going to -- that's in 2023. So we'll get to that at some point to give you some details. And in February, at the capital management call, I think we'll frame it kind of the bigger picture of that, along with our other CapEx investment, and you get a better sense of how that's going to play out.",228

It was the smallest beat to your original revenue guidance you guys have had in a year, and I realize that it's been exceedingly volatile in the last year. But I wondered, was that the demand profile changing from those investors, that selectivity changing that you're talking about?

No, that's okay. Certainly, if any investors want to buy semiconductors from us, we'll be happy to sell them, but yes. So I'd just say that overall, the quarter came in as we expected it to, right? And that's a statement, as we said in the prepared remarks and when you looked across geographies and products and product groups and end markets, those types of cuts -- so there wasn't like one area that was underperformed or outperformed what we were expecting.
But again, the main thing of what was different this quarter versus last quarter was really where customers were coming in and requesting expedites and upsides from us, and those upsides were much, much more narrow and focused just on a few products. So that was really what the difference was. If you're looking for what was different this quarter versus last quarter and those types of things, that's what I would point to, to say what's changed in the last 90 days.",166

It's always a combination of both. And we will and continue to add incremental capacity as we have planned for some time. And certainly, as we go out in time, as we get the bigger tranches of capacity coming on with RFAB 2 and then LFAB, we'll be able to make more progress on that front.
And at some point, we know that things will change from a demand standpoint. And so we don't spend time trying to predict that, but we'll be ready for it. We know what we'll want to do. And as Rafael talked about, one of the top things there is we'll want to rebuild inventory to prepare for the next time that the demand strengthens. So we have a long list of things that we're doing to invest in the company to make it stronger. So we won't control the timing of that, but we'll be ready for them for sure.",168

Frankly, we'll probably end up being at the higher end of that range just because we're still so good about the business model and how good that inventory will be and how it sets us up for the next upturn on the other side given the long-lived nature of that inventory.",124

Are customers not ordering as much from you because they don't have enough from you on the component side? Or they don't have enough from others that they need to complete their bill of materials?,44

There is -- there are instances of both of those. And sometimes, it's not even semiconductors, right? It may be other components that they may be missing. So yes, it's a combination of those things.

Could you talk specifically to the automotive market? This year, it's clear the production has not been that strong, but auto semiconductor sales have been pretty strong. So as it applies to TI, what do you think has been kind of the interplay between content and mix? Or do you think that there is perhaps inventory stuck in the automotive supply chain somewhere that we should watch out for?",70
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2476.0,2413241.0,91768216.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,48,"Yes. I'll comment on automotive. I think I'll even extend it into industrial. And those are 2 markets that we have long talked about that we believe that there is content growth in those markets' content per system that's easy to see in cars and well reported on. I know, Vivek, in your reports that you've reported on that content growth. You can see it in automotive. It's happening in industrial across 13 different sectors, so harder to see.
And we invest in all the markets, but we have a strategic focus on automotive and industrial. So you're beginning to see some of the benefits of those -- that strategic bias that we have, our channel advantages, the breadth of our products, advantages in those markets as well. So there's components of that.
But that said, any time that we have supply shortages in the industry, customer behavior is always very consistent, and that behavior is that they will want to build inventory to protect themselves. So whether they've already begun that or have already done that, they certainly will want to do that. And at some point, they'll have too much product, and that's what creates the cycles in our industry.
So it won't surprise us if the cycle comes to an end at some point. We'll be prepared for that, and we'll know what we'll want to do at that point. So thank you for those questions.",239

Is there any particular pattern that's driving which products you have in short supply? I mean it seems like we see it most in areas like enterprise and some of the personal electronics, higher-volume stuff. Is that something that you guys would agree with? And do you think -- is it -- is there more foundry versus internal fabs? Like is there anything in particular driving those hotspots?",77

I wouldn't put it down on any one thing, Joe. Certainly, there's reports of the tightness across foundry. So obviously, we see that as well. So there's tightness in some lead frames. So we see that as well. Other input raw materials, mold compounds -- we have testers, in some cases, some process technologies, some particular products themselves that have a large number of customers. So -- and those hotspots move around as our operations teams will sometimes move capacity from one area to the other. So they're not always consistent or persistent. Sometimes they are, but sometimes they're not. And there's things that we can do to mitigate those or actually completely alleviate them.
So -- and that's why as we describe them, it's not just one particular product area or one particular product set that -- or even one particular market, or even -- I'd say, even one particular customer that would be impacted by that, that you may see.",163

Dave mentioned the foundries. Only about 20% of our wafers are -- come from foundries. The vast majority, 80% and growing with our investments in 300-millimeter, are internal wafers and that just gives us a much better control of our destiny and for all the reasons Dave mentioned and then the low-cost structure or low cost that we get with 300-millimeter.",69

So I'll take that, Chris. And Chris, you know us very well. You follow us for a long time. You know we do not manage to free cash flow margin percent, right?

And to your point, there are some headwinds on that with the CapEx that we're talking about to set up the company well for the future.

And yes, that should grow over time as we continue to add these wafer fabs that we're talking about, all in 300-millimeter, which with -- the efficiency of the 300-millimeter is huge, right, because a 300-millimeter wafer accounts for almost 2.3x a 200-millimeter wafer.

And as a follow-up, and I don't want to steal your thunder from February, but in the past, you talked about capacity of $22 billion.

No, so great question. Thanks for the setup for February. We will talk about that in February. So until then, what I would tell you is you've heard us talk about DMOS6 and RFAB 1. Roughly, that's a potential of about $8 billion of annual revenue on 300-millimeter than RFAB 2. And this is all dependent -- highly dependent on mix, right? So these are not exact numbers. But RFAB 2 -- with that caveat, RFAB 2 should add another $5 billion of annual revenue, again, when it's fully priced, and obviously, not on day 1. And Lehi should add $3 billion to $4 billion of annual revenue. So we're thinking in terms of that and we're thinking even beyond that, right? Because as we look at the company's potential for growth into the next 10 and 15 years, then we're not stopping just thinking in the next 4 or 5 years. We're thinking 10, 15 years.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into onetime items and our guidance for the third quarter of 2021. 
Starting with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially and 41% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 6% and Embedded Processing grew 2%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 42% and Embedded grew 43%. Our Other segment grew 30% from the year ago quarter. 
Moving on. Given the current environment, again this quarter, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market and comment on our lead times. First, the industrial market was up mid-teens sequentially and up about 40% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market grew sequentially following the strong first quarter 2021 and more than doubled from a weak year ago compare. Personal electronics was about even sequentially and up about 25% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next, communications equipment was up low single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from the year ago. Enterprise Systems grew upper teens sequentially and was about even from the year ago. 
Regarding lead times, the majority of our products continue to remain steady. However, the growing demand in the second quarter of 2021 again expanded our list of hot spots, which required extending some lead times. As planned, we continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and first half of 2022, with additional support from the start-up of our third 300-millimeter wafer fab, our Fab 2, that will come online in the second half of 2022. 
As discussed during our capital management review in February, our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain, which really shows through in a market environment like this. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",504

As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, up 41% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion or 67% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $816 million, up 5% from a year ago and about as expected. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 19% of revenue. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $48 million in the second quarter and are related to the National Semiconductor acquisition. This acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to 0. 
Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter or 48% of revenue. Operating profit was up 80% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.9 billion or $2.05 per share, which included a $0.06 benefit that was not in our prior outlook due to the signing of our royalty agreement. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion. In the quarter, we paid $942 million in dividends and repurchased $146 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $3.9 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $7.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. 
Regarding inventory. TI inventory dollars were down $34 million from the prior quarter, and days were 111, which are below desired levels. In the second quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire Micron's 300-millimeter fab in Lehi, Utah. This investment continued to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology and is part of our long-term capacity planning. The Lehi fab will be our fourth 300-millimeter fab joining Demo 6, RFAB 1 and soon-to-be-completed RFAB 2 in our wafer fab manufacturing operations. We continue to believe that our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology will be of growing importance in owning and controlling our supply chain. 
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.76 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $2.13. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14%.

And I mean, like between 5% to 13% above your original outlook, and that's just making it very hard to distinguish right between how to read your guidance because even now, you're guiding to a flattish outlook in what's supposed to be a seasonally stronger quarter. Should we take that to be conservatism? Should we take that to be a peaking in the cycle?  
And how is it that the demand is so strong? You're increasing supply, but yet your sales outlook is very flattish. I think it's a very confusing message, and I would love your insights into how to interpret your guidance. Are we reading them in the right way?",133

Thanks for the question. I think, first, I'd say perhaps normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things in periods like this. Certainly, the last few quarters, we would all agree have been unusual periods that we've gone through and as we continue to move through. So -- and as you said, the last few quarters have been exceptionally strong. Second quarter was certainly strong, both sequentially and year-on-year. So if you look at our guidance, it would suggest that next quarter will again be a very strong quarter. So -- and as you know, our guidance is the best estimate that we have at this time. So that's what we try to do and try to give you that insight. Do you have a follow-on?",133

So from what you said, I assume that you're again implying conservatism unless you suggest otherwise. But my real question is, when I look at the share buyback activity, it's been very low the last few quarters. And there are only a few reasons why that would be, right? One is the simplest reason that maybe the stock is perhaps not attractive at these valuations. Or it could be that you're preparing for some M&A. Or is it some large CapEx. Or some caution about macro. 
I'm trying to understand why is there such a material shift in terms of your return of free cash flow strategy, right? We understand the dividend part has been very strong, but the share buyback activity has been very low over the last -- almost a year now. So I would just appreciate your views as to why you are not buying back your stock at the pace at which you have historically done so.",162

So first, let me take you back to how we think about cash return, and you know us very well, you follow us for many years. And you've heard us talk about this in capital management year in and year out. And our objective when it comes to cash return is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through dividends as well as buybacks. 
Now that has never meant and doesn't mean that every single quarter or even every single year, where that return is going to be exactly 100%, right? If you look at our history over 15-plus years, it has been actually above 100%. So that shows our commitment to that, and that commitment has not changed.

So in terms of gross margins, I realize you guys don't run the business management business for gross margins. But clearly, you had a very, very strong quarter in Q2. And I know you don't guide gross margins going forward, but based on how you're thinking about utilization rates in your factories, given what you know about pricing in your business, both on the Analog side as well as the embedded side going forward, how are you thinking about gross margins and kind of the OpEx leverage going forward in your business?",93

No. So first, let me emphasize the point you made. We do not focus on gross margins and how we run the business. Just like you said, our focus is on free cash flow generation. In fact, free cash flow per share and how we can grow that over the long term, right? Because we think ultimately, that is what drives value to the owners of the company. And you can do that at 67% margin. You can do it at a lower margin. You can do it a higher margin. It depends on a number of factors. 
So -- and then to answer your specific question. As we have always guided over the long term, not any 1 quarter or even any 1 year, but over the long term, 70% to 75% fall through is the right way to -- generally speaking, the right way to look at -- to model the company as we go forward. So as you put whatever revenue expectation you have there and fall that through at about that rate, and you'll be in the ballpark.",183

And you were at 65.2. Obviously, you did very strongly this quarter, but you said you had $0.06 of royalties that was unexpected. That should have been about 1.4 points of gross margin, as I understand it, if I do the math right. 
And I think you had something like $50 million in Austin cost last quarter that should have rolled off this quarter. That would have been another 100 basis points, give or take. So I'm actually wondering why gross margins were -- if I take out the royalties, they would have been up 60 basis points only with 100 basis points of costs that should have rolled off with a massive revenue increase. Like what's going on with -- what happened with gross margins in the current quarter given all of that?",158

That's the part I did it. Okay. So you were assuming royalty. All right. Okay, so let me address that first. We talk about royalty. It used to be in revenue and gross margin, but that was years ago. I think 3 or 4 years ago, we -- yes, we moved that to other income and expense. So that is in that line, other income expense. So it has nothing to do with margins, it has been for 3 or 4 years or so since we -- and the reason we moved that is very de minimis, it's a relatively small amount. It averages about $100 million a year. Of course, in the big scheme of things, given our revenue level is a relatively small amount, and we expect that to be -- continue to be small going forward. 
On the other part of your question, so last quarter, we had about a $50 million hit to gross margins. That was because of the winter storm in Texas. We did talk about that during the call. We mentioned it, and that was all in gross margin. So yes, you can adjust that, you can adjust however you wish for fourth quarter to get you the gross margin without that impact, right? And that may make more sense when you look at the trends. Does that answer your question?",229

You're guiding revenues flat and you're guiding EPS down slightly. So either gross margins are going down or OpEx is going up or -- I mean normally, OpEx, I think seasonally into Q3 would be down a few points. I guess, on those, are you expecting any sort of different OpEx trends into Q3 as you would normally see like in the normal Q3? Is there something else going on? Because normally, it's down a few points sequentially.",83

Well, so the reason that EPS is moving at the midpoint is the royalty that we just talked about, right? So you just take out that $0.06 from the EPS that we just delivered, you get to a more normalized EPS without that royalty and then compare that to the next quarter. And you'll see that there's nothing unusual there. Obviously, we only gave revenue and EPS range. But if there was something unusual in between the lines, we would point it out, and there's nothing unusual.",88

Sort of flat at the midpoint with down sequentially. I guess I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that your deficiencies kind of increased in the June quarter. You said your hotspots went up. It sounds like demand is still relatively strong, and yet there's a part of your guidance that could be down sequentially, which I'm having a hard time grasping.
Dave, maybe you can talk about end markets. Are there any end markets that particularly look like they're cooling off sequentially into the calendar third quarter? Or why is that down sequentially? I think I have to go back to quite a bit of time to see you guys have a flat to down sequential Q3.",134

So yes, John, if there's something that's unusual going on within an end market or region or product area, we've always provided insight into that to help understand an outlook or even something that's happened in a current quarter. I'll just say that there's nothing unusual like that, that we feel that we would need to explain what's going on. I think that as I mentioned earlier to Vivek's question on the topic, seasonality probably isn't the best thing to be looking at as we've been moving through the last few quarters. And I would say, with that range implies that the revenue still -- will still be strong. So do you have a follow-on?",131

Just as my follow-on. On RFAB 2, I'm just curious with the proposed purchase of Lehi, should we think about sort of the building going on as planned, the pilot line going on as planned but capacity at RFAB 2 kind of slowed? Or how do we think about kind of now your mix of capacity as Lehi comes in next year and what that means for CapEx and the ramp of RFAB 2?",75

No, let me tell you about that. So first, let me step back, remind everyone objective when it comes to CapEx is to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth. And specifically extending our low-cost manufacturing advantage primarily 300-millimeter, right? So we have talked about that for a long time and it's a core part of our strategy, one of our competitive advantages having that manufacturing and technology advantage. RFAB 2 will be the third 300-millimeter factory. Lehi will be our fourth 300-millimeter factory. RFAB 2 will become operational sometime in the middle of next year. That's when the shell will be completed, and then we'll be deploying equipment there. And then we incurring CapEx because of that. So CapEx, as I said at the last call, will be higher, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue because of that.
And then on top of that, add Lehi, right, which we didn't have last quarter when we had talked -- when we had the earnings call. So now Lehi is going to be on top of that. That's a $900 million purchase price, which will run to CapEx. But then in addition to that factory, it's ready for production once we qualify but at relatively low volumes, right? We still have to add CapEx to that factory to take it to the volumes that we want, and that will happen over time. And think of that CapEx is probably going to be -- it's probably going to run about half of what RFAB 2 CapEx will run. I'm talking over years, right, as we deploy equipment there. And both of those will add to the strength -- or will strengthen our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology with 2 more 300-millimeter factories.",298

And certainly, I know there's lots of speculations on how long the strong demand will last. And certainly, we've read the ranges that it's going to end soon and others that say is going to continue for quite some time. And obviously, as you stated, we're not going to forecast the fourth quarter or even comment on how long the cycle lasts because, honestly, as you know, we don't know. I don't think anyone knows.
But I think we can frame how the actions that we've taken and our approach as we've gone through the cycle. And in the first phase, you've seen us accelerate into the widely anticipated decline. And that really enabled us to gain ground. And really, in the second phase, we're working to ensure that we gain strategic ground, particularly in industrial and automotive. And that -- those gains will reward us for years to come. And independent of that, we're investing for the long term. So some of the obvious things that you can see are the new manufacturing investments in RFAB 2. If you're down here in Texas, you'll see cranes up over the building. I think I counted 6 or 7 at the max that were up over that, the addition of Lehi. Some of the less visible ones are the R&D investments and new capabilities at ti.com, and those investments are continuing.
So we won't -- we'll go through cycles. We won't be able to predict it, but we can make the place stronger, we can continue to invest in our competitive advantages. So do you have a follow-on?",269

But inventory levels, first, let me remind everyone the objective there, maintain high levels of customer satisfaction while minimizing obsolescence, which, frankly, is not an issue given our business model. We are clearly below this higher levels, just like we said during the prepared remarks, right? We're running about 111 days and our target is 130 to 190 days. That's part of the reason why we have the hotspots that we talked about. At the same time, I tell you, we go back to second quarter last year, when the pandemic was starting, in fact, March of last year.
Everybody, all our competitors were decreasing their inventory levels, slowing down factories. We went the other way, right? We maintained, and in fact, increase our production levels. We increased our inventory levels. They went from about 140 days to 160, some 170 days almost. And that, along with our business strategy, our business model helped put us in a great position to take advantage of the situation and has helped us do significantly better than our competitors over the last 3 or 4 quarters, right?
But we have gotten to a point where, yes, things are -- inventory is now below these higher levels. We'll continue to add incremental capacity as we have talked about, that is in all of our factories, but especially RFAB 1. But the next bigger tranche of capacity will come in with RFAB 2, as we talked about earlier. Once that is operational sometime in second quarter of next year, then -- well, that's when we finish and will produce revenue sometime in the second half of next year, then that will add a significant amount of capacity. And then shortly after that, Lehi will also come in line for additional revenue capacity there.",308

Both RFAB 2 and Lehi, those are long-term plays, right? These are -- this is to strengthen our manufacturing advantage, owning our own manufacturing, which clearly has proven over the last 1.5 years, we knew that already, but it has proven that -- how important that is in the current environment. In the current environment, they're going to happen to help in the medium term, most likely. But if they don't, if things slow down and it doesn't work out that way, that is completely fine with us.

But it has lagged -- sorry for the background noise, it always happens when I'm on a conference call. If I look at the trailing 12 months and then -- so that's in line with what you have said consistently. But should we expect this to come back to the double digit on an annualized basis? What's the right way to think about the lag over the last 2 years? And how should we think about it going forward?",150

This is one -- most financial metrics are this way too, but you want to look at this over the long term, right? Any one quarter or even any one year, they could be a little choppy. You mentioned a couple of years when 2019 and even 2020, where that trajectory does not represent the longer term. And arguably, the same thing for 2021, right, or the trailing 12-month number that you just quoted, right? So you want to look at this over the long term. And that's how we look at it, and that's what's going to ultimately drive value for the owners of the company, right?",109

With all the tightness and contrast this -- the way you guys have managed the business, and these shares should probably don't show up that quickly because these designs are such long-lasting and they don't change at a time. Are you seeing any discernible change in your design in activity as a result of what we've seen from your peers with the tightness and you managing your lead times and inventory much better than some of your peers?",81

I would say that, as you know, Ambrish, we have started on the journey to have closer direct relationships with customers really 8 -- 7, 8 years ago with our investments in ti.com, investments in our sales applications teams, investments in processes and how we do business and just our structure inside of the company.
And last year, you saw a pretty major step of taking more customers direct and operating with fewer distributors as well as transacting business through ti.com. So you kind of mix that together with the pandemic and our ability to do virtual sales calls, I think all those things have positioned us well strategically, especially in markets like industrial, automotive, those markets where we want to gain that strategic ground. You couple that with availability. And like you say, things don't move quickly. But the supply shortages really started showing up in the beginning of 2020, took a break in the first or second quarter when the pandemic hit and then reaccelerated after that.
So there are cases that are unusual, but there are cases where customers redesign boards just because of availability. I'll describe that as an outlier, but we do see cases of that. But we see more cases where you have designs that are being intersected as they come through. And again, our sales teams are engaged from production all the way back into engineering. That visibility is a great strategic advantage. And those benefits, again, will be things that will pay rewards for us for a long time to come. Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. And I think we've got time for one last caller.",284

My question is on the auto revenue. So if we look at the headlines and talk to the folks in the auto supply chain, there's still a lot of shortages, et cetera, et cetera, out there. And I think your revenue is only slightly up. So can you just explain the discrepancy? It seems like it would be up a little bit more than that, if there's all these folks clamoring for parts out there.",100

So it's a little bit more than up a little bit. And I think you're pointing to the sequential. But again, last quarter, it was up over 25% from pre-pandemic levels. I think we're shipping 25% more cars from pre-pandemic levels, right? So our shipments into automotive are up, and up significantly. And we continue to add capacity and continue to -- we believe we're gaining share there as well. You got to measure it over time. But yes, so we are -- our shipments are up there and up strong. So do you have a follow-on?",109

Just, I guess, a hotspot question. So you said that you're seeing a few more hotspots last quarter. Do you think that the situation gets a little bit worse this quarter? Or do you think it gets better? When do you guys think you'll start to get a handle on all these sort of supply issues out there, I guess?",61

We are -- on the supply side, as we said, we are adding capacity incrementally. We have been and we'll continue to do that. The bigger tranche of capacity doesn't come in until about a year from now, right, as we just talked about with RFAB 2. And then 6 months later with Lehi. So it will be a while before we have big tranches of capacity coming online. So it's going to depend on demand.
At the end of the day, we don't fully control that. It's more of a macro situation. But we are better prepared than our peers and have been in both the tactical decisions we have made during the pandemic but more importantly, our business model and how we run the company, specifically owning our own manufacturing that has been key in this whole process. And we're just really doubling down on that with what we're doing with all those factories that we just talked about.",169

I'll go ahead and wrap up. So let me just emphasize what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.
While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening.",134
