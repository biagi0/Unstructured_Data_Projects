In our fiscal Q1 2024, consolidated net revenue was $12 billion, up 34% year-on-year as revenue included 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Excluding VMware, consolidated revenue was up 11% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 4% year-on-year to $7.4 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 153% year-on-year to $4.6 billion.
With respect to infrastructure software, revenue contribution from consolidating VMware drove a sequential jump in revenue by 132%. We expect continued strong bookings at VMware will accelerate revenue growth through the rest of fiscal 2024. In semiconductors, AI revenue quadrupled year-on-year to $2.3 billion during the quarter, more than offsetting the current cyclical slowdown in enterprise and telcos.
Now let me give you more color on our 2 reporting segments, starting with software. Q1 software segment revenue of $4.6 billion was up 156% year-on-year and included $2.1 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. Consolidated bookings in software grew sequentially from less than $600 million to $1.8 billion in Q1 and is expected to grow to over $3 billion in Q2. Revenue from VMware will grow double-digit percentage sequentially quarter-over-quarter through the rest of the fiscal year.
This is simply a result of our strategy with VMware. We are focused on upselling customers, particularly those who are already running their compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools to upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation, otherwise branded as VCF. VCF is the complete software stack integrating compute, storage and networking that virtualizes and modernizes our customers' data centers. This on-prem self-service cloud platform provides our customers a complement and an alternative to public cloud.
And in fact, on VM Explore last August, VMware and NVIDIA entered into a partnership called VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This allows customers to deploy their AI models on-prem and wherever they do business without having to compromise on privacy and data -- in control of their data. And we are seeing this capability drive strong demand for VCF, from enterprises seeking to run their growing AI workloads on-prem. And reflecting all these factors, for the full year, we reiterate our fiscal 2024 guidance for software revenue of $20 billion.
Turning to semiconductors. Before I give you an overall assessment of this segment, let me provide more color by end markets. Q1 networking revenue of $3.3 billion grew 46% year-on-year, representing 45% of our semiconductor revenue. This was largely driven by strong demand for our custom AI accelerators at our 2 hyperscale customers.
This strength extends beyond AI accelerators. Our latest generation Tomahawk 5 800G switches, Thor 2 Ethernet NICs refinements, DSPs and optical components are experiencing strong demand at hyperscale customers as well as large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers. For fiscal 2024, given continued strength of AI NAND working demand, we now expect networking revenue to grow over 35% year-on-year compared to our prior guidance for 30% annual growth.
Moving on to wireless. Q1 wireless revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially and declined 4% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. As you all may know, the engagement with a North American customer continues to be very deep, strategic and of course, multiyear. And in fiscal 2024, helped by content increases, we reiterate our previous guidance for wireless revenue to be flat year-on-year. 
Next, our Q1 server storage connectivity revenue was $887 million or 12% of semiconductor revenue, down 29% year-on-year. We are seeing weaker demand in the first half but expect recovery in the second half. Accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24 server storage revenue to decline in the mid-20 percentage range year-on-year compared to prior guidance for high teens percent decline year-on-year.
On broadband, Q1 revenue declined 23% year-on-year to $940 million and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. We are seeing a cyclical trough this year for broadband as telco spending continues to weaken and do not expect improvement until late in the year. And accordingly, we're revising our outlook for fiscal '24 broadband revenue to be down 30% year-on-year from our prior guidance of down mid-teens year-on-year. And finally, Q1 industrial resales of $215 million declined 6% year-on-year. In fiscal '24, we continue to expand industrial resales to be down high single digits year upon year. And in summary, with stronger-than-expected growth from AI more than offsetting the cyclical weakness in broadband and server storage, Q1 semiconductor revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $7.4 billion.
Turning to fiscal '24. We reiterate our guidance for semiconductor solutions revenue to be up mid- to high single-digit percentage year-on-year. I know we told you in December, our revenue from AI would be 25% of our full year semiconductor revenue. We now expect revenue from AI to be much stronger, representing some 35% of semiconductor revenue at over $10 billion, and this more than offset weaker-than-expected demand in broadband and service storage.
So for fiscal 2024. In summary, we reiterate our guidance for consolidated revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth. And we reiterate our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of 60%.
Before I turn this call over to Kirsten, who will provide more details of our financial performance this quarter, let me just highlight that Broadcom recently published its fourth annual ESG report available on a corporate citizenship side, which discusses the company's sustainability initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognize Broadcom's responsibility to connect our customers, employees and communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain committed to this mission.

25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Mar 07, 2024",2024-03-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3394.0,3055770.0,111203494.0,Presenter Speech,Kirsten Spears,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, which was a 14-week quarter and included 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12 billion for the quarter, up 34% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q1 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 75.4% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.2 billion and R&D was $1.4 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the contribution from VMware.
Q1 operating income, including VMware, was $6.8 billion and was up 26% from a year ago, with operating margin at 57% of revenue. Excluding transition costs of $226 million in Q1, operating profit of $7.1 billion was up 30% from a year ago, with operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.2 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation.
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semiconductor. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.4 billion and represented 62% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 4% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 190 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses increased 8% year-on-year to $865 million, reflecting a 14-week quarter resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%.
Now moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $4.6 billion, up 153% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 38% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 59%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%.
Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 39% of revenues off a higher revenue base. Excluding restructuring and integration spend of $658 million free cash flows were 45% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures.
Days sales outstanding were 41 days in the first quarter compared to 31 days in the fourth quarter on higher accounts receivable due to the VMware acquisition. The accounts receivable we brought on from VMware has payment terms of 60 days unlike Broadcom standard 30 days. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 1% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. 
We ended the first quarter with $11.9 billion of cash and $75.9 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.5% and 8.4 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $30 billion in floating rate debt is 6.6% and 3 years, respectively. 
During the quarter, we repaid $934 million of fixed rate debt that came due. This week, we repaid $2 billion of our floating rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $5.25 per share we executed on our plan to complete our remaining share buyback authorization. We repurchased $7.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $1.1 billion of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 7.7 million AVGO shares.
To help you with modeling share count, the weighted effect of the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition resulted in a sequential increase in Q1 to $478 million, with the Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count expected to increase to approximately $492 million as the shares issued are fully weighted in the second quarter.
Now on to guidance. Regardless of the updated dynamics of our semiconductor and software segments Hock discussed, we choose to reiterate our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue of $50 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 60%. With regard to VMware, in February, we signed a definitive agreement to divest the end-user computing division with the transaction expected to close in 2024 and subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
The EUC division has been classified as discontinued operations in our Q1 financials. We have decided to retain the Carbon Black business and merge Carbon Black with Symantec to form the enterprise security group. The impact on revenue and profitability is not significant. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",764

This has been very successful so far. And I agree. It's early innings still at this point. We just have closed on the deal -- well, we closed on the deal late November, and we are now March, early March.

Or do you think that this is kind of a very project-driven number, so it's not really supply that gets it? So if you were to get, let's say, increased supply, could there be upside? And then kind of part B of that is on the switching side. Have you already started to see benefits from the 51 terabit per second switches? Is that something that comes along later?

No, our Tomahawk 5 is going great guns. Now it's not driven unlike in the past, Tomahawk 3, Tomahawk 4, by traditional scale-out in hyperscalers on your cloud environment. This is all largely coming from a scaling out of AI data centers, the building of larger and larger clusters to enable generative AI computing functionality, and you're going for bigger and bigger pipes. Hence, the Tomahawk 5 51 terabit is a perfect solution, and we're seeing a lot of demand. And in many cases, we are -- basically, they are surpassing the rate of adoption that we had previously thought. So it is a very good solution in connecting GPUs.
And with respect to AI accelerators, where I think you are focusing on, is that a constraint on supply chain? We do get enough lead time out of our hyperscale customers that we do not have a supply chain constraint.",151

I guess do I have my math right? And if so, like how can that be? What's going on in the core business?

So VMware is still running at like an $11 billion to $12 billion run rate benefit, so that sounds like that should accelerate.

It's like 3 months -- about 3 months. But yes, it's what -- and it seems to be -- that seems to be -- work out, but things seem to be progressing very well as we had hoped it would because where we are focusing our go to market -- and more than go to market, where we are focusing our resources on don't just go to market but on engineering a very improved VCF stack, which we have and selling it out there and being able to then support it and in the process get -- help customers deploy and start to really make it stand up in your data centers, all that focus is on the largest, I would say, 2,000 strategic customers.
These are guys who want to still have significant distributed data center on-prem. Many of our customers is looking at a hybrid situation. Not trying to use the word here too loosely. Basically, a lot of these customers had some very legacy but critical mainframe. That's an old platform not growing, except it's still vital.
Then what they have in modernizing workloads today and in the future is they really have a choice, which they are taking both angles, of running a lot of applications in data centers on-prem, distributed data centers on-prem, which can handle these modernized workloads while at the same time to -- because of elastic demand, to be able to also put some of these applications into public cloud.
Today's environment, most of these customers do not have an on-prem data center that resembles what's in the cloud, which is very high availability, very low latency, highly resilient, which is one we are offering with VMware Cloud Foundation or VCF, is exactly replicate what they get in a public cloud.

Love it because let -- perhaps let me try to perhaps give you a sense how we think of the AI market, the new generative AI market, so to speak, using it very loosely and generically as well. It's really -- we see it as 2 broad segments. One segment is hyperscalers, especially very large hyperscalers with huge, huge consumer subscriber base. You probably can guess who this few people are, very large subscriber base and very -- an almost infinite amount of data.
And their model is getting subscribers to keep using this platform they have and through that, be able to generate a better experience for not only the subscribers but a better advertising opportunity for their advertising clients. It's a great ROI as we are seeing ROI that comes very quickly. And the investment continues vigorously with those -- with that segment comprising very few players but with a huge subscriber base, but with the scale to invest a lot.
And here, ASICs, custom silicon, custom AI accelerators makes plenty of sense and that's where we focus that attention on. They also buy, as a scale out, those AI accelerators, through clusters, increasing large clusters because of the way the models are running, the foundation models run, and large language models need to generate those parameters. They buy a lot of networking together with it but in comparison, obviously, to the value of AI accelerators we sell. Now the network working side, while growing, it's small percentage compared to the size, the value of the accelerators. That's one big segment we have. 
The other segment we have, which is smaller, is the enterprise, what I broadly call enterprise segment in AI. Here, you're talking about companies, large, not so large but large who wants to do -- who have AI initiatives going on. All these big news and hype about AI being the savior to productivity and all that gets all these companies on multiple -- on their own initiatives. And here, short of going to public cloud, they're trying to run it on-prem. If they try to run it on-prem, they take standard silicon for AI accelerators as much as possible.
And here, in terms of the AI accelerator, we don't have a market. That's the merchant silicon market. But in the networking side as they tie it together with their data centers, they do buy all those are -- our networking components beginning with switches, routers even through people like Arista 7800 but switches for sure, and the various other components I mentioned. And that's a different sense market that we have. So it's an interesting mix, and we see both.",451

So our checks suggest that you're vertically integrating there. You're now putting in your own drivers, TIAs. You're starting to get traction in PAM-4 DSP. And I think you kind of had an early lead in 100-gig data center lasers as well. And this is -- a lot of this should be on the back of AI networking that appears to be exploding here. So I was wondering if you could help us size the market and then also talk about how fast this is growing for you. I think there may have been some clues in that 1/3 number the AI you gave us, but perhaps if you can kind of double click or square that for us, it would be great.",131

Before you get carried away, please, those in the other categories outside AI accelerators, all those things like PAM-4 DSPs, optical components, retimers, they are small compared to Tomahawk switches and Jericho routers using AI networks. And also being in an environment where, as you all know, traditional enterprise networking is kind of also in a bit of a slowdown [ law ]. So always think it's demand driven very much by AI. And that tends to push us in a line of thinking that could be very biased because what it is showing is that the mix and the content on networking relative to compute is very skewed, very different from -- in an AI data center compared to a traditional CPU-based data center.
So I don't want to get you guys all in the wrong way. But you're right, in the AI data center, there's a lot of -- there's quite a bit of content on DSPs, PAM-4s, optical components and retimers and PCI Express switches. But they are still not that big in overall scheme of things compared to what we sell in switches and routers. And compared to AI accelerators, they are even small. Think in that ratio. 
As I said, AI revenue of $10 billion plus this year, 70% would be AI accelerators; 30%, everything else. And within that everything else, 30% or so, I would say more than half of that 30%, more like 20% are the switches and routers. And the rest are other various retimer, DSP components because we are not -- unlike what you said, we're not vertically integrated in the sense we do not do the entire transceiver -- the optical transceiver. We don't do that. Those are manufactured typically by OEMs, contract manufacturers like Innolight, Eoptolink guys in China, where those guys are much more competitive. But we provide those key components we talk about. So when you look at it that way, you can understand the kind of the weighting of the various values.",337

That can't be dominating at 2 and -- number one. Number two, the second point is it's very -- it takes years. It takes a lot of heavy lifting to create that custom silicon because you need to do more than just hardware of silicon to really have a solution for generative AI or even AI in trying to create those AI capabilities in your data centers. It's more than just silicon. You have you have to invest a lot in creating software models that works on your custom silicon that matches.
You've got to match your business model in the first place, which leads to and create foundation models which then needs to work and optimize on the custom silicon you are developing. So it's an iterative process, and it's a constant evolving process even for the same customer we deal with. I mentioned that in the last call.
So it takes years to really understand or to be able to basically reach a point where you can say that, hey, I'm finally delivering production worthy -- and it's not because silicon is bad. It's because it doesn't work well with the foundation models that the customer put in place and a software layer that works with it, the firmware, the software layer that translates into it.
All that has to work. You are almost like creating an entire ecosystem on -- in a limited basis, which we are recognized very well in x86 CPUs, but in GPUs, those kind of AI accelerators is something still very early stage. So it takes years. And for our 2 customers, we have engaged for years. With 1 of them, we have engaged for 8 years to get to this point.
So it's something you have to be very patient, be -- persevere and hope that everything lines up because ultimate success, if you are just a silicon developer, it's not just dependent on you but dependent as much even more on your partner or customer doing it. So just got to be patient guys. I got the 2 only so far.",361

I guess, Hock, if some of the merchant leaders in AI were interested in some custom networking stuff from you either in switching routing would you consider it?
And the second question is for Kirsten. The business model around custom silicon for most folks is taking [ already payments ] upfront and sell the end product at a lower gross margin but a higher operating margin. And you guys have ramped this massive custom business with no real impact to gross margin. So maybe you could just unpack the philosophy and the accounting about the way that you guys approach the custom silicon opportunities just from a margin perspective?",121

You're not asking really number crunching. So let me try to answer in this way. No, there's no particular reason short of what constitutes an AI accelerator. An AI accelerator, the way it's configured now, whether it's a merchant or its custom has a -- first, an AI accelerator to run foundation models very well, needs not just a whole bunch of loads of floating point multipliers to do matrix multiplication, matrix analysis on regression. That's the logic part, compute part. It comes -- you have to come with access to a lot of memory, literally almost cash memory tied to it. The chip is not just a simple multiplier. It has -- it comes attached to a memory. It's almost a layer 3-dimensional chip, which it is. 
Memory is not something we -- any of us in AI accelerators are super good at designing or building. So we buy the memory from very specialized high-bandwidth memory, you all know about that, from key memory suppliers. Every one of us does that. So you part the 2 -- combine the 2 together. That's what an AI accelerator is. So even if I get very good net corporate silicon gross margin on my compute, logic chip on multipliers, there's no way I can apply that kind of add-on margin to the high-bandwidth memory, which is a big part of the cost of the total chip.
And so naturally, by simple math, it will -- that whole -- an entire consolidated AI accelerator brings a gross margin below what a traditional silicon product we have out there. No going away from that because you are adding on memory, even though we have to create the access, the IOs that attach in, we do not and could not justify adding that kind of margin to memory. Nobody could for us. So it brings a natural lower margin. That's really the simple basis to it.
But on the logic part of it, sure, with the kind of content with the kind of IP that we develop, cutting edge to make those high-density floating point multipliers on 800 square millimeters of advanced silicon, we can command the margin similar to our corporate gross margin.",378

So we have the strategic guys. We sell, upsell VCF, private cloud, very good. But the long tail of what we call smaller commercial customers, we continue to support and sell improved versions of just the vSphere compute virtualization to improve productivity on their servers.
We don't attempt to say go build up your whole VCF. They don't have the skills, don't have the scale to do it. But only it adds up, is you're right. My costs of my spend, OpEx spend, be it support services, go to market will increase. But the difference between that and, say, CA, my -- under acquisition we did is we're growing this business very fast. And you don't have to increase your spend growing this business.

In our fiscal Q2 2024 results, sorry, consolidated net revenue was $12.5 billion, up 43% year-on-year as revenue included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. But if we exclude VMware, consolidated revenue was up 12% year-on-year, and this 12% organic growth in revenue was largely driven by AI revenue, which stepped up 280% year-on-year to $3.1 billion, more than offsetting continued cyclical weakness in semiconductor revenue from enterprises and telcos. 
Let me now give you more color on our 2 reporting segments, beginning with software. In Q2, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.3 billion was up 175% year-on-year and included $2.7 billion in revenue contribution from VMware, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. The integration of VMware is going very well. Since we acquired VMware, we have modernized the product SKUs from over 8,000 disparate SKUs to 4 core product offerings and simplified the go-to-market flow, eliminating a huge amount of channel conflicts.
We are making good progress in transitioning all VMware products to a subscription licensing model. And since closing the deal, we have actually signed up close to 3,000 of our largest 10,000 customers to enable them to build a self-service virtual private cloud on-prem. Each of these customers typically sign up to a multiyear contract, which we normalize into an annual measure known as annualized booking value or ABV. This metric, ABV, for VMware products accelerated from $1.2 billion in Q1 to $1.9 billion in Q2. For a reference, for the consolidated Broadcom software portfolio, ABV grew from $1.9 billion in Q1 to $2.8 billion over the same period in Q2. Meanwhile, we have integrated SG&A across the entire platform and eliminated redundant functions. Year-to-date, we have incurred about $2 billion of restructuring and integration costs and drove our spending run rate at VMware to $1.6 billion this quarter from what used to be $2.3 billion per quarter pre acquisition. We expect spending will continue to decline towards a $1.3 billion run rate exiting Q4, better than our previous $1.4 billion plan and will likely stabilize at $1.2 billion post integration. 
VMware revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion, grew to $2.7 billion in Q2 and will accelerate towards a $4 billion per quarter run rate. We therefore expect operating margins for VMware to begin to converge towards that of classic Broadcom software by fiscal 2025.
Turning to semiconductors. Let me give you more color by end markets. Networking, Q2 revenue of $3.8 billion grew 44% year-on-year, representing 53% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and custom accelerators. It's interesting to note that as AI data center clusters continue to deploy, our revenue mix has been shifting towards an increasing proportion of networking.
We doubled the number of switches we sold year-on-year, particularly Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3, which we deployed successfully in close collaboration with partners like Arista Networks, Dell, Juniper, and Supermicro. Additionally, we also doubled our shipments of PCI Express switches and NICs in the AI back-end fabric. We're leading the rapid transition of optical interconnects in AI data centers to 800-gigabit bandwidth, which is driving accelerated growth for our DSPs, optical lasers, and PIN diodes. And we are not standing still. Together with these same partners, we are developing the next-generation switches, DSP, and optics that would drive the ecosystem towards 1.6-terabit connectivity to scale out larger AI-accelerated clusters. 
Talking of AI accelerators, you may know our hyperscale customers are accelerating their investments to scale up the performance of these clusters. And to that end, we have just been awarded the next-generation custom AI accelerators for these hyperscale customers of ours. Networking these AI accelerators is very challenging but the technology does exist today. In Broadcom, we have the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex, large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric. Proof in point, 7 of the largest 8 AI clusters in deployment today use Broadcom Ethernet solutions. Next year, we expect all mega-scale GPU deployments to be on Ethernet. We expect the strength in AI to continue, and because of that, we now expect networking revenue to grow 40% year-on-year compared to our prior guidance of over 35% growth.
Moving to wireless. Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion grew 2% year-on-year, was seasonally down 19% quarter-on-quarter and represents 22% of semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal '24, helped by content increases, we reiterate our previous guidance for wireless revenue to be essentially flat year-on-year. This trend is wholly consistent with our continued engagement with our North American customer, which is deep, strategic, and multiyear and represents all of our wireless business. 
Next, our Q2 server storage connectivity revenue was $824 million or 11% of semiconductor revenue, down 27% year-on-year. We believe though, Q2 was the bottom in server storage. And based on updated demand forecast and bookings, we expect a modest recovery in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we forecast fiscal '24 server storage revenue to decline around the 20% range year-on-year. 
Moving on to broadband. Q2 revenue declined 39% year-on-year to $730 million and represented 10% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on the continued pause in telco and service provider spending. We expect Broadcom (sic) [ broadband ] to bottom in the second half of the year with a recovery in 2025. Accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24 broadband revenue to be down high 30s year-on-year from our prior guidance for a decline of just over 30% year-on-year. 
Finally, Q2 industrial rev resale of $234 million declined 10% year-on-year. And for fiscal '24, we now expect industrial resale to be down double-digit percentage year-on-year compared to our prior guidance for high single-digit decline.
So to sum it all up, here's what we are seeing. For fiscal '24, we expect revenue from AI to be much stronger at over $11 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue has bottomed in Q2 and is likely to recover modestly for the second half of fiscal '24. On infrastructure software, we're making very strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth. Pulling all these 3 key factors together, we are raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to $51 billion. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1058

Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance, which included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12.5 billion for the quarter, up 43% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q2 revenue increased 12% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.2% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.4 billion and R&D was $1.5 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. 
Q2 operating income was $7.1 billion and was up 32% from a year ago with operating margin at 57% of revenue. Excluding transition costs, operating profit of $7.4 billion was up 36% from a year ago, with operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.4 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation.
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.2 billion and represented 58% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 370 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI accelerators. Operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year to $868 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 55%.
Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.3 billion, up 170% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 42% of revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software were 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 60%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%.
Now moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 36% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $830 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year and represented 42% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from 2023 due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of U.S. income and the delay in the reenactment of Section 174. 
We spent $132 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 40 days in the second quarter, consistent with 41 days in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 4% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We ended the second quarter with $9.8 billion of cash and $74 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.5% and 8.2 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $28 billion in floating rate debt is 6.6% and 2.8 years, respectively. During the quarter, we repaid $2 billion of our floating rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $5.25 per share. In Q2, non-GAAP diluted share count was 492 million as the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition were fully weighted in the second quarter. We paid $1.5 billion in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 1.2 million AVGO shares. 
Today, we are announcing a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Broadcom's common stock to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and to employees. Our stockholders of record after the close of market on July 11, 2024, will receive an additional 9 shares of common stock after the close of market on July 12, with trading on a split-adjusted basis expected to commence at market open on July 15, 2024. In Q3, reflecting a post-split basis, we expect share count to be approximately 4.92 billion shares. 
Now on to guidance. We are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue to $51 billion and adjusted EBITDA to 61%. For modeling purposes, please keep in mind that GAAP net income and cash flows in fiscal year 2024 are impacted by restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",737

So on the accelerator side, they are going to launch their Blackwell product that many of the same customers that you have a very large position in the custom compute. So I'm curious how you think customers are going to do that allocation decision, just broadly what the visibility is. 
And then I think part B of that is as they launch their Spectrum-X Ethernet switch, do you think that poses increasing competition for Broadcom and the Ethernet switching side in AI for next year?",105

On AI accelerators, I think we are operating on a different -- to start with scale, much a different model. It is -- and on the GPUs, which are the AI accelerator of choice on merchant -- in a merchant environment is something that is extremely powerful as a model and it's something that NVIDIA operates in, in a very, very effective manner. We don't even think about competing against them in that space, not in the least. That's where they're very good at and we know where we stand with respect to that. 
Now what we do for very selected or selective hyperscalers is if there's a scale and the skills to try to create silicon solutions, which are AI accelerators, to do particular very complex AI workloads, we're happy to use our IP portfolio to create those custom ASIC AI accelerator. So I do not see them as truly competing against each other. And far for me to say I'm trying to position myself to be a competitor on basically GPUs in this market. We're not. We are not a competitor to them. We don't try to be either. 
Now on networking, maybe that's different. But again, people may be approaching and they may be approaching it from a different angle. We are, as I indicated all along, very deep in Ethernet as we've been doing Ethernet for over 25 years, Ethernet networking. And we've gone through a lot of market transitions, and we have captured a lot of market transitions from cloud-scale networking to routing and now AI. So it's a natural extension for us to go into AI.
We also recognize that being the AI compute engine of choice in merchants in the ecosystem, which is GPUs, that they are trying to create a platform that is probably end to end very integrated. We take the approach that we don't do those GPUs, but we enable the GPUs to work very well. So if anything else, we supplement and hopefully complement those GPUs with customers who are building bigger and bigger GPU clusters.",351

The strong growth that you had in the quarter, the 280% year-over-year, could you delineate a little bit between if that's the compute offload side versus the connectivity side? And then as you think about the growth for the full year, how are those split in that realm as well? Are they kind of going hand-in-hand? Or is one side growing significantly faster than the other, especially with the, I guess, you said the next-generation accelerators are now going to be Broadcom as well?",93

It's something we don't really predict very well, nor understand completely except in hindsight because it's like, to some extent, to the cadence of deployment of when they put in the AI accelerators versus when they put in the infrastructure that puts it together, the networking. And we don't really quite understand it 100%. All we know, it used to be 80% accelerators, 20% networking. It's now running closer to 2/3 accelerators, 1/3 networking and will probably head towards 60-40 by the close of the year.",96

Like clockwork, the Broadcom team has been driving a consistent 2-year cadence, right, of new product introductions, Trident, Tomahawk, Jericho family of switching and routing products for the past 7 generations. You layer on top of that your GPU, TPU customers are accelerating their cadence of new product introductions and deployments of their products.
So is this also driving faster adoption curve for your latest Tomahawk and Jericho products? And then maybe just as importantly, like clockwork, it's been 2 years since you've introduced Tomahawk 5 product introduction, right, which if I look back historically, means you have silicon and are getting ready to introduce your next-generation 3-nanometer Tomahawk 6 products, which would, I think, puts you 2 to 3 years ahead of your competitors. Can you just give us an update there?",151

But it's 2-year cadence so we're right on.

But it's -- as far as VMware is concerned, we're making good progress. The journey is not over by any means, but it's pretty much very much to expectation. 
Moving to subscription, well, in VMware, we're very slow compared to, I mean, a lot of other guys, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, who have already been pretty much in subscription. So VMware is late in that process. But we're trying to make up for it by offering it and offering it in a very, very compelling manner because subscription is the right thing to do, right? It's a situation where you put out your product offering, and you update it, patch it, but update it feature-wise, everything as capabilities on a continual basis, almost like getting your news on an ongoing basis, subscription online versus getting it in a printed manner once a week. That's how I compare perpetual to subscription. So it's very interesting for a lot of people to want to get on. And so to no surprise, they are getting on very well. 
The big selling point we have, as I indicated, is the fact that we're not just trying to keep customers kind of stuck on just server or compute virtualization. That's a great product, great technology, but it's been out for 20 years. Based on what we are offering now at a very compelling price point, compelling and very attractive price point, the whole stack, software stack to use vSphere and its basic fundamental technology to virtualize networking, storage, operation and management, the entire data center and create this self-service private cloud. 
And thanks for saying it, you're right, and we have priced it down to the point where it's comparable with just compute virtualization. So yes, that's getting a lot of interest, a lot of attention from the customers we have signed up who would like to deploy -- the ability to deploy private cloud, their own private cloud on-prem as a nice complement, maybe even alternative or hybrid to public clouds. That's the selling point, and we're getting a lot of interest from our customers in doing that.",363

And you're right. As I indicated in my remarks, even without the contribution from VMware, this past quarter where we have AI helping us, but we have non-AI semiconductor sort of bottoming out, we're able to show 12% organic growth year-on-year. So almost have to say, so do we need to rush to buy another company? Answer is no. But all options are always open because we're trying to create the best value for our shareholders who have entrusted us with the capital to do that. So I would not discount that alternative because our strategy, our long-term model has always been to grow through a combination of acquisition, but also on the assets we acquire to really improve, invest, and operate them better to show organic growth as well. But again, organic growth often enough is determined very much by how fast your market would grow. So we do look towards acquisitions now and then.",158

I didn't particularly call it out, obviously, because more than anything else, I kind of link it very much to server storage, non-AI that is. And we call server storage as at a bottom Q2, and we call it to recover modestly second half of the year. We see the same thing in networking, which is a combination of enterprise networking as well as the hyperscalers who run their traditional workloads on those, though it's hard to figure out sometimes. But it is. So we see the same trajectory as we are calling out on server storage.",101

I think I've heard you say in the past that if you spent $10 billion on GPU compute, you need to spend another $10 billion on other interest, most of which is networking. So I'm just kind of wondering if when you see these big GPU numbers, is there sort of a rule of thumb that you use to map it back to what the opportunity will be for you?",87
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 12, 2024",2024-06-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3471.0,3159212.0,113420336.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,35,"There is, but it's so complex, I stopped creating such a model, Tim, I'm serious. But there is because one would say that for every -- you almost say, for every $1 billion you spend on GPU, you probably would spend probably on networking, and if we include the optical interconnects as part of it, though we are not totally in that market, except for the components like DSPs, lasers, PIN diodes that go into those high-bandwidth optical connect. But if you just take optical connects in totality, switching, all the networking components it goes into -- attaches itself to clustering a bunch of GPUs, you probably would say that about 25% of the value of the GPU goes to networking, the rest on networking.
Now not entirely all of it is my available market. I don't do the optical connects, but I do the few components I talked about in it. But roughly, the simple way to look at it is probably about 25%, maybe 30% of all these infrastructure components is kind of attached to the GPU value point itself.
But having said that, it's never -- we're never that precise that deployment is the same way. So you may see the deployment of GPU or purchase of GPU much earlier, and the networking comes later or sometimes less the other way around, which is why you're seeing the mix going on within my AI revenue mix. But typically, you run towards that range over time.",248

My question in regards to the custom ASIC AI business. Hock, you had a long run here of a very successful business, particularly with 1 customer. If you look in the market today, you have a new entrant who's playing with different customers. And I know that you said historically, that's not really a direct customer to you. But could you talk about what differentiates you from the new entrant in the market as of late? 
And then there's been profitability questions around the sustainability of gross margins longer term. Can you talk about if you see any increased competition? And if there's really areas that you would deem more or less defensible in your profile today? And if you would see kind of that additional entrant maybe attack any of those in the future?",137

It is a very profitable business, and let me put -- look -- examine from a model point of view. I mean, each of these AI accelerators no different from a GPU. The way these large language models get run computing, get run on these accelerators, no one single accelerator, as you know, can run these big, large language models. You need multiple of it no matter how powerful those accelerators are.
But also, and the way the models are run, there's a lot of memory access to memory requirements. So each of this accelerator comes with a large amount of cache memory, as you call it, what you guys probably now know as HBM, high-bandwidth memory specialized for AI accelerators or GPUs. So we're supplying both in our custom business.
And the logic side of it, where the compute function is on doing the chips, the margin there are no different than the margin in any -- in most of any of a semiconductor silicon chip business. But when you attach to it a huge amount of memory, memory comes from a third party. There are a few memory makers who make this specialized thing. We don't do margin stacking on that part. So by almost buying basic math will dilute the margin of these AI accelerators when you sell them with memory, which we do. 
It does push up revenue somewhat higher but it dilutes the margin. But regardless, the spend, the R&D, the OpEx that goes to support this as a percent of the revenue, which is higher revenue, so much less. So on an operating margin level, this is easily as profitable, if not more profitable, given the scale that each of those custom AI accelerators can go up to. It's even better than our normal operating margin scale.
So that's the return on investment that attracts and keeps us going at this game. And this is more than a game. It's a very difficult business. And to answer your first question, there's only 1 Broadcom, period.",357

And that, of course, is unique among competitors. But as hyperscalers seek to deploy their own unique AI clusters, are you seeing a growing mix of white-box networking switch deployments? I ask because while your custom sales and business continues to broaden, it will be helpful to better understand the growing mix of your $11 billion AI networking portfolio combined this year.",85

So 2 quick things on this. One is the -- you're exactly right that the portfolio we have is quite unique in providing that flexibility. And by the way, this is exactly why Hock, in his statements earlier on, mentioned that 7 out of the top 8 hyperscalers use our portfolio, and they use it specifically because it provides that flexibility. So whether you have an architecture that's based on an endpoint and you want to actually build your platform that way or you want that switching to happen in the fabric itself, that's why we have the full intent portfolio. 
So that actually has been a proven differentiator for us. And then on top of that, we've been working, as you know, to provide a complete network operating system that's open on top of that using SONiC and SAI, which has been deployed in many of the hyperscalers. And so the combination of the portfolio plus the stack really differentiates the solution that we can offer to these hyperscalers. 
And if they decide to build their own NICs, their own accelerators are custom or use standard products, whether it's from Broadcom or other, that platform, that portfolio of infrastructure switching gives you that full flexibility.",210

So excluding VMware, your Brocade, CA, and Symantec business now running $500 million higher for the last 2 quarters. So curious, is that the new sustainable run rate or were there onetime events in both January and April that we should be considering?
And then the second question is as you think about VMware Cloud Foundation adoption, are you seeing any sort of crowding out of spending like other software guys are seeing as they repurpose their budgets to IT? Or is that business so less discretionary that it's just not an impact to you?",104
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 12, 2024",2024-06-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3471.0,3159212.0,113420346.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,45,"Well, on the second one, I don't know about any crowding out, to be honest. It's not -- what we're offering, obviously, is not something that they would like to use themselves, to be able to do themselves, which is they're already spending on building their own on-prem data centers. And typical approach people take, a lot of enterprises take historically continue today than most people do a lot, people do is they have best of breed. What I mean is they create a data center that is compute as a separate category, best compute there is, and they often enough use vSphere for compute virtualization due to improved productivity, but best of breed there. And best of breed on networking and best of breed on storage with a common management operations layer, which very often is also VMware we realize.
And what we're trying to say is this mixed bag and what they see -- is this mixed bag best-of-breed data center, very heterogenous, is not driving that, is not a highly resilient data center. I mean, you have a mixed bag. So it goes down. Where do you find quickly root cause? Everybody is pointing fingers at the other. So you got a problem, not very resilient and not necessary secure between bare metal in one side and software on the other side.
So it's a natural thinking on part of many CIOs we talk to, to say, ""Hey, I want to create 1 common platform as opposed to just best-of-breed of each."" So that gets us into that. So if it is a greenfield, that's not bad, they started from scratch. If it's a brownfield, that means they have existing data centers trying to upgrade. It's -- that sometimes that's more challenging for us to get that adopted.
So I'm not sure there's a crowding out here. There's some competition, obviously, on greenfield, where they can spend their budget on an entire platform versus best-of-breed. But on the existing data center where you're trying to upgrade, that's a trickier thing to do. And it cuts the other way as well for us. So that's how I see it.
So in that sense, best answer is I don't think we're seeing a level of crowding out that is -- any and that's very significant for me to mention. In terms of the revenue mix, no, Brocade is having a great, great field year so far and still chugging along. But will that sustain? Hell no, you know that. Brocade goes through cycles like most enterprise purchases. So we're enjoying it while it lasts.",435

I also want to ask about something you mentioned with VMware. In your prepared remarks, you highlighted that you've eliminated a tremendous amount of channel conflict. I'm hoping you can linger on this a little bit and clarify maybe what you did.
And specifically also what you did in the heritage Broadcom software business, where I think historically, you've shied away from the channel. And there was an idea that perhaps you'd reintroduce those products to the channel through a more unified approach using VMware's channel partners or resources. So any sort of clarification here, I think, would be helpful.",114

That's a great question. Yes, VMware taught me a few things. They have 300,000 customers, 300,000. That's pretty amazing. And we look at it. I know under CA, we took a position that let's pick an A-list strategic guy and focus on it. I can't do that in VMware. I approached it differently. And I start to learn the value of a very strong bunch of partners they have, which are a network of distributors and something like 15,000 VARs, value-added resales, supported with these distributors.
So we have doubled down and invested in this resale network in a big way for VMware. And it's a great move, I think, but 6 months into the game, but we're seeing a lot more velocity out of it. Now these resellers, having said that, tend to be very focused on a very long tail of their 300,000 customers. The largest 10,000 customers of VMware are large enterprises who tend to -- they are very large enterprises, the largest banks, the largest health care companies. And their view is I want very bespoke service, support, engineering solutions from us. 
So we've created a direct approach, supplemented with the VAR of choice where they need to. But on the long tail of 300,000 customers, they get a lot of services too from the resellers, value-added resellers and so in their way. So we now strengthen that whole network of resellers so that they can go direct, manage, supported financially with distributors. And we don't try to challenge those guys unless the customers -- it all goes on the end of the day, the customer chose where they like to be supported. So we kind of simplify this together with the number of SKUs they have. 
In the past, unlike what we're trying to do here, everybody is a partner. I mean, you're talking a full range of partners. And whoever makes the biggest deal gets the lowest -- the partner that makes the biggest deal gets the lower -- biggest discount, lowest price. And they are out there basically kind of creating a lot of channel chaos and conflict in the marketplace. Here, we don't. The customers, I am aware. They can take it direct from VMware to their direct sales force or they can easily move to the resellers to get it that way. 
And as a third alternative which we offer, if they chose not -- they want to run their applications on VMware and they want to run it efficiently on a full stack, they have a choice now of going to a hosted environment managed by a network of managed service providers, which we set up globally, that will run the infrastructure, invest and operate the infrastructure. And these enterprise customers just run their workloads in and get it as a service, basically VMware as a service. That's a third alternative, and we are clear to make it very distinct and differentiated for our end-use customers. They're available to all 3, it's how they choose to consume our technology.",512

In our fiscal Q3 2024, consolidated net revenue of $13.1 billion was up 47% year-on-year, and operating profit was up 44% year-on-year. These strong results reflected three key factors: one, AI revenue continues to grow and grow strongly; two, VMware bookings continue to accelerate; and three, non-AI semiconductor revenue has stabilized. 
Before I give you more color on our two reporting segments, let me give you a quick update on guidance. Now we started the year providing annual guidance with quarterly updates as we run the process of integrating VMware. Things are now much more stable and we are in the final quarter of 2024. So instead of giving you annual guidance, we now revert to providing the quarterly guidance for Q4. 
Starting with software. In Q3, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.8 billion was up 200% year-on-year driven by $3.8 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. 
The transformation of the business model of VMware continues to progress very well. In fact, last week, we held a well-attended VMware Explore Conference in Las Vegas, our first as a combined company. This event was all about promoting VMware Cloud Foundation, or VCF, which is the full software stack that virtualizes an entire data center and creates a private cloud environment on-prem for enterprises. 
The success of the strategy is reflected in our performance in fiscal Q3. We booked more than 15 million CPU cores of VCF, representing over 80% of the total VMware products we booked during the quarter. And this translates into an annualized booking value, or ABV as I had described before, of $2.5 billion during Q3, up 32% from the preceding quarter. 
Meanwhile, we continue to drive down costs in VMware. We brought VMware spending down to $1.3 million in Q3 from $1.6 million in Q2. And when we acquired VMware, our target was to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion, within 3 years of the acquisition. We are well on the path to achieving or even exceeding this EBITDA goal in the next fiscal '25. 
Now turning to semiconductors. In networking, Q3 revenue of $4 billion grew 43% year-on-year, representing 55% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and on custom AI accelerators. As you know, our hyperscale customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters. Custom AI accelerators grew 3.5x year-on-year. 
In the fabric, Ethernet switching, driven by Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI grew over 4x year-on-year, while our optical lasers and thin dies used in optical interconnects grew three-fold. Meanwhile, PCI Express switches more than doubled, and we're shipping in volume our industry-leading 5-nanometer, 400-gigabit per second NICs and 800-gigabit per second DSPs. 
So now let me give you more color on our networking products which are not used in AI. As we had indicated last quarter, we believe we did bottom in Q2. And in Q3, non-AI networking was up actually 17% sequentially even as it was down 41% year-on-year. We expect this level of revenue to sustain in Q4 and the year-on-year decline to moderate to 30%. So in adding the strength we continue to see in AI, we expect total networking revenue to grow over 40% year-on-year in Q4. 
Across enterprise infrastructure, we see the same trend of recovery in server storage. Our Q3 server storage connectivity revenue was $861 million, up 5% sequentially and down 25% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect server storage revenue to grow mid- to high single-digit percent sequentially even as revenue is expected to be down high single-digit percent year-on-year. 
Moving on to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue of $1.7 billion grew 1% year-on-year, representing 23% of semiconductor revenue. And in Q4, reflecting the launch of next-generation devices and our North American customers, we expect wireless revenue to actually grow over 20% sequentially even as it will be relatively flat year-on-year. 
On to broadband. Q3 revenue declined 49% year-on-year to $557 million and represented 8% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in telco and service provider spending. And in Q4, we expect broadband to continue to be down over 40% year-on-year, but we do expect that recovery to begin in '25. 
Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $164 million declined 31% year-on-year. We believe we are approaching bottom in Q3 as Q4 resales are expected to recover sequentially. Year-on-year, Q4 industrial resales will still be down approximately 20%. 
In summary, here are the trends we are seeing in semiconductors. In aggregate, we have reached bottom in our non-AI markets and we're expecting a recovery in Q4. AI demand remains strong and we expect, in Q4, AI revenue to grow sequentially 10% to over $3.5 billion. This will translate to AI revenue of $12 billion for fiscal '24, up from our prior guidance of over $11 billion. 
Putting it all together with software, here's our forecast for Q4. We expect Q4 semiconductor revenue of approximately $8 billion, up 9% year-on-year. For infrastructure software, we expect revenue to be about $6 billion. So we are guiding Q4 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14 billion, which is up 51% year-on-year. We also expect this will drive Q4 consolidated adjusted EBITDA to achieve approximately 64% of revenue. This Q4 guidance would imply we are raising the outlook for our fiscal 2024 revenue to $51.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA for the year to 61.5%. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",917

Consolidated revenue was $13.1 billion for the quarter, up 47% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q3 revenue increased 4% year-on-year. Gross margins were 77.4% of revenue in the quarter. R&D was $1.5 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2.2 billion, up year-on-year, primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. 
Q3 operating income was $7.9 billion and was up 44% from a year ago, with operating margin at 61% of revenue. Excluding transition costs, operating profit of $8 billion was up 45% from a year ago with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.2 billion or 63% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with semis. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68%, down 270 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI accelerators. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $881 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. 
Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 200% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 44% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 67%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 69%. 
Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.8 billion and represented 37% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $529 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 14% year-on-year and represented 41% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of U.S. income and the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174. 
We spent $172 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 32 days in the quarter, in line with the year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. Note that we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. 
We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $72.3 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate notes with new fixed senior notes. We used the proceeds from the completed sale of VMware's end user computing business to KKR and cash on hand to reduce floating rate debt by an additional $4.2 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $53 billion of fixed rate debt is 3.6% and 7.7 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $19 billion in floating rate debt is 6.7% and 3.1 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $1.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes due in Q4. 
Turning to capital allocation. In Q3, we paid stockholders $2.5 billion of cash dividends which, based on a split adjusted quarterly common stock count, represented a cash dividend of $0.525 per share. For Q4, we are rounding up the quarterly cash dividend to $0.53 per share. 
In Q3, the split-adjusted non-GAAP diluted share count was 4.92 billion, in line with expectations. We paid $1.4 billion of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 8.4 million AVGO shares. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.91 billion shares. 
Now on to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64%. For modeling purposes, we expect consolidated gross margins to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q4 are impacted by higher taxes, restructuring, and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. 
As Hock just discussed, we are resuming quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2025 as fiscal year '24 has been a transition and integration year following the VMware deal close. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",757

And are we now kind of reaching that $4 billion base in the fourth quarter that you talked about with VMware?

On semis, the non-AI networking is like more than 50% below where it was running before it rolled off. And clearly, the other businesses are also way below their peaks. Is there any reason why those shouldn't -- is this just cyclical? Or is something else going on? Is there any reason why those shouldn't get back to prior levels once recovery happens? 
And then on the software side, so the non-VMware pieces look like it's back to that $2 billion-ish a quarter level or so that it was at before. Is that just Brocade falling off? And is this sort of $2 billion-ish a quarter, is that bottomed as well? Is that the right level we ought to be thinking about the growth for the non-VMware software business as we go forward from here?",144
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Sep 05, 2024",2024-09-05,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3459.0,3255474.0,115284861.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,15,"Yes. On the semi side, the answer is very simple. As you all know, we've gone through your typical down cycle of semiconductors. And I'm referring particularly to non-AI, and we have talked about that before many times. We've gone through a down cycle as the ecosystem, as many of our customers, but the broad ecosystems, work on an adjustment in inventory levels in all stages in the supply chain. And we're not immune from it, obviously as we try to insulate ourselves from it as much as possible. We've gone through it. And the signs on the indications we have seen very clearly is we have, in fact, passed through the bottom. The best indicator is the bookings we are receiving. In non-AI, our bookings in Q3 of non-AI semiconductor demand is up 20%. And so that tells us we are well on the way to recovery. 
Now by end markets, as I indicated, the amount of recovery, the timing of recovery somewhat varies. But we're seeing largely on enterprise, enterprise data center, enterprise IT spending, we've passed the bottom. And Q3 was, in fact, sequentially, a recovery from the bottom of, we believe, Q2 or Q1 this fiscal year. And we'll see Q4 continuing that recovery and obviously, in our view, into '25 in terms of the cycle. 
Broadband, we are not seeing it yet in terms of the bottom, but we see that as close to bottom in the sense that here again bookings are up from where it used to be. And so we are very, very keen at thinking that broadly, as a whole, non-AI semiconductors, had gone through the down cycle, is on an uptick. And like all previous cycles, my sense to you, Stacy, is we will get us back to the level we used to be. There's no reason at all why it doesn't. And given the rate of bookings, it will go. 
I dare say, even put a thought in your mind, that as AI permeates enterprises all across and digital natives, you need to upgrade servers. You need to upgrade storage. You need to upgrade networking, connectivity across the entire ecosystem. And if anything else, we could be headed for up cycle, timing of precisely when, we're not sure, but an up cycle, that could even meet or even surpass what our previous up cycles would be, simply because the amount of bandwidth you need, the amount to manage, store, manage all these workloads that come out of AI would just the need to refresh and upgrade hardware. So that's my two cents' worth on where we're headed from this down cycle. So my belief '24 was the lowest point for the uptake as part of the reasons we are stating it very clearly here. 
On the software side, to your question, no, I think we have reached a level of stability that puts and takes Brocade as one of those that goes up and down, very volatile, and that's largely it. But on the non-VMware revenue, on software revenue, I think we've reached a level of very clear stability. And what we are looking towards more is how VMware picks up over the next 1 year, 1.5 years.",539

So the question, Hock, really is around the growth rate of your AI revenue versus what we're seeing on the GPU side because this year, you grew about the same as what GPU compute's growing.

In terms of GPU growth, you should ask the guys who does merchant GPU, which is obviously, NVIDIA and ASD. And I don't play in the enterprise market at all. See, that's part of the market I don't see. Having said that, they do both play somewhat in the hyperscalers, where I'm totally focused on doing. So there's really no connection one with the other. That is indirect.
But suffice for me to say, long term, I'm saying actually and thoughtfully long term, the large hyperscalers, few and large hyperscalers with very large platforms, huge consumer platform subscriber base, have the entire model predicated on running a lot of large language models, a lot of AI requirements, workloads out there. And it will drive, matter of time, towards creating as much as possible their own compute silicon, their own custom accelerators, that's a matter of time. And we are in the midst of seeing that transition, which may take a few years for that to happen.
So that is on a different trajectory, a different path, and I'm in that path of doing this, enabling custom accelerators. I'm in that path. I'm not in a path of, in the meantime, a different trajectory of enabling enterprises to do AI on their own workloads. That's more the merchant guys. Some of the merchant guys obviously are also in the hyperscaler today, but there's a process, obviously, of a transition going on. So one doesn't really connect with the other, Tim, in that regard. But I would likely say obviously, as the transition occurs, we have a good tailwind in the business model we have of providing accelerators and networking to the AI data centers of those large hyperscalers.",304

Basically, what we essentially created in that transaction, to begin with, we actually believe long term in the sustainability of hard disk drive medium as a great long-term sustainable storage, alternative storage medium for those hyperscalers. It makes sense. Likely, eventually, everything goes to flash. I don't think so. Hard disk drive storage will still be meaningful. And the technology, which is most interesting for us, has a lot of ways to go. As hard disk drives goes from where it is today, which is 22, 23, 24 terabytes going to 30, 40, and even 50 terabytes. A lot of technology along the way and a lot of that resides in silicon. 
So what we're doing, in effect, is a collaboration, more than anything else, going structured, obviously, as a purchase of intellectual property. But we're also taking engineers, designers, combining it with the designers we have and basically enabling Seagate and eventually the entire industry to continue a road map that goes towards 50 terabytes, that's our ambition, that's our vision, and to be able to do that within 5 years or less. So that's pretty much what it is. It's a statement of our belief that hard disk drives, nearline hard disk drive storage, will sustain very well over the next 5 years, if not longer.",228

I'm curious, do you see that as an opportunity relative to prior generations of NVIDIA just to deepen a participation or just to participate in general in kind of the areas of DSPs and maybe other things related to the Blackwell cycle from NVIDIA?",83

I'm not really participating in NVIDIA's road map. I'm really not directly in that kind of market, in that kind of product road map. That's NVIDIA product road map in terms of Blackwell, impressive product, on the way to coming out.
Now in terms of base technology we develop, of course, it could be used, it could be applied, and we are very happy to share that as it may be useful to enable Blackwell, to be part of that, whether it's on the optical component side, which is what you're referring to, or even on the DSP side in terms of providing the interconnects to enable clusters of Blackwell to be built. That's as far as our engagement in that. We're happy to be part of that ecosystem, as I said, but directly, we're not in that market as you know.",153

It's a great experience. And you're feeling great about it when you do it and when you're doing it pretty much running way beyond expectation, as we indicated in that side. So no, I'm very focused on getting VMware as it continues to accelerate in getting private cloud deployed in the largest enterprises in the world.

It also looks like they're trying to accelerate their deployments of their GPUs, XPUs, and networking into their data centers here in the second half of the year. We know that on AI accelerators specifically, supply is quite tight, given the colos packaging and the HBM memory constraints. So has the team seen upside orders and demand for XPUs and networking here in the second half? Have you been able to meet that upside demand? Or is the team somewhat supply constrained? I guess in other words, is the AI demand greater than your supply here in the second half of the year?",131

No, we continue to see orders. We continue to see upside. And you're right in the pattern of the behavior that is going because our customers, these are hyperscalers trying to deploy more and more capacity in AI data centers. And you start to hear them talk in terms of power. They don't even talk in terms of how many XPU or GPU cloud they found in there. 500 megawatt, 1 gigawatt, not yet, but people are dreaming that. So as they get this enabled, we're getting pull-ins, we're getting upsides. And I expect that to happen a lot more in 2025. We're not putting that in any guidance or indication we're giving you. But probably what you say is exactly right on. We do expect to see upside as we've been seeing recently. We continue to see that probably going forward over the next 12 months, especially related to XPUs getting deployed and getting infrastructure available and rushing to deploy them. We see quite a bit of that.",170

You've said in the past calls that you thought that AI compute would move away from ASICs and go to merchant market. But it looks like the trend is kind of heading the other way. Are you still of the opinion that that's going to be the long-term trend of this?
And secondly, as you just pointed out, power is becoming the defining factor for deployment with all the big guys at this point. Given the performance per watt of the ASICs over GPUs, which is superior to GPUs, why shouldn't we see more of these guys moving to custom ASIC? I know it takes a long time and it takes a lot of funding, et cetera. But especially as the enterprise starts getting more involved with this, there are going to be some applications that are kind of standard across, some of the enterprises wouldn't even see some of the bigger, like AWS, move to a custom silicon for a specific workload. So basically, the overall trend in ASICs in AI.",181

Well, based on history of semiconductors mostly so far, general purpose, small merchant silicon tends to win. But like you, I flipped in my view. And I did that, by the way, last quarter, maybe even 6 months ago. But nonetheless, catching up is good. And I actually think so because I do think there are 2 markets here on AI accelerators. There's one market for enterprises of the world, and none of these enterprises are incapable nor have the financial resources or interest to create the silicon, the custom silicon, nor the large language models and the software going maybe, to be able to run those AI workloads on custom silicon. It's too much and there's no return for them to do it because it's just too expensive to do it.
But there are those few cloud guys, hyperscalers with the scale of the platform and the financial wherewithal for them to make it totally rational, economically rational, to create their own custom accelerators because right now, I'm not trying to overemphasize it, it's all about compute engines. It's all about especially training those large language models and enabling it on your platform. It's all about constraint, to a large part, about GPUs. Seriously, it came to a point where GPUs are more important than engineers, these hyperscalers in terms of how they think. Those GPUs are much more -- or XPUs are much more important. And if that's the case, what better thing to do than bringing the control, control your their own destiny by creating your own custom silicon accelerators. And that's what I'm seeing all of them do. It's just doing it at different rates and they're starting at different times. 
But they all have started. And obviously, it takes time to get there. But a lot of them, there are a lot of learning in the process versus what the biggest guy of them had done longer, have been doing it for 7 years. Others are trying to catch up and it takes time. I'm not saying you'll take 7 years. I think you'll be accelerated. But it will still take some time, step by step, to get there. But those few hyperscalers, platform guys, will create their own if they haven't already done it, and start to train them on their large language models. And yes, you're right, they will all go in that direction totally into ASIC or, as we call it, XPUs, custom silicon. Meanwhile, there's still a market for in enterprise for merchant silicon.",452

That basically suggests that you're on the early part of your curve where I'm not trying to call the GPUs whatever, but you could be getting to something closer to the peak of the GPU market just because everything, right, beside the cost expense and as you're spending all this money and you're paying all this money for power, the ASICs become more and more attractive.
