In our fiscal Q1 '23 consolidated net revenue, that was -- revenue was $8.9 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 21% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. While, as we expected, infrastructure software declined 1% year-on-year to $1.8 billion even as our core software sustained growth of 5% year-on-year.
Stepping back, let me sum up what happened in Q1. From our view, infrastructure spending continues to be up particularly in service providers, even as hyperscale and enterprise sustain. Spending in technology for infrastructure has been strong, showing double-digit growth for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to be booked for fiscal '23 and our lead times and visibility on semiconductors remain largely at 50 weeks. While there have been a small number of requests to push out certain orders, we know that these are the exceptions, and they have not had a material impact on our business. Because we ship linearly throughout the quarter to our customers, inventory on our books has been consistent around 80 days, and overall inventory of Broadcom products across the ecosystem remains very well managed.
We continue, needless to say, to be very disciplined in shipping our backlog only as and when needed by our end customers. With that, let me now provide more color on each of our end markets.
Starting with networking. Networking revenue was $2.3 billion and was up 20% year-on-year, in line with guidance, representing 32% of our semiconductor revenue. We see continued deployment of our advanced Tomahawk switches by hyperscalers in their leaf and spine architectures.
Even as we deliver on increased bandwidth for the hyperscalers, having said that, power remains a major challenge. So just this week, we announced the industry's first integrated silicon photonics networking solution, codename Bailly, which integrates the active optical interconnects with our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch at 51.2 terabit per second. Bailly doubles switching performance, but it will reduce total system power.
Keep in mind that at hyperscalers, a growing portion of our switches have been deployed within the AI networks, which are separate from the traditional x86 CPU scale out running existing workloads. 
Now this is today. Tomorrow, we generated AI using large scale -- large language, I should say, models with billions of parameters. We have to run thousands of AI engines in parallel, enabling large and synchronized bursts of data at speeds of 400 and 800 gig. The networks to support this massive processor density is critical and is important SDAI engines. Such networks have to be lossless, low latency and be able to scale. 
So as you know, such AI networks are already been deployed at certain hyperscalers through our Jericho2 switches and Ramon fabric. In fact, in 2022, we estimated our Ethernet switch shipments deployed in AI was over $200 million.
With the expected exponential demand from our hyperscale customers, we forecast that these could grow to well over $800 million in 2023. We anticipate this trend will continue to accelerate and mindful that we need even more higher performance networks in the future. We have been investing in a new generation of this lossless low-latency ethernet fabric designed specifically to handle such data and compute-intensive AI workloads.
Of course, additionally, the exciting growth prospects for generative AI are driving our compute offload accelerated business at hyperscalers. As we have indicated to you last quarter, this business achieved over $2 billion in revenue in 2022. We are on track to exceed $3 billion in revenue in our fiscal '23. In Q2, looking forward, short term, we expect these tailwinds to drive our networking revenue to grow about another 20% year-over-year.
Moving on next to our server storage connectivity revenue. There was a record $1.3 billion or 18% of semiconductor revenue and up 57% year-on-year. Once again, as we discussed in preceding quarters, the rapid transition to next-generation MegaRAID solutions drove this substantial year-on-year content increase. After 4 consecutive quarters of such increases, this transition, however, is significantly complete, and we expect that in Q2 on a year-on-year basis server storage connectivity revenue will moderate towards 20% year-on-year growth.
Moving on to broadband. Revenue grew 34% year-on-year to a record $1.2 billion and represented 17% of semiconductor revenue. During this quarter, our broadband business particularly benefited from robust deployments of -- by telcos of 10G PON and cable operators of DOCSIS 3.1. These gateways have high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E. And in Q2, we expect the secular drivers behind broadband to sustain momentum on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, broadband will grow a solid 10%.
Moving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2.1 billion represented 29% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer drove wireless revenue up 4% year-on-year, reflecting content increases, which we had previously indicated last quarter. Sequentially, wireless was flattish compared to Q4. And seasonally, we expect wireless to be down sequentially in Q2 and down high single-digit percentage year-over-year.
Finally, Q1 industrial resale of $229 million decreased 4% year-over-year as softness in China offset strength in renewable energy and medical. And in Q2, we forecast industrial resales to be down low single-digit percentage year-on-year on continuing softness in China.
So in summary, Q1 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 21% year-on-year. And in Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of high single-digit percentage year-on-year.
Turning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1% year-on-year and represented 20% of total revenue. While core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year, the Brocade business declined because of lumpiness in enterprise consumption in this very narrow vertical of SAN storage. For core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% of expiring contracts. And within our strategic accounts, we averaged 129%, and within the strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $536 million included $197 million, which represent 37% of cross-selling of our portfolio of products to these same core strategic customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.
Now by way of comparison, over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts, and in our strategic accounts, we averaged 134%. Because of these, our ARR, the indicator of forward revenue at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which is up 3% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be up low to mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year as the stable core software growth continues to be partially offset now by weakness in Brocade.
So in summary, we are guiding consolidated Q2 revenue for the company to be $8.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Before Kirsten, tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisitions of VMware.
We continue to make progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, having now received legal merger clearance in Brazil, South Africa and Canada and foreign investment control clearance in Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Italy and New Zealand. As we stated on our last earnings call, we continue to anticipate that the time line for the review process will be extended in other key regions, especially given the size of this transaction.
Having said that, we continue to expect the transaction to close within our fiscal 2023. We believe the combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era. And we are confident regulators will see this when they conclude their review.
Finally, Broadcom recently published its third annual ESG report available on our corporate citizenship website, which discusses the company's ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognize Broadcom's responsibility to have a positive impact on our customers, employees and communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain committed to this mission.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1320
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3342.0,2756785.0,103175593.0,Presenter Speech,Kirsten Spears,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Broadcom had another great quarter with robust financials. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, about 10 basis points higher than we expected. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 1% year-on-year. R&D of $929 million was also down 1% year-on-year, primarily from streamlined project and other variable spending, offset in part by higher people costs resulting from increased headcount as we are hiring.
Operating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 17% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 50 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $127 million of depreciation.
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 reportable segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 80% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 21% year-on-year. As Hock discussed, this came from strength across all of our semiconductor end markets.
Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 69%, down approximately 160 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $802 million in Q1, down 2% year-on-year. R&D was $716 million in the quarter, down 1% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins were 58%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 21%, operating profit grew 23% year-on-year.
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software reportable segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion, down 1% year-on-year and represented 20% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $346 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 72% in Q1, and operating profit was stable year-on-year.
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.9 billion, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow represented 44% of revenues in Q1 '23 consistent with what we achieved the same quarter last year. We spent $103 million on capital expenditures.
Days sales outstanding were 33 days in the first quarter compared to 30 days in the fourth quarter. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter or 78 days on hand. Overall, inventory of Broadcom's products across the ecosystem, as Hock indicated, remains well managed.
We ended the first quarter with $12.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. During the quarter, we repaid $260 million in senior notes that were due on maturity. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 10.2 years, respectively.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $333 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.7 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was 434 million. As of the end of Q1, $11.8 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 438 million.
Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64.5% of projected revenue. In forecasting such profitability, we expect gross margins to be up approximately 150 basis points sequentially on product mix and R&D spending to be up sequentially on continuing hiring of engineers and seasonal payroll tax step-ups.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",655

Hock, you mentioned generative models in your commentary. I wanted to understand the difference between what you're doing in AI so far versus maybe what our understanding of generative is. You talked about $200 million in Ethernet related to AI. Is that largely generative because we've heard other companies say that, for large part, the generative models are using [ a ton of band ]. And then you talked about $2 billion in compute offload going to sort of $3 billion. My understanding was that was mostly for video processing. Maybe help us think about how we think of Avago's place or Broadcom's place in the generative process.",116

In 2022, generative is just barely starting to kick off, but there exist AI 1networks within the hyperscalers, particularly in fairly significant volume. And what we're trying to say is, very similar to CPUs, traditional CPUs in traditional workloads in those same data centers, we've constrained on performance of those silicon CPUs and Moore's Law. We're starting to see scale out by positioning rows and rows of servers, CPUs and networking them together to work closely in parallel.
As we step up to large language models in AI, generative AI, in particular coming into play, GPUs are starting to be strung together in hundreds, soon to be thousands of racks and working in parallel. And you know how that goes. And basically, those GPUs work in parallel in fairly synchronous manner to basically run and do what we call bulk parametric exchange, basically, run GPUs together or AI engines together whether they're GPUs, AI, or TPUs or other AI engines. You run them together.
Becomes network. The network becomes now potentially a critical part of this whole AI phenomenon in hardware. To make it work, you've got to put together many racks of AI engines in parallel, very similar to what we have been doing -- hyperscalers have been doing on CPUs to make them run faster, high performance as Moore's Law comes to an end and doesn't make any difference here in the form of AI engine.
They come from silicon. They have -- they face similar constraints. So network becomes a problem -- becomes a constraint. Network becomes a very key part of fulfilling generative AI dream here. And what we are saying -- what I'm saying in my comments is, last year, 2022, these are more what you call the AI workloads that are running in hyperscale, and the advent of generative AI is still relatively fresh and new. We're doing $200 million as far as we could estimate of silicon, Ethernet switches and fabric that goes into those AI networks as far as we could identify in hyperscalers.
With generative AI and the urgency and excitement of it coming in that we are seeing today, we are seeing that increase very, very dramatically. And we're seeing urgency in our hyperscale customers coming to us to secure products, to secure ability to put in place those very, very low -- lossless, I would call, very low latency networks that can scale. And Ethernet is what makes those networks scale.",433

But from a new product ramp and design win funnel perspective, is this also causing your cloud customers to want to pull forward some of your future programs like Tomahawk 5 or Jericho3 next-gen switching and routing products and/or pulling the design and tape out of their next-generation compute offload AI ASIC programs?",98

So that's one side of it.
And the other side of it, you are right. We typically not want to talk much about compute offload, which is another way of saying, yes, these are very related to some of the engines that certain -- that are fairly customized dedicated to certain hyperscalers.",131

Well, it's -- I'm sure I don't need to elaborate on what we all hear about on generative AI. And I think it's still early innings on generative AI, but we obviously are also indicating, as we are seeing a very strong and a strong sense of urgency among our customers especially in the hyperscale environment to be -- to not miss out -- not to be late in this trend. And with generative AI, as I said, with many more -- much more billions of parameters that come into the models that they're doing, you're talking about scale out of data centers driving AI engines network together in a manner that we probably have not seen before.
It's not a problem that's not solvable. It is very, very clearly solvable. As evidenced by the fact that we have and deployed technology to support AI networks even today to certain hyperscalers, where we're talking about at least hundreds, if not, thousands of AI engines, AI servers network together and working in a synchronous manner. So this is about ability to scale out in a fairly substantial manner.
And that was the color I was providing. And it's really about trying to make sure that happens and not be the bottleneck to our ability to get the best system performance. And I emphasize the word system performance of an AI data center. And where it's coming from right now is frankly how to network them and how to do those massive parametric exchange, so to speak, when you run large numbers of engines or machines in parallel, as you grind through this huge database and that we need to do.
So that's -- we are in early innings and which is why we think we have time to come -- to start to work on even a new generation of switches in Ethernet that are specifically designed, dedicated to these kind of workloads, which are very different from the normal workloads that we see today traditionally in data centers. And we have to address that. They have to be, as I say, literally lossless -- virtually lossless, very low latency and be able to scale into thousands of engines.
And that's the main 3 criteria we are aware of, and we're driving solutions -- silicon solutions that enable that. We have it but we think we need to improve the performance of what we have to -- in anticipation of a trend that we foresee over the next several years. And so we're putting a lot of investment in that direction.",431

So apparently over the last quarter, you were getting out of wireless, you're getting into wireless or handset guys are going to start doing wireless. So I wanted to get a couple of updates, so maybe you could set the record straight. First of all, even if you see a sea change in, let's say, silicon, mixed silicon baseband providers in the next year or 2, does that fundamentally change your opinion of your wireless group? And either way, actually. Does it get better? Does it get worse? Because obviously, if architectures change, it has a big impact on supply chain. And I know, historically, you've worked very closely with key players in helping develop all the other pieces of the puzzle like transceivers that are required if you're going to do your own. So maybe you could just kind of reset the bar on what you expect for, without guidance, but in general, the wireless division in the next year or 2, does it -- is that superior or greater?",174

As you know, our wireless group, as you call it, not division, is really not one single product line or one single division. It's not one homogenous group either. There's a few key products that comprises this wireless division, all selling, you're right, you're correct, to the same application and very high-end flagship status handsets and largely focused on one key customer, our North American -- our much beloved North American OEM customer. So in that sense, it's one single focus area.
And to answer your question, while we're on these multiple products and they tend to keep -- progress as each new generation happens may not be every year, but it happens fairly regular frequency on a cadence that is pretty predictable of the one -- each on its own cadence. It's a very, very good business for us.
And to answer your question directly, no, nothing meaningful has changed. Our relationship, our strategic engagement continues very much the same as it has for the last multiple years. And we see that to continue in a fairly predictable, stable manner.",185

So I'm trying to put together a perspective of what's happening at hyperscale clients this year. So if I look at your networking division, if you grow like at least $600 million this year in AI and if you have compute offload division growth by $1 billion, that might well represent all your growth in that -- in networking. So that would mean the only thing that is really growing and that is growing a lot this year in that space is AI. And when I look at outside of Broadcom, what we've seen is memory and like the x86 CPU servers are having a very difficult time at the moment. We expect a recovery in the second half, while like the GPU segment of the market is actually in very, very good shape and growing very well and accelerating again.
So my question at the end of the day is, is it fair to say that in these large data centers this year, only AI is growing? And is that a sign of what the future will be? Or do you think like the general purpose part of infrastructure like centered around x86 or similar or general purpose CPUs still is a very good growth market?",209

The problem is I do not -- my customers, hyperscale customers do not necessarily honor me by sharing all those insights that you are -- and on those questions you are asking. I do not know. I do not know. All I know -- what I do know -- because I don't sell them CPUs. I don't even sell them GPUs by the way.
But I know what you know out there, which is in certain areas of their business, we're seeing some of these hyperscalers bringing on a sense of urgency and focus and of course, spending to be up to speed, if not, to not be left behind as we see the excitement hyped perhaps in pushing applications and put workloads in generative AI. That's what we see driving a lot of this excitement. And we -- all we are saying is we've seen some of that effect on our networking business with those hyperscalers. That's what it is.
Beyond that, we -- unfortunately, other than the backlog we get in normal networking switches, routers and key components, we see that. And as I indicated in this last quarter's results, we continue to see sustained strength, now last quarter and continuing as we indicate this particular quarter, Q2.
Beyond that, we don't get to see -- we do not want to guide what we're going to see beyond that. But right now, last quarter, this quarter, yes, traditional data centers' scale out in networking and deployment in networking continues to be strong and sustained in hyperscalers as well, I might indicate, in the enterprise.",278

Maybe if I could, a clarification on that and then a broader question that I want to address on broadband. On the networking piece, I was curious if you could discuss the growth opportunity in your Tomahawk portfolio now that a peer has elected to stop investing in their switch division.
And then as it relates to broadband, several companies across the broadband ecosystem have guided a softer outlook due to a buildup of inventory, but quite frankly, that's been on the customer premise side. You obviously have more weighting towards fiber and sell into the infrastructure portion. And so I was hoping you could discuss how you're thinking about the growth of your fiber business within broadband both from an infrastructure side and a consumer equipment standpoint as governments begin to deploy funds for broadband infrastructure.",156

Yes, broadband is, for us, a very, very good business and very sustaining, used to be boring. Boring is good at this point. And last quarter, Q1, as I reported, we actually grew 34% year-on-year. In my view, that's rather exceptional even though, in broadband, we have been seeing year-on-year growth now at least for the past 4, 5 quarters. But still 34% was rather exceptional. And sure enough, Q2, it normalizes to a more sedate level, but still growing. And the growth in that is simply because we are very well positioned with respect to next-generation PON, 10-gig PON, which has been deployed in big volumes now by telcos supported by their governments, countries all over Europe and even in North America, not to mention other nations beyond that. Basically, it is about reaching this key utility broadband service to every household, and we see a lot of deployment.
And then more vertical market, we also see simultaneous with PON or fiber, as you call it, a large strong continued deployment of cable, DOCSIS 3 coaxial to the home because the cable operators, a few of them who are on the scale of the telcos and who need to maintain competitiveness as the telcos launch 10-gigabit PON, that cable has to update DOCSIS to be able to compete and not lose subscribers in the same market they compete against each other. So we see strength both in cable, DOCSIS 3.1, as I call it, and potentially next generation, not yet happening but hopefully within the next couple of years, DOCSIS 4.0.
Meanwhile, PON is happening, which accounts for the strength we saw last quarter and continuing strength over the last several quarters. And content increases come to not just unit deployment of those gateways and infrastructure but also the fact that a lot of these deployments come with very high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E. And that provides additional boost, content increases more, what I would call it, to our revenue growth in broadband. So that's quietly still chugging along very nicely for us. All right.",354

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in our fiscal Q2 2023, consolidated net revenue was $8.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 9% year-on-year to $6.8 billion, and Infrastructure Software grew 3% year-on-year to $1.9 billion as the stable growth in core software more than offset softness in the Brocade business. 
Now as I start this call, I know you all want to hear about how we are benefiting from this strong deployment of generative AI by our customers. Put this in perspective, our revenue today from this opportunity represents about 15% of our semiconductor business. Having said this, it was only 10% in fiscal '22, and we believe it could be over 25% of our semiconductor revenue in fiscal '24. In fact, over the course of fiscal '23 that we're in, we are seeing a trajectory where our quarterly revenue entering the year doubles by the time we exit '23. And in fiscal third quarter '23, we expect that this revenue to exceed $1 billion in the quarter. 
But as you well know, we're also broadly diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software company. And in our fiscal Q2, demand for IT infrastructure was driven by hyperscale, while service providers and enterprise continue to hold up. Following the 30% year-on-year increases we have experienced over the past 5 quarters, overall IT infrastructure demand in Q2 moderated to mid-teens percentage growth year-on-year. As we have always told you, we continue to ship only to end-user demand. We remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We exited the quarter with less than 86 days on hand, a level of inventory consistent with what we have maintained over the past 8 quarters. 
Now let me give you more color on our end markets. Let me begin with wireless. As you saw in our recent 8-K filing, we entered into a multiyear collaboration with a North American wireless OEM on cutting-edge wireless connectivity and 5G components. Our engagement in technology and supply remains deep, strategic and long term. Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion represented 23% of semiconductor revenue. Wireless revenue declined seasonally down 24% quarter-on-quarter and down 9% year-on-year. In Q3, as we just begin the seasonal ramp of the next-generation [ PON ] platform, we expect wireless revenue to be up low single digits sequentially. We expect, however, it will remain around flattish year-on-year. 
Moving on to networking. Networking revenue was $2.6 billion and was up 20% year-on-year, in line with guidance, representing 39% of our semiconductor revenue. There are 2 growth drivers here. One, continued strength in deployment of our merchant Tomahawk switching for traditional enterprise workloads as well as Jericho routing platforms for telcos; and two, strong growth in AI infrastructure at hyperscalers from compute offload and networking. 
And speaking of AI networks, Broadcom's next-generation Ethernet switching portfolio consisting of Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 AI offers the industry's highest performance fabric for large-scale AI clusters by optimizing the demanding and costly AI resources. These switches based on an open distributed disaggregated architecture will support 32,000 GPU clusters running at 800 gigabit per second bandwidth. 
Ethernet fabric, as we know it, already supports multi-tenancy capability and end-to-end congestion management. This lossless connectivity with high QoS performance has been well proven over the last 10 years of network deployment in the public cloud and telcos. In other words, the technology is not new. And we are, as Broadcom, very well positioned to simply extend our best-in-class networking technology into generative AI infrastructure, while supporting standard connectivity, which enables vendor interoperability. In Q3, we expect networking revenue to maintain its growth year-on-year of around 20%. 
Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 20% year-on-year. And as we noted last quarter, with the transition to next-generation migrate, largely completed and enterprise demand moderating. We expect server storage connectivity revenue in Q3 to be up low single digits year-on-year. 
Moving on to broadband. Revenue grew 10% year-on-year to $1.2 billion and represented 18% of semiconductor revenue. Growth in broadband was driven by continued deployments by telcos of next-generation 10G PON and cable operators of DOCSIS 3.1 with higher attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E. And in Q3, we expect our broadband growth to moderate to low single-digit percent year-on-year. 
And finally, Q2 industrial resales of $260 million increased 2% year-on-year as the softness in China was offset by strength globally in renewable energy and robotics. And in Q3, we forecast industrial resales to be flattish year-on-year on continuing softness in Asia, offset by strength in Europe. 
So summary, Q2 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year. And in Q3, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of mid-single-digit year-on-year growth. 
Turning to software. In Q2, Infrastructure Software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. As expected, continued softness in Brocade was offset by the continuing stable growth in core software. Relating to core software, consolidated renewal rates average 114% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 120%. With the strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $564 million included $133 million or 23% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to these same core customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
And over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And among our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%. Because of this, our ARR indicator of forward revenue at the end of Q2 was $5.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago. And in Q3, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be up low single digits percentage year-on-year as the core software growth continues to be offset by weakness in Brocade. On a consolidated basis, we're guiding Q3 revenue of $8.85 billion, up 5% year-on-year. 
Before Kirsten tell you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, having received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and Taiwan and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. We still expect the transaction will close in Broadcom's fiscal 2023. The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era, and we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1096

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $8.7 billion for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.6% of revenue in the quarter, about 30 basis points higher than we expected on product mix. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year. R&D of $958 million was also down 4% year-on-year on lower variable spending. Operating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 10% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $6.8 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 9% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 71%, down approximately 120 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $833 million in Q2, down 5% year-on-year. R&D was $739 million in the quarter, down 4% year-on-year. Q2 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 9%, operating profit grew 10% year-on-year. 
Moving to the P&L for our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.9 billion, up 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 92% in the quarter. And operating expenses were $361 million in the quarter, down 3% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 73% in Q2, and operating profit grew 8% year-on-year. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 50% of revenues in Q2. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 32 days in the second quarter compared to 33 days in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter. We ended the second quarter with $11.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 9.9 years, respectively. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our common stock and eliminated $614 million of common stock for taxes due on the vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 5.6 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q2 was 435 million. As of the end of Q2, $9 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. 
Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 438 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.85 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q3, we expect gross margins to be down approximately 60 basis points sequentially on product mix. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",545

Thanks for the color that you gave in the percentage of the sales that it was potentially going to represent into the future. I wanted to just get a little bit more color on 2 aspects of that. How you're seeing the demand evolve during the course of your quarter. Has it accelerated in what areas, et cetera? And is there any competitive implications for it? We've heard from some of the compute folks that they want to do more on the networking side. And then obviously, you want to do more into the compute side. So I just wondered how the competitive intensity is changing, given the AI workload increases these days.",131

Well, on your first part of your question, yes, we -- I mean, last earnings call, we have indicated there was a strong pent-up demand, and we have seen that continue unabated in terms of that strong demand such that's coming in. Now of course, we all realize lead times -- manufacturing lead times on most of these cutting-edge products is fairly extended. I mean you don't make this -- manufacture these products under our process anything less than 6 months or thereabouts. And while there is strong demand and a strong urgency of demand, the ability to ramp up will be more measured and addressing demands that are most urgent. 
On the second part, no, we've always seen competition. And really, even in traditional workloads in enterprise data centers and hyperscale data centers, our business, our markets in networking, switching, routing continues to face competition. So really nothing new here. Competition continues to exist, and we all -- each of us do the best we can in the areas we are best at doing.",176

I think you might have mentioned it, but I think last quarter, you gave very specific numerical targets of $3 billion in ASICs and $800 million in switches for fiscal '23. I just wanted to make sure if there is any specific update to those numbers. Is it more than $4 billion in total now, et cetera? 
And then my question is, longer term, what do you think the share is going to be between kind of general purpose GPU-type solutions versus ASICs? Do you think that share shifts towards ASICs? Do you think it shifts towards general-purpose solutions? Because if I look outside of the compute offload opportunity, you have generally favored, right, more the general purpose market. So I'm curious, how do you see this share between general purpose versus ASICs play out in this AI processing opportunity longer term?",149
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3459.0,2830226.0,105350057.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,9,"On your first part of your question, you guys love your question in 2 parts, let's do the first part first. We guided or we indicated that for fiscal '23, that the revenue we are looking in this space is $3.8 billion. There's no reason nor are we trying to do it now in the middle of the year to change that forecast at this point. So we still keep to that guide -- that forecast we've given you in fiscal '23. We're obviously giving you a sense of trajectory in my remarks on what we see '24 to look like. And that, again, is a broad trajectory of the guidance, nothing more than that, just to give you a sense for the accelerated move from '22, '23 and hit it into '24. Nothing more than that. But in terms of specific numbers that you indicated we gave, it's -- we stay by our forecast of fiscal '23, $3.8 billion, frankly, because my view, it's a bit early to give you any revised forecast. 
Then beyond that, on your most broad specific questions, ASICs versus merchant, you know I always favor merchant, whether it's in compute, whether it's in networking. It's -- in my mind, long-term, merchant will eventually, in my view, have a better shot at prevailing. But what we're not talking -- what we're talking about today is, obviously, a short-term issue versus a very long-term issue. And the short-term issue is, yes, compute offload exists. But again, the number of players in compute offload ASICs is very, very limited, and that's what we continue to see.",269

On your next generation -- Hock, on your next-generation AI and compute offload programs that are in the design phase now. You've got your next-gen switching and routing platforms that are being qualified. Like are your customers continuing to push the team to accelerate the design funnel, pull in program, ramp timing? And then I think you might have addressed this, but I just wanted to clarify, all of these solutions use the same type of very advanced packaging like stacked die, HBM memory, [ cold-loss ] packaging. And not surprisingly, this is the same architecture used by your AI GPU peers, which are driving the same strong trends, right? So is the Broadcom team facing or expected to face like advanced packaging, advanced substrate supply constraints? And how is the operations team going to sort of manage through all of this?",158

In that -- this kind of AI product, this -- and this generative AI products, next-generation, current generation are all using very leading-edge technologies in wafers, silicon wafers and substrates and packaging, including memory stacking. And -- but it's from true consumption, it's still -- there's still products out there. There's still capacity out there. As I said, and this is not something you want to be able to ship or deploy right away. It takes time. And we see it as a measured ramp over, that has started in fiscal '23 and will continue its pace through to '24.",103

I can tell you this, I mean you're right, there's this AI networks, and this budget that are now allocated more and more by the hyperscale towards this AI networks. But not necessary, particularly in enterprise, at the expense of traditional workloads and traditional data centers. I think there's going to be -- there's definitely coexistence. And a lot of the large amount of spending on AI today that we see for us, that is very much on the hyperscale. And so enterprises are still focusing a lot of their budget as they have on the traditional data centers and traditional workloads supporting x86. And -- but it's just maybe too early to -- really for us to figure out whether that -- is that cannibalization.",134

I think earlier in the beginning of the call when you gave your AI commentary, you said that gen AI revenues are 15%-odd today is go to 25% by the end of 2024. That's practically all your growth. That's the $4 billion -- $3 billion, $4 billion that you'll grow. So looking at your commentary, I know your core business is doing really well. So I know that I'm probably misinterpreting it, but I was hoping that maybe there's not so many -- hoping that there's no cannibalization going on in your business, but maybe you could clarify for us.",111

We do not see -- obviously, we do not see cannibalization, but these are early innings, relatively speaking, and budgets don't change that rapidly. If there's cannibalization, obviously, it comes from where the spending goes in terms of priority. It's not obvious to us there is that clarity to be able to tell you there's cannibalization, not in the list. 
And by the way, if you look at the numbers that all the growth is coming from it, perhaps you're right. But as we talk -- as we sit in '23 and we still show some level of growth, I would say, we still show growth in the rest of our business, in the rest of products, augmented perhaps. That growth is augmented with the growth in our AI revenue in delivering AI products, but it's not entirely all our growth. I would say at least half the growth is still on our traditional business. The other half may be out of generative AI.",175

It's -- a big part of our growth now in AI comes from the networking components that we're supplying into creating this Ethernet fabric for AI clusters. In fact, a big part of it, you hit on. And the rate of growth there is probably faster then our offload computing can grow. And that's where we are focused on, as I say.

Well, we are still a very broadly diversified semiconductor company, as I pointed out, with multiple -- with still multiple end markets beyond just AI, most of which AI revenue happened to sit in my networking segment of the business, as you all noted, and you see. So we still have plenty of others. And even as I mentioned, for fiscal '24, our view is that it could hit over 25% of our semiconductor revenue. We still have many large number of underpinnings for the rest of our semiconductor business. I mean our wireless business, for instance, has a very strong list of life for multiyears, and that's a big chunk of business. 
Just that the AI business, appears to be trying to catch up to it in terms of the size. But our broadband, server storage, enterprise business continues to be very, very sustainable.

So no, and so we continue that way. And because of that partnership and loyalty, for us, price increase is something that is a very long-term thing and as part of the overall relationship. And put it simply, we don't move just because of prices. We stay put because of support, service and abiding sense of -- a very abiding sense of commitment mutually.",167

It sounded like your comments in the press release on the wireless deal did not include mixed signal, which is part of your past agreement. And everything you seem to have said today doesn't suggest that may not be the mix you've mentioned, wireless and RF, but you're also doing a lot of mixed signal stuff, too. So maybe you can provide some clarity on that. 
And now also, why shouldn't we expect the increased interest in generative AI to increase the prospects, if not there are orders immediately for the electro-optic products that are coming [indiscernible] So I would think that, it would be much greater demand, given the clusters and the size of these, or ways that people are trying to put together will provide most benefits, I think, in [ power limit ]. Can you maybe give us some color on that?",150

I love you guys with your multipart questions. Let's do the first one. You're right. Our long-term collaboration agreement that we recently announced, it includes, as it indicated, wireless connectivity and 5G components. It does not include the high performance analog components, mixed signal components that we also sell to the North American OEM customer. right? That doesn't make it any less, I would add, strategic, nor deeply engaged with each other. I would definitely hasten to add.

So you're talking about general AI and the increase in demand that you're seeing from hyperscale guys, and we're already seeing how big these clusters can get. And it's really putting, I don't want to say, stress on your networking assets. But I would think, given the size of the razor facing with the electro optic products that you're releasing next in Tomahawk 5 that you're releasing next year that puts Tomahawk right on the chip, it would become more attractive because it significantly reduces the power requirements. And I know no one use [indiscernible] deployed, but I would think that interest in that should increase. Am I wrong?",110

All this, as I indicated up in my remarks -- current remarks. Yes, we see our next generation coming up Tomahawk 5, which will have silicon photonics, which is [ co-packaging ] as a key part of that offering. And not to mention that it's going up to 51 terabit per second cut-through bandwidth. It's exactly what you want to put in place for very high demanding AI networks, especially if those AI networks start running to -- over -- to 32,000 GPU clusters running at 800 gigabit per second. Then you really need a big amount of switching because those kind of networks, as I mentioned, have to be very low latency, virtually lossless. Ethernet lossless [indiscernible] for some interesting science and technology in order to make Ethernet lossless. Because by definition, Ethernet tends to have been traditionally. But the technology is there to make it lossless. 
So all this fits in with our new generation of products and not to mention our Jericho3 AI, which, as you know, the router has a unique differentiated technology that allows for very, very low tail latency and in terms of how it transmits and reorder packets so that there's no loss and very little latency. And that exists in network routing in telcos, which we now apply to AI networks in a very effective manner, and that's our whole new generation of products. So yes, we're leaning into this opportunity with our networking technology and next-generation products very much. So you hit it right on, and which is, one, makes it very exciting for us in AI. It's in the networking area, networking space that we see most interesting opportunities.",283

Well, our core -- our software segment comprises, you hit it correctly, 2 parts. That's our core software products revenues and sold directly to enterprises. And these are your typical Infrastructure Software products, and they are multiyear contracts. And we have ton -- and we have a lot of backlog, something like $17 billion of backlog, averaging over almost 2.5, 3 years. And every quarter, a part of that renews, and we give you the data on it. It's very stable. And given our historical pattern of renewing on expanding consumption of our core group of customers, we tend to drive that in a very stable manner. And the growth rate is very, very predictable, and we're happy with that. 
Then we overlay on it a business that is software, but also very [ applied ] different, the sand -- fiber channel sand business of Brocade. And that's very enterprise-driven, very, very much so. Only used by enterprises, obviously, and large enterprises are there. And it is a fairly cyclical business. And last year was a very strong up cycle. And this year, not surprisingly, the cycle are not as strong, especially compared year-on-year to the very strong numbers last year. So that's -- well, this is the phenomenon. This -- the outcome of the combining the 2 is what we're seeing today. But given another my view next year, the cycle could turn around and Brocade would go on. And then instead of a 3% year-on-year growth in this whole segment, we could end up with high single digits year-on-year growth rate because the core software revenue, as I've always indicated to you guys, you want to plan long-term on mid-single-digit year-on-year growth rate, and that's the very predictable part of our numbers.",295

And the networking today are very, very still running Ethernet traditional data center networking because most enterprises is not -- virtually, all enterprises today are very much still running their own traditional service on x86. Generative AI is something so new. And in a way, so there what the limits of it is so extended that what we largely see today are at the hyperscale guys in terms of deploying at scale those generative AI infrastructure. 
Enterprises continue to deploy and operate standard x86 servers and Ethernet networking in the traditional data centers. And so that's still -- so what we're seeing today may be early part of the whole cycle, that's your question, which is why I cannot give you any definitive view opinion of how -- what the attach rate, what the ratio will be or if there's any stability that could be achieved anywhere in the near term.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3, 2023 consolidated net revenue, which is $8.9 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $6.9 billion, and infrastructure software grew 5% year-on-year to $1.9 billion. Hyperscale continued to grow double digits year-on-year, but enterprise and telco spending moderated.
Meanwhile, virtually defined gravity our wireless business has remained stable. Now generative AI investments are driving the continued strength in hyperscale spending for us. As you know, we supply a major hyperscale customer with custom AI compute engines. We are also supplying several hyperscalers, a portfolio of networking technologies as they scale up and scale out their AI clusters within their data centers, now representing over $1 billion. This represented virtually all the growth in our infrastructure business in Q3 this year-on-year.
So without the benefit of generative AI revenue in Q3, our semiconductor business was approximately flat year-on-year. In fact, since the start of the year -- the fiscal year, our quarterly semiconductor revenue, excluding AI, has stabilized at around $6 billion. And as we had indicated to you a year ago, we expected a soft landing during fiscal '23, and it appears this is exactly what is happening today.
Now let me give you more color on our end markets. As we go through this soft landing, we see though that our broad portfolio of products influencing the puts and takes across revenues within all our end markets, except one, and that is networking. And so in my remarks today, we focus on networking where generative AI has significant impact.
Networking -- Q3 networking revenue was $2.8 billion and was up 20% year-on-year in line with guidance, representing 40% of our semiconductor revenue. As we indicated above, our switches and routers as well as our Custom Silicon AI engines drove growth in this end market as they were deployed in scaling out AI clusters among the hyperscale.
We've always believed, and more than ever now, with AI networks that Ethernet is the best networking protocol to scale out AI clusters. Ethernet today already offers the low latency attributes for machine learning and AI, and Broadcom has the best technology today and tomorrow. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium with other industry partners, we are driving Ethernet for scaling deployments in large language model networks.
Importantly, we're doing this based on open standards and a broad ecosystem. Over the past quarter, we have already received substantial orders for our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch and Jericho3 AI routers and plan to begin shipping these products over the next 6 months to several hyperscale customers. This will replace the existing 400 gigabit networks with 800 gigabit connectivity. And beyond this, for the next-generation 1.6 terabit connectivity, we have already started development on the Tomahawk 6 switch, which has, among other things, [ 200G studies ], generating throughput capacity of over 100 terabit per second.
We are obviously excited that generative AI is pushing our engineers to develop cutting-edge technology in silicon technology that has never been developed before. We know the Moore's Law has set limits on computing in silicon technology. But what we are developing today feels very much like a revival. We invest in fundamental technologies to enable our hyperscale customers with the best hardware capabilities to scale generative AI. We invest in industry-leading 200G [ studies ] that can drive optics and even copper cables.
We have differentiating technology that breaks current bottlenecks in high-bandwidth memory access. We also have X high-speed and ultra-low power to chip connectivity to integrate multiple AI compute engines. We also have invested heavily in complex packaging technologies, migrating from today's 2.5D to 3D, which enables large memory to be integrated with the AI compute engines and accelerators. In sum, we have developed end-to-end platform of plug-and-play silicon IP that enables hyperscalers to develop and deploy via AI clusters in an extremely accelerated time to market.
Not surprisingly, in Q4 -- moving on to Q4, continuing to be driven by generative AI deployments, we expect our networking revenue to accelerate in excess of 20% year-on-year. And this has been driven by the strength, obviously, in generative AI, where we forecast to grow about 50% sequentially and almost 2x year-on-year.
Moving to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue, $1.6 billion represented 24% of semiconductor revenue, up 4% sequentially, flat year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customer continues to be deep and multiyear across WiFi, Bluetooth, touch, RF front end and inductive power. So in Q4, consistent with its seasonal launch, we expect wireless revenue to grow over 20% sequentially and down low single-digit percent year-on-year.
On our server storage connectivity revenue, it was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and flat year-on-year. With a difficult year-on-year compare, we expect server storage connectivity revenue in Q4 to be down mid-teens percent year-on-year.
And moving on to broadband following 9 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, revenue moderated to 1% year-on-year growth to $1.1 billion or 16% of semiconductor revenue. In Q4, despite increasing penetration of deployment of 10G PON among telcos, we expect broadband revenue to decline high single digits year-on-year.
Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $236 million, declined 3% year-on-year, reflecting weak demand in China. And in Q4, though we expect an improvement with industrial resales up low single-digit percentage year-on-year, reflecting largely seasonality.
So in summary, Q3 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 5% year-on-year. And in Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of low to mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year. Sequentially, if we exclude generative AI, our semiconductor revenue will be flat.
Now turning to software. In Q3 infrastructure software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. For core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 127%. Within strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $408 million, included $129 million or 32% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to these same core customers. And over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.
Over the last 12 months, I should add, consolidated renewal rates averaged 115% of expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 125%. Because of this, our ARR, the indicator of our revenue at the end of Q3 was $5.3 billion. In Q4, we expect infrastructure software segment revenue to be up mid-single digit year-on-year. And on a consolidated basis for the company, we're guiding Q4 revenue of $9.27 billion, up 4% year-on-year.
Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We have received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan and the United Kingdom and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Hart–Scott–Rodino premerger waiting periods have expired. And there is no legal impediment to closing under U.S. merger regulations.
We continue to work constructively with regulators in a few other jurisdictions and are in the advanced stages of the process towards obtaining the remaining required regulatory approvals, which we believe will be received before October 30. We continue to expect to close on October 30, 2023. Now, Broadcom is confident that the combination with VMware will enhance competition in the cloud and benefit enterprise customers by giving them more choice and control where they locate their workloads.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1250

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.1% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 8% year-on-year. R&D of $913 million was also down 8% year-on-year on lower variable spending.
Operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 6% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $122 million of depreciation.
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.9 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 160 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $792 million in Q3, down 7% year-on-year. R&D was $707 million in the quarter, down 8% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. 
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.9 billion, up 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter and operating expenses were $337 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year. The infrastructure software operating margin was 75% in Q3 and operating profit grew 13% year-on-year.
Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.6 billion and represented 52% of revenues in Q3. We spent a $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the third quarter compared to 32 days in the second quarter. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 2% sequentially. We continue to remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across the echo system. We exited the quarter with 80 days of inventory on hand, down 86 days in Q2 -- down from excuse me, 86 days in Q2.
We ended the third quarter with $12.1 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 9.7 years, respectively.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 million of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.7 billion of our common stock and eliminated $460 million of our common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.9 million AVGO shares.
The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was 436 million. As of the end of Q3, $7.3 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We suspended our repurchase program in early August in accordance with SEC rules, which do not allow stock buybacks during the period in which VMware shareholders are electing between cash and stock consideration in our pending transaction to acquire VMware. We expect the election period to end shortly before the anticipated closing of the transaction on October 30, 2023.
Excluding the impact of any share repurchases executed prior to the suspension, in Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 435 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $9.27 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be down 80 basis points sequentially on product mix. We note that our guidance for Q4 does not include any contribution from VMware.

The whole fabric with its AI engine represents literally the computer, the AI infrastructure. So it's hand-in-hand that our numbers have driven very, very correlated to not just AI engines, whether we do the AI engines or somebody else, merchant silicon does those GPU engines.

One has to make -- none of which I'm going to help you with as you know, because I don't guide next year. But except to tell you our AI revenue, as we indicated, has been accelerating -- on an accelerating trajectory and no surprise. You guys hear that because deployment has been extremely on an urgent basis and the demand we are seeing has been fairly strong, very strong. And so we see it accelerating through end of '22, now accelerated and it continue to accelerate through end of '23 that we just indicated to you. And for fiscal '24, we expect somewhat a similar accelerating trend.
And so to answer your question, we have always indicated previously that for fiscal '24, which is just -- which is a forecast, we believe it will be over 25% of our revenue -- of our semiconductor revenue -- over 25% of our semiconductor revenue.",162

On the clarification, Hock, can you talk about the supply environment, if that's a constraining factor for your AI business? And if so, what kind of growth from a capacity perspective do you expect into fiscal '24? And then my question is more on the non-AI side. As you guys talked about, you've done really well in managing your own inventory. But when you look across inventory levels for your customers or at your customers, it seems as though they're sitting on quite a bit of inventory. So what's your confidence level as it pertains to a potential inventory correction in your non-AI business, networking business going forward?",116

Well, on the first question, you're talking about supply chain. Well, these products for generative AI, whether they are networking and the custom engines take long lead times. These are very, very leading-edge silicon products, both in terms of across the entire stack from the chip itself, to the packaging to even memory, the kind of HBM memory that is used in those chips. It's all very long lead time and very cutting-edge products. So we're trying to supply like everybody else wants to have within lead times.
So by definition, you have constraints. And so do we, we have constraints and we're trying to work through the constraints but it's a lot of constraints. And you'll never change as long as demand orders flow in shorter than the lead time needed for production because the production of these parts are very long extended. And that's the constraint we see as they come in faster than lead times allow as orders come in.
The answer on your second part. Well, as far as we do see, we are kind of, as I indicated, I call it soft lending. Another way of looking at it is that $6 billion approximately of non-AI related revenue per quarter is kind of bumping up and down on a plateau. Think of it that way. We -- growth is kind of down to very little but still pretty stable up there. And so we have -- as I indicated, too, we don't have any one product in any one end market. We have multiple products. As you know, our portfolio is fairly broad, diversified and categorize into each end market with multiple different products. And each product run on its own cadence, sometimes on it's -- on the timing on when customer wants it. And so you see bumping up and down different levels. But again, it average just out over each quarter as we pointed out, around $6 billion. And for now, we're seeing that happen.",333

But is there a way to think or quantify about the headwind to gross margins this year from still elevated logistics costs and [indiscernible] costs as we think about the supply chain perhaps freeing up next year that perhaps could be a tailwind?",68
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2023",2023-08-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3378.0,2900450.0,107185620.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,21,"Karl, it is Hock. Let me take a [ step ] at this question because it's really a more holistic answer, and here's what I mean. The impact to us on gross margin more than anything else, it's not related to transactional supply chain issues. They -- I'm sure they have in any particular point in time, but not as material and not as sustained in terms of impacting trends. What drives gross margin largely for us as a company is, frankly, a product mix -- it's product mix. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a broad range of products even as we try to make order out of it from a viewpoint of communication and segment them put -- classify them into multiple end markets. 
Within this end market, your products, and they all have different gross margins depending on the -- where they used and the criticality and various other space. So they're different. So we have a real mixed bank. And what drives the trend in gross margin more than anything else is the pace of adoption of next-generation products in each product category, so think in that way. 
And you measure it across multiple products. And each time a new generation of a particular product gets adopted, we get the opportunity to lift -- uplift gross margin. And therefore, the rate of adoption matters, for instance, because for some products that changes gross margin every few years versus one that's more extended one. 
You have different gross margin growth profile. And this is what is all tied to the most important variable. Now the more interesting thing to come down to us on a specifically your question is during '21, '22, in particular, with an up cycle in the semiconductor industry. We had a lot of lockdowns, change in behavior and a high level of demand for semiconductors. Or put it this way, a shortage of supply to demand. There was accelerated adoption of a lot of products, accelerated adoption.
So we benefited -- among other things, not just revenue, as I indicated, we benefited from gross margin expansion across the board as a higher percentage of our products out there gets adopted into the next-generation faster. We pass this, there is probably some slowdown in the adoption rate. And so gross margin expansion might actually not expand as fast. But it will work itself out over time. And I've always told you guys, the model this company has seen and it's empirical, but based on this underlying basic economics, it's simply that when we have -- the broad range of products we have and each of them a different product life cycle of upgrading and next generation, we have seen over the years on a long-term basis, an expansion of gross margin on a consolidated basis for semiconductors that ranges from 50 to maybe 150 basis points on an annual basis.
And that's a long-term basis. In between, of course, you've seen numbers that go over to 200 basis points that happened in 2022. And so now later, you have to offset that with years where gross margin expansion might be much less like 50. And I think with that the process, you will see us go through on an ongoing basis.",548

The question really is, are you starting to see growth in backlog about a year out? So in other words, we can assume that we'll spend time at the bottom for about a year and then start to come back?

And frankly, my personal view is Infiniband has been the choice in the old -- for years and years, generations of high -- what we call -- what we have called before high-performance computing, right? And high-performance computing was the old term for AI, by the way. So that was it because it was very dedicated application workloads and not a scale out as large language models drive today. With large language models driving and most of -- all this large language models are now being driven a lot by the hyperscale. Frankly, you see Ethernet getting huge amount of traction. And Ethernet is shipping. It's not just getting traction to the future. It is shipping in many hyperscales. And it coexist Best way to describe it with Infiniband. 
And it all depends on the workloads. It depends on the particular application that's driving it. And at the end of the day, it also depends on, frankly, how large you want to scale your AI clusters. The larger you scale it, the more tendency you have to basically open it up to Ethernet.",189

I guess maybe a 2-part question on your Custom Silicon business. Obviously, the large customer is ramping really, really nicely as you described. But there are many other sort of large hyperscale customers that are considering Custom Silicon, maybe catalyzed by Gen AI, maybe some not. But I wonder if the recent surge in Gen AI spending and enthusiasm has maybe widened the aperture of your appetite to take on big projects for other large customers in that arena? And secondly, any appetite at all to consider custom -- switching routing products for customers or really a keen focus on merchant in those areas?",111

That's a very insightful question. We only have one large customer in AI engines. We're not a GPU company, and we're not -- we don't do much compute, as you know, other than offload computing having said that, but it's very customized. And I mean, what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to mislead you guys. The fact that I may have engagement, and I'm not saying I do on a custom program should not at all be translated into your minds as, ""Oh, yes, this is a pipeline that will translate to revenue."" Creating hardware infrastructure to run these large language models of hyperscalers is an extremely difficult and complex test for anyone to do. And the fact that even if there is any engagement, it does not translate easily to revenues. And I -- so suffice it to say, I leave it at that I have one hyperscale who we are shipping custom AI engines to today. I leave it at that, if you don't mind, okay?
Now as far as customized switching, routing, sure. I mean, that happens. Most of the -- many of the -- those few OEMs, some OEMs who are supplying systems -- switch systems, which are switches or routers have their own custom solutions together with their own proprietary operate -- network operating system. That's been the model for the last 20, 30 years. And today, 70% of the market is on merchant silicon. 
Not yet, I won't say for not the network operating system, but certainly for the silicon is merchant silicon. So the message here is, there's some advantages to doing a merchant solution here then to trying to do a custom solution as behavior or performance over the last 20 years have shown.",299

And the first is the AI upside. And the second is just the resilience of the core business and particularly storage and broadband in light of what have been kind of horror shows for some of your competitors who, I think, are in clear down cycles. So I've maybe been waiting for a reset in storage and broadband for a while, and it looks like Q4 gets a little softer here for you. Maybe you're calling that where you said a soft landing, Hock. So I guess maybe you can describe a little bit more for us what you mean by a soft landing. Does that mean that we have indeed landed here? Would you expect those businesses to be bottoming here at least? And I know you've talked about it before, you guys have had tight inventory management. But is there perhaps even a little bit more inventory showing up -- more inventory burn showing up for these markets? Or are the dynamics here, just all and demand that has started to deteriorate here?",193

First and foremost, and you've heard me talked about in preceding quarter earning calls, and I continue to say it, and Kirsten reemphasized it today, we shipped very much to only end demand of our end customers. And we're looking beyond in enterprise, even beyond -- and telcos even beyond OEM. We look to the end users, the enterprises of those OEM customers. We try to. Doesn't mean we are right all the time, but we pretty much are getting very good at it. And we only ship to that.
And what you're seeing is why I'm saying this -- what you're looking at, for instance, some numbers in broadband, some numbers in service storage that seems not quite as flat, which is why I made the point of purposely saying, but look at it collectively taking out generative AI. My whole portfolio of products out there. It's pretty broad, and it gets segmented into different end markets. And when we reach, I call it a plateau as we are in, you -- a soft landing, as you call it, you never stay flat. There will be some products because of timing of shipments come in more and some ship out the wrong timing come in a bit lower. 
And in each quarter, we may show you differences, and we are showing some of it that differences in Q3 and some even in Q4. And that's largely related to logistics, timing of customer shipments, particular customers and a whole range of products that go this way. This one I referred in my remarks as revenues, which puts and takes around a median. And that median, I was at [indiscernible] to highlight to you guys, has sit around $6 billion, and it has been sitting around $6 billion since the start of fiscal '23. And as we sit here in Q4, it's still at $6 billion. Now not quite there because there are some parts of it they may go up, some parts of it go down. 
And that's the puts and takes we talk about. And I hope that pretty much addresses what you are trying to get at, which is, is this -- what's -- the fact that is it a trend? Or is it just a flatter?

It seems to me by looking at what you're offering and the significant improvement you get over performance and size. This would be something of great interest. Is it limited by inertia or architectural inertia by the existing solutions? Or what kind of feedback you're getting? And why should we expect to see maybe enough because it's rather a new market for you overall. You've not been in it before. So I'm just trying to get a feel for what your expectations are and why maybe we should start looking at this more closely.",127

I didn't -- I mean my investment, at least you should look at it a bit. I'm just kidding. But we have invested in silicon photonics, which is, I mean, literally integrating in one single solution packaging. As an example, our switch, our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch, which will start shipping middle of next year, what we call -- the program we call the Bailly, a fully integrated switch silicon photonic switch. And you're right, very low power, and it's -- you make optics have always have optical and mechanical characteristics by sucking them into an integrated silicon photonics solution. You take away this failures on yield rates on mechanical, optical and translated to a literally silicon yield rates. 
And so it's much -- we like to believe very reliable than the conventional approach. So your question is, so why won't more people jump in it? Well, because nobody else has done it. This -- we are pioneering this silicon photonic architecture. And we're going to pull. We have POC done, POC, proof of concept in selling Tomahawk 4 in a couple of hyperscale, but not in production volume. We now feel comfortable. We have reliability data from those instances. And that's why we feel comfortable to now go into production launch in Tomahawk 5.
But as people say, the proof is in the eating. And we will get it in 1 or 2 hyperscale who will demonstrate how efficient power-wise and effective it can be. And once we do that, we hope it will start to proliferate to other hyperscalers because they cannot do it. If one of them does it and reap the benefits of this silicon photonics solution, and it's there. You know it. I have indicated the power is simply enormous, 30%, 40% power reduction. And power is a big thing now in data centers, particularly, I would add, in generative AI data centers. That's a big use case that could come over the next couple of years.",334

In our fiscal Q4 '23, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while infrastructure software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past 6 months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. 
Generative AI revenue driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion. 
Moving on to results for the year. For fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. And since 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth driven by semiconductor growing at an 18% CAGR over the past 3 years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of revenue. We returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on November 22, just about 4 weeks into Broadcom's fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private and hybrid cloud environments among large enterprises globally and divesting noncore assets. Reflecting the consolidation of a restructured VMware into our 2024 outlook, we forecast our fiscal year '24 consolidated revenue to be $50 billion. We expect the integration to take about a year and will require close to $1 billion in transition spending, which will largely be done as we exit fiscal '24. Regardless, we expect our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 60% of revenue. Kirsten will give you more details in her section. 
Now let me give you more color on our 2 reporting segments, and I'll start with software. In Q4, as you know, there's no VMware revenue and the infrastructure software business of CA, Symantec and Brocade grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
For the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%. Revenue in fiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year and our expectation for fiscal '24 is for this revenue to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. 
For the 2024 outlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by doing so, create private clouds on-prem. Our strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across the other data centers as well as on public clouds by consuming VMware's higher-value software stack. And to attract and keep these workloads across the environment, we are investing in a rich catalog of microservices tools. This will be our focus. And the noncore businesses of end-user computing and Carbon Black will be divested. So for 2024, based on 11 months of contribution from VMware, we expect VMware to contribute $12 billion in revenue. And on a consolidated basis, we expect our infrastructure software revenue in 2024 to be $20 billion. 
Turning now to the semiconductor segment. Let me give you more color by end markets. Q4 networking revenue of $3.1 billion grew 23% year-on-year, representing 42% of our semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for our custom AI accelerators and as well for our networking switches, routers and network interface dedicated towards scaling our AI data centers. As you know, even as Ethernet is the standard protocol in front-end networks, hyperscalers are also deploying Ethernet predominantly in their AI networks. In fiscal '23, networking revenue grew 21% year-on-year to $10.8 billion. If we exclude the AI accelerators, networking connectivity represented about $8 billion, and this is purely silicon, not systems, not cables nor subsystem. In fiscal 2024, we expect networking revenue to grow 30% year-on-year, driven by accelerating deployment of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. 
Moving to wireless. Consistent with the seasonal launch by a North American customer, Q4 wireless revenue of $2 billion increased 23% sequentially and declined 3% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. In fiscal '23, wireless revenue was relatively flat at $7.3 billion, in fact, just down 2% year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customers continues to be deep, strategic and multiyear. And accordingly, in fiscal '24, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year.
Next, our Q4 server storage connectivity revenue was $1 billion or 14% of semiconductor revenue and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal '23, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up 11% year-on-year. And going to fiscal '24, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high teens percentage year-on-year, driven by the cyclical weakness that began late '23.
And moving on to broadband. Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal '23, broadband revenue was $4.5 billion and up 8% year-on-year. Moving on to fiscal '24, we expect broadband revenue to be down low to mid-teens percentage year-on-year and reflecting, again, the further slowdown as the cyclical weakness at service providers that began in late '23 continues into fiscal '24. 
And finally, Q4 industrial sales of $236 million was stable year-on-year. In fiscal '23, industrial resales were $962 million. In fiscal '24, we expect industrial sales to be down low single digits year-on-year. 
So in summary, fiscal '23 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year to $28.2 billion. Revenue from generative AI in fiscal '23 reached 15% of semiconductor revenue in line with our expectation. And moving on to fiscal '24, we forecast Semiconductor Solutions revenue to be up mid- to high single-digit percent year-on-year. We expect revenue from generative AI to represent more than 25% of the semiconductor revenue consistent with prior guidance, which more than offset the lack of growth from non-AI semiconductor revenue. 
With the consolidation of VMware bringing our infrastructure software segment revenue to $20 billion and the semiconductor segment holding at mid-high single digit growth year-on-year, we are, therefore, guiding our fiscal '24 revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth from fiscal '23. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1119

Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940 million was also stable year-on-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 billion or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with our semiconductor segment. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 3% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 110 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were stable year-on-year at $822 million, resulting in operating profit growth of 2% year-on-year and semiconductor operating margins of 58%. 
Now moving on to our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $2 billion, up 7% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $339 million in the quarter. Q4 operating profit grew 12% year-on-year with Infrastructure Software operating margin at 75%.
Now moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 51% of revenues in Q4. We spent $105 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 31 days in the fourth quarter compared to 30 days in the third. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 76 days of inventory on hand, down 80 days in Q3. We ended the fourth quarter with $14.2 billion of cash and $39.2 billion of gross debt, of which $1.6 billion is short term. 
Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal 2023. Our revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor revenue was $28.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and represented 62% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of depreciation.
We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. 
Now turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2023, we spent $15.3 billion, consisting of $7.6 billion in the form of cash dividends and $7.7 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $7.2 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining. With the VMware deal closed, we have resumed repurchasing shares under our existing program. 
In fiscal year 2024, including the incremental shares from the acquisition of VMware and excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 494 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and now off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2024 to $5.25 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '24 subject to quarterly board approval. This implies our fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend to be a record $21 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 13th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. 
Now on to guidance. As Hock discussed, with the recent closing of our VMware acquisition and the integration process, which will take at least 1 year, for fiscal 2024, we will provide our outlook for the full year instead of quarterly guidance. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for fiscal year 2024 is for consolidated revenues of $50 billion. Within this, our fiscal year 2024 semiconductor revenue is expected to grow mid- to high single-digit percent year-on-year. Our fiscal year 2024 Infrastructure Software segment revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $20 billion, including $8 billion from CA, Symantec Enterprise and Brocade and $12 billion from VMware. 
With regard to VMware, our forecast for fiscal '24 revenue of $12 billion reflects 11 months of contribution from VMware. This does not include revenue from EUC and Carbon Black of approximately $2 billion, which we plan to divest. We are also converting an installed base of licenses that is over 60% perpetual today to one that will be mostly subscription by the end of fiscal 2024. Offsetting these, our new strategy for VMware will accelerate revenue growth over the next 3 years.
During fiscal '24, we expect to incur about $1 billion of spend related to transitioning VMware into the new Broadcom model. This transition spending will be largely completed by the end of the fiscal year as our VMware spending run rate exits fiscal '24 at approximately $1.4 billion per quarter, down 40% from a year ago. So in fiscal year 2024, including VMware, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of projected revenue. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",952

So kind of 3 related questions. What do you think about that number? And then number two, how does Broadcom participate in that, just on your large kind of ASIC project on the compute offload side? And then what does this larger AI accelerator market imply for your Ethernet networking business? I assume that they are correlated, but what is the right way to think about what is presumably a much larger market for accelerators and how it impacts Broadcom's growth prospect?",103

Starting with the first one, I mean, it's -- what we're seeing is a market that continues to grow, to accelerate. What is also very obvious is it's very, very dynamic as architectures of large language models, software models, continues to change. I mean, literally change on the fly. We are also seeing the requirements for compute silicon change. And it's very interesting, very fascinating for us, but it also presents quite an interesting opportunity, which is to say that if a customer has a business model that is substantial and have resources which obviously supports that, it's getting to a stage that it might make a lot of sense to design AI compute engines, which comprises memory as well as the compute engine itself, then that can be tailored or better word, customized, for their particular requirements on applications on their particular LLM model. 
And we're seeing this as we all are seeing LLM models continue to change and the pace, the shape of generative AI dynamically change more and more, where training and inference are now starting to, in a way, converge. And the chip designs are changing. And we are seeing that in the way we design specific custom chips for hyperscalers. That's interesting. So that's a very interesting opportunity for us. And as I indicated in my remarks, we see that revenue as part of networking revenue, $4 billion and networking for AI networks and going -- doubling almost in 2024. Nothing new. We have said that before. And if anything else, we are reinforcing that particular guidance. 
Now networking is particularly interesting as you heard in my opening remarks. It is accelerating as fast as our AI accelerators, the compute engines are growing. And we see that growing hand in hand and particularly so as training -- continuous training of very large language models with very different and very large parameters keep going on and things keep changing. So we're seeing no slowdown, in fact, in the update on building out this AI network. Anything else on average, we are seeing a doubling on size of those networks across the board. 
So that's -- to answer your question, yes, I fully concur with AMD, when they indicate that it looks like demand appears to be accelerating rather than staying stable or decelerating.",394

The clarification is, is the fiscal year guidance going to be the new protocol? Or is that just this quarter? And then the real question, Hock, is on the VMware side of things, Kirsten talked about it potentially accelerating off of that $12 billion base. Can you just talk about the linearity of it maybe throughout the year? Or more importantly, how is it going to be accelerating as people start to look at what the VMware Street estimates were before, we know we have to take out the 2 divested operations. But what are the drivers of acceleration? And how should we consider the magnitude of that as we look forward?",119

We are very -- we are in a very interesting, very, very exciting situation here as we move into the next chapter for VMware. As I said, we focus the business on VMware Cloud Foundation, which is the full software stack that virtualizes data centers, on-prem so not totally virtualize it, a cloud environment, and we are converting more and more customers as step-by-step as they come up for renewal into this higher value stack, and we're doing it on a subscription basis. So it becomes very focused. 
So we will kick it off at a much lower rate than -- because subscription generally brings down revenues, as you know, in software based on revenue recognition. But we see a trajectory of accelerated growth even in 2024 -- through 2024. And it just doesn't stop there because it's the math and the trajectory. And to answer your question, you're right, we are accelerating from $12 billion, and we're probably seeing a double-digit growth for the next 3 years, just by sheer math of selling that higher value virtualization stack versus the very loose component sales in the past, particularly on compute only.",193

So even off the lower revenue base starting in fiscal '24 for VMware, is the team still targeting $8.5 billion-plus of EBITDA in 3 years? And then for my main question, Hock, as you mentioned, right, one of the fastest growing workloads in accelerated compute is accelerated compute in generative AI. And all of these workloads are increasing at an exponential rate, right? You talked about the benefits to your silicon franchise. But given the significant performance requirements of these workloads, right, training, inference, it appears that more of the near-term adoption of running these workloads is on bare metal, GPU, TPU, accelerated servers.

Another way of describing it is VMware, the VMware Cloud Foundation software stack, the whole VCF stack, runs NVIDIA cooler, runs the NVIDIA GPU. That is the partnership. So if you're an enterprise. It's a very easy step to get into AI analytics because the data center that you as an enterprise own on-prem that runs VCF will by default run the NVIDIA GPU software stack as well.
Another way to put it, it virtualizes the NVIDIA GPU. That's the VMware software stack as well. So it's a very strong attraction in our -- from our perspective to, in fact, accelerate thinking of lot of enterprise to adopting the whole VCF stack. It's simply because not only does it virtualize the data centers and make your data -- on-prem data center much more resilient, easier to manage, lower cost to manage, it has the added benefit, a big attraction this is of being able to right away start running AI workloads.",190

How should we think about the beginning and exit rates on EBITDA margin relative to that full year total? And I guess, aligned with that, I think I heard you say you -- that VMware OpEx would be down 40% exiting the year versus the entry trade. I'm actually kind of surprised it's not down more. Maybe that's the reinvestment, but is that $1.4 billion per quarter for VMware, that's the right exit rate for VMware OpEx? And should we sort of go off of that or what?",110

We are on a -- as I indicated, I led to an earlier question by Vivek, I think, our revenue during this process, even 12 months, 4 quarters, is on the growth trajectory, just because of the way the math works. As we sell more and it's on revenue, and we recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Our revenue on a quarterly basis is on a growth trajectory. That will keep running and will keep running beyond 2024. But 2024 by itself won't be on a revenue trajectory that goes up very rapidly. So what you have think about picture is, is a revenue trajectory that into '24 that is expanding or growing while the expense -- operating expense total spend because of reduction of transition expenses is declining.

We are still in good shape. Now if you ask me, maybe server storage, that could be a little excessive, but non-broadband and certainly not in networking.
So overall, on our products, we still feel rather good about it and the best indication is the level of our own inventory on our own books. And -- but what we do see is customers are perhaps much more cautious about buying more stuff, not just because they didn't have too much of my inventory, I think because they have too much of everybody else's inventory out there.

What was the first question again? Sorry. Okay. Why do I choose to sell end-user computing and Carbon Black? Those are good assets. Let's make no mistake. They are very sustaining. They are very stable, good assets. And why we chose to sell them is typically our playbook. We focus very much so on -- in any acquisition where we see the biggest value for our business model. And basically, we then do not want to be distracted by noncore focus. And VMware for us is about core. It's about data centers, it's about core networks and core compute.
And so we're now going to invest and focus our sales and R&D on those core areas of VMware Cloud Foundation. And to us, end-user computing, Carbon Black, good assets as they may -- as they may be, we prefer to divest them. We'll find good homes for them because there are a lot of very interested parties who are more than happy to take those assets.

In CA, particularly where we're mainframe, but also some distributors, we focus very much, especially on a core customer base, which represents at that time, we bought it 70% of the overall revenue of those of CA. We focus on these customers. We focus on supporting them and we're continuing to basically give them really good support, feature request growth in the area. And that's how we then and -- we focus on Symantec too, which is a small core group of customers.
And a big part of it is the technology of CA, especially on mainframe is, honestly, is running a lot of legacy applications that are still very, very much alive today, but customers preferring to run it on those mainframe tools simply because it makes no sense to modernize or change for whatever reason, for their own good reasons. VMware, however, we're selling a product of the present and of the future. It is a growth product to be able to create a virtualized cloud environment in your own data center on-prem for any global company. The good thing about going to public cloud is it's also totally virtualized, but very resilient when you run -- when you run a software-defined environment.
We are creating with VMware, the same experience of virtualization of the data center on-prem for those companies, which have workloads, by the way, that are already running VMware products that application that's already written on VMware Cloud Foundation. This is then giving these enterprises as the opportunity to have a hyperscaler on-prem. That's the plan we're doing, plain and simple.",285

You're right, we had a great opportunity and thanks to a very supportive management team from VMware that engages with us very, very well. Again, it's planning. We cannot wait and see, we can't touch, but it goes through a lot of time to plan and think through. It also gives me a lot of opportunity to go out there. And over the past 12, 16 months, I must have talked one-on-one or in small groups to at least 150 CIOs globally of the largest customers of VMware out there. And one thing is very clear. The VMware core product, the VMware Cloud Foundation software stack that enables virtualization of not just computing, servers, compute, but storage, networking as well as orchestration and management layer over that whole stack, is something that CIOs, Head of Infrastructure of large -- many large companies out there really want.
They want to be able to deploy. They want to make their data centers, which is very heterogenous now between virtualization and compute to bare metal and the mix environment and different vendors where each is trying to optimize best-of-breed to one that is managing under a single abstraction layer across a diversity of hardware.
