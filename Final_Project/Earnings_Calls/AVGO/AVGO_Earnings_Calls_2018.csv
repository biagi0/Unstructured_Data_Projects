I am very pleased with our execution in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We drove gross margin to 66.6%, EBITDA to 52.3% and free cash flow to 42.3% of revenue, all record achievements for us and a continued demonstration of our robust business model. We were also quite active in executing on our recently announced stock repurchase program. Since the announcement, over a 6-week period through June 1, 2018, we have returned approximately $1.5 billion to stockholders by repurchasing more than 6.4 million shares. And we do intend to continue to be active. 
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.02 billion, just above the midpoint of guidance with strong wired and enterprise storage results, offsetting weaker wireless revenue. As a reminder, before I go and give you more color into this quarter, the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was a 13-week quarter while the prior quarter, Q1, was a 14-week quarter. Segment revenue comparisons reflect this as I discuss performance by segment. 
Starting with wired. In the second quarter, wired revenue was $2.3 billion, growing 9% year-on-year, 22% sequentially. The wired segment represented 46% of our total revenue. Second quarter wired results reflected strong sequential increase in demand from cloud data centers and a seasonal recovery in broadband access. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by robust increase in networking and compute offloading in cloud data centers and strong growth in spending by enterprise IT. We also benefited from an increase in spending on broadband capacity expansion by service providers. In contrast, however, spending on video access and in the China optical markets remain sluggish.
Turning to the third quarter fiscal '18, we expect growth in wired revenue to continue notwithstanding the ban on shipments to ZTE. We expect demand to remain healthy from cloud data centers and enterprise IT while broadband access remains robust.
Moving on to wireless. In the second quarter, wireless revenue was $1.29 billion, growing 13% year-on-year but declining 41% sequentially. The wireless segment represented 26% of our total revenue. Second quarter sequential decline in wireless revenue was deeper than usual as shipments to our North American smartphone customer reduced sharply from the atypically exaggerated first quarter. We did partially offset these declines from increase in our product shipments to our large Korean smartphone customer as they supported their new product launch. 
Looking ahead to third quarter, we expect to see the beginning of seasonal second half ramp in demand from our large North American smartphone customer as they start to transition to their next-generation platform. However, we expect this strength recovery -- I mean to say, this recovery to be offset by a decline in shipments to our large Korean customer. As a result, we're expecting our overall wireless revenue to be flat, maybe even slightly declining on a sequential basis for the third quarter.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. Second quarter 2018 enterprise storage revenue was $1.16 billion and represented 23% of our total revenue. This, of course, included a full quarter of contributions of over $400 million from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business. As you may recall, we had completed the acquisition of this business early in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. And as reported, enterprise storage segment revenue grew 63% year-on-year and 17% sequentially. But if we exclude Brocade contributions, second quarter enterprise storage revenue would have shown stable year-on-year performance with strong growth from enterprise server and storage markets, partially offset by softer demand from the hard disk drive market. For the second quarter, the overall sequential revenue growth was driven by broad strength from the enterprise IT sector. 
Looking ahead to third quarter fiscal 2018, we expect continued spending in enterprise IT to drive sequential growth in enterprise storage and growth in cloud storage capacity will lead to a recovery in hard disk drive demand.
Finally, our last segment, industrial. In the second quarter, industrial segment revenue was $263 million, growing 17% year-on-year, 5% sequentially. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue. Resales continued to remain very strong with 20% year-on-year growth, and we expect this momentum to continue into the third quarter. Notwithstanding the strength today, we expect annual industrial revenue growth, however, to be in the mid-single-digit range on a long-term basis.
So in summary, our overall business remains robust and stable. Our third quarter fiscal 2018 outlook reflects this with a consolidated revenue forecast of $5.05 billion at the midpoint as we experience continued strength in wired and enterprise storage benefiting from a very robust cloud data center and enterprise IT spending environment. 
Year-on-year, our revenue growth has remained very sustainable. Even with our contributions from Brocade, organic revenue growth for the second quarter would have been in the high single digits. And for the third quarter, we foresee this year-on-year organic revenue growth to modulate towards our long-term target of mid-single digits. We will continue to keep a consistent focus on improving margins and increasing free cash flow from our business. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with over $8 billion cash at the end of the second quarter. We also have $10.5 billion remaining on our stock repurchase authorization as of June 1. And reflecting the very strong free cash flow generation we expect during the balance of fiscal 2018, we plan to continue to aggressively repurchase our shares as long as we believe that we can generate superior returns in doing so.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review of our second quarter financials and third quarter outlook.",939

My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at Broadcom.com. 
Let me quickly summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Second quarter net revenue was $5.02 billion, in line with guidance. Our second quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 66.6%, 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. We did benefit from a more favorable product mix in the quarter driven by higher-than-expected revenue from our wired segment and lower-than-expected revenue from our wireless segment. 
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.46 billion and represented 48.9% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.63 billion and represented 52.3% of revenue. 
Our day sales outstanding were 50 days, a 5-day increase from the prior quarter as we saw reduction in linearity of revenue across the quarter. Our inventory at the end of the second quarter was $1.26 billion, a decrease of $56 million from the prior quarter. Days on hand remain flat from prior quarter at 67 days. 
We generated $2.31 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of $117 million of cash expended on acquisition and restructuring-related activities, including Qualcomm and Brocade. 
Please also note that we did not make any interest payments in the second quarter as these are made on a biannual basis in the first and third quarters of our fiscal year. The capital expenditure in the second quarter was $189 million or 3.8% of net revenue. As a housekeeping matter, I would also note that CapEx was $61 million higher than depreciation. 
Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx in the second quarter was $2.12 billion or 42.3% of net revenue and reflects the impact of acquisition and restructuring expenses. 
On the buyback, just to give you some more clarity, in the second quarter, we spent $347 million on repurchasing 1.5 million shares. These repurchases took place over the last 2 quarters -- 2 weeks of the quarter. Over the first 4 weeks of the third quarter, we have spent an additional $1.16 billion repurchasing 4.9 million shares. In addition, we returned $766 million in the form of dividends and distributions in the second quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We increased our cash balance by $1.1 billion through the second quarter and ended the period with $8.2 billion in cash and $17.6 billion in total debt.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. 
Net revenue is expected to be $5.05 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 66.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $882 million. The tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 7%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $115 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 457 million shares, and it does not include the impact from any share repurchases done after June 1, 2018. Stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $320 million. CapEx will be approximately $125 million. 
As you may recall, in connection with redomiciling to the United States and as a result of the effects of the U.S. corporate tax reform, we had initially expected our effective cash tax rate on a steady-state basis to be in the range of 9% to 11% per year. Following redomiciliation, we currently expect our cash tax rate for the balance of fiscal year '18 to be approximately 7% and our long-term cash tax rate to remain in the 9% to 11% range.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",670

Hock, last quarter, there was a lot of debate about why the year-over-year growth slowed so much, and you guided for a confident sequential growth that you just delivered. Talk a bit about the visibility going forward. What's driving the slight growth that you're guiding to in the fiscal third quarter? And can you still hit the mid-single-digit growth for the fiscal year in that wired segment?",76
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2018",2018-06-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3533.0,1486887.0,58931460.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,6,"Well, the wired segment, for us, especially the networking part of it that we have very good visibility right now and it's largely driven, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, from the cloud data center guys, the big cloud data center guys. What we also see, and that's probably less visible, is very strong spending patterns at enterprise. I call that enterprise IT environment, the more traditional enterprise. That's -- those guys have also been spending. So when you combine the 2 together, that portion of our wired infrastructure business, as it relates to networking broadly, as we describe it, is very strong. And of course, as in the separate segment we call enterprise storage, benefits get dropped along with that, so that's why you see very strong business in what storage might call near-line or what I call data center storage business. Very, very strong both of them. And that's very visible in many of these situations because the cloud data center guys tend to spend in fairly lumpy -- in a lumpy manner. And so you'll get a visibility as opposed to a more secular or trended manner as the enterprise IT guys are doing. So to answer your question, bottom line, that will drive our wired business to hit to our goal of mid-single-digit year-on-year growth for this year.",223

And I guess as my follow-up, switching gears on to the wireless side of things. It's good to see your big North American business is starting to turn up and that the business as a whole has stabilized. Can you just talk about whether via content or the unit side, how you think about seasonality in the back half of the year, given that there's so many different moving parts as content per SKU and what different customers are doing?",81

It's easier to look at it on a whole -- on a total basis and the second [ total ] basis. And also, there's unusual factors which we all thought would happen in that, as we move from iPhone 8 to iPhone 9 generation coming out that there's some caution in the level of build. And there is. We believe there is. But having said that, we also think orders coming in what I'd call in a normal seasonal pattern of strength. And we do see that very clearly now, and we do see bookings that extend all the way to close to the end of this calendar year from these North American customers. So we see back -- what is exactly back to -- trend to be normal patterns. The difference is what's the mix of the new generation phones versus legacy phones. And that's what might lead to some uncertainty of how much content changes or increases that might be. And very frankly, visibility is not that clear because it's hard to predict what level -- what will the mix of new generation phones versus legacy generation phones would be.",199

So some of the pushback on the companies that you've been so acquisitive that the feeling that there's a need to do more M&A. So just 2 things on that. Number one, with the current makeup of the business, can you talk about the long-term growth profile as you see it? And then the second part would be now that you're buying back stocks, your view of the opportunities to do M&A versus return cash through buybacks.",91

In terms of long-term growth of this company and the various franchise businesses that comprise our entire business and company, we've always said and there are no reason to change that at all to say that long term -- that we will achieve on a long-term basis, if you look over an extended period of time, an average compounded growth rate, average compounded growth rate of mid-single digits. No reason for us to change. The business model continues to be -- to demonstrate that, and we do not see anything that makes us think otherwise. Year-to-year, as we are seeing, you may see variations from that mid-single-digit. You see -- we saw that 2017 as it compared to 2016. We saw it strongly. Organic growth, taking -- stripping out the acquisition -- the contribution from acquisitions, we saw close to mid double-digit mid-teens year-on-year growth in '17. We're in '18, and I don't expect that mid-teens rate of growth to continue because, as I said, it's 1 year but it is still above in '18 mid-single digits, definitely. We expect it to moderate down to perhaps high single digits conservatively. And we expect that, but that's to be expected. You cannot expect the kind of breadth of our business in connectivity solutions largely and our major positions -- multiposition within connectivity solutions, especially in those markets where franchise products prevail to keep growing higher than the rate of growth of the entire semiconductor industry, not counting memories. There's no way. It has to modulate down, as I said before, to a level which is closer to the growth of the entire industry. We have to follow that. And the only variation to that whole thing, as we think through this, is simply that every -- is that like all technology business, every new generation -- every time a new generation pops up and it varies in product life cycle from handsets, which is 18 months; to storage, which may be 5, 6 years; to industrial, which may be even longer, that each new generation brings an increased content. So we have a kicker above GDP growth rate is always why I say that. Hence, we end up with mid-single digits worldwide on a global basis. And we will see that long term. Even as in the short term, we see variations, and we saw it in '17, we're seeing into '18, but if you're willing ever to believe, you measure it over a long enough period, get confident mid-single digits.",424

And then just as a second part of that question around how you're evaluating kind of M&A opportunities versus the aggressive steps you're taking on the buyback.,29
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 07, 2018",2018-06-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3533.0,1486887.0,58931467.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,13,"We keep doing both as we do basically based on return on investment as we generate cash. One of the things we are seeing is our cash flow generation, as Tom indicated in his remarks, and especially last quarter and then last quarter is not an unusual quarter as we forecast going forward is our cash flow generation is very, very strong. Our free cash flow was north of $2 billion last quarter, and a big part of it relates to the fact that CapEx, which has been a big consumption of our cash flow over the last 2 years at least, between building up capacity and building up campuses in couple of locations, which involves big amount of money for cost reduction purposes -- cost reduction -- operating cost reduction purposes, but nonetheless suck up all our CapEx. It dramatically dropped as we finish those programs. And as Tom said, we are looking towards a CapEx level much lower than we have seen in prior years, in prior quarters. So that's enabling our cash generation to be fairly substantial. And on a quarterly basis, probably north of $2 billion free cash flow. So that's allowing us a lot more flexibility, which allows us to still look at M&A, as we do, and still be able to invest those -- that very strong stream of cash generation in a very good asset -- return-generating asset, our own shares, which is fairly simple. If you think about it, right, our own shares producing or generating over $8 billion. In the company, our market cap, we're talking over 8% cash-on-cash return [ compared ] in our own shares. So of course, we will keep doing that, especially for the flexibility of generating a lot of cash, but that doesn't mean we stop doing M&A. We are continuing to look, and we go by the criteria we have on cash-on-cash return. And as we see opportunities as we still do, we will act on those M&A opportunities.",334

This question is for Hock. On the wireless, the guidance seems to be implying a flattish on a year-over-year basis in terms of growth for the fiscal third quarter.

I think if you look at the operating expenses, they've effectively flattened out here at these levels. We might see them come down a bit, especially as you look in '19, but it's a fair level. We don't see expenses increasing from here much. And we obviously think we still have a lot of leverage from a gross margin standpoint and continue to see gross margins expand. But the trend you've seen over last several years, we don't see that stopping anytime soon. And so we put that together, we believe that we've got a lot of capacity to continue to improve. Our operating margins, as Hock talked about, CapEx is coming down. I mean this is a largely established company, a CapEx-light company when you look at the fundamentals. And so we're driving CapEx down to more like $100 million a quarter, which suggests you're going to be running much closer to 2% as a percentage of revenue. And so free cash flow margins, which we have a target of 40%, we think that can continue to improve and likely to improve, obviously, north of 40% if you do that math.",209

First, just on capital allocation, now that buybacks are part of your broader capital allocation, does the bar for M&A for deals here essentially become higher because plan b would be, assuming you buy your own stock, buying something at an 8% cash yield with no integration issues. So I'm curious, does the bar for deals become higher? Or how do you look at the cash and cash targets today now that you have the option to do buybacks?",85

I'll just reiterate it maybe with a little more color. But basically, it's a returns-driven phenomenon. You can see our views on the returns of our -- buying back our own stock based on our execution to buyback over the last month-plus, so I think that's self-evident. Going forward, as I've said, we always look to drive double-digit returns from an M&A standpoint. Obviously, we think we know how to do integration, and so we'll take a risk-adjusted view of it. But as long as we think we can find opportunities that are well in excess of where we can buy own stock at, we'll, obviously, take a very close look at that. But without that in mind, obviously, the stock over the last month plus has looked attractive to us based on the stock that we bought back and continue to do so, as Hock said, given the returns.",157

I understand the impact that mix might have as far as your revenue growth in the back half of the year. But as you think sort of flagship to flagship at your North American customer, how should we think about content growth this time around? And perhaps differentiate between RF and other applications. And I guess on the RF stack, we'll start to see some initial 5G modems coming out of the end of this year. I'm just wondering what kind of visibility you have for continued growth thus far as the world transitions from 4G to 5G.",111

That's given. That's very well proven. That's very well known. When would 5G really come in and what fashion it will come in because the initial phones will likely be claimed to be 5G but not truly 5G so the specifications don't have to be as rigorous for performance. People will try to -- phone makers may use -- especially in the lower end, not higher end, use software alternatives and soft filters and get away with it because performance doesn't matter, just the socket. But when you really get deeper and deeper into 5G, you need FBAR filters to make it work given. So think of it long term, content will step up. No question. Not only more frequencies, but frequencies that demand the need for FBAR. Beyond that, who knows?",186

So I know last year around this time, you gave us a number for content. You said that your North American customer was up 40%. Obviously, that may have changed a bit given the mix. And it sounds like you're suggesting mix going forward of new phones versus legacy is an unknown. But if the mix, I guess, into 2019 was the same as what we saw this year, what do you think your content at your North American customer would be? That should be a math problem you ought to be able to do.",103

But even I tell you, how are going to check it against revenues, which is what I will say is most important because the legacy phone will vary -- if the mix of legacy phones start increasing dramatically, you will reflect on the different set of content. What you're asking is what -- it's not really what the content. What's the revenue over the next few quarters? What it's going to look like? And based on -- you're trying to do simple math on content. But I say you have an unknown equation which says the legacy phones may increase in percentage, which then dilutes any increase in content. And then the revenue will reflect what you're looking for. I'm basically trying to answer your questions for you by saying that if you're looking for [ rel ] what else -- on a simple correlation between content increase and revenue change, I'm saying there are other factors that are coming in that might dilute that whole equation. And so answering that question that you ask in simple terms doesn't answer the underlying interest that you have. I will say, in broad scope, content direction and trends haven't changed at all. But the mix of legacy, the mix of phone SKUs, and in some situations, if you look beyond a North American OEM and look at other high-end smartphone makers, which we sell to and their varying performance, all will skew your numbers. I mean your math request is easy. And I'll tell you the math request is that the strength in content increase has not changed. But it doesn't show you anything.",273

But I mean your old -- like long-term normalized outlook was for end market units to be relatively flat, given, call it, premium phones aren't growing very much. But you have mid-double-digit -- over the long-term mid-double-digit content increase, you're not changing that long-term point of view.

Let me ask about storage really quickly. So obviously, that's growing well right now in conjunction with the networking portion of enterprise. They've got similar drivers. I'd say storage, historically, has tended to be quite a bit more lumpier though than the wired business, and it just rose 17% sequentially and it looks like on a mostly organic kind of quarter. I guess how should we think about the drivers of that and I guess the lumpiness that may continue with that going forward? I think, historically, you've given, again a longer-term view of that business overall was roughly flattish plus or minus. Like how should we be thinking about the near-term drivers of that and how those may play out over the rest of the year?",129

Let me correct some perceptions. And maybe it's our fault for not articulating it clearly enough. If you strip out Brocade, I was trying to say -- only if you do a year-on-year comparison, you have to strip out Brocade from current year, fiscal '18 result. Our revenue in enterprise storage year-on-year is single digits growth as you expect enterprise storage to typically happen. And this is a very stable kind of business. It doesn't do cartwheels and funny stuff like that, but it's very stable and extremely, extremely sticky and profitable. That's storage. And it will be. And even in fiscal '18, we've seen super strength, especially with near-line data -- cloud data center buying more high-capacity drives, hard drives, we'll still grow maybe closer to high single digits year-on-year, which is unusual for enterprise storage. What perhaps confused the mix is we now add year-on-year comparison Brocade, and that leads to that 17%. Otherwise, year-on-year, please don't expect double-digit growth on storage. At best, flattish to single digits is the norm for it.",176

In every franchise -- product line franchise we have, and we have 20 of them, we are in the lead. That's the definition of why we call it franchise, and that's our business model that we are the lead. Whether we grow it organically ourselves or acquire and strengthen and sustain those, we are the #1 in each of the segments. No different in wireless, be they in wireless we sell, most notably RF front end, FBAR filters in other words, built into it, or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo ship, or as we call it, wireless connectivity. Very much, we're the #1 and in the lead. And we always, having said that, have competition. You can't enough. World is large. You always have competitors. But we are always in the lead, and we always, as our key business model, continue to invest as we need to continue, if not extend our lead. And to answer your question, in RF front end, which I assume that's what you're addressing rather than wireless connectivity or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, where that -- nobody is even within range. In RF front end, we are very much in the lead, and we have that lead now for many years, and we continue to invest to keep that lead. And it has not changed. Believe me, it has not changed. The lead that we have been able to design -- add strength and design those RF front-end components, which includes a lot of it FBAR filters, our key element of strength and power amplifiers like so and the normal switches and little components that add up to an RF front end. But especially where it relates to FBAR. We're in the lead in architectural. We're the best at creating those RF front ends that enable high-end phones to deliver the kind of performance and bandwidth that they generate for -- that you see around you. And we continue to make sure we are very much in the lead. So as far as I'm concerned, that hasn't changed. The business hasn't changed. The franchise, to answer your question directly, is not at all in jeopardy. Maybe that's a clear answer to all you guys out there, is we do not see -- and we're just not trying to be cavalier or complacent. Well, far from complacent in any one of our franchise business. We continue to remain the lead, and we ensure we are -- continue to be in the lead as we look forward 1 generation, 2 generations. That hasn't changed. The franchise is not in jeopardy.",430

I mean, obviously, it is mix as well. I mean, if you look at the growth Hock's been articulating around cloud and enterprise IP, we've added Brocade, these are all very margin-accretive activities. As revenue grows as well, we're seeing our businesses that were lower performing carried with it lower gross margins that acquired from Broadcom, in particular, continue to improve. As you know, it takes several years to go from actually designing-in the product to shipping new products in volumes, some of the businesses we've owned for less than a couple of years. And so all those things as well as the day-to-day normal operating improvement is driving gross margins up. Clearly, we're focusing on value-accretive R&D. So we're spending nearly $3 billion in R&D. All of that is focused on delivering greater and greater value to the customer. That's also very gross margin-accretive. So that gives us confidence that we can continue to improve it from these levels.",162

You see, we pick those franchise products, and those products are strategic components typically of the customers in each of the segments -- in each of the end markets we address. And as I say, one of the things that's great about technology business is it constantly evolves. I'm not using the word disrupt. I'm using the word evolution. It evolves. It grows up, switches, increases in bandwidth. The top of the right switch we're launching now is 12.8 terabytes. Features a lot, but let's use capacity. The routers we have, same situation. The 30s we have out there to support our building block products and a few -- a bunch of other products we have, has gone from -- has now reached a level of 102 gigabit per second. As we go up higher and higher, the bar in challenging our products goes up correspondingly. I almost want to say, use the word in many cases, exponentially. You have to spend the money to deliver those kind of very high-technology products. And it gets harder and harder as time -- as generation progresses in every one of our products. Even a thing as PCI Express generation 3 going to generation 4 is a huge challenge for most silicon guys out there. We can do it. 30 is going from 25 gigabits to 56 gigabits to 112 gigabits, as I said earlier. We are finding less and less people out there able to come even close to what we do. And because of that, we're delivering high content. When you increase bandwidth, which is a big part of what we do, higher bandwidth allows more data transfers, allows us to get better value for those products. And that's what drives the gross margin. All this -- the spending, is mostly in R&D. The spending is not in making the product more -- is not in cost of manufacturing going up. It's more in the R&D spending to design and enable the product to come out. So it's normal that the gross margin goes up. It's also normal that the cost of doing R&D is stepping up, too. And that's something we're very disciplined on how we make sure we get a good return. But really, the cost of manufacturing more and more sophisticated, higher-performance product doesn't change -- doesn't increase as fast as the value we add to our customers. And that's why you translate it to higher and higher gross margin. The same applies in wireless to RF front end. I'd like to say that it's harder and harder, the value goes up, but the cost of manufacturing goes up less. And that's the explanation for why our gross margin has been trending or creeping up generation after generation, year after year.",505

I'd be direct with you. I don't know the final outcome and ancillary either, but we see strength today and looking forward to the next generation in both merchant silicon and ASIC implementations of the kind of products we do. We're both. And in fact, in many situations, on large cloud guys who have the scale to ask for unique ASICs, those -- some of those unique ASICs get their platform from our merchant silicon. And so it becomes like -- in many cases, it's -- now we're saying it's almost an ecosystem play. It's a whole fabric or network play. It's not one component by itself, and we're seeing that. And I would say both. Both merchant silicon is moving along very strongly as is ASIC or semi-ASIC -- semi-custom development. And this is -- when you say that the cloud guys want to do their own silicon, I'm afraid to say they can only do so much of the silicon. As you know, there's a whole spectrum when you do a silicon from right and the front-end definition, architecture definition, chip definition to the RF front-end design RTL, all the way to the back-end. And no cloud guy can cut across the entire spectrum. They'll do only parts of it. There's always room for a silicon supplier like us who are able to do across the entire spectrum. And with $20 billion of revenues, we -- our scale enables us to not only do things better than most other suppliers out there in silicon, but it also gets us to the scale of cost that is hard to match and across a wide diversity of products. In other words, our cost of developing 7 nanometers spread across such a wide spectrum of products is very, very cost effective as the IP, intellectual property, we develop to support many of our unique products very low. And you see that in the kind of financial performance from -- articulated.",333

So if you do that math, obviously, this is a business that's meeting, if not, exceeding our expectations, but I don't want to get any more detailed than that.",112

The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of very sustained revenues, strong earnings and free cash flows. 
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.07 billion, 13% increase from a year ago, and EPS came in at $4.98, a 21% increase from a year ago, while free cash flow at $2.13 billion is 42% of revenues.
We have a lot to cover today, so let's dive right into the segments. Starting with wired. In the third quarter, wired revenue was $2.3 billion, growing 4% year-on-year, and this segment represented 45% of our total revenue. Third quarter wired results reflect strong year-on-year growth for both our networking and compute offload businesses, driven by robust demand from the cloud data center markets as well as traditional enterprises. Networking and compute offload represented approximately 60% of our total wired segment in the quarter and grew over 10% year-on-year in the quarter. This is off the back of growing over 15% annually in the second quarter.
So this part of the wired segment is doing really well. However, cyclical headwinds in certain parts of our broadband businesses have impacted year-on-year growth for the wired segment. While digital subscriber line or DSL demand remained stable, demand for PON, Fiber-to-the-Home in China as well as video access, particularly North America, has been soft compared to a very strong 2017. As a result, broadband was down year-over-year in the third quarter after being down in Q2 as well.
Turning to the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. We expect networking and compute offload to continue to grow double digits year-on-year, as strong demand from both the cloud and traditional enterprise sustain. However, cyclical headwinds we have seen in video access, including cable and satellite, are persisting into the fourth quarter; and as a result, in the fourth quarter, we expect wired to grow only mid-single digit year-on-year.
While on the other hand, we are very encouraged by the prospects for fiscal 2019. We expect strong growth in our networking business to continue, driven by new product ramps of our Tomahawk 3 switch and our Jericho 2 router platforms. We also continue to see strength from our deep learning ASICs with our cloud customers, and we forecast broadband video will bottom this fourth quarter as we start to enter an up cycle in 2019. On enterprise wireless access too, we expect to be the first to enable -- integrate the 802.11ax chipsets during this coming year among service providers, enterprises and homes.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. For the third quarter 2018, enterprise storage revenue was $1.25 billion, representing 25% of revenue. As we had experienced and mentioned in our wired networking businesses, robust enterprise IT spending drove over a 70% year-on-year revenue increase. This, of course, includes contribution from Brocade. But even without Brocade, storage was robust year-on-year in the third quarter. Looking at the fourth quarter, strong demand from enterprise continues to be good, and we expect year-on-year storage revenue growth to accelerate.
Moving on now to wireless. In the third quarter, wireless revenue was $1.3 billion, which was flat year-over-year. The wireless segment represented about 25% of our total revenue. In aggregate, wireless revenue were in line with our expectations for the third quarter. We benefited from the initial seasonal ramp at our North American OEM customer, which was partially offset by anticipated decline in our other large wireless customer. We expect this ramp at our North American OEM customer to drive wireless revenue to be over 25% sequentially even as it may be down single digit year-on-year.
Let me take some time to put this in perspective.  Like all our franchises, our RF front-end business, which makes up roughly half of our wireless segment, competes and competes very well based on its technology leadership and its ability to deliver differentiated high-performance products, generation after every generation. To generate the high returns we expect on our substantial R&D and manufacturing investments, we focus on delivering the best FBAR technology in every new generation of smartphones.
Nonetheless, from time to time, not that often but time to time, the same technology platform used by our customer may extend beyond one generation. And when this happens, it does create an opportunity for our customer to temporarily use lower-performance alternatives in selected SKUs.
With the benefit of hindsight, this may be precisely what happened with this 2018 generation. But every indication we have is that the cadence of annual platform upgrades will resume in the upcoming 2019 smartphone generation, and we believe we are very well positioned to win back the platform. And with 5G on the horizon, we expect this cadence of annual upgrades to sustain.
As a result, we are maintaining our high level of investment as the market transitions to 5G.
Meanwhile, in WiFi, Bluetooth, the transition to 802.11ax continues to keep us in the lead. We believe we are very well positioned to sustain this particular franchise over the next several years; and accordingly, we expect to see our wireless revenue returning to double-digit growth in fiscal 2020 following a temporary dip in fiscal 2019.
Finally, our last segment, industrial. In the third quarter, the industrial segment represented 5% of total revenues. Excluding IP licensing, industrial business was up over 10% year-on-year. Distribution resales continued to be strong with double-digit Q3 year-on-year growth. We expect the demand environment for industrial to remain strong and industrial resale to maintain double-digit year-on-year growth during the fourth quarter.
So in summary, we continue to execute well on our business model. More than half our consolidated revenue, you may note, is benefiting from strong cloud and enterprise data center spending. This, coupled with a seasonal uptick in wireless, will drive our forecast revenue in the fourth quarter to be $5.4 billion, an increase of 11% from a year ago.
In the meantime, our margins continue to expand due to our focus on technology leadership and high-performance products. This is all driving exceptional cash flows, which provides us great flexibility in our capital allocation model of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand our earnings capacity going forward.
Speaking of acquisitions, before I turn this call back to Tom to talk about the financials in greater detail, let me perhaps take a few more minutes and talk about CA Technologies. The #1 question we get from -- we get with CA is why did we choose to buy them. Cut to the chase. We're buying CA because of their customers and their importance to these customers. CA sells mission-critical software to virtually all of the world's largest enterprises. These are global leaders in key verticals, including financial services, telcoms, insurance, health care and retail. And CA does have scale fairly unique to the infrastructure software space. This can only come from long-standing relationships with these customers that span several decades. In other words, these guys are deeply embedded.
Now Broadcom does a lot of business with the cloud companies building the digital economy. The leaders, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, are all large customers for us. They are growing rapidly, and we are, as you noticed, growing with them. They use our leading-edge silicon solutions to develop their next-generation data centers to enable many businesses worldwide.
On the other hand, when you look at the largest enterprises, which comprise CA key customers, these guys really have limited direct access to our mission-critical technology. In that lies what we think is a new and huge opportunity. Just as we have done with hyper cloud players, we believe we can bring our compute offload solutions, our Tomahawk switchers, Jericho routers, fiberoptics and our server storage connectivity portfolio directly to these same large enterprises that are buying CA software. These large end users invest tens of billions of dollars on IT infrastructure every year. Through CA, we believe we have a big doorway to engage strategically with these customers and provide them direct access at very compelling economics to the same leading-edge -- and link to the same leading-edge networking, storage and compute technology that are used to enable the cloud service providers today.
Beyond this industrial logic, I might note CA by itself is a great franchise. Mainframes remain the backbone of the enterprise computing environment and are relied on to run mission-critical applications. Mainframe process approximate -- mainframes process approximately 30 billion transactions per day and $7 trillion of credit card payments annually. Contrary to popular belief, over the last 10 years, mainframe workloads have actually increased 3.5x, driven largely by increasing amounts of data generated with every single transaction. Given mainframes power the most important parts of large enterprises, we believe this will remain a strong and stable market opportunity for us for a long time.
CA is a leader in delivering a suite of mainframe solutions across application development and ITOM tools. So bottom line, we actually see this opportunity a great opportunity, I might say, to double down for future growth.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom at this time.",1523
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,4238.0,1551910.0,61258974.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. Let me walk through our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Third quarter net revenue was $5.07 billion, just ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin from continuing operations was at the high end of our guidance at 67.3% as we benefited from the more favorable product mix in the quarter. Operating expenses were slightly lower than we expected at $874 million, driven by lower SG&A. As a result, operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.54 billion and represented 50.1% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.71 billion and represented 53.4% of net revenue. For housekeeping purposes, Q3 depreciation was $129 million in the quarter.
Below the line, net interest expense was slightly better than guidance due to higher interest income from our cash deposits. The tax provision was in line at 7% of operating income from continuing operations or $170 million.
The diluted share count was 453 million shares and includes the weighted average impact of the stock repurchases completed in the quarter. As a result, the company delivered $4.98 of EPS in the quarter. This represents 21% year-on-year growth, including the impact of share repurchases.
Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, increased approximately $209 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to an increase in receivables. This increase was driven by seasonally higher shipments in the last month of the quarter as well as the effect of a distributor consolidation program for the Brocade business, where we were providing a temporary extension of payment terms to facilitate the consolidation. In addition, cash restructuring expenses were $18 million as we are now at the tail end of the Brocade integration.
Finally, we spent $120 million on capital expenditures, which was slightly below expectations. As a result, free cash flow from operations was $2.13 billion or 42% of revenue. This represents 52% year-over-year growth in free cash flow from operations.
In the quarter, we returned $754 million in the form of cash dividends and spent $5.38 billion repurchasing 24 million AVGO shares. We did not pay down any debt in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $4.14 billion of cash, $17.6 billion of total debt and 438 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $5.4 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 67%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $394 million (sic) [ $874 million ]. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 7%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $125 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 436 million shares. CapEx will be approximately $110 million.
Before we open the call for questions, I want to update you on our financial model and capital allocation policy. On the financial model, there have been a lot of questions regarding our long-term growth and concerns about the growth rate of our core semiconductor business. The intention with the CA announcement has not been to signal a change in the growth rate of our core business. On the contrary, we believe our long-term growth rate for the semiconductor segment will remain mid-single digits driven by end market growth and content increases from new product introductions. 
As we acquire businesses outside of semiconductors, including Brocade and more recently CA, we are taking a conservative approach relative to our internal expectations on revenue growth. The returns we modeled do not require growth to hit our targets; but make no mistake, we do expect to grow these businesses. So the important message is that we do not see any fundamental changes in our long-term growth rate.
Now on to capital allocation. Here at Broadcom, we have a set of complementary highly profitable technology franchises that require limited capital expenditures and that sit on top of an efficient corporate platform. This in turn spits out a substantial and sustainable base of cash flows that we expect will grow over time. This expected cash flow generation provides us with a lot of flexibility on how we allocate capital to create value for you, the shareholders.
We are committed to our policy of distributing 50% of our prior fiscal year free cash flow to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. Given our fourth quarter outlook and expected full fiscal year '18 results, we anticipate another substantial increase in the quarterly dividend for calendar 2019.
Now with the remaining free cash flow, we see the opportunity to do a couple of things. One, we plan to continue to buy back shares. We currently have $6.3 billion left on our $12 billion stock repurchase authorization that extends through the end of FY '19. And two, with a focus on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, we believe we also have the cash flow and the borrowing capacity to continue to expand our earnings base through strategic and accretive acquisitions.
Finally, as previously announced, we have cleared HSR with respect to the CA transaction in July. The transaction is still subject to CA shareholder approval and antitrust approvals in the EU and Japan. We expect to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018.
That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we request that you limit yourselves to one question each. So with that, operator, could you please open up the call for questions?",970

Our business model is very much focused on putting together a portfolio -- or not -- a portfolio of what we consider product technology, product franchises. And that's not necessarily limited to IT infrastructure or networking or data centers in any particular specifics. As you noticed, we have a range of products that sells into multiple end markets, which ranges from wired, and even in wired, we have made the distinction, as I said, of networking data centers as well as more service provider spending as it relates to carrier access and PON and video delivery. And that's 2 sets of end markets by itself. Then we have enterprise storage, which is very data center centric, [ I mean ]. But then you're right. We have wireless, which is, as we define it, is very focused on mobility on smartphones, where we put up the best latest technology. And finally, we have industrial where there are a set of products that goes to various industrial products and it's reconnected to the data centers. So they are very disparate. They are very diverse, and therein, in our view, lies our strength. It's a very set of diverse product franchises, and that's the key operating word, franchises. But each of them has very -- a set of common characteristics. One is they operate in niche markets typically. Those aren't just niche markets that become mass markets because mass markets have moved over to these niche markets. And -- but two is we have the technology, and more than technology, we are the leader in technology in each of these niche markets. And we tend to have the lead -- we tend to have the highest market share, too, in each of these end markets. And the common thing we do is it all sits on a platform, but each of those niches keep investing, and you're seeing the level of dollars we invest. We're investing over $3 billion, $3.2 billion a year just on R&D and product development as we move to each product generation and evolve the technology for use of our end customers. And we make sure we lead in each of those. And so we still believe -- to answer your questions specifically on wireless, we believe our position in wireless, in those wireless niche markets -- in those wireless products and markets, that we are very much in the lead technology. We are lead in market share in the niches we're in. So it's satisfying those considerations of us, of franchises in those specific markets as you would apply to switching and routing in data centers where we are very well represented too. And the benefit of all these particular franchises is they all are enormously profitable and they all continue to grow.",491

So today, it really feels like we need to better understand the Broadcom model, how Broadcom can create so much value from acquisition and how it can apply to CA. So in that spirit, my question to the 2 of you, Hock and Tom, would be can you tell us what you guys do like nobody else. What makes you unique at integrating a business you acquire and create value from these businesses like nobody else and in particular, like a private equity fund, for instance, will not be able to do? And then, of course, put that in the context of Computer Associate. How are you going to apply these unique capabilities to Computer Associate.",168

Interesting question. Let me try to address that if I could. One of which -- one -- to start off with, we are non-private equity, by no means are we. Why? We know -- we understand the businesses that operates in Broadcom very well, and we operate those businesses. We are not financial investors. The financial performance, the capital allocation that comes over here is exceptional. Cash flow, we generate out those, making those businesses very successful. Happens to be just the end product. We run those businesses, and we run them as a group. That's the biggest difference between us and private equity, very, very much so. So where we see our -- where we see some differentiating traits in how we identify and acquire those businesses and then integrate them into a whole as part of Broadcom is simply this. I think we're very, very aware of our ecosystem, what product lines, what markets are very sustainable, very good as potential profit and growth opportunities, and we are very focused. And that's a key thing. We are very focused in determining what differences make sense to invest in and what businesses we do not or should not invest in because it won't generate a return, which is why in -- to expand on my reply to the earlier question, today, Broadcom comprise of 19 separate product divisions. Each of them leader in their own right in each of those niche markets they are in. And by being extremely focused on continuing to be the technology and market leader, which basically means delivering generation after generation because one advantage in technology is you keep having to evolve with better and better products that your customers can use and ask for. As you do that, you actually create more and more value to your customers. And the extension of that is shown by the fact that if you look at our financials over the last several years, we expect our product margin, gross margin to say as a collective whole 100 basis points approximately every year. This is the same product. This is not about adding new acquisitions, which accrete the gross margin. We're talking about if you look organically at the same products that we have 3, 4, 5 years ago, you will see that margins expand as a whole. And the reason it can expand is because you're delivering more value to your customers. And so the real basic thing is be very focused. Stick to what you do very well and focus on where you are very successful and keep doing the same thing. And what we do when we look at acquisitions very simply is we look at companies where the opposite is actually sometimes happening, where the core business of the company -- of some of these business companies are not so focused on or neglected in many ways, and instead the bright, shiny objects get focused on where the strength of that particular company may not be so good. And we basically pull them back to their roots and put them into as part of the overall Broadcom portfolio. That's really what we are.",532

Now I understand you have 19 or so franchises that you can argue are more specialized, but I think you're certainly exposed to the broader trends in the industry.

And what we -- I can -- I'm not trying to look out far nor trying to basically postulate a vision here, but short -- but what we're seeing now and what we've seen recently and looking at what we're seeing now is that the dynamics of the semiconductor space is constantly changing. I know that's an obvious answer. But what I mean is by different end markets. And we, in some ways, are fortunate in selling to 4, 5 end markets, very, very different end markets. And I can tell you, over the last 2 years, the behavior of all those 5 end markets are very -- have been very different. So it's hard for me to say how's the whole semiconductor industry because it does cover into a lot of spaces. And 2 -- like 1 or 2 years ago, I did say that in 2016, 2017 -- even 2017 and '16, broadband was very strong. What part of the, I guess, of service provider spending -- level of service provider spending worldwide and -- but also -- and leading to business that's kind of cyclical. It's a business I might add that's relatively flat but sustainable and cyclical. So today, as I say, broadband, as I mentioned, is not so strong anymore. Now last year -- 2 years ago, data center spending was okay. This year, 2018, it's extremely strong and continues to look good. So we see different parts of the cycle. Just like even wireless. I mean, wireless, 2 years ago, 3 years ago was great. Content was growing. Then what we've seen over the past year is smartphones literally, not just handset worldwide but smartphones, just kind of flattened out, totally flattened out and where cost becomes a concern more than that demand or innovation becomes limited, and people are now waiting for perhaps a 5G cycle before we see another uptick. And industrial -- oh, yes, automotive was moving away for a few years, drives industrial, continues to do so as we see, though we start to see definitely some slowdown from where we are, both in automotive and industrial. So you're seeing ups and downs across different segments, different end markets that's an -- which uses semiconductors. And I guess, our best saving grace here is, because we are fairly diversified, we cannot keep ourselves stable and secure on a total basis as opposed to riding any particular end market upwards or downwards.",423

With -- in many -- a lot of our business are semiconductors, and we sell IP embedded in silicon, is perhaps the simple best way to describe. That's what we do. We don't try to license this out. We make it into products that addresses what our end users, end customers need to make, to use or make into -- for the -- make into part of a systems. And it's that intellectual property that drives the technology evolution because we keep feeding that machine. We keep enhancing, innovating on those technologies in any particular markets we're in. And as I mentioned, we have 19 of those markets. In each of them, one -- it's -- we behave very commonly. We have a team of people, and in many cases, we -- or in most cases, I would add, we have the best engineers in the world, architects and engineers in the world in each area -- in the space they are in. We are among the best. And many of these -- and these guys, the other side to IP, they have IP they have developed over the years and innovate to the next better thing. And we keep doing that. And the customers love to have this product because it makes them successful. It makes them more productive. It makes them do things that otherwise they can't do. And when you do that with each evolving technology, each evolving generation of technology, you basically get a higher value added to your product. Always do because you give your customer more value. You get something more for it. I'll give you an example, right? The well-known Tomahawk 3 switch is a 12.8 terabit per second throughput switch. The previous generation, Tomahawk  2, was only 6.4, half that throughput. So you are able to put into a data center and on top of a direct of servers twice the throughput, twice the capacity, twice the bandwidth. Do you -- do I -- am I able to charge 2x the price? Of course not. That's not the way technology works. But we are able to obviously improve against our value simply by the fact that even as dollars, our price per terabit drops, on the total 2x terabit, the value of the product goes up for us, for the customers. And if the demand, the usage consumption increases to use up all 12.8 terabit and basically, the data center  scale gets to scale out tremendously at a very cost-effective set of economics. And that's an example that applies across all 19 product lines and to balance out -- at the bottom -- at the end of it all, so because of that, our ability to do that, to offer better products are more value to our customers. Our product margin goes up. And it goes up faster than the amount of R&D we pour in, and we pour in quite a bit to sustain that level of improvement. And that leads to an improved operating -- and expanding operating margin. That's what we've seen. That's what has happened.",543

In the near term, you did a great job of explaining some of the puts and takes between that 60-40 split of the fast-growing and slower-growing businesses. But to the extent it's 45% of your business today, and we look forward longer-term, how should we think about the growth rates of that 60-40, and what does it mean to the profitability of the company, either on the gross or operating margin line as the growth rates seem to be so different between those 2 subsegments?",103

But what you say is true right now. In 2016, I loved broadband. It was an on up-cycle. If you recall, there was the Summer Olympics floating around. Everybody was signing up for cable, cable access. So we were booming. That time paid. That thing outperformed data centers, networking, that is. Today, the cycle turned around. We look at broadband and say, ""Man, this thing is dragging me."" It's not. When the up-cycle happens as we fully expect within the next 12 months also, it'll be great again. So that's one of the interesting things about it, is looking at, say, even wired or even wireless. Every one of this -- a lot of these markets' growth has their ups and downs, and especially if you look at a quarter and much less annually. Quarterly, even worse. What we have to keep realizing is these are all technology-driven applications and market-driven as better and better, more innovative technology comes in. It keeps expanding, some at a slower pace than others, but what it does is it adopts new technology, and which allows us to keep adding more value as we progress through it, even though it goes through its ups and downs. And the key thing to all this is sustainability. These are all very sustainable end markets. The product we see today may be much better than the product in this end market we saw 5 years ago, and the product 5 years from now will be much better than the product we see today. But believe me, the end use continues.",270

And then, yes, because again, in the case of wireless, we have very unique technology. We have very, very differentiated technology that allows us to produce very high-performance products in those smartphones. And so far, it's been the super high-end smartphones that tends to use our products. And I could see a situation where, especially with 5G coming into the mix, with all these difficult bands showing up, where 5G, you start running higher than 3 gigahertz spectrum bandwidth, you start to need better and better RF components, especially in filtering, very much so in filtering, and we could see that being required across the board in many next-phase or next-generation 5G phones. And we can see that happening, in which case then, it starts to expand beyond just high-end phones, and you're exactly right in that regard. It has happened before, a few years ago, when there were certain bands that were so critical, it can only be done using FBAR. Very difficult FBAR technology, and for a while, that was pretty cool.",188

You were talking about cycles and some years better than others. When you look at wireless, cellular and then WiFi is 2 components. Just kind of curious, as you look out, you mentioned 5G. Maybe kind of what's the content story between now and a couple of years from now, when 5G will be a majority? And then on the WiFi side, can you just talk about timing of that?",79
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,4238.0,1551910.0,61258995.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,24,"Okay. You -- and so actually, 2 questions you're asking here, so let me try to address them separately. WiFi, in many ways, is a more stable, predictable evolution of the technology trends. And today, very much so, everybody uses the standard, WiFi standard called 802.11ac, C as in China, and that's great. It's definitely an improvement from what it used to be 5 years or 10 years ago. But we have a new technology, a new protocol coming in called 802.11ax, which I may have commented on a couple of times in my prepared remarks. What ax does is, in a nutshell, it increases, in layman's language, the bandwidth. Huge. You can imagine easily running data stream wirelessly from your handsets. Upwards and uplink and downlink way over 1 gigabit per second, even 2 gigabits per second. You get carried away. But what's even more interesting is it allows for multiple users simultaneously, which is something that's always been tricky. And it requires a lot of technology, hardware and software. And we are in the lead in doing it, as I indicated. We are the first out with our product, they're working, we're designing, and we started launching it with multiple partners starting October next month. By the way, this year, starting with the retail routers and going on to the enterprise access points and then operators by early next year. So it's a big thing, 802.11ax, and I bet you in the spring, you will find at least one big handset maker coming out big-time to push 802.11ax. And our chips will be right in those flagship phones. But -- so it's more predictable, and our technology is so strong. I have to say that we see ourselves in the road map of our key customers over the next 2, 3 years. More predictable as 802.11ax, that should go to a second wave and upgrade and all that. On RF, it's truly not that much different, except that what's happening here more than anything else is over every several years, we go from, as you know, 2G, GSM, we go out to 3G, and now -- and then we have 4G that's been going on now for 6 years. And now there's actually demand, or kind of a demand, I might add, for even higher speeds, higher throughputs, lower latencies, more connections, that's what 5G is all about, which leads to IoT applications and all those applications we had dreamed about previously. That -- those are great. It's just that those are very, very difficult to implement. And in order to make it happen, one, in a nutshell, it will happen as it has happened in the past on 4G, it's your phone already runs 3G, 4G. You now have to put in additional components, additional capability to run an additional set of spectrum that runs, that is operating in 5G. And once you start doing that, you really will have issues of coexistence. You also have to reach out in 5G to frequencies that are much higher, much more difficult to produce, to put in a phone for communications, data communications. And I'm referring to frequencies that go way above 3 gigahertz now as a first step. And as you go into more and more of these 5G phones, you have more frequencies, more requirements of components in the same limited space of a phone. So you start to have to innovate on your components to be able to put them in a phone, in limited space, lower power, working very well together. And that's where our capabilities, our technology in RF, especially FBAR, comes into its own. And that's why we see this is as a sustainable franchise, especially for someone who is able to design, have the IP to design capabilities, components, that few people are able to replicate.",644

I'm almost tempted to tell you, hello, the same reason we've put together a bunch of businesses in semiconductor, what we call semiconductor solutions. On one extreme semiconductor solution, I am pulling simple hardware semiconductors, pure hardware analog components. To the extreme, it's not even silicon, in some cases, it's nanotechnology, it's Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, as in lasers, to the more well-known, well-recognized silicon SoCs, silicon over -- on a tube, that we built our routers and switches and deep-learning chips on, with a lot of software, by the way, on distance, lots of software. I have, in our networking team, I have as many software engineers as I have hardware engineers. Silicon sort of changed in there. In our video delivery business, video, which is basically a set-top box with cable modem, I have more software engineers because there are tons of different kinds of software that goes into a set-top box chip thus compared to hardware engineers. We understand software. CA, you're right, is all software. But a set-top box is, to put a number, over 60% software. And if I have to look at a switch, I can make a switch as simple, programmable and install software-defined networks and write a lot of software specs to program this, and that's 70% software, 30% hardware. Or I could hard-code chips as I do in certain other versions of my networking business, which are typically lower-end switches. And I would say I have 80% hardware and 20%, 30% software. So I go -- it varies across a lot of spectrum. One thing that's common is technology. It's technology solutions you provide to your customers, who cannot operate very productively, very efficiently, they don't sometimes operate at all without that, and it's technology solutions that evolve over time and your ability to keep up with customer needs over time. We're very good at managing that. We are very good at understanding how to monetize intellectual property in technology. I think that's a common thing we have.",342

I think, Tom, you did an excellent job in sort of reiterating the capital return policy. It sort of struck me on a lot of the questions that we got from investors were just sort of a surprise at the size of the CA deal, given some of the prior commentary around maybe focusing on smaller M&A deals. So I just kind of open it up and I'd love to hear some philosophy, conversation about how you're thinking about maybe verticals or size or any of those things, if there's anything that's off limits going forward, or we should just think about the capital return policy only and nothing's really off the table in terms of M&A.

I think that the important message is not much has changed. The business model and what we think drives the returns of the acquisitions that we do is very consistent. And we understand and appreciate that CA was a bit of a surprise and certainly larger than maybe what many people expected, but the reality is it was the right deal for us at the right time as we think about how to grow the earnings base of the company and how to drive value for shareholders over time. And if you think back, and this follows up on Harsh's question a minute ago, when we bought LSI, we were getting into what you could argue as a very different business. We had a largely mobile business at Avago, RF business that's sustained today has grown organically very rapidly, but we're getting into businesses that included rechannel SoCs, preamps for hard disk drives. We were getting into enterprise storage and SaaS connectivity, serving -- delivering to the server market. And these were all businesses that we frankly didn't know very well, but it was the characteristics of those businesses, just to follow on what Hock discussed in terms of the intellectual property, the barriers to entry, the sustainability of the businesses, and by focusing on those businesses, that's what allowed us to drive the returns we've seen. And we have obviously expanded from there. We've done smaller transactions, but we've also more recently done Brocade. Clue, that's a systems business. It's largely software. It has an end-user sales force. It's opened our eyes to end customers and what we can do with those end customers. But more importantly, it's proven to us that we can manage these businesses. The performance of Brocade over the last year, and we've obviously been quite familiar with the business for more than that time period, has been quite exceptional. And so CA is really an extension of a strategy that we've been pursuing for a number of years and has driven a tremendous amount of value for shareholders. So we look to continue to do that as a way to drive value. Obviously, we're going to deliver on the dividend, which is really important to us. But we have a lot of financial flexibility off the back of significant and substantial operating cash flows to continue to do buybacks and to do accretive M&A, and we see opportunities going forward to do that.",412

You were talking about porting in some of your networking and compute solutions, storage solutions to them. But right now, you're selling semiconductors, and a number of your big customers, you mentioned them, Google, Facebook or Google, Amazon, Microsoft, build their own boxes using your silicon. I would imagine, most of the CA's customers do not do this. So how are you going to port your -- how do you think you could port your semiconductor products to these new customers without getting into boxes? Or are you thinking about that? Or do you think they will start up such endeavors to start porting through? So I guess I don't understand how your existing products are going to be ported to these new clients without some sort of intermediary or white box guy or something. Maybe I'm a little bit confused there, but if you could explain that, I would appreciate it.",192

I think that's a very, very insightful question you came out with, and you're right 100%. One, we're not interested in going to the boxes, you got that right, or systems. We don't need to do that. But we have the key ingredients. We have the chips, the engine. So you take a box, be it in the industry that you're after, any of those things. Where -- and we have the software. Or if you want to sum up all of these end users now, and you're probably aware of that and to some extent, some of the big operators now are starting to want to build their own data centers and they have come to us and asked us to enable them to build their own data centers. And what -- that's very similar. And these guys are very, very aware of how the cloud guy is doing. The cloud guys use our own silicon engine -- our own merchant silicon. In many cases, some of our initial -- our software, SDK, by -- in many cases, they even write their own software and they then go to ODMs, the ODMs in Taiwan, in China, anywhere else, to put a box to build a system, a box. We have to enable that. Obviously, we have to. And the cloud guys do it. There's no reason why an operator like AT&T with Domain 2.0 cannot and is, in fact, executing on that basis or any other large enterprise users who build -- who had to build out on their own scale fairly substantial data centers, why they can't even do that on their own because as long as the core IP, the core technology, which is the engine, the software. Everything else ties together, and there are lots of ODMs out there. You call that white boxes, I believe, and they have a choice of doing that or continuing to buy from their traditional sources. What we are able to do now with our direct access to CA customers is establish strategic and strong engagements with those end users, and substantial end-user enterprises or end users, who would want to start doing it themselves in order to not just do it at low economics, but in order to access directly the latest, call it, leading-edge silicon software products, technology, which will enable them to build data centers just as leading-edge as what's available in the cloud. But we have seen that requirement, that request coming in, and we are basically responding to it. This is not a pipe dream.",431

That's a question that's wrong on so many fronts, I don't know where to begin. Let me start, let me try. Number one, we acquire -- we have a history of acquisitions and integrating very, very well. Those are not financial deals. They end up, as I say, as great financial returns. They're not -- we operate them under a single umbrella. We operate them, I hate to say, very, very well, but we also operate them very, very focused. And when you're focused, as I said before, you don't overinvest in R&D. When you're focused, you don't overinvest in even selling. When you run your company in a business model that is simple, you don't need a huge amount of SG&A. As already mentioned, it's not about cutting SG&A, it's about simplifying a business process with very strong -- a portfolio of very strong businesses, where you focus your spending on R&D to enable you to keep being ahead of the pack. And that's really our business -- our model, it's a business model and that we have executed over the last 6 years through multiple acquisitions. And it's also, as I mentioned in an earlier response, how well we integrate into the model, which ties to being very focused on what you pick as core businesses you want to keep investing in and divesting. You can't cut a business that you don't have. Businesses that you do not see as being sustainable, key part of it being sustainable is really a chance of them in franchise. When we buy companies over the last 5, 6 years, just as many companies and businesses we are in. If you look at the finer print and we have that data, we divest as many businesses out there. We just let it go because those are businesses that we believe are not sustainable, are not strong, are commoditized and where you don't have an advantage for whatever reasons that comes into play. So in that sense, you might call that financial. I don't. I call it a very strategic focus on businesses you can win. And that's how we look at even looking towards CA, which is an interesting part of what you say because, Romit, the mainframe business is very alive and well. Investments are still continuing in the mainframe business. And to put it in simple terms, transactions, online transactions, a lot of them in the largest enterprises in the world cannot run without mainframe, with hardware or the software tools that drive it. So that's basically all I say to that. But obviously, ours is an operating model and a business model, and the financials is what comes out of a very strong, sustainable and secure business model.",460

Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we really had a very good start to our fiscal year 2018 with first quarter revenue and earnings towards the upper end of our guidance. First quarter revenue of $5.33 billion grew 28% year-on-year and 10% sequentially.
On the income front, earnings per share were $5.12, which grew 41% year-on-year and 12% sequentially. But please, just don't get too excited by this as Q1 was actually a 14-week quarter and do include -- did include partial quarter contribution from Brocade, which we closed during the quarter. But having said this, we do expect business conditions to remain favorable in our second quarter as well, although the revenue mix by segment will be quite dramatically different.
First quarter revenue, after adjusting for Brocade contribution, was all driven by wireless growth, while we expect the second quarter will be driven by double-digit growth of our other 3 segments, offsetting a very sharp seasonal decline in wireless. As a result, thanks to diversification, second quarter top line continued to be very stable.
Let's go deeper in the performance by segment, starting with wired infrastructure. In the first quarter, wired revenue was $1.88 billion, declining 10% year-on-year, 13% sequentially. And the wired segment represented 35% of our total revenue. As expected, first quarter wired results reflected the bottom of the seasonal decline in demand for both our set-top box and broadband carrier access products. The well-known weakness in optical access in metro end markets impacted us as well in this quarter. But in contrast, demand was strong from data centers, and cloud shipments remained stable.
Turning to the second quarter outlook fiscal 2018, however, we have a different picture as demand in this wired segment returned with a vengeance. We project strong double-digit sequential revenue growth, and this growth is driven by very strong increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers as well as the weighted seasonal recovery in broadband carrier access. Set-top box continued to be flat.
Now what happened in wired is in sharp contrast to wireless. In the first quarter, wireless revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 88% year-on-year and 23% sequentially. The wireless segment represented 41% of total revenue. First quarter 2018 wireless revenue growth was driven by the ramp of the next-generation platform from our large North American smartphone customer. As you may recall, this ramp was pushed out into the first quarter from the fourth quarter as compared to prior years. This push-up coupled with a very large increase in our content in this new platform drove the substantial year-on-year growth in revenue in the first quarter. But as we look into the second quarter of fiscal '18, we expect -- we are expecting a much larger-than-typical seasonal decline in wireless revenue as shipments to our North American smartphone customer will trend down sharply from the exaggerated first quarter. We expect to partially offset this decline from an increase in our product shipments that support a ramp of next-generation flagship phone in a large Korean smartphone customer. This phone also comes with an increase in Broadcom's wireless content on both our RF and WiFi/Bluetooth combo products. Notwithstanding such volatile seasonality, I should note that year-on-year, revenue growth for Q2 in this segment will still be in the double digits.
Turning to enterprise storage. In the first quarter 2018, enterprise storage revenue was $991 million and included approximately $330 million in partial quarter contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel Switch business. As reported, enterprise storage segment revenue grew 40% year-on-year and 54% sequentially. Without Brocade contribution, however, first quarter enterprise storage revenue would have resulted in flat but still stable performance sequentially. Storage segment represented 19% of our total revenue for the first quarter. Now the Brocade revenue in the quarter was actually higher than our prior expectation of $250 million, and this has been driven by stronger-than-expected demand of fiber channels and switches. Our server storage connectivity products also had a strong quarter with substantially increasing revenue driven by ramp in the Purley generation server shipments. And this growth, though, was partially offset by a decline in our hard drive -- hard disk drive business as demand bottomed out during the quarter.
Into the second quarter fiscal '18, the contrast here we expect to see is strong double-digit sequential growth in revenues in enterprise storage driven by robust demand from both enterprise and data centers.
Finally, industrial. First quarter, industrial segment revenue was $251 million and represented 5% of total revenue. Industrial product revenue remained very robust, grew by over 20% year-on-year. Resales also grew by 20% year-on-year and trended up 7% sequentially.
Looking into the second quarter, we expect strong double-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenue, and we continue to expect retail to trend up by the same amount.
In summary, therefore, for the first quarter, as we expected, we delivered very strong financial results and completed  acquisition of Brocade during that period. Our second quarter fiscal '18 revenue outlook reflects the benefit of a very well-diversified product portfolio. We expect to fully offset the impact of a much higher-than-normal seasonal decline in wireless revenue with strong increases in our wired, storage and industrial segments. As a result, we expect second quarter revenue to be sequentially flat at $5 billion on a normalized 13-week basis for the quarter.
However, this change in -- the change in product mix will have a dramatic impact on second quarter gross margin, which we expect to sequentially expand by 100 to 150 basis points. Tom will provide more color during his guidance commentary on the impact this will have on our Q2 profitability.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review.",960
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 15, 2018",2018-03-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3565.0,1569591.0,61910867.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Our comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.broadcom.com.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal '18, focusing primarily on balance sheet and cash flow items. We delivered strong financial results for the first quarter starting with revenue of $5.33 billion, which was at the upper end of guidance. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 64.8%, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance as we benefited from a more favorable product mix in the quarter, driven by higher-than-expected revenue from the Brocade Fibre Channel SAN switches. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.6 billion and represented 48.2% of net revenue. EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was approximately $2.7 billion and represented 50.6% of net revenue.
Our day sales outstanding are running on target at 45 days, a 1-day decrease from the prior quarter. Our inventory at the end of the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $156 million from the prior quarter as we depleted wireless inventory we had built up to support the large ramp in first quarter shipments. We are pleased with this level of inventory going into the second quarter.
We generated $1.7 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact in the first quarter of approximately $460 million in payments of annual employee bonuses for fiscal year '17; $240 million of cash, expended primarily on Brocade restructuring and acquisition-related activities; and an additional $129 million payment to fund the legacy pension plan. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $220 million or 4.1% of net revenue.
Now let me turn to free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 27.5% of net revenue and reflects the impacts of the items I just mentioned, including the annual bonus payout, restructuring and pension contribution. Without those items, I would just note, free cash flow as a percent of net revenue would have been 43%. As a housekeeping matter, I'd also note that CapEx was $94 million higher than depreciation in the quarter. We expect CapEx to continue to trend down and approach our long-term target of 3% of net revenue in the second half of fiscal '18.
We also continue to make significant progress in increasing our free cash flow per share. We calculate this metric as our free cash flow divided by the sum of our outstanding ordinary shares in limited partnership or LP units. For the first quarter of fiscal '18, free cash flow per share was $3.39 based on 410 million outstanding ordinary shares and 22 million LP units. More importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow per share for the period ended Q1 '18 was $13.79, an increase of 71% compared to the trailing 12-month period ended Q1 '17.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $5 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 66%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $890 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $103 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $114 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 461 million shares. The share-based compensation expense will be approximately $305 million. CapEx will be approximately $190 million. Our second quarter gross margin guidance anticipates a very favorable revenue mix driven by strong high-margin networking enterprise storage product sales and a more than seasonal decline in relatively lower-margin wireless product sales. Our guidance for second quarter operating expenses includes a full quarter of Brocade expenses and anticipates our typical increase in employee payroll taxes from the annual vesting of RSUs in the quarter.
Please note that after we complete redomiciliation to the United States, we presently expect our effective cash tax rate to be approximately 10%. We expect to start reflecting this new rate in our non-GAAP results starting with the third fiscal quarter of 2018.
In the second quarter, we are anticipating very healthy free cash flow and expect to deliver results above our target model of 40% of revenue.
Before we open the call for questions, I would like to briefly address this week's events. Yesterday, we announced that we have withdrawn and terminated our offer to acquire Qualcomm. We have also withdrawn our slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Although we are disappointed with this outcome, we will comply with the order issued on Monday, March 12, 2018, regarding the proposed transaction. Importantly, we sincerely appreciate the overwhelming support we received from Qualcomm and Broadcom stockholders throughout these past few months. Indeed, I have to say we are touched by the ISS report issued just last night that continues to recommend the Broadcom independent nominees and by our understanding that based on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15% to 16% of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate down in San Diego.
In any event, back to Broadcom. Consistent with our announcement in November to redomicile the company, we continue to believe the U.S. represents the best location from which to pursue our strategy going forward, and we don't see this week's events putting any constraints on our ability to pursue acquisitions more broadly going forward. To that end, we also announced that we continue to move forward with our redomiciliation to the U.S. and now expect to complete this process after the close of the market on April 4. This timing will allow us to hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 4 as presently scheduled. Our special meeting for stockholders to vote on the redomiciliation will still be held on March 23.
So with this, we know many of you are asking what's next. Hock and I have had the last couple of days to reflect on this. First, and most importantly, we remain focused on delivering superior return for our shareholders. Broadcom benefits from a long history of technology innovation, engineering excellence and product leadership across our 20 franchise businesses. We believe this will allow us to sustain mid-single-digit revenue growth and increasing operating and free cash flow margins. To reflect our confidence in the sustainability of the current business, we will continue targeting aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow. This should afford us the opportunity to provide material dividend increases in the future.
The allocation of the remaining 50% of free cash flow is governed by the returns we believe that we can drive via acquisitions versus buying AVGO stock and/or paying down debt. As you all know, Hock and I are quite familiar with the industry landscape. And sitting here today, we do see potential targets that are consistent with our proven business model and that also can drive returns well in excess of what we otherwise achieve buying our own stock and/or paying down debt. If this view changes, rest assured we will not hesitate to change our approach. Providing superior returns for shareholders has been and always will be our focus.
One final point I want to make. Qualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity. Given the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it is seeing and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet much beyond our current financial policy of 2x net leverage.
I would like to remind you that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our quarterly earnings. Consistent with our previous call, please keep your questions focused on today's financial results. We will not be commenting in Q&A on this week's events.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",1401

And we saw very large -- a very -- a lot of strength in both enterprise as well as cloud data centers in both respects. It's just strong, and it's strong across the full range of our networking products that I commented on. We also saw strong bookings which will translate into revenues, obviously, in Q2. Very strong revenue recovery in our broadband carrier access, which basically reflects DSL, digital subscriber lines, PON and attached enterprise and carrier WiFi. And that's typical seasonality, and it came back very, very strongly. What we don't see a sharp recovery is, obviously, fiber optics in networking. The old fiber optics out of data centers continue to be better -- not continue but has shown renewed strength. So basically, data center, cloud that are showing -- enterprise showing a lot of strength to offset, what I call, metro networks and, in our case, through a continued flatness in set-top box.",173

From a financial standpoint as well, Craig, it's margin-accretive to the company. We see that continue to contribute positively to earnings and free cash flow.

Look, I think there's a couple of things going on, both -- there's short term and then there's long term. Let me comment on both. Short term, when you look at the seasonality in the business over the fiscal year, obviously, the second half of the year is typically more wireless-weighted. Wireless, as everyone knows, tends to carry slightly lower than corporate gross margins. So I think I wouldn't get too excited in terms of where gross margins go from here through the end of this fiscal year. However, that being said, as you look longer term, consistent with the business model Hock has been driving the last 11 years, we continue to see content gains. We continue to have very good product leadership across the 20 franchise businesses. We've added Brocade, which is margin-accretive. So we don't see any reason, as I said in the prepared remarks, that as we sustain mid-single-digit revenue growth, you're not going to see leverage not only from an operating and free cash flow perspective but a lot of that's going to get driven by gross margin expansion. So we don't see any reason that, that can't continue.",198

For my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask about sustainability of storage. So we're seeing some upside. You admitted Brocade was a little stronger than you had expected. And I think you've talked about this business like longer term, just given the drivers of the different segments within it being maybe flattish. But in reality, it's quite volatile. We have years where it's very strong and years where it's very weak. I know last year when we were seeing the strength in storage, you kind of warned us not to get too excited about the sustainability of that. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of that growth? And frankly, even in your other non-wireless segments as we're seeing that strong double-digit growth into Q2, how should we think about sustainability of that versus your long-term organic growth target?",145

So in the enterprise storage, we've got, obviously, the LSI businesses, the SaaS connectivity business, which is an absolute franchise. It is going to move from a cyclical standpoint with the Intel server platform releases. Obviously, we're in with Purley, we've had very good leadership position with the new products in that area and so that business is doing well, and we expect it to continue to do well this fiscal year. Contrast that with HDD. Obviously, HDD, we think, is in slight structural decline. We also have very good leadership position with those product lines. And so there has been more volatility than probably Hock and I would have anticipated in that business over the last several years. And I wouldn't think that would change, frankly, going forward as you look out. And then beyond that, Brocade. Frankly, Brocade's probably the one that's the most stable in our view. And of course, we've owned it  the shortest period of time. But as you look forward, that's a business that we think can sustain at the levels that we saw on a full run rate basis in the first quarter. So we think, when you put all that together, I'd echo kind of where I think you are going, which is this is kind of a low single-digit type growth rate segment as we currently reported.",240

And that's related -- for years, it has been there -- the whole enterprise storage business we see there, the various components are very, very stable, grow low single digit. Nothing exciting but very, very predictable and stable. What happened probably a year or 2 ago was flash coming in the picture and shortages and creating impact to the extent it creates impact, which is on the consumer client side of hard disk drive. And that creates some level of impact. Beyond -- as client goes down as a portion of the hard disk drive market and the data center part of the business expense, what we call nearline, you will see that volatility start to go away, too, and what you'll end up with then in our enterprise storage business as an extremely stable business, single-digit growth, if at all, but extremely profitable.",170

And this might be kind of a moot point just given how strong your April guidance has been. But I'm still trying to figure out that business being down 10% year-on-year. You characterized it as sort of a seasonal lull, but I would assume a year-over-year compare would catch that, and you did have the extra week this quarter that you didn't have last quarter. So I guess, I'm just trying to figure out what -- you mentioned a bunch of factors in your prepared comments. I'm trying to figure out what was the most significant factor. And as you think about the long-term growth in this business, to the extent that you'd have a 5% growth rate for the overall business, how does this business fit in? Because arguably, with your exposure to data center and cloud, this is probably the business that investors are willing to pay the highest multiple on, but it's one that, over the last several quarters, has actually been growing much slower than the other business unit. And I know there's a lot of different businesses inside of wired. But how would you think about the long-term growth rate and the moving parts on that?",214

That's the best part of the question but to try to answer your technical part, which is what the hell happened in Q1 and all that. First, for the compare year-on-year-- if you compare year-on-year, which was Q1 a year ago, don't forget, what we did a year ago, there were some exceptional items, indeed, a year ago. What we did as part of the integration of classic Broadcom with Avago is we're able to dispose of certain assets. And as part of that, we sold manufacturing rights, which we articulated at that time we have announced the earnings, to certain companies out there for -- as part of the disposal process on overlapping products in the integration. And that jacked up the revenue artificial -- onetime a year ago. So we have that little compare to hit on. And the amount there wasn't small. It was over $60 million -- $60 million, $70 million. Small by a total spend of $2 billion but, nonetheless, it dealt a percentage and you worry about the 10%. So that's one thing I want to say to -- add on. But on Q1, to address your question on it, our wired infrastructure -- our wired business is really 2 parts when you look at it. One is data center, very much data center enterprise business, which is networking. And that's about just almost -- it's roughly half. And you have the other half, which is more carrier-related, operator service provider-related, which is really the set-top box business, the carrier access business and a part of our optics business, optical transceiver business, just as a part of optical transceiver that lands in data centers. And it's very interesting that the enterprise data -- and data center business, which was holding up in January quarter, but the other side was all down, all down, including optical that relates to fiber to the home to networks and operators, especially in China, and as well as carrier access, seasonally down, set-top box, seasonally down quarter. So we have one side being dramatically down; one side, holding up. Then comes April, and we see the part that's down a lot starts to recover quite strongly, especially in carrier access, popped right up. The fiber optics in China on networks and set-top box have not -- but that part of it popped up. But what we really start to see is also the other -- the half of the business in data center enterprise took on huge strain. A big part of it is some of the -- we start to ramp on some certain new products. I don't want to get into specifics which I had, you probably know what they are, they are networking and they are in AI, especially as well as various other programs all related to cloud and enterprise being very strong, and that's what drove this April strength. And that's kind of the whole story.",493

And then Tom, maybe as my follow-up, I think I understand the OpEx guidance going into the April quarter relative to period costs that come in on the payroll and Brocade. But I'm just kind of curious, given that you're going from a 14-week to a 13-week, how is that impacting sequential OpEx? I would've thought just having 1 less extra week would have helped you on the OpEx front? And how do we think about OpEx trending from April on to the second half of the year?",92

Look, we -- there's a lot of things going on. You've got the payroll uptick because of RSUs, which is material. You've got Brocade transition costs, which we have the benefit of having a longer time between sign and close, so we're very much actually past day 2 now and on our way to being fully integrated. So that should come off and bring numbers down. So as we look at the second half of the year, look, I would be thinking you're not going to see OpEx go up anymore, it probably does trend down slightly. But we're running at or about these levels when you exclude the Brocade transition expenses.",117

But maybe from a longer-term perspective, if you just set aside the seasonal aspects, what is the right way to think about a 2- to 3-year growth rate for the wired business? You obviously have strengthened your cloud switching and AI businesses, but is set-top box going to be a headwind longer-term? Just conceptually, do you think your wired business sort of grows in line, above or below your overall company 5% growth rate?",94

But to answer your question on that, remember, look at our wired business as 2 parts. One is enterprise data centers, which includes the switching. Basically, a lot of it is the switching. The controllers, routing, even part of routing, and even fiber optics that go to data centers. That area, we have been seeing, is growing very, very fast. There are occasional hiatus, flattening out, not going down but flattening out, as happened in January, as I indicated, even though demand continued to be good. But it keeps growing and it grows, I would say, close to probably -- on a year-on-year basis, probably close to 10%. Then we have the other side of business, which is more related to network service providers, and those are more volatile, more seasonal. But if you take it on an annualized basis, I would say it's practically flat. And that's why I'm saying that, on an average, something mid-single digits when you average out on an annual basis over a 5-year period, that it'd be running at that rate. It's very strong enterprise and cloud products, all enterprise and cloud, and there continues to be a lot of innovation in that areas, which we are right in the thick of, which we drive, in fact, a lot of it and which includes new applications, new ways to optimize data centers in cloud, less so in enterprise but definitely in cloud and associated. We have great fiber optics that ties to cloud computing and, against that, a more traditional but, nonetheless, very, very stable and sticky service provider wired business in the video delivery, set-top box, OTT as well and carrier access, which certainly provides both on  end  gateways especially for our carriers. So it's a mix of the 2 and the dynamics of the 2, but it's very clear that one -- a big part of the half is growing very fast, relatively speaking, and the other half doesn't grow.",352

Wondering do you think pricing dynamics could be different in the industry as you go forward because 2 of your largest players, 2 of the biggest players in the industry, are really struggling to, I would say, drive unit growth at this point.

Those phone makers, particular phone makers, have to innovate, have to offer features that continue to push their envelope. They're probably more mindful, as they will be, about costs, overall costs. But a lot of our components are not gimmicks, you realize. They are like basic, basic fundamentals to a phone working in various bandwidths. To give you an example of 5G, 5G adds on a lot more spectral bandwidth, which means you need more content, just simple basic fundamentals that -- going to 5G means you had to find new spectrum bandwidth to operate in. In every spectrum you'll find, you need more components in that direction. You need more bandwidth in wireless connectivity, you push in that direction, too. So yes, there will be. Now not necessarily every place, for instance, touchscreen, people might be cheaper and not push as much into it, we understand that. So that's a confluence -- a mix of both, which is why I say, on a long-term 5-year trend, the fundamental feature requirements will be what drive growth because you are running with more requirements in terms of performance even if it's as basic as operating in more spectral bandwidth as you go from 4G to 5G and on and on. And that alone by itself would drive, if you compute, that low -- at least low double-digit growth in content. There's no getting around it.",274

I think the free cash flow margin is about 1,600 basis points or so below that number. Structurally, at what point do you see these 2 things converging?

I mean, that was the point of sort of spelling it out for Q2, right? I mean, in Q1, you do have something that happens every year, which is we pay out our annual performance bonuses. And hopefully, we'll be able to continue to pay out the bonuses we've been paying out over the past many years going forward. So I'd expect that. But beyond that, the one-time items around the Brocade acquisition and the restructuring activities there as well as paying down the -- actually, one of the last legacy pensions we have where there's a liability, those are one-time items. So if you took those away, we're already running well above 40%, which is actually very much in line with non-GAAP net income.

There's quarterly up, quarterly down, capture all that, take it on an annual basis. It's just the trend on -- from enterprise but more on the net data centers, especially from the cloud, in pushing very hard for a lot more silicon products in those data centers. Bandwidth, they need more bandwidth. They need a set of pipes. They need offloading, as you said, [ good but that is -- ] which means chips, controller chips that are getting very smart and things that grew things beyond what a standard CPU would do.

Or we call it the analog team in the digital age. We have one of the strongest, I call it, analog team in terms of DSP and converting analog, which is real-world signals, to digital in order for you to do organic stuff. Basically, ADCs, analog-to-digital converters, which is one of our key strengths, though we don't publicize it very much because that's what we do. We're very -- people see us as a very strong digital company, but you can't just do digital alone. What we have is, actually, one of the strongest analog-to-digital conversion capability in the world. And that has enabled us to do a lot of things very well hidden, in many ways, from the public eye. We can do a digital front-end ADC for even things like base stations, as an example. And we do that for human interface as part of our capability, and we do it for coherent receivers in DSP -- on a DSP basis.  We do have a strong capability of people who, best way to describe it, virtually walk on water from the viewpoint of many of our customers. And that has enabled us to keep getting this strong backlog of programs that we are actively engaging in the various core business franchises we're in. This doesn't deviate us from our core franchises, I should mean -- I should say that, it just enables us to drive those core franchises deeper and deeper into performance, whether it be next-generation technology, whether it be driving 100Gs -- gigabits per second  studies  or driving ADCs that push the boundaries of where -- the  extent  of product technology driving -- send the products up and touchscreen controllers and various other things.

You've got these franchises, you've been articulate about where you're going to go, where you don't go. But there seems to be this other area, the custom ASIC area, you did router for Cisco years ago and then you've gotten into AI and then when your largest customer, when you got Broadcom, you obviously moved into connectivity but you also jumped into areas that would be considered  unnormal for Broadcom, Avago even, like wireless charging, which the market itself is really way below where your margin profile exists, but you've done a really good job of that. So I know it's not a franchise, but isn't it the case that your custom ASIC business is becoming kind of a franchise unto itself with a select groups of customers where you can go in and do things they can't do and offer them a service?

You're right. We have something to see there and we are very careful, but we have been asked by -- I mean, some of it, of course, we go dig it out ourselves. But in some cases, certain customers who need technology that pushes the envelope like no speeds of -- the accuracy and speeds of ADCs, for instance, we've been asked by certain customers into areas beyond what we have touched on. And I also mentioned that on the ADC on the front-end, a DFE or base stations as an example where we've been approached by customers to design its CMOS silicon what used to take non-CMOS processes to do and be able to achieve the same performance with much lower power and potential integration possibility. All that comes in. And you're right, we don't know where the limits are, but we're very careful that we do not expend resources in the wrong manner back to ROI, as Tom said. Every dollar or every resource we put into a program, we are very conservative, very risk-adverse, you might say, about ensuring we get a very good ROI. And that comes in making sure customers put skin in the game together with us when they ask us to do programs where we are expected to, as I keep saying, walk on water literally.

And so it opens up a much wider swath of technologies that you could go into if the agreement is cast correctly so that we may be seeing you do stuff that may be more uncharacteristic if you haven't had the custom ASIC group?",157

Well, as you saw, we closed the fiscal year on a very high note. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter fiscal '18 was $5.45 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago, and EPS came in at $5.85, a 27% increase from a year ago. Importantly, free cash flow was $2.53 billion or 46% of our net revenue.
I would like to provide you more color on the top line today, and I have a lot to cover today actually. And please note fourth quarter results do not include any contribution from CA.
Starting with wired. On quarter results, starting with wired, revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 3% year-on-year. And the wired segment represented 41% of our total revenue for this quarter.
Looking deeper though, fourth quarter wired results reflect very strong year-on-year growth for our networking and computing offload businesses, driven by robust demand from the cloud data center market as well as traditional enterprises. And networking computing offload represented over 2/3 of our wired segment in the quarter and grew 22% year-on-year in the quarter. This is on the back of growing 10% year-on-year in the third quarter. So this part of the wired segment continues to be very robust.
On the other side, as anticipated, cyclical headwinds in certain parts of our broadband business reflecting weak carrier spending in those areas continue to impact this part of our wired business in the fourth quarter. As a result, broadband was down year-over-year again in the fourth quarter and offset partially the strong growth from data center spending.
Turning to enterprise storage. Revenue was $1.3 billion, representing 23% of revenue. And consistent with what we experienced in wired networking businesses, robust enterprise IT spending drove over 96% year-on-year revenue increase. Now of course, this includes contribution from Brocade, which we acquired about a year ago. But even if we strip out Brocade, enterprise storage grew double digits year-on-year in the quarter.
Moving on to wireless. Revenue was $1.7 billion, which was down 5% year-on-year. Wireless segment represented 31% of our total revenue. And wireless revenue, however, was somewhat better than our expectations for the fourth quarter as we benefited from upside volumes of legacy phone generations at our North American OEM customers.
And finally, our last segment, industrial. In the fourth quarter, industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenues. Distribution resales, which is how industrial are sold for us, continue to be strong, contributing to high single-digit year-on-year growth in the industrial business.
With that, now let's talk about the segment performance for the full fiscal year 2018, which interestingly enough could be in stark contrast to the Q4 results I just articulated. Wired for us in fiscal 2018 was up 1% as networking expanded while broadband was down. Meanwhile, enterprise storage was significantly supported by Brocade as well as strong organic growth in our server storage connectivity business. And industrial performed extremely well, up 4%, helped by a healthy macro backdrop. Finally, despite all the quarterly fluctuations, wireless was actually up 20%.
So what's interesting and what I want to highlight when you step back from quarterly results and look at the annual performance, we had a great year. Our revenue hit a new record high, growing 18% year-on-year to nearly $21 billion for fiscal '18. This clearly demonstrates how our diverse set of businesses drive stability and sustainability in our consolidated revenue despite quarterly and even annual volatility in specific segments. With this in mind, we plan to move away from quarterly guidance to annual guidance going forward. Annual goals and guidance reflect, we believe, more accurately how we manage our business and also aligns very well with how management and employees in this company are measured.
In addition, viewing our business broadly, you can see we have created, over the years, organically and through acquisitions a substantial core revenue stream in semiconductors based on technology enabling connectivity solutions across a broad set of end markets. We continue to remain focused on the sustainability and growth of this core business.
But in addition, with our acquisition of Brocade, we created a complementary revenue stream to our semiconductor solutions that we are now calling infrastructure software. With CA -- with the acquisition of CA, I mean, we will grow this revenue stream and build upon it through acquisitions consistent with our business model. As a result, going forward, our 2 primary segments will be semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software.
And so for fiscal 2019, this coming year, the outlook for business is as follows. In the semiconductor solutions segment, we expect continued robust demand from cloud customers with the ramp of next-generation Tomahawk 3 switches and from the launch of our next-generation routers, Jericho 2.
We also expect to see recovery of spending by carriers, operators in cable and -- excuse me, in cable as well as in communications as we expect the broadband market recovery to start to progress through the year. We have already seen that happen this quarter. Storage, we believe will be stable relative to fiscal 2018. And as we previewed last quarter, we believe the reset in our wireless business in the first half of 2019 from share loss in the current phone generation will be followed by a substantial recovery in the second half as we take share back for the next generation.
So while there will be lots of puts and takes here, our outlook for the semiconductor business is for modest revenue growth in 2019. This may be somewhat dampened relative to our long-term mid-single-digit growth expectation by wireless.
Now turning to infrastructure software segment. Before providing our outlook, I should take a few minutes to outline the substantial changes we are making to the CA business model. We expect these changes to result in a dramatically more profitable revenue base, which is more aligned to the rest of Broadcom and that we expect will grow. First and foremost, gone are the days of trying to land new products with new customers. And I'm referring to software, enterprise software. We are focusing all our attention on renewing existing products with existing mainframe-centric customers, customers that represent virtually all of the world's largest enterprises and largest spenders on IT. We're also targeting expansion opportunities within this core mainframe customer base. The cost of running this renew-and-expand model will be substantially less than the legacy ""land at all cost"" model, and importantly, renewing and expanding plays to CA's strengths.
Let me explain. Today, over 70% of CA's revenues are derived from its top 500 accounts. In almost all cases, these top customers have been licensing CA mainframe products for more than a decade and oftentimes, several decades. CA contracts with these customers are primarily broad-based, multiyear license agreements and include a term license with maintenance for mainframes. At this same customer, entire enterprise products are sold as perpetual licenses with maintenance embedded in the license agreements.
At each of our top customers, we have 2 primary objectives. One, we want to expand our efforts on mainframe and make sure we are realizing the full value that our mainframe tools are delivering to our customers. And as we discussed on the prior call, usage as defined by mix, has been growing at double-digit rates at all these top accounts. Logically, we are now more focused because of that on pricing mainframe based on consumption. We also feel there's a huge opportunity for customers to save money by leveraging our broad mainframe portfolio to drive more convergence through CA tools.
Going on to the second objective, we really want to expand our enterprise software products within these same top accounts. Now it is true that lower cost and lighter weight SaaS alternatives have been creating challenges for CA for some time in the enterprise software market. But what's interesting is that CA actually is very highly rated. In fact, Gartner upper right-hand Magic Quadrant categories for enterprise software -- enterprise product software on the -- for enterprises. While they are very well suited to the private cloud IT environment of the largest enterprises, these enterprise software are just too expensive relative to SaaS. So moving forward, we are going to move away from the inflexible perpetual license model for enterprise software to an enterprise-wide ""all you can eat"" license for all of our core accounts.
By doing this, we expect to remove the friction caused by selling expensive upfront perpetual licenses so that the incremental costs for our customers to expand the use of enterprise products will be highly competitive relative to SaaS-based alternatives. Bottom line, we are adopting a fully ratable subscription model for the Broadcom software business. The new business -- this new business model, we believe, plays to our strengths, focusing on the largest 500 customers tied to mainframes with the ability to upsell enterprise software competitively using an ""all you can eat"" subscription-based model.
We expect this transition though to take a couple of years given the timing of contract renewals. But once completed, we expect revenues to stabilize at over $3.5 billion annually and grow from there. And to support that revenue base, we do not expect to spend more than $900 million per year. And as a result, we expect to achieve more than $2.5 billion per year in operating profitability from the CA business once we go through this transition. We are well underway today with the CA restructuring and integration process, including announcement of the Veracode divestiture to Thoma Bravo and the outsourcing of the CA services business to HCL.
So with that as background, let me talk about our outlook for the infrastructure software segment in 2019. Now SAN switching, private channel SAN switching here, performed beyond expectations in 2018 on the back of very strong enterprise demand as well as meaningful share gains. While we expect to continue to see healthy demand, we do not expect in this forecast to have this sustained through 2019. Furthermore, since we are moving mainframe and enterprise software products to a fully ratable revenue recognition model and just focusing on the top 500 accounts, we expect a reset in the CA revenue starting Q1 2019. As a result, our revenue outlook for the infrastructure software segment for 2019 is -- will be approximately $5 billion.
Combining the semiconductor solutions, in summary, we are forecasting consolidated revenue to be approximately $24.5 billion fiscal 2019. This will be, to repeat, driven by a very stable semiconductor business that will be complemented by an infrastructure software business that we are rapidly building up.
Thank you. Tom?",1779

My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted.
Let me walk through our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Fourth quarter net revenue was $5.45 billion, ahead of the midpoint of guidance. Our gross margin from continuing operations is above the high end of our guidance at 68.4% as we benefited from a more favorable product mix in the quarter.
Operating expenses were slightly lower than expected at $863 million. As a result, we achieved record profitability in the quarter. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.86 billion and represented 52.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.02 billion and represented 55.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $132 million of depreciation. And the company delivered $5.85 of EPS in the quarter off of a 435 million weighted average fully diluted share count. This represents 27% EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year.
Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, increased approximately $105 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to an increase in receivables. This increase was driven by seasonally higher shipments in the last month of the quarter. In addition, we spent $106 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record free cash flow from operations at $2.53 billion or 46% of revenue. This represents 47% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q4 of 2017.
In the quarter, we returned $2.26 billion to stockholders, including $723 million in the form of cash dividends and $1.53 billion for the repurchase of 6.4 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash, $17.5 billion of total debt, 408 million of outstanding shares and 432 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Now let me turn to our fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP guidance. We do intend to update our annual guidance on our quarterly earnings calls throughout the year. And as normal, this guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
As Hock discussed, net revenue for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue.
Operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. I'd like to note, post-CA integration restructuring, we do expect to move closer to 55% operating margins in 2020. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion and reflects maintaining a target cash balance of approximately $4 billion and servicing total debt outstanding of approximately $37 billion following the close of the CA deal. This forecast does not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019.
The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11% and includes a slight negative impact from the CA acquisition. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. As a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. Now this is a substantial increase in our stock-based compensation expense, and let me take a moment to explain.
We are implementing a special broad-based multiyear equity award program for our employees, including our new CA employees. Each multiyear equity award will vest on the same basis as 4 annual equity grants made on March 15 of each year beginning in 2019. And it is expected that a maximum of approximately 31 million shares of common stock in aggregate will be issued and vest over the next 7 years. This is the same number of shares in aggregate as we would have expected to grant over the next 4 years annually. The spike in the 2019 stock-based comp will start to come down in 2020 and decline from there back to our normal level by 2022.
So in summary, really, this is an accounting dynamic that impacts the stock-based comp in 2019. We do believe providing 4 years of equity grant upfront provides clarity regarding future compensation that creates a powerful retention incentive in an otherwise tight labor market and a sharpened focus on long-term stockholder value creation. In addition, it allows us to maximize the use of the remaining authorized share reserves under our 2009 Avago equity award plan, which unfortunately is expiring in 2019. As broad-based employee stock ownership is a fundamental tenet of our company, it is important that we continue this legacy while our current equity plans enable us to do so.
I would note a couple of things. One, Hock is not participating in this program and as previously disclosed, will not receive another equity grant until at least 2021. In addition, for executives, 50% of the awards are PSUs, the vesting of which is tied to total shareholder return similar to our prior annual awards to executives. Finally, no further annual grants are planned for employees who receive this award until at least 2022.
Now let me turn to capital allocation plans before we open the call for questions. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are focused on returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends with the balance being allocated through a combination of stock buybacks and acquisitions. In addition, we plan to also continue to use our balance sheet to fund acquisitions while focusing on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.
With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $8.2 billion of free cash flow that we generated in fiscal 2018, we are increasing our target quarterly cash dividends starting this quarter to $2.65. This constitutes an increase of 51%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend at this time next year based on our fiscal 2019 free cash flow from operations.
Now given the dilution stockholders are bearing from the multiyear grant and given the free cash flow yield that Broadcom is currently generating, we are also budgeting to return an additional $8 billion to stockholders through stock buybacks in fiscal 2019. Coupled with the dividend, this means we are planning to return approximately $12 billion to stockholders in fiscal 2019, which constitutes all of our projected free cash flow plus the excess cash that we have on our balance sheet today.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, if you could please open up the call for questions.",1112

I think, keep in mind, there are now 2 substantial businesses. I should really say 3 in that number as you probably pointed out. There's the CA business for a couple data points. Veracode, the run rate business, is about $150 million a year it was growing. And we've outsourced the services business, so that business will start to tail off through the course of 2019 and largely be gone in 2020. But then keep in mind also there's Brocade, the SAN fibre channel switching business, which is performing very well for us. We're not breaking out these specific revenues for that particular business, but it's also providing substantial portion of the overall $5 billion. So in total, we see a reset in the CA business starting in Q1. We do expect, based on the renewal expectations around our core 500 customer base, to grow throughout the year with CA, and we also expect to continue to maintain reasonably high levels of revenue with the Brocade Fibre Channel business.",173

Let me outline again what I went through in my remarks fairly quickly. And as Tom actually articulated earlier in answer to Aaron's question, we start 2019 partly because of a resetting from recognizing perpetual licenses on an accelerated manner to ratable subscription base over revenue recognition. '19 will take a step down from what you typically expect the rate to be, and you will rapidly build up over the next 2, 3 years to the level, as we spoke about, closer to over $3.5 billion. On the spending side, if you recall, before we acquired CA, the last quarter, stripping out services, taking out services, which was a wash, spending -- total spending was above $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion per year. We're bringing it down to $900 million. And we are able to bring it down to $900 million is for what I purposely articulated in my opening remarks. Okay? A large part of that $2.4 billion of spending was attributed to the various sales motion, development motion, I should say, of trying to land new customers as well as land existing customers with new products but basically landing new customers. And a lot of these customers are, I would consider, the long tail of a long list of customers. The largest 500 customers in the world are already their customers through mainframes. But they do -- a but a big amount of that spend, I would guess what we're seeing is to the tune of more than $1.5 billion and leads -- sorry, I think, yes, a bit above our spending $2.4 billion, sorry, $900 million is our annual spot close to $1.5 billion is used to try to develop new products and land on new customers. By moving away from that, focusing on the largest 500 customers, we think that with renewals, with mainframes by upselling on enterprise software, we basically get to the same revenue number with much less spending substantially, and that's a $3.5 billion, say, as conservatively we get to in year 2 or year 3 from today; and last, the $900 million savings end state spending is where we believe we get to around the $2.5 billion operating profit target.",371

Next year, it's still looking like the cloud guys are growing their spending again albeit at a lower rate versus this year but then you -- they're on the 200-, 400-gig upgrade cycle with Tomahawk 3. And then you've got the ramp of some of your AI and deep learning and smart NIC ASIC programs. Given all of this, I kind of wanted to know if the team still feels like they can sustain double digits year-over-year growth rates for this segment fiscal '19.",108

Yes, cloud, public cloud, I call it, spend -- part of our networking compute offload business so to speak. The public cloud side, which is about half or at least half of our revenues right now in that sector that does networking and compute offload continues to be extremely strong. And it's strong not because anything else. In 2018, that one, we didn't launch any major new milestone products, and we still grew as we indicated. We grew double digits. 2019, we have, in addition to that natural momentum, the addition of the fact that we're launching both 2 significant products, the top of the rack switch, the Tomahawk 3, 12.8 terabyte -- terabit per second, thick throughput switches, which are very welcome, very -- basically, won't be very much in use by the hyper cloud guys. That will be our big driver of growth. In addition -- but perhaps in use in some of the spine architecture of those hyper cloud data centers. But more on just [ smart ] and also at operators for routing, for their routing applications, we are launching middle of the year Jericho 2. So we have 2 product drivers on top of the natural momentum of increasing content that we are seeing that you articulated in those data centers at the cloud from -- especially from compute offload, where we're talking about more than controllers. We're talking of deep learning, content. We're talking about compression encryption, and we're just talking broadly about anything to do with offloading CPU cycles from servers. And that's a very long-term tailwind that we have basically been able to take advantage of and continue to benefit through probably more than 1 year.",289

It's a 4-year grant accelerated and done in 1 shot this year as opposed to doing it over 4 years. So in aggregate, you wouldn't have any difference. But from an accounting perspective, you'll have -- take all the stuff up this quarter. It'll start to bleed off next year and decelerate back to where we were over a 4-year period. So I look at the 2018 $300 million a quarter type stock-based comp run rate as the run rate roughly for the company on a steady-state basis.",100

There was a significant increase this quarter. And when we contemplate the company's ability to grow the top line long term, expand margins and your capital allocation plan save any further M&A, what does management expect the sort of long-term growth rate of that dividend to be?",54

Well, so I think we've spelled it out fairly clearly both on the policy in terms of returning the 50% of free cash flow from the prior fiscal year. And we've spelled out now what we think we can do from a free cash flow from operations perspective in 2019, which is the $10 billion. So when you take into account the buyback expectation that we've also articulated of approximately $8 billion, the outstanding shares should come down as well as the free cash flow is going to go up. So when you do that math, you're going to come up with a number that's north of 20% in terms of potential for dividend growth. Now going forward, we'll have a couple of other tailwinds that we've benefited from the past, which is frankly M&A and the accretion that we drive once we're fully integrated and restructured. And so as Hock's been articulating, when we get to the $2.5 billion-plus of operating profit, that's going to start to be realized in 2020 into 2021. Absent additional M&A, we would continue to focus not just on the dividend but also the buyback, which would allow us to reduce the share count as well. So I think we have a good setup to continue to be able to drive the dividend well into the double digits over the next several years.",230

Does that basically work one license that the customer takes for anything that you buy going forward and put into that segment? And if that's true, how do you grow the business without taking those rates up over time if you're still selling to the same customers? Like, what does that model actually look like over time?",83

That's a very good point, and you're right. We provide that enterprise-wide license to those core customers only, by the way, product by product. Obviously it's not across all our enterprise products at the same time, but it's only when the customer is adopting. And so that part of it becomes important. You're right because customer -- if one of those big core customers adopts, say, agile operations -- one of our agile operations software or agile, what we call, Rally, which is for projects and they want more seats, they want more capacity, what we will provide is for a license -- for a contract -- license contract of a -- on a multiyear basis. We expect to get a certain amount of dollars I should say, and we'll give them under that enterprise-wide unlimited license. And you're right. So for that particular product, limited ability to increase except on the fact that after, say, the contract is 3 years, end of 3 years, inflationary improvement and improvement in our products, innovative improvement in putting more features in the product. But we better be selling them another product on the same basis. And that's how we expect to be able to grow. And so from 2 fronts: improving the product we have on an ongoing basis but also send the customer another product from our very broad suite of enterprise software products.",235

But since that would represent a 400 basis point increase from what you're targeting in fiscal '19, can you just walk us through some of the assumptions that could lift the operating margin level that magnitude?",56

So there's a number of things in that. First and foremost, we do continue to see the ability to grow the business. In the core semiconductor business, we do expect, especially as wireless recovers in the back half, to see a return to more standard sort of mid-single-digit growth rates in 2020. On the software side, as we continue to grow into the ratable model, we also expect to continue to see growth there in 2020 and into 2021. And then as is consistent with what you've seen over the last many years, our model is very focused on gross margin expansion. We will continue to drive incremental expansion in gross margin especially on the semiconductor side. And then finally, we talked about it a lot on this call, but we are going to be reducing expenses dramatically with CA. And we're doing that because of the change in the business model and the focus on the top 500 accounts, the focus on leveraging mainframe with these great enterprise products and moving to a fully ratable model, which is a much lower cost, much more profitable way to run the business. And so you're going to see the benefits of that in 2020, which will actually continue to show progress even into 2021 we think. So 55% operating margins, we think is very achievable with all those factors as we to look out beyond '19.",238

Fiscal '19, I would estimate we are carrying something like $1 billion of transition expenses in fiscal '19 alone. Now it won't all evaporate by fiscal '20, but a big part of it will evaporate by fiscal '20. And that, with the revenue increase Tom was talking about, gets us to that 55% operating margin.",92

I have met with quite a few CIOs, Chief Operating Officers and CIOs of fairly -- of some of the largest customers of CA who happen to be going for example or otherwise the largest end-use customers of Brocade as well, which is SAN switching. And you may know, we have mentioned it prior quarters, SAN switching, which is attaching to storage arrays, is very, very connected to mainframes as well in hardware and software, the way storage is done. And basically, all these customers, CIOs, a lot of them are, as you all know, thinking through the high levels of IT spending each of them has to go through. Each of them are trying to figure out what's the best structure, architecture for their data centers. And many of them are regulated, which means they can go completely to the cloud. So a lot of them are going -- are talking about -- actually, we all hear hybrid cloud. A lot more then are thinking of building their own private cloud. We have all the technologies, hardware and software to build -- enable them to build those private clouds. And each of those CIOs in these larger companies who are spending several billion dollars at least a year in IT are quite able and have the scale to do that. So there is potentially a lot of synergies, and it's not just in the technologies we have and collaborate as one. It's also the go-to-market model that would be very much simplified as we now reach out to those end-user customers who are in CA, who are in Brocade and who put indirectly -- are building or buying big data centers, compute storage, networking indirectly from us. So there is a lot of synergies, and we have begun the process of engaging in a dialogue.",309

But I think I'm not sure some of it is related more to microeconomic variations in those niche markets we deal with versus the bigger concern with respect to tariffs, is what I think you are referring to. It's hard to tell. But as we said, we're across so many different end markets, niche markets, some of them. We do see some of them -- your question is are they all consistently trending down. No, we do not see that. But we do see some that are down, and we do see some that are up. And is that an indication that it's tariffs versus very typical microeconomics or macroeconomics? Can't really tell because some of the color that I've given you guys are almost -- I mean, are not affected by those going through broadband recovery. I think it's more tied to the lumpiness and the cycle of carriers and operator investment, especially in Europe and U.S. more than anything else. And we have benefited from that. Meanwhile, cost spending, be they in the U.S. or China, is still on track because that is still going on very well. Enterprises, maybe we start seeing some level of slowdown in enterprises, but that's only now to -- down to a small part of our broader system. So there's a lot of mix. And at the end of the day, it's not that clear yet how this will affect the business we are in, which is largely enterprises and operators.

Let's try the first one. The cloud guys, as we see, the spending is still going on. I mean, they are -- their spending pattern to some extent almost is starting to track or copy those of operators. They get lumpy. They don't spread evenly across the year, but that's part of the reason why we want to go to annual thing because you do it quarterly, it's not driving me crazy. It's driving you guys, who track us, crazy because it gets very lumpy, especially with the level of spending. They are all coming in and the level of spending we -- they make on our products. And -- but you look at it across a period of like a year, they are sustaining. And they are sustaining and I really mean the high -- the large cloud guys, which include both China and U.S. but also even the Tier 2 guys. It's still sustaining. And probably, there's also content. We're selling them more and more stuff -- I should say products. It's not just switching and to some extent, routing. It's not just switching that we started with initially. It's -- which is why I like -- and it's not new generation of switching as they go to scale out of the data centers and higher capacity switching. We sell interconnects like fiberoptics, and that, I think, goes from 1 -- 10 gigabit to 100 gigabit, now 100 to 200 and 400. The price point, the content of those fiberoptics goes -- shoots up fairly exponentially and very nicely. And then we also do this computing offload, which is really a nice description of broad base of, as I say -- you call it accelerators. And it's true. They are mostly accelerators and deep learning chips, network, Ethernet, controllers, Smart NIC as some people call them, encryption, compression, video delivery chips, all those growing bigger. The content keeps going up. And that's why they're some at level -- when you pull it all together, where do you see cloud going? And as I say, most of these are not 1 generation or 1 year at a time. They go beyond 1 year. So overall, we see it as a continuum that is growing. How fast does it grow? It's that 20% I mentioned in Q4 seem somewhat unusual, but it's because of the lumpiness. And that's why we don't give you guys the wrong impression because the quarter before was closer to 10%. And on average, I would say, the cloud guys grow more, more likely in the high single digits to 10% year-to-year than a 20% that any particular quarter might lead us to think. So -- but it's there and very stable. And it's there to replace, to some extent, the enterprises, the traditional enterprises.",472

It's a new way of reporting for us, but we think we're going to have modest growth on the semiconductor side. And then you've got 2 businesses. You've got CA and Brocade, which is constituting the $5 billion that we're building up on the infrastructure software side.
