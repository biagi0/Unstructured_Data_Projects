25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2014",2014-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3371.0,592194.0,26887409.0,Presenter Speech,Hock Tan,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Bin. Good afternoon, everyone. We are going to start today by reviewing recent market business highlights in our end markets, then Tony will provide a summary of the first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results. 
Revenue from our first quarter was $709 million and represented a decrease of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 23% from the same quarter a year ago. Now Q1 revenue came in slightly better than the midpoint of our initial guidance. Sequentially, seasonal down trends provided some headwinds in our wired and industrial business, even if strong demand from a major smartphone OEM sustained our record wireless revenue through this quarter and backed the historical norm of a revenue decline in wireless in Q1. Having said all that, the key message I want to impart this quarter is simply that we have significant year-on-year revenue growth in wireless, that's 13% year-on-year, and wired infrastructure at 59% year-on-year and have seen a clear recovery in industrial end demand from a year ago. 
Let me now provide more color on each of our end markets, starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless came in slightly above our expectation, growing 1% sequentially and represented 49% of our total revenues. On a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned, revenue -- wireless revenue grew 13%. And as mentioned earlier, normally, our fiscal Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for wireless. However, sustained demand from a large OEM customer during the quarter helped us achieve a second consecutive quarter of record wireless revenue. This period, I would also like to highlight an exciting development, and it should come as no surprise that the push into LTE among carriers in China has enabled us to now design in meaningful content in the mass-market China smartphones for the first time. This trend was significant enough to substantially grow our mix of FBAR revenue and expand wireless gross margin during the quarter. 
Looking towards Q2 of fiscal 2014, similar to last year, the annual product transition at this same large OEM I referred to earlier will now be a significant headwind. However, we expect this may be partially offset by initial product ramp and another large OEM customer where we have won significant RF content. Moreover, we see in this quarter the proliferation by multiple white box OEMs of LTE-enabled handsets in China, which would accelerate demand for FBAR filters. The expected surge of our FBAR sales will, in addition to expanding our wireless gross margin by over 200 basis points further, partially cushion our decline in Q2 revenue from wireless to no more than mid-teens sequentially. Of course, year-on-year, we still project continued growth in our wireless business. 
Moving on to wired infrastructure. Wired revenue declined 7% sequentially and represented 32% of overall revenues. Year-on-year, this grew 59% but closer to 20% without adding in CyOptics. Data center-related demand continued to be strong, particularly for our new-generation, 48-gigabit-per-second fiber optics. However, due to sluggish enterprise demand and soft carrier routing, coupled with the known inventory adjustment at our major networking OEM customer, both our ASICs and parallel optics business declined sequentially compared to the preceding quarter. Now into this mix, we have also aggressively transformed the CyOptics business model from low-margin module revenue in China to higher-margin component sales. Despite this strong demand by service providers, particularly for optical 100G coherent transport solutions, had enabled us to sustain the CyOptics revenue level.
Looking forward to Q2, we believe strength in data spending will continue. In fact, we expect to see the initial ramp of our proprietary bidirectional optical transceivers for simultaneous 10G and 40G transmission, which have been adopted by a major networking customer in their new-generation data center platforms. One network switching remains muted. We expect demand from EDGE routing, as well as high-performance computing, will drive sequential revenue growth for our ASICs. And as a result, we anticipate wired infrastructure revenue to grow mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared with Q1. Importantly, year-on-year, we expect to sustain our revenue growth trajectory in this end market. 
Finally moving on to industrial. Industrial sales declined 11% sequentially, below our expectation at the beginning of the quarter, but nonetheless showed a steady recovery of 6% from the relative bottom of a year ago. Industrial sales represented 19% of our overall revenues. This weaker-than-expected sales were caused largely by our ongoing actions to contract inventory in the channels, which exacerbated this single-digit seasonal decline in distribution resales in this end market. But not all regional geographies behave the same way. As is normal this quarter, we experienced low-single digit declines in North America and Europe. However, Japan continue its industrial recovery based on domestic demand and strong export performance, while Asia remained virtually stable, supported largely by China spending.
Looking to Q2. We expect resales -- industrial resales will rebound by mid-single digits on a percentage basis. We also plan to ship more into distribute channels in anticipation of this improvement in industrial demand. Accordingly, revenue for industrial end market is forecast to grow high-single digits on a percentage basis compared to Q1. By the same token, year-on-year, we anticipate industrial sales will also expand high-single digits. 
To sum up, in Q2 -- in the second fiscal quarter, I should say, we expect product transition at a major OEM in wireless, which will drive consolidated sales down, despite sequential growth in both wired infrastructure and industrial. Accordingly, we're guiding overall revenue to decline between 3% to 6% from that of Q1. Notwithstanding, we expect that the favorable growth trend year-on-year experienced in our 3 end markets during Q1 will persist into Q2. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of first quarter fiscal 2014 financials. Tony?",962
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2014",2014-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3371.0,592194.0,26887410.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available at our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $709 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was in line with our guidance for the quarter. Revenue from our wireless target market came in slightly better than our expectation, though it was offset by weaker-than-expected revenue from our industrial target market. Revenue from our wired infrastructure target market was roughly in line with our expectation. Foxconn continued to be a greater-than-10% customer. 
Our Q1 gross margin was 52%, which was above our guidance for the quarter, and also higher than the prior quarter. Gross margins improved in some of our product categories, offsetting unfavorable product mix. I would like to highlight that during the quarter, we successfully improved the gross margin of the CyOptics business to our targeted level of approximately mid-40s on a percentage basis, 3 quarters ahead of our original plan. We believe CyOptics gross margin has reached the level to support our overall corporate target and, therefore, we will stop commenting on it separately from this point forward. 
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses decreased by $2 million to $98 million, and SG&A decreased by $1 million to $44 million, driving total operating expenses for Q1 to $142 million, $3 million below our guidance. The lower-than-expected operating expenses were primarily due to a curtailment and settlement gain from a change to our U.S. retiree medical plan benefit in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained unchanged at 14% and SG&A remained unchanged at 6% of net revenue.
Income from operations for the quarter decreased by $5 million sequentially to $224 million and represented 32% of net revenue. Compared to the $162 million for Q1 of last year, income from operations increased by $62 million, helped primarily by higher revenue. 
Taxes came in at $7 million for Q1, $3 million below our guidance. This was due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and expense. 
Q1 net income of $217 million decreased by $10 million from the prior quarter, and Q1 earnings per diluted share of $0.84 was $0.05 lower than Q4. Q4 '13 net income was higher primarily because of an $11 million increase in other income, resulting from a gain on marketable securities. Compared to Q1 of last year, net income was $54 million higher and earnings per diluted share was $0.19 higher. 
Our share-based compensation in Q1 was $24 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q1 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&D and $13 million in SG&A. In Q2 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $30 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding dropped to 42 days from 52 days in the prior quarter. The decrease was due primarily to the linearity of revenue throughout the quarter, timing of shipments around the holiday season and our collection efforts. 
Our inventory ended at $286 million, a slight increase of $1 million from last quarter. Our wireless inventory remained at an elevated level in anticipation of continued strong demand throughout the year, particularly of our FBAR filter products. Days on hand were 76 days, which increased 5 days from Q4, given the lower revenue during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.11 billion, and we generated $229 million in operational cash flow. We spent $52 million on capital expenditures. This was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q2, we expect CapEx to be approximately $70 million, primarily to support our continued build-out of FBAR capacity. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 270,000 shares, which consumed $12 million of cash. The buyback was lower than the prior quarter due to the timing of our negotiations to acquire LSI. On December 31, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per ordinary share, which consumed $62 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011 to date, we've continued to increase our dividend each quarter. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to be down in the range of 3% to 6% from Q1. Gross margin is expected to be 52.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $147 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $7 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 261 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",872

So I think the mix, we've seen improvement in the wireless side is sustainable. It's definitely things that you can get that as the FBAR mix and so forth.

And -- but in -- if we talk industrial, as I assume you are referring to in this question, we are seeing refill a lot in Japan where there's a fairly strong industrial recovery. We're also seeing that in Europe where, after the season -- and the holidays season last quarter, things are picking up and resale is showing very strong signs. Those are 2 specific areas we are talking about. Industrial in -- as I mentioned, in China, continues to be stable, slightly up, but nothing dramatic, but very stable at a significant level. Having said that, for channel inventory in general, we are seeing very strong resale. And because of that refilling too, in China, particularly with respect, not so much for industrial, in China, as much as wireless products for the white box makers in China.",146

And I assume you are referring to the announced merger of RFMD and TriQuint. And it's -- we know Bob and Ralph very well, strong -- good guys, good managers. And we have very strong managers.

But when I look at the guidance you're giving for the April quarter, it suggests sort of mid-single digit or so year-on-year growth. Now I understand the transition at your largest customer. But how is it that of the need for FBAR is going up, yet you are seeing this deceleration in sales. Is this just sort of a temporary pause when the growth driver is really your largest customer and as the mix shifts towards more to China and other customers? Or are you still comfortable with the long-term sort of double-digit growth trajectory possible in this business?",117
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2014",2014-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3371.0,592194.0,26887423.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,16,"To get right to the nut of your question, yes. We are still very comfortable with double-digit year-on-year growth. As I was very careful to articulate in each case, year-on-year, we still show -- which is on a quarter-on-quarter basis, year-on-year, we still show double-digit growth. The interesting thing we are experiencing, and I mentioned that a lot in my last -- in the last earnings call and I don't -- and I'm -- is simply that as the OEM industry consolidates, revenues within each year, as we go 1 quarter to the other within each year, goes through sharp movements because of product transitions of those larger OEMs now in smartphones in the marketplace. And so you do -- we do -- and by the way, our content keeps increasing in those OEMs, which exacerbates it even further. But what we do see is fairly sharp changes in revenues quarter-on-quarter during the year. But if you look at -- if you look -- trend it over the -- from 1 year to the other, you will see very clearly that we are able to sustain double-digit, year-on-year growth, which is really what matters because within each in a year, you will see the other handset OEM launch their products at different times. And because of that, we go through fairly sharp upticks as well as fairly sharp declines, as we move from one quarter as we did from Q1 to Q2 in this current year. And we will probably see another cycle of movements as we move to Q3 and Q4 this year when the large OEM launches its new generation of phones.",274

And as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that you are starting to see the surge in your China FBAR adoption. Is there a way to quantify how much that is? So outside of your top 2 sort of Tier 1 customers, is there a way to size how much that white box China market is demanding FBAR? Or is it too early to provide that quantification?",73

And because it's not just one OEM in China that's launching LTE-enabled phones -- smartphones. It's multiple OEMs at the same time rushing into this market. And as you all know out there, China 4G or LTE is just a big thing this year -- since the beginning of this year. And it's not just handset that's happening. It's infrastructure -- wireless infrastructure that's been built out, rolling out in China on LTE and shouldn't surprise us all that -- because of that smartphones are coming out LTE-enabled, which are low cost, even by China standards, and -- but then are LTE-enabled. And it really proves a point that we have been announcing all the time in our FBAR thesis, which is FBAR is used based on technology requirement, not based on whether they are high end or low end. It is really based on technology requirements and there are some bands, particularly in China, that do require, very much so, FBAR in order to achieve its performance. And because of that, we are seeing those designs and quite a considerable amount of those designs, which are driving quite a bit of our FBAR revenue from that angle. Having said that, our more traditional markets of the large, branded smartphone OEMs continue to adopt for the same reason the Chinese white box OEMs are adopting more and more designs that uses FBAR, though a lot of them relate to front-end modules that encompasses both the FBARs and filters, as well as the associated power amplifiers from an not just one band, from multiple bands, within your phones.",284

Just one last one, high CapEx is -- could be a good news or bad news story. The question is -- it was about 8% of sales for you in the last 4 quarters.

But again, we're only investing with line-of-sight capacity that we need for either, as Hock mentioned, either the large OEMs or some of these other surge we're having.

So it's a typical technological race. They improve, we try to improve more. And if we're already ahead of the game, it makes our improvement much better. But they still [indiscernible]. And in terms of other players, then just ourselves and TriQuint trying to get into the BAW business, oh, yes, that had -- has happened. It's not the first time. And that continues to happen. It's something -- nothing new. We have not seen for the last few years. But see, a big part of where we are today is not just the technology in terms of evolution of FBAR or BAW, as you put it generically. We are on, as I mentioned, on our current 8th generation, moving to our 9th generation. Nobody comes even close at this point. And as long as we keep making the investments we are making, we not only are continuing to be ahead of the game technologically on our FBAR, but in terms of capacity to try to address a very fast-expanding market. We  are also, I believe, quite way ahead of anybody else.",239

We're not wrong there, really. And that's why we put in huge amount of investments. We also put in investment in doing power amplifiers because that's what it takes to sell FBAR many times. And it's a very -- and it's -- it changes depending on the generation. It changes depending on the architecture. So it's not one single particular architecture in RF that makes -- that is pretty much etched in concrete. We vary -- it varies. So many times we sell discrete FBAR and we love to do that. But if we have to, we sell those so-called end-to-end solutions as you pointed. We call it front-end module. We just don't have the transceivers, I guess. But on an RF basis, we do cover the full gamut between the antenna to the baseband transceiver. But if you're talking about things like SkyOne and -- or RF360 by Qualcomm, we don't specifically go into that yet. Doesn't mean we will never. We keep an open mind, as I said, and we are very opportunistic based on the fact that our simple -- our single strategy is we do products that can differentiate ourselves and performs distinctly.

Hey, you are really reading too much in what I'm saying, and maybe it's my mistake. I was actually trying and doing a very unprofessional victory lap about the fact that, hey, finally, we got into low-end phones in China and that's because of FBAR. Because, as you know, we have never -- we have not participated much in those low-end phones in China because of price and because of inability to differentiate. Finally, we did and it's because of FBAR, which we've been talking about for years about the fact that it's technology that drives its usage more than the price points of smartphones. We've finally proven that. That's all I'm saying. And unfortunately, this seems to be leading you to a path that says, ""Well, now tell me, when -- how much is it going to drive your business?"" Well, a bit too early to tell, I'd be honest, JoAnne, because it depends on how successful those LTE-enabled white box phones are going to be in China. And I can't really tell because the surge of it is just happening. It could be a one-quarter wonder for all I know. I don't really know. I hope it isn't. And if it can sustain, it'd be great for us.

Well, I guess, it's not just overnight that I am. I -- as I mentioned, if you look at our Q1 last quarter, that is, and you look over the trend over the last several quarters, we have seen -- having said that, I have to qualify, it's a gradual but fairly, very steady uptrend of demand resale in industrial in China, but also even in places like Europe, where after the meltdown in Europe a year ago, people have given up as a lost cause. It has recovered. And in Japan, here's the other data point that gives me a lot of encouragement, especially with a fairly low yen these days, finally, we're starting to see that the Japanese industrial OEMs, the big powerhouses that we sell many of our products to, are also picking up steam. And the reason they're picking up steam over the last 6 months or 9 months, 6 months in particular, is not just strong domestic demand, but they are able to export into China, guess what, and emerging countries, of course, China, helped by their currency. And even the Europeans are able to hold their own. So what that tells us is that there is improvement in industrial demand. It may not be as strong or as clear as the way wireless moves. But it is more steady and it's definitely a trend. And that's part of the reason why I'm feeling more bullish about it as you put it than it is. Having said that, from a year ago, we have grown 6% industrial. It's no great shakes but mid-single-digit for industrial year-on-year isn't too bad. At least, it's not going down or flat.",283

Book-to-bill, unfortunately for us, is not a very clear indicator. Because to many of our larger OEMs, and they're comprised a big part of my revenues, we are on vendor -- VMI, as they call it, vendor-managed inventory. Basically, we -- they ship direct -- they pull it direct from hubs. So there's almost no book-to-bill ratios as it applies to a big chunk of our revenues. The part that applies are the smaller chunk and the smaller chunk, I hate to tell you even I give you data, might not reflect what the total business tells it, albeit the range.

That's a very interesting question for me. And I try to put in some comments. I'll tell you what we're seeing right now. I don't know what's going to happen the rest of the year, to be honest. It's hard to figure it out. But in enterprise, the transceiver business overall is kind of -- the optical transceiver business has been flattish and no surprise, as some of the OEMs out there have been saying that there may be winners and losers among the lot. But broadly, I think the market is flattish. And the way we try to play in this market now is what we have always been trying to do, which is pick out opportunities that are -- that we can produce fairly proprietary products for and right on the coattails of those customers who adopt our proprietary designs and use that to push their overall systems. And as I pointed out earlier, we've started last year with 40G and that's more of a standard product. But we were about the only guy who could do it at that time and do it for extend -- relatively longer distances to be applied in data centers. And we have been selling it very well, and we continue to sell it very well. That's one of our drivers. The other thing that is also happening now is we just launched and are ramping up another proprietary fiber optics that is bidirectional. What that really does is applicable, particularly, for data centers where we can with our transceivers, our customers or their customers or our OEMs can run using the same infrastructure of OM3 fiber optic cables that have already been laid out in an existing legacy data center, just change the transceiver and suddenly transform the transceiver from running 10 gigabit to 40 gigabit by just putting in new transceivers and boxes. That's the one -- that's the new product we launched and that's what I mentioned earlier in my remarks about transceivers that can simultaneously do 10 gigabit, as well as 40 gigabit. That's the bidirectional product we launched. We're depending on those kind of proprietary system to give us an edge and gain us share to grow. But as far as the broader market is concerned, what we're seeing now is fairly flat and sluggish, be it switching, routing market -- be it switching or routing market.",406

We have definitely very, very good ASICs, very proven ASICs. And there are not too many people out there who can do those kind of ASICs and run it all the way to 28 gigabit per second, which is what we and our current generation of products out there in designs are doing now. And that's really our edge, our differentiation in a lot of the opportunities we go against. Of course, the other side to it is we are very tested and we have very good skills in integrating, not just the SerDes, but the IP cost into one complex micron digital chip that we do for ASICs for our customers. And we're very good at doing that. So we continue to driving that. And frankly, on our ASIC business, we're very linked to the customers we deal with and we deal with only a handful of large OEM customers. And as they succeed, so do we. If they don't grow as much, we don't grow as much either. But that's pretty much where we stand right now. And so we've -- in terms of -- and we are very much focused on the enterprise networking business, though we do some of it in high-performance computing. And what we're seeing now is high-performance computing is doing very good currently. So that's providing the engine of growth for us. As far as ASICs into enterprise networking, largely in the switches and all that, growth here is okay. And over the last few years, we've been growing at 20% a year. We expect close to that this year as well. But if not, something that ramps up fairly rapidly.",287

But it's -- but some of these bands are on the edge because of how they are architected in any phone system. If, for instance, they are stuck next to certain other bands and certain other functions that may interfere with their performance easily, certainly, the band that is on the margin may become not on the margin any longer. Equally, the other direction, if you put a -- even if you put a band that is not so on the margin but in a very clean environment, and that doesn't happen too often, might get away with temperature-compensated SAW filters. Doesn't happen too often, though. But it's hard. It is -- this as not a -- it's not deterministic. It's very under-deterministic, depending on the system and the architecture of each of the handset. But what the broader picture is evolving is that as you put in more bands and as phones carry around more bands, and some of these bands are harder and harder, and even if all bands are on the margin, when you put a bunch of them together, they all become non-marginal. They become tough. And as more of that happens, the trend towards FBAR, as I've always said, will continue to move up.",234

Good afternoon, everyone. Now we're going to start today, as we always do, by reviewing recent business highlights in our end markets. And then, Tony will provide summary of our second quarter fiscal 2014 fiscal results. 
Before we do that, a couple of housekeeping items. As you all know, we closed the LSI acquisition on May 6, 1 day into our fiscal Q3. And I'm very pleased to welcome LSI's employees, customers and partners to Avago. Since then, we have been hard at work integrating the 2 companies. And accordingly, any comments made on fiscal third quarter and beyond will apply to the combined Avago/LSI businesses. Q2 commentary will, of course, only apply to classic Avago. 
Also, earlier today, Seagate announced they will be acquiring the LSI flash businesses, which include the standard flash controllers and the PCI Express flash adapter product lines for $450 million in cash. We are divesting this LSI product lines, as they do not strategically fit with our long-term business model. The impact from this divestiture to our total revenue, on an Avago/LSI combined basis, is not material. 
Okay. Starting with our Q3 fiscal quarter, our mix of revenue will change and will now include a new end market we call enterprise storage, in addition to the previously defined Avago wireless, wired infrastructure and industrial markets. I will provide additional color on the changes in the end market discussion. 
Revenue for our second quarter was $701 million, and represented a decline of 1% from last quarter and an increase of 25% from the same quarter a year ago. Q2 revenue came in higher than the upper end of our guidance, and the primary driver of our better-than-expected revenue performance was very strong wireless shipments into Korean and Chinese handset OEMs. 
Let me now proceed to provide much more color on each of these end markets, starting with wireless. The composition of our wireless end market remains unchanged, post the LSI acquisition, basically comes from Avago classic. And for fiscal Q2, revenue from wireless came in significantly above our expectations and was flat sequentially compared to our prior expectations for mid-teen decline on a percentage basis. Wireless represented 50% of our total revenue, and on a year-over-year basis, wireless grew 25%. 
As mentioned during our Q1 call, we had expected our Q2 revenue to decline sequentially, as we work through the normal annual product transition in a large North American OEM customer. While we did experience that anticipated product-transition-related decline, we were able to fully offset that decrease with a strong product ramp at another smartphone OEM and strong demand from LTE-enabled Chinese smartphones. We are also achieving high penetration with these Chinese OEMs through our industry-leading FBAR technology. The growth in FBAR-related revenue helped us to continue to expand our gross margin. 
Looking at Q3 fiscal 2014, and clearly, this end market is only classic Avago, we expect mid-single digit sequential growth in our wireless business with the beginning of a ramp from a North American smartphone customer, as they transition to their next-generation platform. And we continue to also see very strong demand for our FBAR-related products from the Chinese LTE smartphone OEM. We also expect to see additional Avago content for handsets enabled by our FBAR technology and taking advantage of the expected increase in RF content across both traditional high-end smartphones, as well as even entry-level solutions. For Q3, revenues from our wireless end market will be a little over 25% of our total revenues, which would have included the impact of the LSI acquisition. 
Moving on to wired infrastructure, for fiscal Q2, in which we talk only about Avago classic, wired revenue decreased 4% sequentially, performing below our expectations at the beginning of the quarter and represented 31% of overall revenues. However, we continue to see a fair amount of strength in this end market as, on a year-over-year basis, we still grew 43%. ASICs was flat sequentially, as data center switching remains relatively soft, but we're starting to see a rebound in a major -- at a major data networking OEM. We saw a sequential decline in our fiber optics with slower-than-expected shipments for our 40G products, which are also influenced by data-center-switching softness. 
Please note too, that starting fiscal Q3, in addition to fiber optics and SerDes-based ASICs, our wired infrastructure end market will now also include LSI's ASICs, as well as standard x-year-based products. In this regard, we expect Q3 revenues from a combined wired infrastructure end market to be a little over 1/4 of our total revenues. Looking forward, we expect strength on a number of fronts. We expect a significant ramp in our ASIC revenue from shipments into base stations, as well as enterprise and data center switching platforms. ASIC increases will come from both Avago and LSI design wins. And we are expecting a recovery in fiber optics as it relates to enterprise switching. We believe that a combination of LSI and Avago positions us extremely well to take advantage of next-generation data center switching and LTE transitions and network upgrades on the wireless infrastructure side.
Onto enterprise storage. This is a new market for Avago, addressed by LSI's hard disk drives and servers and storage connectivity product lines. Accordingly, for Q2, we have no discussion as it relates to Avago classic. For Q3, however, we expect to continue the momentum and leadership LSI had established across all the storage product lines, and expect some strength in Q3. For hard disk drives, against a backdrop of a fairly stable market, especially in our focus areas of 3.5-inch and enterprise SaaS, we expect to continue to benefit from our strong design win positions in 3 channels and pre-amps across all hard drive OEMs. 
Our server and storage connectivity business, which includes our SaaS and rate silicon adapter and software solutions, are now entering the seasonally second -- strongest second half of the calendar year for the server and external storage markets. We remain very enthusiastic with our progress in 12G SaaS design wins and ramps across multiple OEM customers. And we expect Q3 revenues from enterprise storage to be approximately 1/3 of our total revenues. For now, we expect enterprise storage will be the largest end market for us.
And finally, moving on to industrial. Fiscal Q2 industrial resales were very strong in the quarter, with double-digit sequential growth on a percentage basis, which was in line with our expectation for this end market. We saw strength, especially in Europe and Japan; however, we reduced shipments to our distributors to reduce inventory levels in the channel. This resulted in industrial sales increasing only 2% sequentially during Q2, but way below what we have guided at the beginning of the quarter, but up 3% from a year ago. Industrial sales represented 19% of our overall revenue in Q2. In Q3, though, we expect to replenish inventory, the low level of inventory, at many of our distributors, to support expected growth in the high-single digit level, sequentially, as a result of continuing worldwide recovery in industrial activity.
Now starting Q3, we will also include in the industrial the LSI intellectual property licensing business. Combined with this, our Q3 revenues will be approximately 1/8 of total revenues in this segment. 
In summary, for Q3, here's how we would see our business. The beginning of a strong product ramp in wireless, a rebound in wired infrastructure and continued stability and slight growth in enterprise storage and industrial. We expect overall revenue for fiscal quarter Q3, therefore, to come in between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. As you know, this is the first quarter for the combined Avago/LSI businesses, and integration activities are still progressing but progressing very well. Our restructuring activities to achieve forecast annual cost synergies of $200 million have just kicked off, but we remain very much on track to achieve these by the end of our fiscal 2015, the first full fiscal year after closing. We are also working to drive the combined LSI Avago businesses long-term towards a non-GAAP operating margin model that is consistent with the Avago classic business model. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our second quarter fiscal 2014 financials.",1381
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, May 29, 2014",2014-05-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,2994.0,645059.0,28864187.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $701 million in Q2 represents a decrease of 1% from last quarter and an increase of 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Overall, Q2 revenue came in higher than the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our wireless target market came in better than our expectation, though it was offset by weaker-than-expected revenue from our wired infrastructure and industrial end markets. 
Foxconn and Samsung were greater-than-10% customers in fiscal Q2. Our Q2 gross margin was 54%, which was above our guidance for the quarter and also higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher-than-expected FBAR revenues, which have favorable gross margins. 
Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses increased by $3 million, to $101 million, and SG&A increased by $3 million, to $47 million, driving total operating expenses for Q2 to $148 million, or $1 million above our guidance. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained unchanged at 14% and SG&A was 7% of net revenue. 
Income from operations for the quarter increased by $9 million, sequentially, to $233 million, and represented 33% of net revenue. Compared to the $158 million for Q2 of last year, income from operations increased by $75 million, helped by higher revenues and better gross margins. Taxes came in at $9 million for Q2, $2 million above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher income than forecast, as well as a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and expense.
Q2 net income of $223 million increased by $6 million from the prior quarter, and Q2 earnings per diluted share was $0.85 or $0.01 higher than Q1. Compared to Q2 of last year, net income was $70 million higher and earnings per diluted share was $0.24 higher. 
Our share-based compensation in Q2 was $30 million, the breakdown of the expense for Q2 includes: $3 million in cost of goods sold; $10 million in R&D; and $17 million in SG&A. In Q3 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $79 million, and this includes the impact from the LSI acquisition. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding remained at 42 days, same as the prior quarter, as we observed stable revenue linearity throughout the quarter. Our inventory ended at $301 million, an increase of $15 million from our last quarter. Our wireless inventory increased in anticipation of a continued strong demand throughout the remainder of the calendar year, particularly for our FBAR products. 
Days on hand were 86 days, which increased 10 days from Q1 due to this planned inventory build. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion and we generated $251 million in operational cash flow. 
We spent $73 million on capital expenditures. For Q3, we expect CapEx to be approximately $125 million, which primarily relates to spending to support our continued build-out of FBAR capacity and also the impact from the LSI businesses, which include a campus rationalization. 
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares in anticipation of completing the LSI acquisition, which closed on May 6. Our 2013 share repurchase program has expired, and the board has not, as yet, authorized any new share repurchases while we digest the LSI transaction. However, it is something that we and the board look at regularly. 
On March 31, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per ordinary share, which consumed $68 million of cash. The dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Our Q3 guidance includes the LSI acquisition, which closed on the second day of the quarter. This guidance is not adjusted for the business divestiture announced earlier today. 
Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Gross margin is expected to be 55%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $386 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $20 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $54 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 276 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",812

Hock, maybe the first one for you. What's your sense of the wireless market? You had a very strong quarter in Q2 and you're guiding to mid-single-digit type growth in Q3, partly related to China LTE deployment. Do you think there is some kind of bubble or inventory building up in China, or do you think just the growth trends that you're seeing are more sustainable in the second half also?",76

The demand --  I do know, though, the demand continues to be very strong. And as you know, the bands -- and it's obviously related to LTE build-outs in China because of the bands and the strong demand for FBAR products, which are particularly strong as it relates to LTE and Wi-Fi, I should add. But -- and this -- so this strength we saw beginning of Q2 -- middle of Q2, to be precise, and has continued till now. And we have a very strong backlog, we have a very strong demand. And the question is how long it will continue? I don't really know. What we do see within our lead times, which runs out over 10 weeks, is continued strength.",134

And then as a follow-up, on the divestiture -- or the planned sale of the flash business, how do we think about, first of all, the benefits that you might get from a profitability perspective? Is that included in the $200 million cost synergies you had given out before? Would be it incremental to that? And then also sort of related, I think Seagate is paying roughly 3x sales for that division, is that a fair price? It seems like, I think, Western Digital paid more like 6x, 7x sales for Virident. So any color around operating sort of savings from divesting the division, and just the price you're getting for that division would be helpful.",118

We believe that we could drive $200 million of cost savings from whatever business we would inherit, so that is not included. Now, I qualify that by saying for us to march to our long-term business model of the Avago operating margin, that did contemplate some divestitures. And I'll let Hock comment on the part of your question that says, did they pay too much or whatever. I won't comment on that.",101

As I said -- as we said -- as I articulated in my opening remarks, we do not see this business as, in the long-term, being very strategic to our business model. It would require continued level of investments, obviously, to which we have a lot -- and this business has great capabilities, but I would continue further investments to sustain that capabilities. And given it's long -- it is not part of our long-term plans to make those kinds of investments, we obviously chose to divest it. And I think it was a very fair deal, both sides.

And there, they'd start behaving a lot more like service providers than traditional enterprises, where demand is more stable and more predictable. Here's a bit less predictable, we're not looking at this miss in the Q2 on, obviously, on fiber optics, which is what this is, because our ASIC business sustained. And on my remarks on fiber optics, it's simply because at the leading edge, especially on 40G, fiber -- 40G interconnects, fiber transceiver interconnects, which is where we largely see a miss, and that's probably because it is state-of-the-art data center build-outs that require the use of those 40G. And the fact that we don't hit all the demand -- all the -- what we had thought we should hit in the quarter. That demand is likely to reappear in the following quarter. Hence, our expected rebound in Q3, what we missed in Q2.",194

So we're really confident on the acceleration on removal of costs. And as we mentioned, most of it is going to come from the R&D and SG&A line. Now I won't comment at all on the divestiture just yet, but we'll break that down in the future, as we complete the sale and so forth.",107

We believe that's something that can continue well throughout the calendar year. However, we do have some CapEx coming online, so depreciation in the fab will go up slightly. But we've seen utilization in the fab is pretty much pegged at 100%, and even as we add capacity throughout the year. So we think the tailwinds to our gross margin is still pretty good, mostly driven by kind of our wireless, especially, wireless mix. And then the overall wireless division is, again, closing that gap on the corporate average pretty quickly as well. So we're very positive on those things. And the rest of the businesses are holding up well. I'd say it's mostly a wireless focus right now.",153

One big part of it is, obviously, notebooks, which, fortunately, LSI is very little represented, very little, if not, not at all represented, hence, the emphasis has been on 3.5-inch to SaaS hard drives. But -- and also in certain parts of data centers where you want really very fast -- or very good IOPS or latency access, that's an element of our replacement in that regard there. We see that and we do support that -- those enterprise markets through customized flash controllers that we developed for specific OEM customers of ours. That continues to happen and we continue to be able to participate in that. What we are moving out of by this divestiture is the merchant market for flash controllers on SSDs which is -- a big part of it, will be, obviously, in the client market and which we do not see our position to be very strategic in the first place.",186

And then, Tony, just a question on stock option expense. If I look at Avago's standalone, it's been about $30 million per quarter, that's about $0.10 to $0.12, and with the inclusion of LSI, it jumps up to about $80 million, which is more like $0.30. So how do we model that going forward? Is the $0.30, over time, going to come down? How should we think about stock option expense going forward?",74
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, May 29, 2014",2014-05-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,2994.0,645059.0,28864218.0,Answer,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,34,"Again, there's 2 pieces in that $79 million, there's the traditional Avago piece, which we had a grant in March. And so if we were to strip that out separately, it probably -- would increased probably from $30 million to, roughly, $40 million. And then for the LSI piece, is the remainder, so $39 million. Now that is impacted as well by the early exits of certain executives where they're accelerated. So we will see that trend down pretty significantly, pretty quickly, over time, to maybe a run rate of something closer to 20 in out quarters like 5 or 6 quarters out. However, I still qualify that because again, we need to bring on the LSI people onto our plans for stock comp and so forth. So I don't really have a real long term, but the $79 million is really somewhat of an anomaly for kind of this quarter and maybe next because we have this huge overhang from some of the exits that we have to pay for.",171

A large of part of that is happening -- a large part of this growth driver is obviously happening in China, as the Chinese carriers build out their 4G networks. And in so doing, at the same time, I believe they're obviously pushing the use of that network by being very aggressive in promoting, they call it terminals, I guess we call it handsets, devices in -- that are 4G-enabled. All that is happening, which is a big part of driving our wireless business, which we announced Q2 and which we continue to see strength in Q3 because of the proliferation of LTE-based handsets in China, both from local Chinese OEMs, as well as benefiting some of the global OEMs who sell into China. And we see both of that happening. But as far as the infrastructure side, it depends. There are some strength in it, especially on the backhaul, and it seems to move from backhaul to front end on the base station side, and we have -- and we've seen that vary quarter-to-quarter. As far as how long they will keep sustaining the rest of this year? I don't know. We can only hear -- have hearsay, but in terms of actual line of sight, we probably don't see it more than one quarter at a time.",221

Broadly speaking, and we think that's long-term, and long-term being 6 months, perhaps 1 year. Well, 1 year, say, realistically. What we see the highest growth drivers for our business is in wireless and wired, wired infrastructure. As in wireless, the reasons are quite obvious, is that 4G comes into play more and more, but what's also more clear is that as it comes into play, not just in China, now that North America is very 4G-enabled but more slowly, beginning into Europe and other places, we see content in handsets, smartphones, in particular, increasing. And we are rising more than unit growth, content growth in smartphones very strongly. And very short-term, technically, the ramp this current quarter, the beginning of the ramp this current quarter of our largest North American OEM customer is just tip of the iceberg in our view. So it would drive our wireless business very nicely, I think, over the next 12 months by line of sight. On wired, we see a combination that helps, some of it relates to China too. As I mentioned, as we've -- I talked along in -- to replying to earlier question, we see that 4G phenomenon, the conversion, to be a sustainable thing. Quarterly, you might see some variability, as we talked about. But over the next 12 months, we're very well-positioned, as evidenced by the size of our designs, but also the size of our existing backlog, by the way. That will drive our fiber business and will also drive a whole generation of SerDes-based ASICs that we and LSI, combined, have been able to secure in data center switching, as I articulated in my notes. That, coupled with more of a local phenomenon in China networks, metro networks and backhaul, especially in areas in excess to, I'm going to say, where we have a very strong position. We all see that, again, China build-outs of their expanded networks, especially in fiber access and fiber networks through backhaul as augmenting the strength in our wired infrastructure business. We see that today, and we see that continuing through the end of this year in China. So those 2 would be businesses we see growing probably at least in the double digits over the next 12 months. Against that, we see stable businesses, and by stable, I mean business that may grow in the single digit, mid-single digits, likely, in both enterprise storage and industrial. Low- to mid-single digits. So we have an interesting combination of 2 businesses, 2 end markets that will grow double digits and 2 -- that as we see now, are very stable, if not stably growing. So the endpoint of it all, when you combine all 4 together in a fairly balanced mix, is a business that probably is what we had forecasted before, which was a business that will grow in the high-single digits to, probably, low-double digits over the next 12 months.",491

They're not -- the consolidation -- 80% -- more than 80% of wireless business, about 80%, relates to handsets, and the bulk of it in handsets are triggered, are tied to FBAR, one way or the other. Power amplifiers that are put into front-end modules, with filters, FBAR filters, or whatever, but it is. And as you know, the handset businesses, especially smartphone business, has been very much consolidated. We are very well represented, by the way, in spite of the consolidation. But it is not that diversified in that regard. The positive side of looking at it, though, is that it's driven by -- not by, necessarily, unique phone architecture related to specific OEMs, it's really by the fact that 4G, whether that be in U.S., Europe, China, increases dramatically the use of FBAR filters, which we are very, very well-positioned. It also implies, with 4G, an increased number of bands required on every -- almost every smartphone around, whether they be in China, Europe or the U.S. An increased content gives challenges to power, gives challenges to coexistence of different bands running on the same phone, and gives challenges to space, which leads to architectures that favor our designs and therefore leads to increased content in our handset business. That's not necessarily an issue of diversity, as much as a technological trend, architectural trend that has favored our businesses. In terms of capacity, we continue to invest, and whether we invest in CapEx or, as Tony articulated, whether we invest by building products, wafers, early to handle shop expected ramps, as evidenced in our inventory level this closing quarter, Q2, it is intended to be able to ensure our capability and our capacity in addressing fairly substantial demand and ramp up by several of our large OEM customers.",312

Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent business highlights in our end markets. I might give you an update on progress of our integration, and then Tony will provide a summary of our third quarter fiscal 2014 financial results. 
So during our first quarter as a combined company, we have made great progress in integrating the Avago and LSI businesses. As you all are aware, in early May this year, as part of our cost reduction program associated with the acquisition of LSI, we announced our intent to eliminate approximately 1,100 positions from our workforce, and which would generate most of  the forecasted annual cost synergies of $200 million. This is still in progress very much and -- but we believe we are well on our way to achieving this before the end of fiscal '15.
On top of integrating the 2 companies and their workforce, we have also taken decisive steps to reshape our business to make our product portfolio more consistent with our business model. As you know, because of this, we have agreed to sell 2 non-core businesses, the LSI flash and Axxia businesses. Now revenue associated with these 2 businesses was a little over $100 million in Q3 fiscal '14, while the annualized operating expenses for these 2 businesses exceeded $200 million. So reflecting this, these 2 businesses will be reported as discontinued operations with revenues and costs taken out of P&L going forward. 
However, please note that the guidance we have provided for the third quarter still include expected contribution from both the flash and the Axxia businesses. And relative to this revenue guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we provided in May, our Q3 revenues reported were $1,394,000,000, which is at the high end of guidance, reflecting strong demand for our ASIC networking products and seasonal uptake in hard disk drives. 
Without revenue contribution from the flash and Axxia businesses, Q3 revenues from continuing operations would be $1.287 billion. So starting with Q3, our reported consolidated financial results will be shown in this manner. 
So turning now to a discussion of our end markets. As I mentioned in prior quarter's earnings call, with the combination of LSI, our mix of revenue now includes revenues from a new end market, enterprise storage, in addition to the previously defined wireless, wired infrastructure and industrial. 
Starting with wireless which, as you know, is pretty much classic Avago, not impacted by the LSI acquisition. For fiscal Q3, revenue from our wireless end market met expectation, moderately growing by 5% sequentially. Wireless represented 28% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And on a year-to-year basis, wireless revenue grew 26%. 
Within the quarter, we observed continuing demand increases for our FBAR and FBAR-related products and seen increased content from Chinese LTE smartphones, offset partially by softer demand from Korea. However, looking at Q4 fiscal 2014, we expect quite a different picture. We anticipate very strong sequential wireless revenue growth in excess of 60%. We expect this growth to largely result from the ramp of a new phone model in a North American smartphone customer. Compounding this ramp is a significant increase in content, driven by the increasing proliferation of wireless bands within LTE smartphones.
Moving on to wired. Our wired infrastructure end market includes our ASIC business and our fiber optics business, which is a combination in fiber optics of optical interconnects, modules that is, and components. For fiscal Q3, our wired end market performed as expected. Wired revenue represented 27% of our total revenues. Our ASIC business experienced significant strength from the prior quarter, driven by strong demand from enterprise networking switches as well as service provider routers. Driven by similar trends, our fiber optics business experienced a moderate recovery from the prior quarter. In particular, we saw a strong sequential increase in BiDi fiber shipments used for 40G. We also saw sustained demand for optical components from Fiber to the Home deployments in China, but we were capacity constrained within the quarter.
Looking forward to Q4, we expect low single-digit sequential growth, revenue growth, from this end market. We expect growth in our ASIC business from sustained demand in the enterprise switching and routing. Our leading IP, in particular, in high-speed SerDes with 25G and 50G offerings, continues to position us extremely well at many customers. And in Q4, we expect several design wins in high-performance computing platforms and software-defined networking switches.
For fiber, however, we expect that to be flattish in Q4. We expect growth in our BiDi products. We expect continued growth, I should say, in our BiDi products, offset, however, by slowdown in 4G/LTE wireless backhaul applications.
Moving on to enterprise storage. As I mentioned, this was a new end market for Avago in Q3, addressed by LSI's hard disk drive and server storage connectivity product lines. Starting in Q4, this end market will also include contributions from the recent PLX acquisition. For fiscal Q3, enterprise storage revenue came in also as expected, the brand represented 32% of our total revenues. Hard disk drive was strong as we benefited from seasonal strength in this end market, as well as certain design wins for custom solid-state drive controllers within the quarter.
Our rechannel in hard drives grew both in nearline as well as enterprise platforms, and we saw strength in 3.5-inch desktops. Demand also for our pre-end products was strong as customers built into expected seasonal strength in the quarter. 
Our server storage connectivity business, which includes our SAS, RAID con [ph] silicon, adapter and software solutions, continued to be very stable in Q3. Looking forward to Q4, our enterprise storage end market expects mid single-digit sequential revenue growth for the core business without contribution from the PLX business. Including PLX contribution, we expect sequential revenue growth for this end market to be a little higher than 10%.
In Q4, we expect server and storage connectivity to grow significantly as our server OEM customers start launching new grandly-based [ph] platforms using our 12G SAS solutions. And we expect our HDD business, hard disk drive business, to grow moderately, reflecting usual seasonality in the second half of the year. 
Finally, moving on to our industrial, and our smallest end market. This does also include LSI's IP licensing business. And in fiscal Q3, this end market saw strength compared to the prior quarter and represented 13% of our total revenues. Industrial resales, in particular, were even stronger especially in Asia and Japan. And overall, distributor inventory continued to decline within the quarter.
Looking into Q4, we expect our industrial to continue to grow with mid single-digit sequential growth rate. However, after such a strong Q3, we expect industrial resales to moderate. And we are closely watching Europe for weaker demand trends. However, we continue to see strength in Japan and China.
So in summary, for Q4, we expect revenue to grow -- consolidated revenue to grow sequentially in all our end markets. Very strong 60%-plus in wireless, low single digits sequential growth in wired, a little higher than 10% growth in enterprise storage, and mid single-digit growth in industrial. This leads to our overall expectation that revenue from continuing operations for fourth quarter fiscal 2014 to sequentially increase around 20%. Similar to what we experienced last year, we currently expect the increase in wireless demand to sustain into the first quarter of our fiscal 2015. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of third quarter fiscal 2014 financials. Tony?",1260
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2014",2014-08-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3167.0,688060.0,30486790.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. As we previously announced, we have definitively agreed to sell our flash and Axxia networking businesses, and we currently expect both of these transactions to close in Q4 fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the financial results and tables included in our third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings press release classify these businesses as discontinued operations. As a reminder, we acquired both of these businesses in the LSI transaction. 
Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Since the guidance we provided for the third quarter included expected contributions from both flash and Axxia businesses, I will provide Q3 revenues on a basis comparable to guidance, followed by detailed financial results for continuing operations only. Please also note that Q3 results include contributions from continuing operations of acquired LSI businesses, while prior periods mentioned do not, as the LSI acquisition was completed at the beginning of Q3 2014. In addition, the Q3 financial results do not include any contributions from PLX, which closed in Q4. 
Now on to our Q3 results. Relative to the guidance we provided in May, our Q3 non-GAAP revenues, including contributions from flash and Axxia businesses, now classified as discontinued operations, were $1.394 billion, coming in at the high end of our guidance. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion on financial results for continuing operations for the third quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.287 billion, and all our end markets performed as expected. Foxconn was a greater-than-10% customer in fiscal Q3. 
Our growth -- Q3 gross margin from continuing operations was 57%, which is above our guidance range of 54% to 56%. Please remember that our guidance range included expected contributions from flash and Axxia businesses, both of which typically run at a lower average gross margin than the rest of the business. 
Flash and Axxia are now classified as discontinued operations and are not included in gross margin for the quarter. This, combined with our revenues coming in at the high end of guidance, resulted in gross margin above our original value.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $219 million and SG&A expenses were $88 million, driving total operating expenses for Q3 to $307 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 17%, SG&A was 7% from net revenue. 
The guidance we have provided in May for Q3 operating expenses was $386 million, which included the flash and Axxia businesses. After adjusting for the impact from discontinued operations, our Q3 operating expenses were approximately $20 million better than our expectations in May, primarily due to progress in our cost reduction program associated with the LSI acquisition.
Income from operations for the quarter was $428 million and represented 33% of net revenue. 
Taxes came in at $24 million for Q3, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to a higher income than forecast. 
Q3 net income was $347 million and Q3 earnings per diluted share were $1.26. Q3 interest expense and other was $57 million. Specifically, interest expense related to our debt was $55 million.
Our share-based compensation in Q3 was $50 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q3 includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $20 million in R&D, $24 million in SG&A. 
In Q4 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation would be approximately $52 million and this includes the estimated impact of the PLX acquisition. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income, excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 39 days, an improvement from the prior quarter's 42 days. Our inventory ended at $482 million and days on hand were 79 days, which decreased 7 days from Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.277 billion and generated $314 million in operational cash flow. As a reminder, the PLX acquisition, which consumed approximately $310 million in cash, closed after the quarter ended.
We spent $95 million on capital expenditures. For Q4, we expect CapEx to be approximately $220 million, which primarily relates to spending to support our continued build-out of FBAR capacity as well as Avago-LSI integration activities supporting IT and a campus rationalization.
During the quarter, we did not purchase any shares. We currently expect to use some of the anticipated net proceeds from the sale of the Flash and Axxia businesses, less the payment for the PLX acquisition towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year. 
On June 30, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per ordinary share, which consumed $73 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and other factors deemed relevant by our board. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions. We do not intend to update this guidance. Our Q4 guidance includes the estimated effect of the PLX acquisition, which closed on August 12, about 1.5 weeks into our quarter. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only and does not include any contribution from the flash or Axxia businesses.
Net revenue expected to grow in the range of 18% to 22% from Q3. Gross margin is expected to be 56%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $307 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other expected to be approximately $53 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 279 million shares. 
I'm very pleased with the speed of our businesses evolution as, in a very short period, we have significantly transformed Avago, increasing our scale considerably with the LSI acquisition, while also selling product lines that do not strategically fit with our long-term business model. This, combined with our progress on restructuring cost synergies, is driving our non-GAAP operating margins for continuing operations over 30%.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",1095

Hock, my first question, just on the wireless business. Wondering, in the October guidance, if you can help us better understand, up 60% sequentially. How much of that is unit versus content? And in addition to that, if you think about the content trends in the LTE market in China, where are we today and where can you expect that to go over time?",65
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2014",2014-08-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3167.0,688060.0,30486793.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,6,"Well, that's a lot of questions. But let me take the broader question, which is what is content versus unit. I would say, probably 1/3 unit, 2/3 content. It's probably roughly what our overall wireless revenue represents. It's hard to really measure because it's more than just content. It's a mix of products that also starts to shift through it all. But for purpose of your addressing it in a fairly simple direct manner, probably 1/3 due to unit growth and 2/3 due to content is what's driving the overall expansion of the revenues. And to answer your question, yes, it's all LTE phones. As you know, LTE phones have, not only to factor in more and more LTE bands, roaming bands in multiple continents, through multiple carriers, is also related the fact that it had to be backward [ph] compatible with a bunch of 3Gs and 2Gs, including CDMAs. So the number of bands in every LTE smartphone increases more than linearly. I hate to use the word exponentially, but it almost feels that way. And really, the more bands they use in LTE, the more chances there are that FBAR and FBAR-related content is required. Not every LTE band needs an FBAR, but the more bands there are, the more coexistence issues exist, especially like in China, China Mobile where Wi-Fi exists and the TD-LTE Bands 39, 40, 41, has issues operating with Wi-Fi that tends to bring in increased instances of usage of FBAR. So our content in China has, content-wise, has gone up quite significantly, as I indicated in my remarks. And the trend, my view, is there to stay. Now there is also, going on, the possibility that there's clever ways to do it where you'll find ways to reduce the band by keeping the phone usage within narrower regions. And so, that does eliminate -- there's a counter trend to reduce, in some of these phones, the expansion of content. But you look at it broad-based, longer-term trend, it is a trend towards increasing content.",341

Then as my follow-up, I believe, in your prepared comments, you said there were some capacity constraints in your wired business. I wonder if you can just talk more specifically exactly where those constraints were, how much did it limit revenue in the just reported quarter? And does the guidance for October assume those capacity strengths have gone away?",63

And a large part of it goes into the same fab, the same process line, goes into, what I call, metro networks, single-mode fiber optics, as well as that same production line goes to produce lasers, components for Fiber to the Home deployments. And as both strengthened last 6 months, our capacity just jumped. As I mentioned, 4G LTE backhaul seems to have slowed down somewhat. So that enables us to push more into Fiber to Home deployments, which is very helpful. But we're still capacity-constrained. Even as we expand our capacity gradually this quarter, Q4 is still capacity-constrained. As far as how much revenues, I don't want to be speculating. We don't sell it, we don't count it.",144

When I look at the last few years, you've always had very strong seasonal Q4s, and then we have seen some modest seasonal declines in Q1, flat to down 2%, 3% or so. Now given the very sharp 60% plus growth that you're expecting in Q4, how should we think about the potential seasonal correction in Q1? Or do you think that there's a possibility that growth in China could, perhaps, correct for any moderation at your North American customer?",86

You are right. Historically, Q3, Q4 were our seasonally up quarters, and Q1 roll over. But then, what happened the last couple of years was that has changed. The seasonally strong quarter is Q4 and Q1 maintaining before it rolls over in Q2. And given that, with more recent trends, and given what were behind the reasons behind those recent trends, compound it with continuing strength in China LTE phones, I would say, I would expect, as I made in my opening remarks, that our wireless strength through this Q4 will likely sustain in Q1 before rolling over in Q2.",113

And then, maybe as a follow-up. As I look at the trajectory of operating expenses, obviously, very strong performance in controlling OpEx and with all the divestitures that you have done. When I look back, prior to the LSI acquisition, I think, your OpEx to sales was around 20%, 21-ish percent, and your Q4 guidance suggests that you're, sort of, already at those levels. So I'm trying to put the OpEx to sales as you've had historically in the context of more room that you have in the $200 million or so that you had outlined in terms of the cost synergies. So the other way of asking the question is, how should we think about OpEx trajectory over the next few quarters?",125
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2014",2014-08-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3167.0,688060.0,30486800.0,Answer,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,13,"So, Vivek, obviously, we're very pleased with the progress. But in that first bucket of what we call real savings, we still have a lot to do. There's stuff to do for the next 4 quarters. Those, as I mentioned, those 1,100 people are identified. They're rolling off into these next 4 quarters. So there is room. So I think, the other way to look at it is, if you look at the number of the $307 million that we guided to, that includes approximately $10 million from PLX. So you can see, we're continuing to do things quarter-over-quarter. Now as I've always said, for the 6 quarters of OpEx reduction, we're going to get some quick reductions in the first couple of quarters like you saw. We kind of flatten out here for the next couple of quarters, and then you'll see it reaccelerate into Q3 and Q4. Again, offset against any standard merits or bonus increases we do in the coming year.",164

There's been a number of companies that have pointed to a little bit of slowing there, and investors have been a little bit of concerned about a peaking in the cycle. So, Hock, I guess my question is, what are you seeing as far as the balance between supply and demand in those segments, and how are you feeling cyclical?",78

Of course, so if I address industrial, you're right, there is a slowing down in the growth of industrial. I would say, industrial, as I mentioned, last quarter, Q3, was industrial resale together [ph]. Our revenue ship rate [ph], which goes to largely in industrial to distributors, but really resale what our distributors sell, although which we track. It was high single digits last quarter, sequential growth, industrial. And I think, this quarter, it will slow down to probably mid single digit, is what I'm indicating. So there is a slowdown. But it depends on the geography that we are looking at. I see China and Japan continuing to still be okay. But I see Europe as definitely flattening and starting to slow -- more than flatten, starting to slow down. North America has been flat in the last 3 quarters, maybe there has been a slight increase now to sort of make it up. So you have a mixed set of circumstances, and I suspect it also depends on products one sells. Like, we serve 2, 3 industrial end markets. I tell you that they behave very differently. In servo drives, which is one big area in industrial consumption where we sell a lot of our products into, it's still good. And servo drives user models and all that, still good. Inverters continues to be weak. Factory automation, up sometimes, down sometimes, may happen [ph], and we continue to see this mixed effect [ph]. And part of servo being strong is related, obviously, to the ramp-up of capacity for some of these product ramps that we are talking about in China.",282

So as we mentioned, definitely through the sales and also the purchase of PLX, we will be making some debt paydown, and then also from the free cash flow going forward. We haven't really said -- we said it's going to be kind of in chunks, something in the $0.5 billion range when we do these payoffs, and we're not committing to a quarter-over-quarter type steady paydowns.

And as we've always said, whenever we add FBAR capacity, this capacity pays itself off fairly quickly. So you can see that couple of hundred million quarter-over-quarter in wireless revenue, that's FBAR-related. And if you put in any reasonable gross margin, you can see that we're going to pay for this CapEx pretty quickly. Now whether or not this continues on this trend forever, it's doubtful. We have to get some of this FBAR capacity in place. We also had a building that we bought that was supposed to happen at the end of Q3 that pushed into Q4. It was a little under $20 million. So I think that had impact as well. But we're not giving any long-term CapEx as of yet. You'll see us do it in a smart fashion as soon as we have line of sight for opportunities.",157

Well, there are multiple reasons. In Europe, there is this Russian situation that's not helping very -- in many ways, in particular, to Europe. Then there has been -- and we've noticed that now for a while, more recently, in last few -- last couple of quarters, is exchange rate. The European -- the industrial OEMs come from 2 locations in the world, Japan, Germany. And the guys -- the German OEMs operating with the euros have an issue on exchange rate compared to the Japanese. That's why we are seeing Japanese demand, from an industrial OEM, for our products sustaining, whereas Europeans are flattening. I suspect both have something to do with it. One is domestic demand, perhaps in Europe; but, two, is also exports related to competitiveness.",131

Does that kind of how we should think about it?",100

So you have take that $50 million per quarter and say some of it goes above the line. So yes, we made great progress in this first quarter.

I'm wondering what you see in future years. Is this sort of a last hurrah for significant content gains? Or do you have visibility towards further gains? And then, what sort of magnitude do you anticipate? And would those be in flagship models, or just really from the spread of 4G to emerging markets?",81

I can address it very, very simply, JoAnne, is we have visibility to the next couple of generations somewhat as we are engaged in working through architectures, or RF architectures, on high-end LTE smartphones. And the number of bands and by extension, 1 for 1, the number of filters that goes into the next generation and 1 -- and the n+2 [ph] after that, the increased bands is exponential. It is even getting more and more bands into each phone. And our sense of it is, within that kind of horizon that we have some, obviously, some sense, some of visibility, not perfect visibility, but definitely some, especially as it relates to RF architectures for smart to LTE handsets, be they 4G, 4.5G and, obviously, potentially beyond that. Just more and more bands and we see that linear expansion of demand for filters. We also see miniaturization, which actually requires that all those bands to be squeezed into tighter and tighter spaces, which then promotes to use more and more of creative architectures that relates to pads, especially pads, also the requirement for, not just envelope tracking, which we already know is happening, but carrier aggregation, which therefore pushes in more bands per phone as carriers seek to multiple bands in the same region that they have. All we have seen so far, and this is not just sticking a finger in the air and hoping for the best, is what we've seen in what engagements we are working with phone OEMs is that future phones, future generation phones, are going to require a substantial increase in the number of bands per phone and with it increased amount of content. From our perspective, as we see this current quarter, this current generation, as illustrated by this current generation, content is the biggest driver for growth -- of growth for us. And with content, as you are seeing here, what Tony said, it drives better and better product margin.",329

It's whether you put in switching, whether you put in multiplexers, as we call it. Multiplexer is a component that puts -- aggregates, I won't use the word integrate, but aggregate, multiple FBAR filters into 1 chip. It's coming into play more and more. And how you architect this whole thing is just as important as the very existence of just FBAR filter fundamental performance. So the more tricks here now, and those tricks are getting harder and harder. So we are not unduly concerned, though we are paranoid, about the existence of future players into this marketplace because it's more than just being able to produce an FBAR filter. It's also being able to design them together in the phone.",191

We're very good at filtering, we are very good at combining power amplifier with FBAR filters, and making interesting results out of it, be it envelope tracking, carrier aggregation, or combination of both. We're sticking to that. And I think there's enough opportunities for us, especially the point I made earlier with a question from JoAnne, is that we see the content for filters just continuing to increase pretty dramatically. And unlike power amplifiers where you can integrate multiple bands to be supported by 1 single multimode, multiband power amplifier, you need 1 filter for each band. So that increased that demand -- that volume increase is going to be very exciting for us over the foreseeable future.",157

Thanks for joining us. We are going to start today by reviewing recent business highlights and then Tony will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results.
So revenue for our fourth quarter was $1.61 billion, an increase of 25% from the prior quarter. The sequential revenue increase was above the upper end of our guidance, which was 18% to 22%. Wireless growth was better than expectations with revenue growing 73% sequentially, driven largely by product ramp of a new smartphone generation at a large OEM. Enterprise Storage also performed significantly better than expected even without considering contribution from our recent acquisition, PLX.
Now before I provide more color on each of our segments, let me quickly provide a short update on the integration of the Avago and LSI operations. As you know, we have completed the sale of 2 non-core businesses, the LSI flash and Axxia businesses, which had annualized operating spend of approximately $200 million. This has been a key contributor to the significant improvement in our operating model. We have also made great progress in extracting synergies from integrating LSI onto the Avago platform. We are now more than halfway through this process and expect to complete the balance of the integration program as we exit our fiscal 2015. Clearly, the financial benefits from the integration program and the divestiture of non-core businesses have been achieved faster than we had originally planned and has definitely given us flexibility to step up R&D investments in certain core businesses.
Now turning to the discussion of our various segments, starting with Wireless. In the fourth quarter, revenue from Wireless was much better than expectations said earlier, growing 73% sequentially. Wireless represented 39% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And on a year-on-year basis, grew 83%. Within the quarter, growth was largely driven by the ramp of a new smartphone generation at the north -- at a large North American smartphone OEM. We also benefited in this from a significant increase in our content.
We also saw strong double-digit sequential revenue growth from our FBAR-related products across the board and, in particular, from multiple Chinese LTE smartphone OEMs. In fact, over 80% of our Wireless revenue is now FBAR-related, which has driven significant improvements in Wireless gross margins.
Not surprisingly though, we continue to be very capacity constrained even as we have been investing in additional capacity to meet demand. Looking towards first quarter fiscal 2015, we expect sustained demand from our large North American smartphone OEM to mostly offset broad-based seasonal declines from many other global handset OEMs. We're not sure how this will play out in the quarter, so for now we expect Wireless revenue in Q1 fiscal '15 to be flat to perhaps slightly down on a sequential basis.
Moving to Wired Infrastructure, which consists of our SerDes-based ASIC business and our fiber optics business. Here, the Wired segment performed close to expectation in the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 1% sequentially. Wired revenue represented 22% of our total revenue from continuing operations. You may recall, we saw very significant strength in our ASIC business in the third quarter and that strength sustained into this fourth quarter. Overall, ASIC revenue was fairly flat on a sequential basis, with growth in Ethernet switching and routing products largely offset by declines in base station and high-performance computing.
In fiber optics, we grew moderately from the prior quarter, in particular, with very strong shipments of our 40G -- 40 gigabit, I should say, BiDi fiber products as the customer, the exclusive customer, built up their supply chain to support their new product launch. We also benefited from stronger demand for 16G fibre channel transceivers in storage markets and very strong Fiber to the Home deployment in China. Against this, we see declines in 10 gigabit and other standard transceivers.
Looking forward to first quarter 2015, we expect growth in our ASIC business to resume, partially offset by softness in our fiber optics business. In ASICs, we expect a strong ramp of next-generation LTE base station ASIC at a large Chinese OEM. And we expect a stable enterprise and data center Ethernet switching market. However, in fiber optics, we expect recovery in parallel optic shipments into routers, core routers, to be more than offset, however, by declines from our other Ethernet transceiver products, especially as 40G takes a pause. As a result, we do expect low-single digit sequential revenue growth for our Wired segment.
On to Enterprise Storage. Here, in this segment, our Enterprise segment -- our Enterprise Storage products include our hard disk drive business and our server and storage connectivity product lines. Starting this fourth quarter, this segment will also include products from our recent PLX acquisitions, which will be part of our server and storage connectivity business. In this fourth quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue, including contribution from PLX, came in stronger than expected and grew 15% sequentially. To provide you with some continuity from the prior quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue without PLX grew 8% sequentially. This segment represented 29% of our total revenues from continuing operations. The HDD or hard disk drive end market had a seasonally strong quarter, with a large increase in Enterprise shipments and our HDD revenue grew mid-single digit sequentially on a percentage basis.
In server and storage connectivity, we also had a very strong fourth quarter with revenue growing double digits sequentially on a percentage basis. This growth was driven by our server customers staging supply lines in anticipation of a strong tri-annually-driven server refresh cycle, and they accordingly purchased significantly high amount of our 12G SAS and RAID solutions this quarter.
Looking forward to Q1 fiscal '15, we expect data center and enterprise demand to continue driving growth in server and storage connectivity business. We also expect this similar trend to also drive growth in our HDD business. As a result, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth for our Enterprise Storage business.
Finally, moving on to Industrial. Fourth quarter, our Industrial segment performed below expectation with revenue declining by 2% sequentially. Industrial represented 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Resales were weaker here than expected in all regions except the Americas, as we saw a cautionary stance from customers in those various other countries. On a sequential basis, in fact, resales in America were up 2%, but declined 9% in Asia-Pacific, 6% in Europe and 13% in Japan. Regardless, our industrial product inventory at our distributors remain very tight. In Q4, we were also expecting some revenue related to a last-time purchase for a legacy program which is now expected to push out to the first fiscal quarter.
And looking into the first quarter fiscal of 2015, we expect mid-single-digit decline on a percentage basis in Industrial product revenue due to planned customer shutdowns late half of December. But to be -- however, this we expect to be more than offset by the anticipated last-time buy I referenced earlier. As a result, we expect low- to mid-single digit sequential growth on a percentage basis for Industrial segment.
So in summary, for Q4 and for fiscal 2015, we have a very strong finish with 25% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in Wireless, robust demand in Enterprise Storage, flattish Wired and a small decline in Industrial. For our first fiscal quarter 2015, we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Enterprise Storage, low- to mid-single-digit growth in Industrial. However, low growth -- low-single-digit growth in Wired, offset by a flat to down Wireless segment. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low-single digit sequential growth -- sequentially on a percentage basis.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financials.",1312

The business composition of our reportable segments remains the same as previously defined target markets. Please note that our fourth quarter results include contributions from the PLX acquisition, which closed on August 12, 2014.
Revenue of $1.61 billion in the fourth quarter represents an increase of 25% from the prior quarter and came in higher than the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our Wireless and Enterprise Storage segments came in better than our expectations. The Wired segment performed close to expectations, and we saw weaker-than-expected revenue from the Industrial & Other segment.
Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 58%, which was above our guidance range of 55% to 57%, primarily due to better revenue mix and fab utilization.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $214 million and SG&A expenses were $89 million, driving total operating expenses for Q4 to $303 million, $4 million below guidance, primarily because of some anticipated spending in R&D, which is not expected in the first quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 6% of net revenue, respectively.
Income from operations for the quarter was $636 million and represented 40% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $42 million for the fourth quarter, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast. Fourth quarter net income was $556 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.99.
Fourth quarter interest expense was $54 million. The other income and expense line was $16 million, resulting primarily from gains on the sale of non-core LSI portfolio investments, which had a positive impact on EPS.
Our share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter include $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A. In the first quarter fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $51 million.
Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 42 days, an increase from the prior quarter's 39 days, primarily due to linearity of revenue during the quarter. Our inventory ended at $519 million. Days on hand were 70 days, which decreased 9 days from the third quarter as we reduced inventory in our Wireless segment, which had built up in prior quarters to support the strong ramp in fourth quarter shipment.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion, and we generated $381 million in operational cash flow. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we closed the PLX acquisition, which consumed approximately $308 million in cash, and we closed the sale of our flash business for which we received approximately $450 million in cash. On November 18, 2014, in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we also closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash.
In the fourth quarter, we spent $189 million on capital expenditures. For the full year fiscal 2015, we expect CapEx to be approximately $600 million, of which approximately $200 million is expected to occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses related to the prior fiscal year.
As you may recall, last quarter, we mentioned our intent to use a significant amount of our net proceeds from the sales of the flash and Axxia businesses towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year. We are still evaluating our capital needs over the next 12 months and, for now, we see investment of these proceeds in the business as a better short-term use of our cash, including potential investment in our internal fab capacity to support continued demand for our Wireless products.
On September 30, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per ordinary share, which consumed $81 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarters. Since the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011. To-date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.
Now let me briefly recap our fiscal 2014 full year results. Net revenues increased by 71% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, benefiting primarily from 2 quarters of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our Wireless business. Gross margin increased by 5% year-over-year to 56%, driven by an improvement in product mix, with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products in the classic Avago side, as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the LSI continuing operations. Net income for 2014 increased to $1.343 billion or $4.90 per diluted share as compared to $731 million or $2.89 per diluted share in fiscal 2013.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be flat to up 4% from the fourth quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 57.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $301 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $56 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 283 million shares.
That concludes my prepared remark. Operator, please open the call for questions.",1129

I was wondering if you could just, looking at the inventory levels and the ramps, how -- if you had to relate it to a normal seasonal, I know it's hard in Wireless, how would you compare? Then you probably don't want to give guidance for April, but how does it relate as you look into April in terms of normal or not?",91

But we do have pretty clear visibility, frankly, in this Q1 fiscal '15 in terms of backlog from customers, forecast from certain customers. And particularly when you have a fab that's running full, you do get pretty good -- you get very good visibility for the quarter, out that period. So right now, Q1, as we see it, we plan -- we see sustaining the levels pretty much of what we saw in Wireless of Q4. And that's not dissimilar from what we saw a year ago.",103

It continues to be extremely strong, particularly with the full launch in late Q4 -- in Q4 -- our Q4 that is, of the next-generation smartphone from the North America -- that certain North American OEM. And that demand has continued -- as far as we see, continues to sustain. So that said, the strong demand for high-performance filters. And we know the competitors out there, be they Ball or on a limited basis, TC, temperature-compensated SAWs. And I mentioned that on a limited basis. Because, obviously, we have our fab full, we can only supply so much for short term. Though our plan to increase the fab will enable us, as time progresses fairly rapidly, to be able to address the markets in a normal basis. But short term, it's not -- for us, the seasonal uptick is not happening, which basically leads some of our -- some certain other customers, potential customers, to perhaps look for alternatives. And they do. Having said that, we believe the performance of our FBAR far surpasses anybody else. And if there's a choice, we do get selected. If not, good enough might do.",256

The trend towards this will occur more and more and won't be just restricted to any particular phone maker. And the simple reason is simply because while the overall number of phones out there are kind of flattish to maybe single-digit growth, the conversion of feature phones, low-end phones towards smartphones is happening fairly rapidly. And especially smartphones which goes higher and higher end, it requires roaming features, which means you put in bands that are not just unique to a particular local country or carrier, but multiple carriers globally. And the content in every smartphone will have to increase. And so RF components, as we all know, and has been evident the last 12 months, RF component demand has been very strong. And even within RF components, filter demand is particularly strong because while in semiconductor processes or in semiconductor typical trend, you can -- you do -- you can and do integrate chips functionality together. For instance, multiple -- one power amplifier can support multiple modes, multiple bands. In filters, you only -- you need one separate filter for every single band. And as more and more bands enter smartphones, which are expected to roam multiple continents, multiple carriers, the share content of filters in each smartphone will increase, especially when you go 2G, 3G, 4G now and potentially forward in the future. So the trend is towards more and more content increase.",258

Is it that enterprise networking or Enterprise Storage and Industrial don't require much R&D? Because if I look at some of your networking comparables, nobody is spending less than 20% on R&D. Analog is a little bit better than that, but you could argue the model is different. So maybe you can just talk about R&D here at 13%. Can you sustain that without compromising future growth?",95

And we are quite totally different model from the rest of the world, too, by the way, Romit. And to answer you seriously, we have a range. We have 4 end markets as you know. And give you a sense, one extreme side, which is Wired or Enterprise -- from the enterprise networking on the ASIC side, especially on SerDes side. Of course, we'll be spending R&D in the mid-20s, really not much different from many of our peers in that area. We do spend there. And then on the other extreme, Industrial, which tends to be very analog, in our case, extremely III-V compound semiconductor analog, not just silicon analog, we spend single digits in R&D of revenue. So -- and the others are somewhere in between. And by -- and so we average out 13%, 14%. A big part of it, frankly, is -- on the standard products we drive in Wireless, as an example, we get huge revenue scale up, a real operating leverage in the -- in specific areas where demand -- the volume is high. So when you look at this range of products we are in and, obviously, Enterprise Storage and Wireless falls in between the extremes of Industrial and networking ASICs, especially, all the rest falls in between, we just average out 13%, 14% R&D spend. And we believe we are spending at a fairly comfortable level because the comment I made at the beginning of my remarks, we are running ahead of our financials, achieving financial synergies with this integration. We're running ahead of it and it's also because of that allows us a lot of flexibility, not that we need that to do it because we always have the habit of reinvesting a lot more even into our core businesses to defend it and strengthen it even more. We have not been -- we have never been cheap about doing it. Where the difference is, if we don't see a business as being core, we divest it. Then we don't spend it anymore. But where the business that are core, believe me, we will invest what we need to continue to lead in technological leadership, which is central to this entire business model.",375

I know you're not guiding to Q2 Wireless. But in general, given the large contribution from your North American customer, do you expect your Wireless segment to show more volatility or more seasonality going forward? Because I'm trying to offset that against some of the content growth you are seeing in China. So the question really is, do you see your Wireless segment being more or less seasonal than before? And if it is more seasonal, what does that do to your FBAR capacity utilization and gross margins?",95

We don't know. We don't have that clear visibility. It's -- I like to say that last -- this year repeats from last year. And you know how last year's cycle is. And I guess that's why you're driving this particular question. And so keeping that in mind, I'll answer you this, which by itself tells you something, we don't know. We don't really know. And that's why even in Q1, as we forecast Wireless, and please don't read too much in what I'm trying to tell you then, when I purposely stated in my Q1 -- Wireless for Q1 -- this particular quarter. Right now, our sense is, Wireless is flattish. It could be down slightly, but you're talking about a fairly substantial number either way. And right now, sitting here right now, we think it's flattish. I could be wrong even then, even sitting here right now. And I definitely would be in no position to give you a sense of what Q2 is at this point.",184

And then as a follow-up, maybe one for you, Tony. Can you remind us what your target debt leverage ratio is? And what do you plan to do with the cash that's coming in and the cash flow that you are generating? I know that you have been increasing your dividend consistently. You are investing in CapEx. But do you see leverage getting to a point where you feel comfortable expanding the buyback plan or considering more M&A? Maybe another home run like an LSI?",87

So just to be very clear that our priorities on cash usage hasn't changed. So it's number one, it's internal investments. And that includes, as Hock mentioned, some of the things that we're opportunistic with or strengthening our product portfolio. Second is really the dividend and then also the debt paydown. And the debt paydown, I want to be clear, is that our leverage ratio at the beginning of the transaction was roughly a little over 3x. And if you look at some of the models you guys have out there, we could end up in the 2s quite easily this year. So really, once we hit around 2x is that when we'll go back to our board and say, “Hey, do we -- I want to change our capital structure and put some longer-term debt on the balance sheet."" The pause that I talked about in my speech was really just to say, “Hey, we're thinking about it still."" So think about it more as a one or two quarter pause only in kind of the debt paydown that we're thinking about. And of course, we don't comment on any M&A.",193

With the combination of your ASIC business with LSIs and then one other big player in that space getting out, I just wanted to see roughly what your expectations are for the growth potential of that business. And has there been any lash back from your customers because the combination of Avago and LSI now can be so dominant?",72

We're just -- we have a scale now. And we suddenly have scale that allows us to benefit from investing in a lot more capabilities than we had previously. I mean, we -- our claim to fame used to be in Avago, SerDes, we now have very, very strong IP, still in SerDes, but beyond SerDes into memory, embedded processing, all that nice stuff that many of our ASIC customers love to have in communications, wired and wireless infrastructure. That's why we tend to focus our ASIC business in networking, but also wired and wireless infrastructure on a more focused basis, but still very much ASIC. And yes, that business, as I reported over the last couple of quarters, has been growing very nicely. A big part of it, having said that, is product ramps. Product ramps on -- in new generation edge routers, new generation of this software-defined network switches like the Nexus 9000. We're in those very much. We're in couple -- we are in all the edge routers that I'm aware of, almost. And we even have ASIC baseband in one Chinese base station OEM. And all that is driving very nice growth, not huge growth. That's not the nature of this kind of business. But it's more, and best call it, moderate growth. And that's the way we like it. So we do see potential growth opportunity on a very moderate basis that is more sustainable over the next 2, 3 years.",254

My follow-up question really quickly for Tony is on the OpEx side of things. Can you just remind us where we are in the integration path as far as getting to the $200 million originally you talked about? And I guess the angle I would put on it is more on an absolute basis. At the $301 million you're guiding to, is that the new base off of which we increase or decrease according to revenue? Or do you still have some of those, I guess, after last quarter, 1,100 people that had yet to exit the company and therefore, that would make OpEx actually decline?",107

And remember that the original base was like this $390 million number on the combined company. And so the goal would have been $290 million, but then you got to add in PLX, a couple of million. So really, as Hock mentioned in his speech, we're done with the divestitures, which contributed that $50 million a quarter. And we're probably about, as you can do the math yourself, $40 million toward the $50 million of the other. But as Hock mentioned as well, it gives us great flexibility to beef up other areas of R&D as these final stages happen. So those will happen as we combine the systems, the IT systems, which again is planned for kind of the end of the first half, beginning of the second half of this current fiscal year.",144

We saw -- when we started with the whole LSI acquisition, we're quite surprised that we've seen some upside to their businesses as well.

But on the other side, there's a lot of ASSP, FPGA out there that definitely provide very strong competition for us, not just ASICs. And it's just that we are very good at ASICs, and we focus on that. And by natural self-selection, customers wants their own differentiated product fixes. Having more capabilities, obviously, makes us a more formidable competitor, as against the FPGA guys or against standard products. But we do see all the competition out there.",144
