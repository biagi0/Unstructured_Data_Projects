Good afternoon, everyone. Now, as you all are aware, today we announced the acquisition of Emulex Corporation. Emulex is very complementary to Avago's Enterprise Storage businesses and aligns very well with the Avago business model. It is a leading supplier of Fibre Channel and related products, selling primarily into server and enterprise storage OEMs that Avago currently serves with our SAS, RAID and PCI Express switching and fiber optic products. We expect this transaction to allow us to offer one of the broadest suites of silicon and software storage solutions to the enterprise and data center markets. 
With that, now I will turn on to more mundane methods related to our recent business performance. And Tony will provide a summary of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results. 
Revenue for our first quarter was $1.66 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter. In particular, Wireless growth was much better than expectations, with revenue growing sequentially versus the flat to slightly down outlook we have provided during our fourth quarter earnings call. Wired and Enterprise Storage held up well, but Industrial did show seasonal decline.
Now turning to a discussion of our segments, starting with Wireless. In the first quarter, as noted, revenue from our Wireless segment grew 6% sequentially. Wireless represented 40% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And compared to the same quarter last year, Wireless revenue grew 90%, that's 9-0 percent. Within the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected demand from a large North American smartphone OEM, which shall remain nameless, and that which enabled us to achieve another quarter of record Wireless revenue. 
Given these levels of growth, coupled with our expectation for additional FBAR filter content in upcoming smartphone generations, we expect to remain capacity constrained through the balance of this year, even as we continue to grow our FBAR capacity over the next 12 months. As you know, we have expanded our Fort Collins fab capacity multiple-fold over the past few years, but demand has continued to exceed expectations.
Turning to second quarter of fiscal '15. Similar to prior years, we expect a sharp seasonal, some may even call it product lifecycle-related, decline in demand from our large North American smartphone OEM. However, this decline is expected to be partially offset by product ramp at another large handset OEM, where our designs have resulted in substantial RF content. 
Nonetheless, we do expect Wireless revenue to decline sequentially, somewhere in the low teens. Year-over-year, however, we expect to maintain our trajectory of strong growth in this business, with second quarter revenue projected to grow over 65% from the same quarter last year. Our strategy and capability to offer highly integrated RF front-end solutions incorporating very high performance FBAR filters has been a key driver of our success.
Moving onto Enterprise Storage. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in as expected, growing about 5% sequentially, driven by strength in enterprise and data center spend. Enterprise Storage represented 29% of our total revenues from continuing operations. 
In HDD -- in hard disk drive, revenues grew by mid-single digits sequentially. In server and storage connectivity, we also had a good first quarter, with revenue growing in the mid-single-digits sequentially. This growth was driven by the start of the granary based server refresh cycle as well as the strong attach rate for our 12 gigabit SAS and RAID solutions. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, in server and storage connectivity, we expect strong growth from increasing adoption of our PCI Express switches and sustained SAS and RAID shipments, while we expect to see seasonal decline in hard disk drives. Our custom flash controller -- controller business and NAND have been ramping. Putting these factors together, we expect low single digit sequential revenue growth for our Enterprise Storage segment.
On to Wired Infrastructure and Enterprise segment. Our Wired segment performed somewhat below expectations in the first quarter, with revenue declining by 1% sequentially. Wired revenue now represents 21% of our total revenue from continuing operations. 
ASIC revenue was up slightly on a sequential basis, with strong growth in Ethernet switching, thanks to our various OEM customers, partially offset by declines in carrier routing and high-performance computing. As expected, our fiber optics business declined compared to the prior quarter. We saw growth in parallel optic shipments into carrier routing, more than offset by expected declines from our Ethernet transceiver -- standard ethernet transceiver products, especially 40 gigabit, which took a pause after a strong fourth quarter.
However, the second quarter fiscal '15 in this segment is looking very different. We expect growth in both our ASIC businesses and our Fiber Optics business. In our ASIC business, we actually expect very strong growth from enterprise switching and routing, as well as in storage. In fiber optics, we're expecting more moderate growth in 40G shipments, driven by increasing demand from the hyper-skilled data center markets. And we are also continuing to see strength in fiber optics demand from fiber-to-the-home and LTE base stations, especially in China. As a result we expect, at least, mid-single-digit sequential growth for our Wired segment.
And finally, moving to Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial segment performed below expectations, with revenue declining by 4% sequentially. Industrial represented about 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Resales in this segment declined sequentially in this very seasonally weak quarter, with broad declines across all regions except Asia, which remained stable compared to the prior quarter. 
As you know, we recognize revenue on shipments to our shipment bases to our distributors. And during this period, our industrial rev -- product revenues that is shipped into our distributors also declined at a similar -- at a consistent rate to industrial resale as we maintain very tight inventory in the channel, less than 2 months' net inventory. 
Looking in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect sequential recovery in our Industrial segment. In particular, we're seeing strength in North America and Europe, reflecting this recovery.  And the need to replenish -- and the need and demand, I would add, by distributors to replenish the very low levels of inventory at these distributors, we expect to see sequential revenue growth in the mid-teens for our Industrial business. 
With this, let me summarize. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong start to fiscal '15, with 3% sequential revenue growth in the first quarter due to a strong quarter in Wireless, good growth in Enterprise Storage despite flattish Wired Infrastructure demand and a decline in Industrial.
Turning to the second fiscal quarter. As in past years, as you may know, we've always seen sharp second quarter sequential declines in our Wireless business due to seasonal product cycles in the handset market. This year is no different and we are expecting our Wireless revenue to be down in the low teens from the prior quarter. 
However, what is different this year is we expect to at least offset most of the Wireless decline with strength from our 3 other segments: Wired up mid-single digits, Enterprise Storage up low to mid-single digits, Industrial up in the mid-teens. And as a result, we expect our second quarter consolidated revenues to be roughly flat from that of the prior quarter.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our first quarter fiscal 2015 results.",1234
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3396.0,770638.0,33725175.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $1.66 billion in the first quarter represents an increase of 3% from the prior quarter. Revenue from our Wireless segment came in better than our expectations. The Enterprise Storage segment performed as expected. And we saw weaker-than-expected revenue from the Wired and the Industrial & Other segments. 
Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 59%, which was just above our guidance range of 56.5% to 58.5%, primarily due to better revenue mix and higher manufacturing yields.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $210 million and SG&A expenses were $83 million, driving total operating expenses for the first quarter to $293 million, $8 million below guidance, primarily because of the lower-than-anticipated spending on certain R&D engineering materials. 
Due to capacity constraints, some materials initially intended for R&D projects were instead used to build products for customer shipments, and we expect this to continue in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 5% of net revenue.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $681 million and represented 41% of net revenue.
Taxes came in at $35 million for the first quarter, slightly below our guidance given 1 quarter ago. This was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and the retroactive reinstatement in the quarter of the U.S. Federal Research and Development tax credit. First quarter net income was $596 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.09. 
First quarter interest expense was $54 million. Other income, net, was $4 million.
Our share-based compensation in the first quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the first quarter includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation to be approximately $52 million. Our annual equity grants typically occur in the second fiscal quarter of the year. Starting this fiscal year, we are switching to a solely RSU-based equity award program instead of a combination of option and RSU awards. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 39 days, an improvement from the prior quarter's 42 days. Our inventory ended at $500 million. Days on hand was 67 days, which decreased 3 days from the fourth quarter, as we reduced inventory which we had built up in prior quarters to support the strong growth in our Wireless segment. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion, and we generated $481 million in operational cash flow.
Our first quarter is also when we pay our annual bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. In the first quarter we spent $162 million on capital expenditures. On November 18, 2014, in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash.
On December 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per ordinary share, which consumed $89 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our standing indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board.
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we anticipate paying approximately $600 million towards reducing our outstanding term loan, which will reduce our annual interest expense by about $22 million based on current interest rates. 
In addition, as we announced today, we expect to invest approximately $600 million for the acquisition of Emulex Corporation. And we currently expect this transaction to close in the second half of our fiscal 2015. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. We plan to align Emulex with Avago's business model over the course of our fiscal year 2016. And once aligned, we expect Emulex's businesses to contribute approximately $250 million to $300 million in annual net revenue with improved operating margins. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. 
Net revenue is expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% from the first quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 58.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $294 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $37 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $49 million, which anticipates paying approximately $600 million towards the reducing of our outstanding term loan within the quarter. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 289 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",948

Then I guess, maybe sticking on FBAR as a follow-up. So the North American customer comes down in the April quarter, but that's offset by content growth at another customer. I'm kind of curious if you can give us, Hock, an update on what you're seeing relative to FBAR content in the China market, specifically. And how do you think that might trend over time?",69
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3396.0,770638.0,33725182.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,10,"Well, it's never a monotonic increase in capacity. But then, it's a question that always we think about real hard. But it's just that as more and more phones become multiple band-enabled, they become where you can roam multiple locations and -- now if you ask specific -- because that's broadly worldwide. But if you ask specifically China, there are multiple categories of those phones in China even with their smartphone, yes, those unique to China. And for those phones that are the kind of smartphone that are unique to China, obviously, the Chinese LTE bands, by the way, are very much -- are bands that do use a very, what I call, friendly to FBAR usage. And couple that with the tendency to make them Wi-Fi enabled, and then you basically increase the number of, call it the amount of number of bands requiring FBAR in those phones. So to answer your question, the Chinese phones tend to be very FBAR friendly. Now it's not always that way because there are ways they can do to cut down or curtail performance and therefore substitute FBAR for perhaps lower performing SAW filters. And they do, do that. And there's a mix of that going on right now, particularly with the capacity constraint. But over the long term, from phones that are basically multi bands and 3-mode phones, going to 5-mode phones, as they call them in China, you just need a fairly significant increase in FBAR content.",247

So basically, we'll still go through the same process, where certain parts of the business we will look at closely. And what we believe is that it's going to be closer to that in the exit of 2016.

And as my follow-up, Hock, you mentioned additional FBAR content in next-generation phones with your flagship customers. Is that due to additional bands?

It's really related to RF architecture and it's an RF architecture that pushes a lot -- that allows a lot more bands to be crammed into very limited space in smartphones to be able to handle multiple, multiple bands for world roaming phones. And it's putting them all into modules, front-end modules, which both includes power amplifiers and FBAR filters. So it's really architectural related and ability to contain many more bands within the same limited, constrained space.",81

And we are very big in Enterprise Storage, as you know, particularly after our integration -- the acquisition and integration of LSI. So we do have SAS, as I said, we do have SATA and PCI Express with PLX acquisition and the need for high-density port solution on data center connectivity. So we come across Fibre Channel very often, adjacent to the software, adjacent to the systems and chips that we provide to those same OEM customers in enterprise -- or in enterprise and data centers.

We see that long term -- well, medium-term, let me rephrase that -- in the mid-single digit growth. It's kind of business where we see a lot of barriers to entry, obviously. And we see it very unique in technology, which is very hard to replicate because of all the criteria that fits our business model. And we basically see the necessity to focus on the strengths of this business, Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over Ethernet.

I've never view ASICs in terms of market share, unfortunately. I just think ASICs -- we pick and choose our ASIC customers very carefully. And we support those customers simply because we have a very unique technology and a very expensive technology in some ways. And we -- and in ASICs, as you know, the business is tough to scale, unlike standard or ASSP products. So our business strategy in ASIC is very strong IP and we basically are rather selective about the customers, usually OEM customers and not necessarily OEM customers. We do support data -- certain specific data center customers too, but very selectively. And we tend to only select those where we believe we have opportunity to grow our business very well with the particular customer we support ASICs with. And to answer your question, in the last 3 years, we have been very successful. And in integrating in the LSI ASIC business to our Avago classic ASIC business before the acquisition has combined to provide a business that's pretty -- that's doing very well in the sense that it's roughly $700 million to $800 million and it has financial criteria that meets what we need, what we need to keep reinvesting and generating really state-of-the-art technology in terms of process libraries, in terms of the best service in the marketplace and the most robust set of IP in memory and processing. So it's a business model we believe has been very, very successful. And we'd like to see the same with our, by the way, our storage portfolio.",263

Obviously, there's been a pretty intense competitive environment over the years with QLogic in that space.

Maybe you call the word bottom-out, but I'd call it stable. And what brings in a lot of stability to the market is, Jim, as you probably may know, is Fibre Channel over Ethernet as well, which sort of counteract some, perhaps, slight declines in certain situations like UNIX-based servers. But overall, we think it's [indiscernible] there. And we believe we can bring in certain capabilities, certain features and performance that will enable us to grow this, not much, but we believe in the mid-to low-single digits. That's pretty much where all we are looking for. And for us to be able to do that and focus on it totally will also enable us to create operating margins, operating returns on our investment and operating margin, as Tony indicated, close to the range of what we are used to for the rest of our businesses. And all of that's over time. It'll probably take 1 year.",173

Can you help us disaggregate that between unit growth in the market and then against customer -- new customer wins and then that architectural dynamic that you talked about driving incremental growth with existing customers? So if we disaggregate it between market unit growth, Avago customer wins and then the third bucket being that architectural dynamic driving increased content, how would you break that 90% down?",81

Because we are comparing apples and oranges. There is definitely a change in architectural content. And as we go into a new architecture of integrating in the front-end modules multiple bands of power amplifiers and filters in one module, you can't compare it to a module that used to have 2 bands to one that now has 9 bands. And so the content increases, the dollar gets priced differently. I hate -- I'm not trying to evade your question, but I don't have an answer for you, except to say that it's very different and the market is evolving. It's evolving towards an architecture, especially where high-end smartphones -- which is where a lot of our applications are, a lot of our products go into, to be honest, into high-end phones, those high end phones can afford the rather high-performance, very space-constrained architectures that our solutions, RF solutions provide. In low-end smartphones, and some of them like tri-mode phones in China, where there's only a limited number of bands needed, they can probably make do with discrete filters and power amplifiers, and they do. And we don't really compete much in those areas. We tend to compete it towards the new architectural phones. So no, there's no distinct change.",219

In the FBAR space, you're doubling your capacity.

That business does appear to run at above-average corporate margins.

Number one, $1 billion a quarter sounds fairly extreme.  And the reason is, usually it's simply this, could be -- first, we're nowhere close to $1 billion a quarter yet, as you know. I mean, 40% of our revenues right now is not quite there yet, but I know what you mean by a doubling of it. But it may be one quarter but it's not a whole year. So I just want to make that point. We could get there in one quarter and at the right point at the peak season, but it won't sustain because of the seasonality of product lifecycles of the players in it. So that's a fair -- so I hope that answers your question. In terms of gross margin. Sure, we have never been any thoughts about whether there has been a ceiling to our gross margin. All we have said is we don't know where it is, but over time, as our product mix and our business become more and more efficient and our product mix hit the right spot, they hit the sweet spot of certain markets, sure, we do see continuing improvement or expansion of gross margin. And you see that last -- this quarter -- last quarter and you'll probably see that again in our guidance this quarter. And it's all related to product mix.",238

Where do you pick up the little things? But it is a fair question. Yes, we sold off our -- we sold our business as well as intellectual property and capability in developing standard flash controllers for solid state drives. And we did that. And we sold it off, and we do not have any standard flash controller capability nor products nor revenues right now in our product portfolio. We sold it all off; happily, too. Because we believe we are not prepared to keep investing into this play, which we believe could get very competitive. Having said that, we do retain some intellectual property and capability still within our hard disk drive division, operating division, where similar capabilities exist in terms of designs, understanding how to develop flash controllers for our custom flash controllers. And we do that for very selected customers, sort of in the form of an ASIC/controllers for enterprise markets, specifically, on the low-volume on specific customers. And we continue to do that because that part of the business retains behind reverse [ph], and we have the capability inherent within our hard disk drive division and our SoC division. And if it makes money, we'd be happy to do it. But it is really not the standard flash business, very different from our standard flash business, which we sold off. Okay?",228

We, by the way, I think, are one of the very few guys today with silicon, working silicon that can drive what I call 56 gigabit band pong [ph].

There, as you know, as you've been hearing, there is some -- there's some momentum in enterprise spending and data center build-out and spending going on. And as that happens, couple that with the launch of Intel Grantley that supports 12 gigabit from the previous generation of 6 gigabit. So yes, there is a tailwind as we go through that refresh cycle. As it always happens, it will be the case. And in this case, it's servers enterprise driving -- our server and storage connectivity. So we are benefiting from that, and that's partly why you see our business growing sort of mid-single digits sequentially so far in the next -- in the last couple of quarters or so.

Let me answer the first one. On the BiDi thing, I hate to say it, because it's exclusive to a particular customer, and I don't really want to comment on it. Sorry about that. I hope you don't mind. But because it's exclusive to a particular customer, I prefer not to comment on it. Now coming back to the ASIC consolidation, we don't really see that much of it on our side. And part of the reason for it is, as I say, in ASIC, we're not out there looking for market share. We have very unique capabilities in the sense of we have very low power, we have very leading edge process technology through working with TSMC and -- but we have very, very robust serializer, deserializer, very strong robust IP in memory as well as processing. A lot of that not just from Avago classic, but with LSI combined with us and greater relationships with selected list of OEMs and who are somewhat winners in so far in the enterprise networking business. So as they grow, we grow along with them. And as I remarked earlier, so as a particular customer announced a gain in share, we do see benefit of that. Having said that, sometimes we also support another customer who doesn't, so that kind of balances out somewhat. But because of our unique technology and our unique business model of trying to select -- be very selective of the customers we support, which tends to lend itself to very large, successful OEMs, we do not see that much of this M&A activity you're referring down at the ASIC businesses.",274

See, we are now -- we participate a lot in the datacom, short reach datacom, and that's nicely chugging along. There is price competition, to be honest, about it but we try not to play, as I've said many times before, in the standard fiber optics lower bandwidth products. We tend to go up very fast. We're now doing 40 gig. Our sweet spot is pushing 40 gig, including the BiDi that someone referred to earlier, which is a 2x20 form of -- unique form of 40 gig, and that's standard 40 gig. And we're pushing now 100 gig. And we're working on various forms of 100 gig and going even beyond 100 gig for core routing. That's where our strength is. So I'm really not a very good indicator of the broader fiber optics market. But in terms of datacom, our strength is up because it's more of  the high bandwidth. On the low bandwidth, under like 1 gigabit, 10 gigabit, and then on some of the storage products, like 8 gigabit and 16 gigabit. 16 is not so bad. You can mention anything below that, it's a price -- it's a very price competitive environment. And we try to not be too engaged in it. I won't say we're not -- we are out of it. We can't be because we have to support many of our OEM customers, even though our share is very low. We're now looking -- our focus is really on higher end, whether it's proprietary or not so proprietary very high-bandwidth datacom. And that's growing very well as data centers, especially the larger data centers are pushing from 40 gig to now -- in some cases, leapfrogging 40 gig to go to 100. And, of course, somebody indicated 25 and 50 provides additional opportunities. And when you start talking about 25, you're talking about having to drive short reach or even longer reach native 25 that makes it very tough to produce lasers, big phones [ph] , lasers, so to speak, that does 25 gigabit. We are one of the few guys who can do it, and we happily sell that to guys who do 100 gigabit Infiniband today. We are the supplier of the big phones [ph] , for instance. So that one is one side of it. Our other strength in telecoms is we don't do that much transceivers and long reach telecoms, except medium reach, few kilometers in data centers. Other than that, for transplant we don't do much at all. We do provide, though, coherent transceivers but we do it at a component level. We're kind of like an arms dealer, and we do that very well. And for instance, we also do component level to fiber-to-the-home in China. And that one we can't provide enough products for the market. Not all for that matter for LTE supporting fiber -- base station fiber optics. We can't provide enough of those components to those particular markets. That one, we have a pretty full set, too.",515

I was hoping you could talk about this in the context of maybe a 4- or 5-year type range. Obviously, some of the great strengths here have been driven by the move to LTE or to serve LTE-Advanced. But it seems like if 5G doesn't come for -- until maybe 2018, 2020, so how do you keep in mind adding capacity versus you've got a lot of LTE switching over the next couple of years versus the length of time before 5G starts to come in.",115

U.S. already spent their money and we're enemies of China, so it's all good, not to mention the emerging countries. But to answer your question more directly, I kind of hate to disappoint you, but our CapEx plan, we tend to build -- and I mentioned that many times before, a year ago or 2 years ago, so maybe it's time to refresh that. But we tend to lack demand in our capacity build. We basically see the white of the eye in demand before we start rushing to build capacity. We don't build in anticipation of demand. We tend not to do that. We don't run our business that way. So if you ask me about 5G, no I'm not even there, sorry. Not even there.",162

25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2015",2015-08-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3201.0,862640.0,37139271.0,Presenter Speech,Hock Tan,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. I will touch on Q2 revenue highlights; give a preview of our Q4 expectation and then Tony will provide a summary of our third quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results. As a note, you may be aware, we closed the Emulex acquisition on May 5, 2 days into our third fiscal quarter, and accordingly, Q3 results include contributions from Emulex. 
Now it is ironic that the volatility and recent weakness in the equity markets are in such sharp contrast to the relative stability and predictability of our end market demand. Revenue for our third quarter was $1.75 billion, a 6.4% sequential increase and above the midpoint of our guidance, as all segments performed well. I'm very pleased with our execution, which drove Q3 margins and earnings per share to the high end of our expectation. We continue to see good demand, driven by our diverse portfolio of highly differentiated solutions. We believe our focus on sustainable franchises provides us with a firm foundation to consistently deliver strong operating results. 
Turning to a discussion of our segments, starting with wireless. In the third quarter, revenue from our wireless segment grew by 7% sequentially. Wireless now represents 35% of our total revenue from continuing operations. As expected, growth within the quarter was driven by the start of a ramp from our North American smartphone OEM as they transition to the next-generation platform and the continuation of a product ramp at an Asian handset OEM. 
Looking in the fourth quarter of fiscal '15. We do expect revenue growth to continue in our wireless business, with strong growth of over 10% sequentially. We expect this growth to result from the full ramp of the new phone model at our North American smartphone customer, partially offset by the product cycle rollover at the Asian customer. 
We continue to make very good progress in increasing our FBAR capacity, which we anticipate will increase by approximately 50% by the time we end fiscal '15 compared to that of the prior year. This correlates perfectly well with our expectation for the year-over-year increase on our fiscal 2015 wireless segment revenues. However, we have been unable to quite satisfy demand from Chinese LTE handset OEMs and have only been able to make limited shipments to them this year. But we do expect to further increase FBAR capacity by another 50% over the course of fiscal '16, which should hopefully enable us to better meet demand from these Chinese customers starting late 2016. In addition, we remain focused on increasing our RF content in new handset releases and expect any new significant design wins could consume significant amount of planned capacity additions, particularly towards the end of fiscal 2016. And as a result, our capacity for FBAR may continue to remain under pressure for an extended time period. 
Moving on to enterprise storage. Starting with third fiscal quarter, the enterprise storage segment includes Emulex Fibre Channel connectivity product. And in this third quarter, enterprise storage revenue grew 26% sequentially, and enterprise storage represented 34% of our total revenue from continuing operations. Much of the strong sequential growth was due to the addition of Emulex in the third quarter, but our other enterprise storage business also grew organically in the high single digits sequentially. 
We experienced strong sequential growth also in custom flash controllers as that product line continues to ramp very nicely. Our server storage connectivity business continued to trend positively, with solid demand for 12 gig RAID and SAS products and strong shipments for our PCI Express solutions. 
Looking towards fourth quarter 2015, we expect enterprise storage to continue with momentum. Revenue growth is projected in the low to mid-single digits sequentially, driven by forecast seasonal uptick in the hard disk drive end market but, more importantly, sustained demand in our server storage connectivity businesses. 
On to wired infrastructure. With the closing of our Emulex acquisition in the third quarter, our ASIC and fiber optic sales to Emulex have now become into complete transactions and are no longer included in this wired segment revenue. Reflecting this change, our wired segment declined by 3% sequentially in the third quarter, which otherwise would have been up slightly from that of the prior quarter. Wired revenue now represent 21% of total revenue from continuing operations. Our underlying ASIC business declined moderately, coming off a very strong second quarter, where we had seen double-digit sequential revenue growth. 
We remain very optimistic with our expanding ASIC footprint in the routing, switching and high-performance computing end markets. We saw strong sequential growth in fiber optics, driven by the start of a ramp in 100G shipments and a sustained increase in 40G fiber optic module shipments to the hyperscale data center markets, where we are supplying to multiple end customers. We have also added wafer capacity and increased shipments significantly to meet continued strong demand from the Fiber to the Home market, largely in China. 
Okay. Moving -- turning to the outlook for the wired segment for the fourth quarter. We expect our ASIC business to resume growth, driven by continued strength in data center build-outs. We expect demand from hyperscale and Fiber to the Home market to sustain our fiber optic business. Consequently, we expect wired segment revenues to grow in the mid-single digits sequentially. 
Moving to industrial. For the third quarter, industrial and other segment represented 10% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And as I mentioned previously, this segment does include our intellectual property licensing business. This segment had much stronger-than-expected second quarter revenue, as I disclosed previously, because of the significant IP licensing business transaction in that quarter. As a result, going to the third quarter, we saw an unusually large revenue decline of 21% sequentially in this segment. 
Without the impact of this single transaction, industrial revenue would have grown in the high single digits sequentially as we replenish inventory at certain of our distributors in the U.S. and China. Industrial revenues, having put that in that context, industrial resales in the third quarter were down in the low single digits as we saw softness in Europe and Japan, even though China was flat and the Americas were up. But while we expect resales in the fourth quarter to improve in China and Europe, uncertainty in industrial market keeps our revenue expectation for this segment to be flat to marginally down sequentially. 
So to highlight in summary, we believe we have built a very firm foundation for our company, anchored by our 4 diverse segments. In Q3, wired storage and industrial performed to plan as expected, and we experienced a gradual startup of the typical annual wireless product cycle. Now in Q4, we expect to gain from the full double-digit sequential growth in wireless with continued and sustained performance from the rest of the company, resulting in aggregate revenue growth of approximately 6% sequentially. 
The Broadcom acquisition continues to progress well and is very much on track for closing as we indicated early next year. As I plan the integration of our 2 companies, I am pleased to identify Tony Maslowski as the CFO of the combined company. Tony has done a superb job in -- at Avago and will be great as we scale up the combined companies. 
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our third quarter fiscal 2015 financials.",1240
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2015",2015-08-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3201.0,862640.0,37139272.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available at our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $1.75 billion in the third quarter represents an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the third fiscal quarter. Our third quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 61%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix and fab utilization. 
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $245 million, and SG&A expenses were $85 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the third quarter of $330 million, $5 million below guidance, primarily because cost synergies from the Emulex transaction being realized faster than expectations. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 14% and SG&A was 5% of net revenue. 
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $733 million and represented 42% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $38 million for the third quarter, slightly below our guidance. Third quarter net income was $660 million, and earnings per diluted share were $2.24. This is a significant increase from the $347 million in net income and $1.26 in earnings per diluted share from the same quarter last year, which was our first quarter that included results from LSI. 
Third quarter interest expense was $43 million. Other income net was $8 million, resulting from a number of items, including gains from foreign exchange hedging and interest income. Our share base compensation in the third quarter was $63 million. The breakdown of the expense for the third quarter includes $7 million in cost of goods sold, $31 million in R&D and $25 million in SG&A. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $66 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 42 days, same as the prior quarter. Our inventory ended at $507 million, a $17 million increase from the second quarter. Days on hand were 67 days. We generated $592 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion, which declined by approximately $1.1 billion from the prior quarter, primarily due to the cash consumed by the conversion of our 2% convertible notes, the purchase of Emulex and the conversion of all Emulex notes, as described in the earnings release. 
In the third quarter, we spent $148 million on capital expenditures. On June 30, 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per ordinary share, which consumed $104 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in second quarter 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions relating to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions. We do not intend to update this guidance, and this guidance is for results from continuing operations only. We expect net revenue to be $1.85 billion, plus or minus $25 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $336 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $42 million. And net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $38 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 296 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",693

I think you guided to over 10% sequential growth. And I believe last year, Apple did some prebuilds, so some of the year-on-year trends are probably distorted.

And how should we think about seasonality as we look out at Q1?",67

And number two, we do not really give guidance beyond the current quarter we are in, so I would have to refrain from giving you a sense of what would go on beyond -- into Q1 of fiscal '16.

But as far as OpEx going forward, as we said to you before, $335 million and then a steady decline, with Emulex getting further and further along the way on their cost cutting, I think, is the way we look at it. And then also remember, we have the bonus reset in Q1. So we're ahead of plan, above 100% right now. So we're accruing above 100%, and you'll see that tail off in Q1. So, I mean, flattish to -- and again, as Hock said, we're not guiding Q1, but I think you can kind of see where it's headed for Q1.",124

That ramp should probably be largely over by the end of October going into the January quarter, but you still are clearly undersupplying the overall market for FBAR and you have a lot of confidence. You're building capacity at a pretty healthy clip for the next fiscal year. So, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, to what extent, if the North American guide does see some seasonality going forward, you can find homes for that capacity in any given quarter? Or is that not how the dynamic works? Is it going to take time for you to get incremental content out of Chinese smartphones?",145

No. Well, right now, our fab is as it has been for the past -- so far, past 12 months, I will say. It's been completely full, and we expect it to continue to run full through to the middle of next year. That's based on what we can see in terms of line of sight. Beyond that, frankly, not sure. And as I pointed out correctly, it would give us any opening -- any additional capacity coming online going forward, coming from additional capacity would be very welcome by us in terms of our ability to then ship to various other customers. And you point out one group obviously, some of the Chinese customers, which we feel we want to be able to support very well and which we have been trying very hard to do as much as we can. But our capacity, as I mentioned, continues to be rather constrained.",159

And then, I guess, as my follow-up, on the enterprise storage segment, you did a really nice job kind of going through the different product lines within that division. I might have missed it, but I was kind of curious, did you talk about what the HDD trends were in the just reported fiscal third quarter? And then you talked about it in the guidance of fiscal fourth quarter the expectation of a seasonal uptick linked to the just given some of the lackluster data points around PC builds, help me understand a little bit better why you're confident you're going to see kind of that seasonal increase on the HDD side within enterprise storage.",119

We virtually do 0 products into notebooks, limited amount only into desktops. And most of our revenues and most of our share resides in enterprise and what we call near line data centers. So obviously, data have some impact with this entire seasonality that we've seen over the last several months, as we mentioned last quarter, too. And as PC weakened, we have seen some of that. But that impact is -- has been mitigated by continuing demand from enterprise and data centers. And so there's certain level of offset. Having said that, I'm not for a second saying for the last several months that our HDD business is up. It's not. But we believe we have seen bottom, and we believe that there will be some improvement as we head out over the next several months. And perhaps, part of it is due to our emphasis on enterprise and data centers.",177

And in fact, we're 12 separate products in those 4 end markets, 12 separate operating divisions and 12 separate product lines, some are even larger. And you might say each of them are in a niche market of their own. So when you -- and not all up at the same time, nor are all down at the same time. Combined, consolidated or aggregated as a whole, we have been able to see, and we have seen it now for the last 12 months, I would say 4 quarters, a very stable progression of our business. What is more volatile, as I'm [indiscernible] to point out in my closing remarks though, is in enterprise storage, wired and industrial, multiple segment, multiple niches of perhaps offset each other, but it's also in our end market, largely that because of perhaps of the niches have been able to be fairly stable.

I think it's still pretty clear that your FBAR technology still has a measurable lead by an apples-to-apples basis compared to other filter technologies. But as some of your competitors introduce more highly integrated front-end modules with either BAR or TC-SAW filters combined with [indiscernible], can you talk about how those type of low-cost solutions that are highly integrated, how that might compare to your overall PAD solutions from a total subsystem or a front-end module performance perspective and what kind of implications that might have from a competitive standpoint longer-term?",107

Fair question. First of all, I want to clarify, the RF solution we specialize in and that drives a lot of revenues, as you correctly call them, are in front-end modules, and within it, comprises several discrete -- multiple discrete elements, largely FBAR filters, one FBAR filter for each frequency band. And combined into a front-end module of different discrete elements, they constitute, as you correctly call it, a front-end module or a PAD for RF, cellular, receive and transmit. And in this case, in this particular phenomenon, the physics is what dictates it. The filters, certain filters, certain bands, frequency bands, require FBAR filters in order to perform adequately. FBARs and certain other bands could do without FBAR filters and need only use SAW filters. And where we excel and where we have a very strong market position, obviously, are in those phones we're requiring frequency bands that can only perform adequately with FBAR filters. And that's where our market position is. For those bands and those front-end modules, because of that, that can do with SAW filters, we don't participate in it because while our performance is still far superior, SAW filters is adequate and go for a much lower price. So it's -- in that sense, you're comparing apples and oranges. There are certain bands we are not competitive -- we are not well represented and are not competitive, even though our performance may be very good. And for other bands, they require FBAR filters to achieve a certain performance for the phone makers, and we are very well represented there. And that's how we compete. We differentiate ourselves from largely the SAW filter guys.",279

Typically, the products we sell, we sell the RF analog. I mean, this is the extreme of analog performance kind of product. We sell RF analog. We do not sell additional mixed signal platform. And so as I mentioned an answer to an earlier question, our core focus products are filters. And there are some bands, even those in China, that require FBAR filters versus the normal ubiquitous SAW filters. And they would be required, even in many kinds of platforms, as discrete solutions. And we have obviously no issue about selling discrete FBAR filters to phone makers in China who require that filters in order to be able to perform well at those specific bands. On top of that, there is this phenomenon of what we call phone operators trying to win multiple bands, trying to uplink or downlink as a single pipe, and that's called the phenomenon of carrier aggregation. And to really do carrier aggregation very well, which we are very good at doing, you really need -- you really want to have FBAR filters operating in that regard. So that provides us the additional opportunity to position our product, and that's something we obviously have been working on very, very vigorously.",206

So we have a building that we inherited from Emulex that was owned, which is about $45 million in net asset held for sale, and a couple of small buildings as well. And then also remember, with the Emulex transaction, we had a security business that is not core to Avago, a security appliance business called Endace, and that's about another roughly $40 million of that. And then as you might have seen, we had a sale of a certain part of our business to Hana earlier this week, and that makes up the remainder of that assets held for sale.

When you're measuring capacity, are you talking about a 50% increase in wafer output?

We got a couple of dynamics, and we're not sure whether this whole thing will fall out. But you're right in that regard. Each new generation of FBAR filters on every 6-inch wafer, which we are still using, each of those filters do become typically smaller, but however, there's a change in the mix, too, because depending on which band [indiscernible] some -- these filters are larger or small -- may be larger than even the mix, than even the bands -- the other bands they are replacing. So there's 1 dynamic that goes the other way. Two, keep in mind this is as we sell more and more of those bands, which per phone, you might add, which is the content increase in phones we have been espousing all this time, and it's true, which is every -- a new generation of a phone, be they Galaxy or otherwise, would tend to contain more bands. The world phone concept, the broader roaming concept, more bands will get into a phone. The scaleup is pretty substantial. And the way we address the scaleup is we make the filters smaller, which helps. But also, they then pull into a front-end module, as I mentioned before, or PAD [indiscernible], which basically what we power amplifies within the module. And as you will probably know, the number of power amplifiers remain substantially the same, even as small filters go into the same module. So basically, our leverage on revenues on those bands effectively become less, which are mostly -- almost is saying that as the price discount, the more bands of FBAR filters we sell in each phone. And that does happen, and that's counter, obviously, to in terms of a linear ASP increase as the number of bands increase. So these 2 makes up dynamics. And the end result of all that is, yes, a 50% increase in capacity of wafer output [ph] does not necessarily mean a similar increase in revenue a year from now.",359

Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.
After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.
During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results, background to our first quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.
In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?",253

Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a short summary of fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 business highlights, and Tony will continue with more details on our financial results.
So fiscal 2015 was an important year for Avago, where we saw a significant increase in our top line from a full year of LSI contribution, augmented by strong growth in wireless revenue. On this expanded base, we drove higher levels of profitability through leveraging our larger scale, continual richer product mix and the full achievement of LSI acquisition cost synergies to deliver operating margins over 40%. In other words, mission accomplished.
Our fourth quarter results exemplified this loud and clear. Revenue came in at $1.85 billion, a 6% sequential increase, and I continue to be very pleased with our execution, which drove the fourth quarter margins above the high end of our range and earnings per share to $2.51. We ended our fiscal year on a very strong note, delivering record levels of revenue and profitability.
Let us now turn to discussion of our segments, starting with wireless. In the fourth quarter, the wireless segment represented 37% of our total revenue from continuing operations in this very typical strong seasonal fourth quarter. As we expected during this seasonal upturn, revenue from our wireless segment grew by 10% sequentially, with the customary product ramp at our North American customer partially offset by the product cycle rollover at one of our large Asian customers. While there was an increase in overall RF content in the new phone model, our -- Avago's RF content on a dollar basis in the new phone model remained largely flat, the same as it was in the prior generation. We had to walk away from supplying additional RF content in the new phone model because of a constrained filter manufacturing capacity. This will not happen again.
Our long-term expectation for our wireless business remains very strong, and we expect our RF content per smartphone to increase at over 20% every year. We have concrete plans in place to address this. We remain on track with our plan to increase FBAR filter capacity in fiscal 2016 by 50% as we convert our fab from 6-inch to 8-inch wafer manufacturing. We also expect our Fort Collins fab to remain at near full capacity as we start to prebuild inventory to support anticipated new phone launches later in fiscal 2016.
Now looking more short term at the first fiscal quarter 2016. Unlike last year, we see -- we do see a seasonal decline in demand and expect our wireless revenue to sequentially decline in the low teens on a percentage basis. Last year, first quarter demand had held up, offsetting normal seasonality, but we don't see the same phenomenon this year. And therefore, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our wireless segment revenue to also decline similar to the sequential drop.
While that is just one part of our portfolio, let me now turn to another segment of our portfolio which has been performing rather amazing, and that's our enterprise storage segment. In the fourth quarter, enterprise storage revenue grew by 9% sequentially, and enterprise storage represented 35% of our total revenue from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter, we also saw strong growth from our RAID and SaaS products. We also benefited from increasing shipments into enterprise and data center hard disk drives. Despite macro worries, enterprise storage market held up quite well in fiscal 2015, and in fact, our core enterprise storage revenues in the fourth quarter grew close to 20% on a year-on-year basis.
Looking towards first quarter 2016, we expect this segment to maintain its momentum from the strong fourth quarter, and we expect revenue to be up slightly on a sequential basis. We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment.
On to wired infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, wired revenue grew by 2% sequentially, and our wired segment represented approximately 20% of our total revenue from continuing operations. The ASIC business was up slightly in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in shipments into routing, especially edge routing. Our fiber optics business, after a strong third quarter, maintained much of its momentum into the fourth quarter, delivering a small sequential increase. We saw increase in fiber-to-the-home shipments and stable deliveries into the enterprise OEM market. The addition of wafer fab capacity at our Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, edge-emitting laser facility helped us better meet the increasing demand for fiber-to-the-home market. In the final -- in the next quarter, first quarter, we expect sustained performance from this segment and project our revenue to also be up slightly here.
Moving on to industrial. In the fourth quarter, industrial and other miscellaneous products represented 8% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Focusing on industrial, resales held up reasonably well during the quarter and were in fact up slightly. By region, Asia Pacific was quite strong with resales growing close to double digits. Europe also grew by near mid-single digits sequentially, but the Americas and Japan were both weak and resales declined in the mid to single digits sequentially in those regions.
However, similar to a number of peers, we saw -- we took a cautionary tone from customers during the quarter and consequently reduced shipments into our distributors, which drove channel inventory down. As a result, our industrial segment revenue declined by 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter. And please keep in mind, we recognize revenue here on a sell-in basis. As we look at first quarter, anticipating normal seasonal decline as well as, of course, lingering macro uncertainty, we plan to continue to reduce inventory in distribution. And accordingly, we expect revenue for industrial segment to decline in the low single digits sequentially.
In summary, therefore, after a strong close to fiscal 2015, we expect an approximate 4% sequential decline in consolidated first quarter 2016 revenue, driven primarily by seasonality in our wireless and industrial segments, offsetting projected sustained performance from our wired and enterprise storage segments.
With the LSI integration completed in fiscal 2015, we have created a very powerful business model that leverage our larger scale and increase diversity to deliver strong growth in earnings for the year. As Tony will provide more color on this in his summary, we expect our earnings strength to carry over into the first fiscal quarter regardless of revenue seasonality. And as we go into the rest of fiscal 2016, we expect this earnings machine to further strengthen with the pending Broadcom acquisition.
With this in mind, I'd like to mention that the Broadcom acquisition process continue to progress very smoothly, and day 1 integration planning continue -- planning, including identification of all key business leaders and supporting teams, have -- has been completed. We have made very good progress, in fact, on the regulatory approval front and expect to be in a position to close the transaction early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. In fact, we believe that we could present an integrated set of financial results starting with our second quarter of fiscal 2016.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financials. Tony?",1212
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2015",2015-12-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3029.0,910331.0,38889621.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.
Revenue of $1.85 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter represents an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. Foxconn was a greater-than-20% customer in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62%, which was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix and continued high fab utilization.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $257 million and SG&A expenses were $81 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $338 million, $2 million above guidance, primarily due to higher bonus accruals driven by higher profitability. On a percentage basis, total operating expenses were 18% of revenues, a reduction from 19% in the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 14% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $811 million and represented 44% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $43 million for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $737 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.51. Fourth quarter interest expense was $41 million. Other income, net, was $10 million, resulting from a number of items, including cash from a legal settlement, interest income and gains from foreign exchange hedging.
Our share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $63 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter includes $7 million in cost of goods sold, $30 million in R&D and $26 million in SG&A. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $65 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. The non-GAAP guidance from first quarter fiscal 2016 also excludes estimated ticking fees of approximately $47 million related to debt commitments for the pending Broadcom acquisition.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 50 days, an increase of 8 days from the prior quarter, caused by linearity of our revenue across the quarter. Our inventory ended at $524 million, a $17 million increase from the third quarter. Days on hand were 68 days. We generated $582 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, which increased by approximately $400 million from the prior quarter.
Our fourth -- in our fourth quarter, we spent $106 million on capital expenditures. On September 30, 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $0.42 per ordinary share, which consumed $116 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter.
Since the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board.
Now let me briefly recap our fiscal year 2015 full year results. Net revenues increased by 60% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, benefiting primarily from a full year of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our wireless business. Gross margin increased 5% year-over-year to 61%, driven by an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the enterprise storage segment. Net income for fiscal 2015 increased to $2.6 billion or $8.98 per diluted share as compared to $1.3 billion or $4.90 per diluted share in fiscal 2014.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion plus or minus $25 million. Gross margin is expected to be 61% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $314 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $40 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $37 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 295 million shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. However, I would like to make one final comment. Earlier this week, Avago became 10 years old as an independent company. Just as a contrast to today's results, our first year in operations, we had $1.51 billion in revenue and a non-GAAP net loss of $108 million. I would like to personally thank all employees for their hard work and contributions in this first decade.

Can you give us some context, what is driving that higher content? And what is your differentiation and competitive advantage versus, say, another competitor who also has BAW filters and is also adding capacity? What can you do consistently that they cannot? So what's really driving up content? And what's your competitive advantage?",74

Content keeps increasing in smartphones, especially the higher-end smartphones, because of, as I say, increasing number of bands, spectral bandwidth that come into play worldwide as carriers expand the bandwidth by which they connect phones, connect us to each other. A number of especially LTE bands are increasing even in places like Japan, where you have new introduction of new bands, band 21, which have not existed before. And of course, the same applies in China, where you have both TDD and FDD as well. So it's really the proliferation of LTE bands and for high-end smartphones, the need for the creation [ph], especially towards the higher end, for phones that can roam. Adding on to this mix is the fact that 2 other things are happening that drives not just RF content, but our particular kind of RF content which is a form of FBAR filters, which allows signals to be received or transmitted in extremely discrete, very narrow -- on a very accurate or, call it, narrow base switches. The problem of -- with that number of bands in one little device, you start to create the phenomenon of coexistence. And coexistence, which exists and exists not across cellular bands alone, but across WiFi, Bluetooth as well, crossing cellular bands, too, that coexistence issue creates a specific need for filters that can extract signals from a very cluttered air space from ether [ph]. Then, of course, you hear now about downlink carrier aggregation, and next year on, you'll start to see some of -- certain phone models with uplink carrier aggregation. Those -- what carrier aggregation meant, and I may have discussed it in previous calls, is simply the ability to max [ph] or de-max [ph] multiple bands -- signals from multiple bands into one single channel in the phone or out, externally. And in order to do that, you need components, you need filters that are able to do the maxing [ph] and de-maxing [ph] in the RF space. And that's where FBAR filters come into their own. So because of all that, we had been consistently seeing over the last several years, and we see that trend continue over the next 3 years because it's as far as we can probably look with a degree of certainty, the increase in content -- in RF content and in particular, in the need for filters, which are not able to be integrated into one single chip. Each filter is a very discrete element. So that's pretty much what's driving what I postulate as perhaps a trend of 20% a year increase in dollar content of RF over the next several years for high-end smartphones. Okay?",452

All we do know is it is -- and I suspect in specific areas, there is market share gains on our side simply because we do a better product, simply because we're able to execute on better products. Also, we've been perhaps fortunate in being focused on certain customers, certain OEM customers in particular, that have done better than others and that allows us through that process by itself to gain share. And we build -- display that because, yes, we're fully aware of what's out there, what we hear out there on the macro side. But we are seeing strength particularly on the enterprise front, less so the cloud data center side. So maybe that's something to do with that as well.",140

It's mostly due to 2 factors. We completely completed the Emulex transition, so there's some OpEx drop-off from that. But more significantly, it's the reset on the bonus accrual. So on the bonus side, we're significantly above 100% attainment and that gets reset into Q1 at 100%, so you get some benefit from that as well. Now just to give you some perspective in 10 years of working here with the bonus is that it's not reset to last year's numbers. We have new numbers that are a little bit stretch targets for next year. So every year that we accomplish over 100% is a pretty Herculean feat. So it's not that we go into it saying we're going to earn 150% in the next year and you'll have kind of expense catch up at the second half of the year. So it's a true reset, and those are the 2 reasons for the expense drop-off.",157

I cannot really answer for fiscal '16 because we don't give guidance, Romit, on an annual basis. But I tell you, the trajectory we have been seeing and continues, I believe, to be on. And I second [ph] things in my opening remarks to clarify why this year, this end of '15, early '16, as we sit here, why it's more of an exception, a hiatus, I call it, than the rule. But content, as we farm [ph] in all this additional spectral bandwidth into a single piece -- a single device, has increased content-wise, physical content. My -- what we are seeing is anywhere from 30% to almost 50% every year, compounded every year. And -- but then there's always a value to some level of integration in terms of dollar translation, which is why in dollar terms, that content increase of 30% to 50% typically translates to, I think, 20% to 30% on an annual basis.

Not as much perhaps as out here in the U.S., but there is, and there's a need to do that because that's where the operators in China were and want to go. And so we are seeing that now and we are selling some products, some more discrete module products that addresses downlink carrier aggregation. Uplink, that's a different method. Down, probably out for a couple of years at least, if not longer, for China. Uplink will happen here and some parts of the world faster, but downlink carrier aggregation is already happening in China.",118

I know you said you have visibility into the next 2 to 3 years on the design wins and also on the architectures. I'm just curious as to how much visibility you have on the pricing front because, obviously, to say that your content is increasing 20%, you got to assume some pricing curve.

It's -- again, I'm approaching it from a very macro point of view and a very trend basis. And if you look at my trend and macro over the last 4 years, that 20% is what I've been achieving and have been able to achieve and achieving. And I think there's nothing really that we see out there, though I should never take it for granted because each one is an interesting challenge by itself. I'll be honest, the products we do in FBAR in front-end module, pets [ph], as I call them, are very, very difficult things to do. I mean, I'm not saying they are moon shots, but they're not that far from that. And we spend an enormous amount of money, talent doing it. So the best way to describe it is we don't see anything that dramatically changed, though each one is a tough one by itself. So as I've seen it the last 4 years, I'm basically commenting that it sure looks that for the next 2, 3 years, we'll see a continuation of this trend. And we see that, as I answer in an earlier question, through more bands, through the increasing issue of coexistence across bands in handsets, plus just as much the phenomenon of downlink and uplink carrier aggregation as operators need to run their network and base station much more efficiently. And all that is happening. It's not pie in the sky.",244

And then, Tony, on the balance sheet side, I guess once you close the Broadcom deal, I think you told us you're going to have the leverage ratio around 2.5x or so.

So you can think about, at any given time, we can be another turn here right out of the gate. However, the Broadcom acquisition, there will be a digestion phase for Broadcom. And as we've said, we don't wake up every morning looking for the next acquisition. We're very opportunistic on the acquisition front, and we'll look at it as we go. But again, I think we have flexibility with a starting point at 2.5x to do what we need to do, and if something opportunistic comes along, we'll take advantage of that.",115

But you're right, it's tied to sockets, I believe in sockets that we will win over the next 12, 18 months.

But at the end of it all, it's all based on judgment, and we tend to be rather conservative in lagging capacity build-out behind what we see as demand. We might have, based on an earlier statement, started to behave a little differently. But basically, we are very conservative creatures is what we know we are.

Keep in mind, maybe first, simplest way to answer is our Q1 is November, December and January. So as you know -- as you probably know, industrial seasonality is down late -- end of the year and up again beginning of the year. So for Q1, we only have 1 month, not much. So that's why we continue to be -- to forecast and be conservative in our guidance of industrial revenue, whether they be resale or shipping. On the resale front, yes, we kind of see industrial -- it's hard to break out between seasonality versus secular in this case. All we see is that industrial is kind of struggling even to stay flat at this point. We saw -- our Q4, just to emphasize, was actually August, September, October. So we only saw part of the downturn of the back end of the year. And so that -- so even though our shipping was down, our resale, as I indicated, wasn't that bad. So I would expect our resale Q1 to be not so good, and that's why I used the word struggle to even stay flat, which is why we believe we better guide our shipping, which is our revenue, at down single digits. And we could have -- and not more or less, let's put it that way, because if the resale maybe down even more but our shipping is less because we already pulled down inventory last quarter.",246
