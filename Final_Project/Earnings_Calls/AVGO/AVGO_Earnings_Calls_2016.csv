Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited.
After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at www.broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.
As you're all aware, Broadcom Limited is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited. Following Avago's acquisition of Broadcom Corporation on February 1, 2016, the first day in our second fiscal quarter, Broadcom Limited became the ultimate parent company of Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corporation.
During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2016 results, which relate to our predecessor Avago only. They will then move on to providing background to our second quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook, which will relate to the combined company. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.
In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is recorded in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?",310

Good afternoon, everyone. As Ashish mentioned, my comments on first quarter results relate only to classic Avago, while comments for the second fiscal quarter relate to the combined company, Broadcom Limited. 
Now the combination of classic Avago and classic Broadcom has produced a new, larger and more diversified company. I'm very pleased to welcome classic Broadcom employees to the new company. They are truly a very talented group of people who bring a great deal of unique engineering expertise.
Talking of which, we are making very good progress on the integration front, have started to realize the acquisition-related cost synergies although we are only at the beginning of this exercise. We've also just started the process of pruning some noncore classic Broadcom product lines. Accordingly, my comments for the second quarter focus only on continuing operations, which do not include these noncore product lines classified as discontinued operations.
From a segment point of view, we will continue to report results broken out by our 4 end markets, namely: wired, wireless, enterprise storage and industrial. However, starting with our second fiscal quarter, the components of revenue will increase significantly for our wired and wireless segments as a result of the Broadcom acquisition. And I will provide additional color on these changes in my end-market discussion. Our enterprise storage and industrial segments will remain unchanged from classic Avago.
Let me start with a short summary of first quarter fiscal 2016 results, which only refer to classic Avago. Revenue for our first quarter came in at $1.78 billion, a 4% sequential decline and in line with our guidance. Our tight control over operating expenses during the quarter helped keep Q1 operating margins flat sequentially at a robust 44% of revenue despite the sequential decline in revenues. Earnings per share came in at $2.41, better than the midpoint of guidance.
Moving on to our expectations for the second quarter, which now include revenue contributions from classic Broadcom. We expect consolidated revenues to approximately double to $3.55 billion. We currently anticipate this quarter's revenue level to be the trough for the rest of the fiscal year. 
So with this, let me now turn to a discussion by segment of our Q1 results as well as our outlook in Q2. Starting with wired. In the first quarter, wired revenue grew by 2% sequentially, and the wired segment represented 22% of our total revenue. Growth in the quarter was driven by broad strength in our fiber optic business, largely offset by a decline in our ASIC products, reflecting weakness in data center switching. However, starting with second fiscal quarter, in addition to classic Avago's custom networking ASICs and fiber optic products, the consolidation of classic Broadcom will add Ethernet switching and routing standard products; physical layers, copper and optical standard products to this segment. In addition, it will also include classic Broadcom's broadband communication solutions for set-top box, cable modem and carrier access.
In the second quarter, we're expecting strength, good strength on multiple fronts in the wired segment. We're expecting growth to resume in our custom ASIC business, driven by increase in shipments to wireless base stations and the start of a product ramp into the new data center switches. Our standard ASSP switching, routing and physical layer products are seeing an increase from enterprise demand. Broadband carrier access is experiencing strong activity driven by fiber to the home and DSL deployments in multiple regions including China. And finally, we expect our set-top box business to also benefit from some seasonal refresh cycles at key customers. In aggregate, we expect second quarter revenues from wired segment to be approximately 55% of our total revenue from continuing operations.
Moving on to wireless. In the first quarter, revenue from the wireless segment declined by 15%, 1-5 percent, sequentially and represented 32% of our total revenues. And just to remind you, that's just Avago classic. Last year, unusually high demand in the first quarter from our North American customer offset the normal seasonality. This year, however, as we all well know, seasonality returned, and there was a product life cycle-related decline in demand from that key customer. We did see a small positive offset from an increase in shipments to our large Korean customer driven by the launch of their new flagship smartphones where we also increased our RF content.
Turning to the second fiscal quarter. In addition to Avago's -- Avago classic RF FBAR filters and power amplifiers, our wireless segment will now include classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity and custom analog handset solutions. And in this second quarter 2016 that we're in, we expect the product life cycle-related decline demand from our North American customer to continue to impact our combined wireless revenue. And in the aggregate, we expect second quarter revenue from our wireless segment to be approximately 23% of our total revenue from continuing operations.
We expect the second quarter though to be the trough for our wireless business for the rest of the fiscal year, and we expect to start ramping up shipments late in our third quarter to support the increase in demand driven by the difficult product cycle ramp in our North American customer. In fact, we have already started prebuilding in significant quantities our RF FBAR filters to support this expected ramp. We expect the demand increase from this product ramp to be further enhanced by a substantial increase in our content in this new next-generation phone. Classic Broadcom's combo Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and custom analog solutions will further add significantly to our content in these Tier 1 OEM-leading smartphones. By the same token, of course, we expect the classic Broadcom wireless products to also benefit from the launch of new generation of phones later this year.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the first quarter, this segment revenue grew by 6% sequentially, better than expectations and enterprise storage represented 38% of our total revenue, that's revenue of Avago classic in Q1. This was our largest segment in the first quarter. During the quarter, we saw strong demand from enterprise and nearline hard disk drives. Our server and storage connectivity businesses also had a good quarter led by seasonal growth from fiber channel shipments, while our RAID and SaaS businesses largely sustained.
Going forward, composition of this segment will remain largely unchanged. However, we expect a somewhat different picture in the second quarter with seasonal declines impacting both our hard disk drive business and server storage. We expect second quarter revenues from this segment to be approximately 17% of our total revenue from continuing operations.
Finally, to the last segment, industrial. First quarter 2016 industrial segment represented 8% of our total revenue as we had planned. In the face of lingering uncertainty in industrial end markets, we decreased shipments in the distribution and during the quarter, our industrial segment revenue declined by 10% sequentially in the first quarter. Keep in mind, we recognize revenue on shipping basis. So -- but -- and so industrial resales on the other hand decreased only moderately in the mid-single digits on a sequential basis.
By region, resales in Asia Pacific was slightly up, Japan flat, Americas down moderately, while Europe declined in the low teens sequentially last quarter. Our prudent approach to distributor shipments, which like resales, resulted in a reduction in channel inventory. Please keep in mind, as I said again, we recognize revenue only on a sell-in basis. And as we look at the second quarter, the composition of this segment will also remain unchanged, Avago classic and then -- but anticipating favorable seasonality to the start of the year, we expect a high single digit sequential increase in industrial resales. However, we will continue to manage channel inventory and expect a more moderate increase in shipments into the channel and by that, revenue. We are also expecting a substantial increase in our IP licensing revenue due to a few deals we expect to close within the second quarter. And so in aggregate, we expect second quarter revenue from industrial to be approximately 5% of our total revenue from continuing operations of this combined company.
With those color, let me summarize for the second quarter. With the addition of classic Broadcom, wired now becomes our broadest and largest segment, and we're expecting a very strong performance from multiple product lines in this segment. Wireless also becomes broader but remains tight to a limited number of large high-end smartphone customers, and we expect this current Q2 quarter to be the seasonal trough for the rest of the year. We also expect a seasonal decline in enterprise storage, but something of a recovery in industrial.
We are very excited by the opportunities in front of us as a combined company to continue to drive our financial model on an even larger scale with broader access to very attractive end markets. We continue to expect we will achieve the $750 million target in annualized cost synergies over the next 6 fiscal quarters, and we think we might be able to even beat that. We're also working on returning to our long-term financial model of driving operating margins back above 40% as quickly as possible.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our first quarter financials.",1553
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2016",2016-03-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3217.0,947367.0,40311587.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, my comments on our first quarter results relate to our predecessor Avago, while comments, including guidance for the second fiscal quarter, relate to the combined company. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.broadcom.com.
Revenue of $1.78 billion in the first quarter represented a decrease of 4% from the prior quarter. Foxconn and Apple were greater than 10% direct customers in the fiscal first quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 61%, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $238 million, and SG&A expenses were $68 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $306 million, $8 million below guidance as we were cautious going into the close of the acquisition. On a percentage basis, total operating expenses were 17% of revenues, a reduction from 18% in the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $783 million and represented 44% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $35 million, which is a 5% rate for the first quarter, a bit lower than our guidance at 5.5%. First quarter net income was $710 million, and earnings per diluted share were $2.41. First quarter interest expense was $41 million, and this does not include the ticking fees we incurred in the quarter related to the debt commitments we secured for the Broadcom acquisition. Other income net was $3 million.
Our share-based compensation expense for the first quarter was $57 million. The breakdown for the first quarter includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $28 million in R&D and $23 million in SG&A. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation expense will be approximately $195 million. Just as a reminder, the definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 54 days, an increase of 4 days from the prior quarter caused by linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $490 million, a $34 million decrease from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Days on hand were 64 days, a reduction of 4 days from the prior quarter as we sold raw material and work-in-process inventories in conjunction with the sale of certain fiber optics subsystem manufacturing and related assets to a third-party. We generated $474 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion, which increased by approximately $350 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we also received $68 million from the sale of the fiber optics subsystem assets.
In the first quarter, we spent $140 million on capital expenditures. For the second quarter, we expect CapEx to be approximately $210 million, which includes approximately $60 million for campus construction activity primarily at our Irvine location, $50 million for ongoing capacity expansion for manufacturing RF filters at our Fort Collins fab and $10 million of IT integration expenses related to the acquisition.
On December 30, 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $0.44 per ordinary share, which consumed $122 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of Avago's dividend program in second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As you have seen, our board has also declared a dividend of $0.49 per share to be paid on March 31 this quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which include projected contributions from the combined Avago and Broadcom Corporation businesses. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $3.55 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 59% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $832 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $50 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $161 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 443 million shares.
And one balance sheet item, the ending cash balance, which is expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion, which includes the expected repayment of $300 million of our outstanding debt in the quarter. As mentioned, this guidance excludes the estimated results of certain recently acquired Broadcom businesses, which have been classified as assets held for sale and will be reported as discontinued operations beginning February 1, 2016. In fiscal 2015, we estimate these businesses generated $295 million in annual revenue and consumed $282 million in annual operating expenses. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.",897

We're seeing pretty broad-based strength even from -- both from Avago classic as well as the newer product divisions from Broadcom classic. One clear example is the initial ramp of -- you probably heard announcement on data center switching where our ASIC business are coming in and starting to see a ramp in certain -- at certain cloud guys through a fairly large OEM, and this has been successful and things are moving along very nicely. And the funny thing is while the ASIC ramp is happening, the existing products, which is using standard switch products from Broadcom classics, is also seeing a lot of strength, especially in this case, from enterprise. So we think across the board and carrying along that, of course, are our physical layer products and Ethernet switching, which all moves in the same direction. So that pretty much is enterprise largely, to answer your question, a couple of product ramps but largely enterprise.",160

It's very, very good traction of 25 gig at hyper data center guys and even some enterprise guys who are building data centers of their own. That's what's driving a lot of strength also in the Broadcom classic business and even the ASIC business of Avago classic is 25 gig. And it drives not just only switching, which is one you mentioned here, Tomahawk, it also drives to a large degree the associated product related to Ethernet, though that's still early, but definitely physical layer products, which is a big chunk of Broadcom classic wired segment as well.

And we all know the units of phones in this very high-end top of the pyramid smartphones is not -- is maybe 20%, maybe 15%, 20% of that entire market made by a few key branded manufacturers, and we are very well positioned there and we -- our growth rate is not about unit growth. It's about content. And if this continues the same trend of the content keeps growing over 20% a year, this coming generation and on back half of this fiscal and calendar year remains very much on track to follow that same trend.",154

The first priority is we pay down debt, absolutely. Second priority is, and simultaneous to it as evidenced by increasing our dividends, if we are confident about cash flow generation, which we are, we do -- we'll return cash, excess cash we consider more than what we need to operate this company even as it scales up, to shareholders and evidenced by increasing dividends. And right now, we're not doing much M&A. It could be further from our mind at this point.",112

On the clarification, on the sales guidance for Q2, I'm wondering, Tony, how much is excluded for the recent optics divestiture and then the $300 million that you said might be held as discontinued ops? Because I'm just trying to get an apples-to-apples of your guidance versus consensus expectations, and I want to make sure that I am excluding some of those things that have -- that are in discontinued ops or that you have divested already.",90

First off, on the asset sale, part of that was in Q1. So it's a tough compare to say exactly what it is from Q1 to Q2, but it was fairly insignificant, I would just say that, for the overall company. And as I outlined in my final statement was the disc ops portion of Broadcom assets is sub $300 million.

And then my larger question, I know, Hock, that you are focused on the current business right now. But one thing we often hear is that companies are trying to essentially balance the amount of exposure they have to the smartphone market, and I understand your FBAR business is doing extremely well. You're seeing the content gains. But when I look at the connectivity business, I don't see the same potential for content gains. So is that a fair assessment? And if it is, then do you think that perhaps that is the potential for divesting the business and perhaps focusing on other areas, whether it's wired or storage or others?",113

It's definitely not in discontinued ops, obviously, and we believe it is a sustainable franchise. That's how we classify this business is one of our sustainable franchise as is FBAR and evolution of the technology of next-generation Wi-Fi has been particular. Keeps coming in, improvement of performance, issues of coexistence between Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and now cellular band. It's a major, major issue that Broadcom classic are very good at addressing. And as we especially we start going to 5G Wi-Fi next-generation and that is already starting to happen and we start seeing those high-end smartphones run multiple channels simultaneously, we start to see that our expertise, our unique technology in FBAR will actually come to bear in even improving Wi-Fi modules that can perform -- that can surpass performance of anything else in the marketplace today. So that to us is a very, very complementary product line to our cellular FBAR business. So no, it's a sustainable franchise.",166

On the broadband connected home business, this is a business that's often thought as a relatively slow growth segment. However, cables are going through a pretty big major upgrade cycle to DOCSIS 3.1. Hock, as you mentioned, you've got PON in China, which continues to be relatively strong. And then we have the pay TV service provider move to 4K UHD over the next several years. What's your confidence level on the growth prospects in the broadband business this year?",86

One is a large part of it is mainly CPE, relates to set-top box, in particular for us, though there are some over-the-top stuff by Roku, which we participate in too, but truly is set-top box is the primary chunk. So there's one chunk of it on broadband. And the other chunk of it is what I call carrier access, which is really gateways, infrastructure gateways, which are the DSLs and the GPON mostly and then there's the set-top box. The set-top box business is, my favorite line again, a sustainable franchise. We are very well positioned. We have great technology, tied a lot of it to the fact that we have all the different business of technology as -- including DOCSIS 3.1. We're the only guys, the first one and only guys certified in it. We also have all the technology that integrates in one chip a digital solution. And we are not the only one, but as somebody said, with the exit of STMicro, it even perhaps strengthened our market position and indicates how difficult this business is. So that -- but having said that, the client side set-top box including satellite is not something that we foresee any dramatic growth, but we do foresee stable sustainable levels, which is a big chunk of our business. Now on the carrier access, which is gateways, infrastructure gateways, that's very exciting on growth. We see evolution in new generation, 2.5G and even GPON going to 10G, applying same to [indiscernible] DSL. All that is happening and that requires new capability to generate new generation of products, which we have in ample supply. Broadcom classic, these guys are phenomenal. They're there, and they only generate the products better and faster than anybody else and we're doing it here, too. And that business, as emerging countries and even developed countries, regions like Europe, upgrade their infrastructure towards more broader capacity and connectivity, they're going for 10G now and we are seeing initial ramp to it. It's pretty cool, and we see there is a lot of strength to it. And here comes the other complementarity to our Avago classic business. We also sell the lasers, the optics that go hand-in-hand with many of this carrier access stuff. So we're very positive about this.",395

And then Tony, on the April quarter guide, sort of looking at the combined entity and looking at your guidance for April, looks like you guys are taking out about $120 million per quarter in OpEx.

Hock, getting back to the classic Avago wireless business, the FBAR business, given the weakness in the North American customer in the near term, is there opportunity to transition some of that capacity into the Chinese smartphone market?

We are pre-building products for FBAR filters, in particular, for the expected ramp of our North American customer, we are. And so it's pretty full. And frankly because of that, we do sell to other customers, but we obviously have a commitment, very clear commitment, to be sure that we continue to support this North American customer, and that's always very important, not least of which they are the ones who drive the most interesting content within your phones.",126

And then a little bit on the combined wired business. I mean, clearly the acquisition of Broadcom, on the surface, is more than justified by sort of the financial justification. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at the wired business and classic Avago and classic Broadcom, have you started to see opportunities for revenue synergies? And as you answer the question, I was hoping I'd get a better understanding of how your ASIC business compares, contrasts with the Broadcom ASSP business.",88

They coexist because I'll tell you this, we go to customers and we love our customers. So we go to these OEM customers. And we basically, our ASSP switch, for instance, our router, is a full turnkey solution. It's not just a piece of silicon. It has -- it needs to be architect in a certain way first and it has all the software aspects that ties to it. So it's a full turnkey solution that can support a customer. As opposed to that, all our ASIC business does is my customer has to architect the switch. They have to then -- basically, all they're buying from us is a piece of silicon. They even do some of the front-end RTL sometimes, and we do the back end. But we do the supply chain, of course. By the end of the day, all the software, we don't do. They provide it. Our ASIC business has 0 software. So what we sell is a piece of silicon, finished, no doubt, but there's no -- that's all it is, is hardware. No software. So what we really offer is this thing, and we sell both to the same customers very often. It's really up to the customer, and some customers will look at it and say, ""I want to invest on a lot of software,"" a lot -- invest in architecture and just buy the ASIC from us. And so they spend a lot of operating spend R&D to do that or they invest much less, very little. They build a box and they buy a turnkey SoC with software from standard switching. So to the customer, it's not competition. It is a business model alternate -- 2 business model alternatives, one where they spend less R&D OpEx, okay, and maybe get time to market faster with a completed solution quickly; or through that they spend R&D, architect it, drive the software and go often and are later to market and basically try to put secret sauce on their own, which are at liberty to do and we will support a customer on both models. To us and to them, it's a business model choice rather than competition.",383

So I mean, if any, we get something late in the quarter. And I think you'd see more material COGS changes in the second half, and I think that's the way it will work on COGS.

That's helpful. And then with regard to the integration of the classic Broadcom business, clearly, you're approaching the businesses a bit differently.

And that's where we are like. We're very focused. So we identify a bunch of these businesses, and we put a general manager in charge of each of those businesses responsible for their own entire P&L, except support functions on SG&A. Otherwise, they're responsible on product development, positioning a product, marketing their product and developing their product. And each of them run by management team under general managers reporting directly to me, and they have specific targets and goals. And it's not -- and the biggest overwhelming goal for each of them is sustained leadership, and that comes in 2 parts: market leadership and technology leadership. So we'll let them invest as much as they need to sustain it, but we want them to be very focused on continuing to be very strong in the market they're in, in the narrow market they are in. And we define that very clearly with them, each other, and we continue in that way. And so anything that is not those core businesses is what we really call discontinuing operations. We do not go to look at adjacent markets. We do not go shooting up into the stars and send people to Mars and stuff like that. No, we don't do that. We focus on the core business, and the key thing is sustainability and being the technology leader. And we have identified a bunch of them, as we have in Avago classic. You just add it all together, and we have a fairly flat organization. Each business runs by a management team with their own general manager and a set of goals. That's really how we run the business.",334

So remember, about 70% of it is semi-trap, meaning that it can't be used for probably general purposes, but we can use it for debt purposes on a worldwide basis. The other 30% is similar to the Avago cash flow, which is untrapped, and the Avago portion remains untrapped. So you're right. I mean, we could probably take on bigger goals around the debt and so forth. But for right now, we'll just kind of post that on a quarterly basis to you what we're kind of planning to pay off. And I think you can see that if we hit our goals on synergies and everything else, we'll quickly get back down to an EBITDA ratio of less than 2 probably within a year or so if we execute on our synergies and so forth. So we're not too concerned about the debt we took on, and we took on debt at a lower ratio than we did even on the LSI time.",178

Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we delivered strong results for second fiscal quarter of 2016, the first quarter of operations as a combined company.
Revenue, $3.56 billion, came in just a shade above the midpoint of our guidance, while earnings per share were significantly higher than guidance. As you all are well aware, demand for hard disk drives and premium smartphones was weak this quarter, Q2. However, we experienced strong product cycles from switching and broadband in our wired segment, enabling company revenues to come in line with expectations.
Our larger scale and greater diversity enabled consolidated results to be resilient, mitigating fluctuations in our individual end markets. Earnings came in significantly above expectations, enabled by delivering gross margin at the high end of guidance and driving faster-than-expected ongoing realization of acquisition-related cost synergies.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our second quarter segment results. Let's start with wired. In addition to classic Avago's custom networking ASIC and fiber optic products, the combination of classic Broadcom has added Ethernet switching and routing ASSPs, physical layer, copper and optical products. And in addition, in this segment, it also includes now classic Broadcom's broadband communication solutions for set-top box, cable modem and carrier access.
In the second quarter, wired revenue came in at $2.06 billion, and this represented 58% of our total revenues. This is now obviously our largest segment, and it performed better than we had expected in the second quarter.
We saw strength across various product lines. We experienced robust demand in switching and routing standard products, including very strong traction for our new Tomahawk switching and Jericho routing platforms, especially from the cloud and service provider customers. In fact, as some of you may know, a key customer today announced a new lead -- universal lead switch and routing platform for next-generation data centers, which is based on the Jericho product platform.
We also saw strong demand for our broadband products from set-top box refreshes driven by the start of adoption of 4K video. Service providers continue to invest in broadband access infrastructure, including ongoing fiber to the home build-out in China as well as DSL and cable modem build-out in Europe.
As we look into the third quarter for our wired segment, we expect the strong demand to sustain from the prior quarter and project wired segment revenues to be up in the low single digits sequentially. We're also working on resolving a few potential supply constraints in this particular segment.
Moving on to wireless segment. In addition to Avago's FBAR filters and power amplifiers, our wireless segment now also includes classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity and custom analog handset solutions. In the second quarter, wireless revenue came in at $792 million, and the wireless segment represented 22% of our total revenue.
As expected, we did see a decline in demand from a large North American smartphone customer, including the anticipated impact of the seasonal product life cycle related reduction in shipments. This was partially offset by an increase in shipments to a large Asian handset OEM. As we have said before, this second quarter was the trough for this segment for the rest of this fiscal year.
Moving on to third quarter. We're expecting a very different picture for our wireless segment and expect strong sequential revenue growth in the mid-20% range. The expected growth is driven by the start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next-generation platform, enhanced by a substantial increase in classic Avago's RF content in this new handset. 
Classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity content will also increase in this new handset. We anticipate our wireless connectivity business to continue to drive significant innovation for mobile WiFi and Bluetooth applications and expect this product line to be a very key long-term contributor to our wireless segment.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the second quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $525 million, down 23% sequentially. Enterprise storage represented 15% of total revenues. This segment experienced a sequential decline in revenue driven by a large trough in hard disk drive unit TAM and seasonal weakness in the enterprise server storage connectivity market.
Looking to the third quarter. Largely due to further hard disk drive unit TAM declines, we expect enterprise storage revenue to decline in the low single digits sequentially. We currently project the third quarter to be the trough for our enterprise storage revenue this fiscal year. Regardless of fluctuations in unit TAM, we also expect to continue to gain share in our hard disk drive business.
And let me now move to the last segment, industrial. As I mentioned previously, this segment does include our IP licensing business. But in the second quarter, industrial segment revenues came in at $182 million, up 30% sequentially and represented 5% of our total revenues. Industrial resales grew sequentially mid-single digits, and our revenue here increased as well by the same level as we replenish channel inventory to keep up with the seasonal increase.
Looking at the third quarter, we expect the trend to sustain from the prior quarter and expect mid-single-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenue driven by continuing high resale projections. However, in IP sales, after a strong and lumpy second quarter, we expect revenue to drop in the third quarter. And as a result, we expect revenue in the industrial segment to decline mid-single digits sequentially after a 30% increase in Q2.
In summary, therefore, what we expect for the third quarter is sustained performance from networking and broadband, a trough in enterprise storage but a strong seasonal ramp in wireless, driving sequential growth in consolidated revenue of over 5%. We expect earnings to grow even faster, and we are projecting earnings per share to grow sequentially at almost double the rate of revenue growth, driven by lower operating and interest expense as a percentage of net revenues. This, in a nutshell, is the leverage and power of our business model.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our second quarter financials. Tom?",1024
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2016",2016-06-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3281.0,995241.0,42060914.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. The reconciliation of our GAAP and our non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.
First, before I get into the second quarter results, I would like to take a few minutes to review progress we're making towards our long-term financial model as we work through completing the integration of classic Broadcom.
Fundamentally, just to review, the financial model is the output of the business model that Hock is driving. The most important element of our model is sustainability of the franchises we invest in over the long term. When we set out to acquire Broadcom, we recognized their collection of well-established businesses with leadership positions. Built on the back of proprietary and highly defensible technologies, we believe that these franchises were critical to enabling rapidly evolving wireline and wireless ecosystems. While we only have one quarter under our belt, we think that this thesis is very much intact.
Another key element is discipline. We are actively managing the portfolio to stay focused on investing in the core franchises while monetizing businesses that do not have clear long-term sustainability. This is an ongoing process to continue to allow us to maximize returns on our R&D investments.
Finally, we keep things simple and focused on critical business processes. Given our now larger economies of scale, we can be even more efficient across our global supply chain and sales platforms as well as our general and administrative functions. 
This takes us to the 3-key elements in our financial model, starting with revenue. While we don't expect the broader semiconductor industry to grow much over the long term, we do believe that our franchises will benefit from some very positive trends, including what seems to be an ever-increasing demand for mobility, bandwidth and storage. We believe that we have the right set of technologies to support these needs, which gives us confidence in our long-term annual revenue growth rate target of approximately 5%.
On the gross margin front. Given the market need for our technology and the leadership positions we have, coupled with ongoing cost reductions in our supply chain, we see potential opportunities over time to push gross margins beyond the 60% we already delivered this quarter.
Turning to operating expenses. We believe the completion of integration activities and our focus on return on investment will allow us to drive R&D expenses to 16% of net revenue within the next few quarters. Looking at the target portfolio and the set of core projects we want to support, we feel 16% is currently the appropriate long-term target for R&D expenses.
And finally, on SG&A, we clearly see potential opportunities to drive these expenses below 4% of net revenue.
In summary, as we look at the second half of fiscal '16, we expect to see solid revenue growth from the second quarter, which we believe will help drive operating margins to 40% as we exit the year. As we work toward completing integration and the full achievement of cost synergies in fiscal '17, we think we can drive operating margins north of 40% and sustain those margins longer term.
Let me turn to our capital allocation strategy moving forward. As many of you know, over the last several years, we have focused on M&A and the returns have allowed us to drive significant value for shareholders. Going forward, we believe acquisition opportunities will continue to present themselves that, under our business model, will drive returns that far outweigh the alternative uses for our capital.
As a result, we currently intend to limit the paydown of our outstanding term loans until our gross debt is approximately 2x EBITDA, at which time we intend to start pooling excess cash for the purposes of M&A as well as review our capital structure generally, including our long-term debt alternatives.
As part of our capital allocation strategy, we plan to remain committed to our dividend program and are currently targeting an approximate 10% per year increase. However, as a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions relating to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board.
Now let me turn to a quick review of our results for the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $3.56 billion, which we believe will be the trough for the rest of this fiscal year. Foxconn was a greater than 10% direct customer in the second fiscal quarter.
Our second quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60%, which is at the upper end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix with a stronger-than-expected wired segment and higher fab utilization as we pre-built filters to support the expected second half ramp in wireless revenues.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $663 million and SG&A expenses were $146 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the second quarter of $809 million, $23 million below the guidance. This was largely due to faster-than-expected realization of acquisition-related cost synergies. On a percentage basis, for the second quarter, total operating expenses were 23% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 19% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.3 billion and represented 37% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $53 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected net income. Second quarter net income was $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $2.53.
Second quarter interest expense was $150 million, and other expense net was $6 million. Our share-based compensation expense in the second quarter was $186 million, which included the impact from new grants issued to classic Broadcom employees approximately halfway through the quarter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation expense will be approximately $221 million, and this anticipates the full impact of the new grants for the quarter. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 70 -- sorry, 47 days, reflecting the combined company. Our inventory ended at $1.47 billion, and days on hand were 72 days, which includes the impact of an inventory build supporting the strong growth expected in our wireless business. We generated $622 million in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $300 million of cash expended on restructuring activities. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion. We believe that we currently need approximately $1.5 billion to operate the business.
During the second quarter, we repaid approximately $565 million of our outstanding term loans. We incurred -- we currently intend to repay approximately $1 billion in the third quarter, part of which we expect to fund using proceeds from the 2 previously announced divestitures, which are expected to close in the third quarter.
In the second quarter, we spent $158 million on capital expenditures. For the third quarter, we expect CapEx to be approximately $230 million, which includes approximately $75 million for ongoing capacity expansion for our manufacturing RF filters and $45 million for campus construction activity. We expect CapEx to run at an elevated level over the next several quarters, driven by campus construction in our Irvine and San Jose locations, ongoing RF filter fab capacity expansion and integration-related operations and IT investments.
A total of $204 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the second quarter. As you will have seen, our board has declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid later in this third fiscal quarter.
Finally, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter for fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $3.75 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $809 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $59 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $141 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 449 million shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",1439

I'm kind of curious about a couple of things. Did both the North American and the Korean customer grow sequentially in July or was it just mainly the North American customer? And when you look at that North American customer, does the July guidance reflect a full quarter's worth of build benefit of their new high-end phone? Or is it only a partial benefit in the July quarter with really a full benefit coming in the next quarter?",93

Boy, are you getting very sticky and picky. All right. But to answer your question, it's largely from the certain North American customer that's driving the bulk of the growth. Having said that, the Korean customer does show growth as well on its own, but obviously, not to the extent the North American customer is doing because it's a ramp. It's the beginning -- I should use the word beginning of the ramp for the next-generation phone. And tied to that is this July quarter, our current quarter, Q3, will not show the full impact of an entire quarter of revenue ramp. It's just the beginning and very back loaded.",112

And then, Tom, as my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the OpEx guidance for the fiscal third quarter. You are showing sequential revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter. You're guiding OpEx effectively flat on a dollar basis. I'm just kind of curious, just given more of the opportunity you have to realize M&A synergies, why only flat and not better than that? What are the offsets?",77

Good question, John. It's really the timing of the realization of synergies. Obviously, we did better than we thought we'd do out of the gate in the first quarter, and you saw that in the results. And a lot of what's to go to a certain extent is tied to system integration and a lot of the back office activities; that's very much on target to be completed early in the first quarter of next year. And so I'd suggest we will see a bit of a pause here this quarter and perhaps a bit in the next, but as you look in the first half of next year, you'll see the full realization.",115

You broke out every few seconds, but if I get it right, you're basically asking, are we seeing content increase in our wireless revenue in terms of participation in all those premium handsets? And as I've always said, year-to-year generation, obviously, there are fluctuations in the level of content increase. But over a period of time, we have experienced, we have seen and will continue to see a steady increase in content. And this is not just about FBAR -- front-end module content -- as more and more bands and carrier aggregation features comes into high-end phones. Now that we have, well, WiFi, Bluetooth, wireless connectivity, we are seeing the same phenomenon apply exactly. The -- I mean, the parallels between those 2 product lines is pretty amazing from our perspective. It's not coincidental. It's part of the reason it attracts us to our acquisition of Broadcom is the fact that we see wireless connectivity as a very strategic product line in handsets, particularly high-end handsets. For instance, fully 80% of data moves through WiFi today in most handsets. Not LTE but WiFi. And so the importance of improved WiFi connectivity, performance, particularly in the form of capacity, bandwidth, becomes more and more demanding. Improvement becomes more and more needed. And as each generation occurs, I believe is that increase in bandwidth capacity, that increase in performance will follow for the same reasons that increase in requirements for FBAR filters show the same kind of improvement. So we expect -- and I've seen in FBAR filters that over the last few years, content has grown by about 20% fairly steadily. And I might almost apply the same principles to wireless connectivity for WiFi and Bluetooth.",286

Well, we think it's very strong bookings, very strong demand for our switching and routing product lines. And along with that, we carry related products, related products like PHYs, retimers, all that stuff that's needed to connect the various parts and elements of a data center, and so it's one big set of content is -- one might say that, particularly, obviously, the switching and routing. Tomahawk, as you know, launched much earlier than the new Jericho. So Tomahawk is still on a ramp. It's still on a pretty decent ramp, I should say. And we're seeing a very strong demand for it this quarter, particularly on application. Obviously, it is used for top of the rack switching for data centers among the cloud and service provider guys. What we're also seeing very interestingly enough that was just recently launched by some of our OEM customers, some more advanced OEM customers, is the use of our Jericho product line. That's more router. Or another way to describe it is a deeply buffered switch. And that's been used -- that has been increasingly launched to use as the spine of the data center architecture. And why I put emphasis to the spine is today, we just started to see the launch of that same product line deeply buffered on the leaf of that same data center. So -- and that's on a -- both on an accelerated revenue ramp as we're experiencing today. So a big part of this could be a product upgrade cycle, we think, but we also believe there's also very strong underlying built up demand in cloud computing data centers, be they in North America or among the hyper-data center guys or in China.",289

Hence, as Tom articulated, we are positioning ourselves. We are creating a capital allocation strategy that will enable -- that will position us very well to do that.

You mentioned what was going on in a couple of the different areas, but you never mentioned what was happening in the traditional Avago ASIC business. So I guess the first part of it in wired, what was going on in that? And how do you see that going forward? And then as we look into the July quarter, the broadband segment, can you talk about the puts and takes within that subcomponent of your wired business as well?",89

On those traditional -- you call it traditional, I call it the classic Broadcom networking ASIC and fiber optics business, this is still chugging along very nicely. And we're still seeing growth both on fiber optics as well as on traditional ASIC. The reason we don't say as much about it is because what we're seeing in comparison to the standard switching product portfolio that we're seeing out of classic Broadcom is very strong by comparison in this new -- in this area of standard switching and routing, is extremely strong and perhaps probably as I indicated, driven by data centers in the cloud guys who are seeking standard solutions versus the enterprise side, which is more driven -- driving towards using ASIC-based solutions by the OEMs.",131

And I guess as my follow-up, switching back over to the wireless side momentarily, the pace of the ramp you said is very solid in the July quarter and sounds like it will continue in October.

There isn't. Like moving from one to the other, no, I don't think so. We have not seen it. I think it's just that there are some sectors that are strong. Now I know you mentioned -- you asked a question earlier about what the broadband -- set-top boxes, example, or carrier access. Some areas we are seeing a lot of strength, one I mentioned is standard switching and routing. The other area we are seeing a lot of strength is broadband carrier access, which is PON and DSL and associated with it, enterprise wireless access points. All those connected together and then basically pushing it towards infrastructure to some extent as well as campus environment. And we're seeing extreme strength too in that area similar to what we're seeing the level of strength in standard switching and routing. And so I see no specific areas, specific segments or niches in the overall wired market. Not all are growing at the same rate. Some are growing less, as I indicated, and in networking ASIC or fiber optic interconnects. But in carrier access and standard switching and routing, we're seeing very strong demand.",195

And we are working to obviously accelerate this, compress this cycle time, and we believe we should be able to get there within a matter of a couple of months, maybe no more than 3 months.

I think when we talked about the deal when we announced it and then obviously since we closed, our target has been $750 million of line of sight synergies, which both hit the gross margin line as well as the operating margin line. I think by and large, we're still committed to that target. When you think about quarter-to-quarter, it's sometimes a little bit difficult to articulate, but let me put it this way. I think by the time we finish the year, exit the fiscal year, we'll be roughly halfway through our target, which is a bit ahead of plan actually, and then we'll realize the rest in the first half of fiscal '17. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of support on that.",132

Hope you don't take it in any way. I don't think we ever mentioned about raising prices in classic Broadcom or classic Avago for that matter. We never did that. What you may mistake is that when we sell to the same customer multiple product lines and because of the, I guess, the benefit of being able to supply multiple products to the same customer at the same time for platform sales, we're able to increase revenue, not necessary prices. In fact, far from that. And so we've done nothing of that sort.",97

And I believe it's unusual that the July period, as it is this year, is the big quarter for wireless. Even in fiscal '14 where you had big content gains, it was October where you saw -- that was really the quarter where you saw the big sequential growth. And I'm just -- first question is I'm just curious why seasonality in wireless appears to be different this year? Why is July the big quarter instead of what's normally been October?",101
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2016",2016-06-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3281.0,995241.0,42060952.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,41,"Okay. Start over, Romit. July has never been the big quarter. July, being Q3, has never been the big quarter for us if you look back multiple years, never has been. The big quarter has always been the October quarter, Q4, and never been July simply because July is the initial ramp quarter, okay? And in the back half of the July quarter, precisely in the month of actually July, that we start to see shipments because of lead times taken to manufacturer -- manufacturing. We ship to the all -- to the contract manufacturers of our OEMs at that time. And so you see a small part of it in the July quarter. You see a full quarter of impact virtually in the October quarter. And potentially, if you look back 2 years ago, you continue to see in the first quarter of fiscal '17 that ends January 2017 before it rolls over, the typical seasonality rollover, where it rolls over where the trough will be the second fiscal quarter that we just finished. So no different. We're seeing that now. What may puzzle you perhaps when you say why is your wireless revenue ramping 20-odd percent in Q3 this year, perhaps might be the best way to describe is for the various reasons I mentioned and you guys are very well aware of, Q2 this year for the particular generation of phone we're referring to has seen particular weakness known to everyone. And so you're starting off from a bottom that is deeper than in Q2, say, last year or the year before for that matter. So when you come up from such a bottom to a new generation of phone, which you still have to ramp up in the same fashion with the same kind of profile to reach a certain level of supportability or supply, then we suddenly see this big mid-20s ramp up. You're right. Prior years, Q3 -- Q2 to Q3 may not hit that 20-odd percent. You take Q3 to Q4 to hit that. But this year, it's really not Q3 that's different. Perhaps it's Q2 that's different.",355

Well, remember some of the criteria for what Tom called as a franchise product? We only have products that we consider meet certain very disciplined and very tight criteria of being a franchise. The most important is sustainability. We're building a business for 10 years. We're not building a business for 12 or 24 months. And I'll be direct. Most of the IoT products out there early -- and it's early on in the cycle obviously -- are very much consumer-driven, and we're obviously starting very hard and are very disciplined on making sure we preserve -- we invest in product lines -- we invest and we invest a lot in product lines that are very sustainable for many, many years rather than product lines where we have to keep investing as the product line changes every year -- every other year. And from our viewpoint, because of that and because of the tight discipline we put ourselves under, we believe that this was a product line we prefer to have someone else with a different set of perspectives, invest in and nurture than for us to deal with. It doesn't mean that they are wrong, we are right; or we are wrong, they are right. All it is, is beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.",219

One is our overall business model in this company, and it applies across the multiple products lines. We sell franchises, I call it, is we compete basically on technology. We have technology. I mean, we are a walking example of lots and lots of technology in various areas -- not all areas, but in various areas that we feel we are very strong in technology, includes engineers and IP. And we pride ourselves in therefore using that technology to create, develop products, which are very differentiated for leading customers in the markets we participate in. We really do. And those customers, we take very seriously. We are very loyal. We go 100% in for the customer, and we invest to develop those products. In return, we ask for certainty. We ask for partnership, and we tend to like to enter into long-term strategic partnership with a customer where they will continue to use us for future generations of products, which enables us to continue to invest into developing technology and products, which enable them to be successful. And that investment is not just technology in the case of the 8-K -- the filing -- 10-K filing, sorry, that we talked about. It was also capacity -- unique capacity in FBAR. So it fits very, very nicely. But this is not an unusual kind of transaction. We do that with many of our major strategic customers who we like to call partners, but that would be rather presumptuous because they are customers and we are the supplier. But we give them technology, we give them value. And we hope we do enough of that, that they will sign up for a long-term partnership with us, which enable us to continue to invest and sustain that franchise, as we call it.

Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we did deliver very strong results for our third fiscal quarter 2016, with revenue at $3.8 billion, up 7% sequentially and above the midpoint of guidance. Earnings per share of $2.89 grew by a more impressive 14% sequentially as we benefited from the leverage inherent in our business model. 
I'm rather pleased with our execution on integrating classic Broadcom businesses and divesting several of its noncore businesses we had identified as assets held for sale. We've also made rapid progress in driving towards our target business model within the first 2 quarters after closing the acquisition, but we're not yet done with the full realization of expected acquisition-related cost synergies.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our third quarter segment results, starting with wired. In the third quarter, wired revenue came in at $2.07 billion, and the wired segment represented 54% of total revenues. Revenue for this segment was flat sequentially as the strong demand we had seen for wired products in the prior quarter continued to sustain into the third quarter. This was slightly weaker than we have expected due to lower-than-expected set-top box product shipments because of supply constraints. However, the reduction in set-top box revenue was offset by growth in our ASICs, particularly in Internet switching and fiber optic shipments into the Fiber-to-the-Home applications. We also benefited from strong demand for Fiber-to-the-Home products in our broadband access business. Switching and routing ASSPs sustained as data center operators continue to upgrade their infrastructure. Our Jericho routing product family, which is enabling a whole new set of switching and routing platforms for our core customers, had a strong ramp in this quarter. 
As we look in the fourth quarter for wired segment, similar to the prior quarter, we expect wired to sustain and come in -- and continue to come in flat sequentially. We continue to resolve supply constraints in this segment as we progress through the fourth quarter.
Moving on to wireless. In the third quarter, wireless revenue came in at about $1 billion, and this segment represented 27% of total revenues. Revenue for this segment was up 27% sequentially, somewhat stronger than expectations. Growth was primarily driven by the expected start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to the next-generation platform, further enhanced by a substantial increase in Broadcom's content in the new handset. We also benefited from continued demand increases from our large Asian handset customer. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter fiscal 2016, we expect strong growth to continue in our wireless segment, and we are projecting revenue growth over 30% sequentially here. We expect this growth to result from the full ramp of the new phone model in our North American smartphone customer, partially offset by the annual product cycle rollover in our large Asian customer.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the third quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $527 million, and this segment represented 14% of total revenue. Segment revenue came in flat sequentially compared to the large seasonal decline in the prior quarter. We had expected revenue in this segment to decline sequentially, but instead, we delivered better results as some stability returned to both the hard disk drive and server storage, SaaS connectivity businesses in the third quarter. 
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect positive end-market seasonality to drive enterprise storage revenue growth in the low single digits sequentially. 
Finally, to our last segment, industrial. As I mentioned previously, this segment also includes our IP intellectual property licensing business. In the third quarter, industrial segment revenue came in at $202 million, up 11% sequentially, much better than expectations. Industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue. In IP licensing, as expected, after a strong and lumpy second quarter, revenue dropped in the third quarter in IP licensing. 
In contrast, industrial product resales -- these are distributors selling to our end customers, their end customers, grew by a healthy 15% sequentially, with strong demand from all geographies. As a result, industrial product revenue also increased sequentially and significantly as we replenished depleted channel inventory during the third quarter. 
And accordingly, as we look into the fourth quarter and take into account the strong inventory replenishment in the third quarter, we plan on reducing shipments into the channel as we head towards the seasonally weaker end of the calendar year. Therefore, even as we focus resales to continuing to be firm and trend up mid-single digits, we expect an approximate 20% sequential decline in fourth quarter industrial revenue.
In summary, therefore, I'd like to say visibility to near-term projected demand remains very solid, and we anticipate continued momentum into the fourth quarter. We expect the ramp in our wireless segment to drive consolidated revenue growth of 8% sequentially. We expect our operating leverage to drive earnings per share growth of 16% sequentially, twice our projected revenue growth.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials.",845
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 01, 2016",2016-09-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3286.0,1040918.0,43748282.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com. 
We continue to focus on our core businesses, or franchises as we call them, to drive a financial model that delivers sustainable mid-single-digit annual revenue growth at greater than 60% gross margin and greater than 40% operating margin. To that end, in the third quarter, we took another very positive step towards our target model. We achieved healthy top line growth with gross margin over 60% and operating margin at just over 39%. As our integration plans progress, we see a very clear line of sight to achieving our target model in fiscal year 2017. 
We were also able to improve our capital structure in the quarter. We completed both previously announced divestitures, collecting over $600 million in cash, and paid down $1.3 billion of our long-term debt. Finally, just after the quarter closed, we took advantage of favorable credit markets to refinance our outstanding term loans at substantially lower rates. I will touch on the details of the refinancing later in my prepared remarks.
Now let me turn to a summary of our results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $3.8 billion, growing 6.7% sequentially. Foxconn was a greater-than-10% direct customer in the third fiscal quarter. Our third quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60.4%, about 40 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected operational efficiency.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $667 million and SG&A expenses were $141 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the third quarter of $808 million, in line with guidance. Operating expenses were flat sequentially as the benefits from the ongoing realization of acquisition-related cost synergies were offset by higher bonus accruals due to higher profitability. Our fourth quarter guidance for operating expenses anticipates a similar outcome. 
We expect our IT platform integration, which is scheduled to be completed in early fiscal year 2017, to continue to drive operating expense reductions next year as we work towards the full realization of projected acquisition-related cost synergies. 
On a percentage basis for the third quarter, total operating expenses were 21.3% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 17.6% and SG&A was 3.7%. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.5 billion approximately and represented 39.2% of net revenue.
Taxes came in at $61 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected net income. Third quarter net income was $1.3 billion approximately, and earnings per diluted share was $2.89. Third quarter interest expense was $139 million; and other income, net, was $4 million. 
As I mentioned in the opening remarks on August 2 right after the quarter closed, the second day of the fourth fiscal quarter, in fact, we completed a refinancing of our outstanding term loans by upsizing our term loan A and reducing our term loan B by an equivalent amount and simultaneously repricing the remainder of the term loan B at a lower interest rate. The net effect is a reduction of our blended cost of debt based on current LIBOR from 3.5% to 2.9%. This refinancing significantly lowers our projected ongoing interest expenses starting with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Keep in mind our indebtedness is 100% floating rate and is, therefore, subject to movement in short-term interest rates. 
Our share-based compensation expense in the third quarter was $213 million, which included the full impact from new grants issued to classic Broadcom employees after the close of the acquisition in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation expense will also be approximately $213 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 52 days, an increase of 4 days from the prior quarter due to the timing of the seasonal ramp in our wireless revenues. Our inventory ended at $1.3 billion, down from $1.47 billion in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to depletion of wireless filter inventory we had built up in prior quarters to support the strong second half production ramp, which started as expected in the third quarter. 
We generated $963 million in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of cash expended on restructuring activities. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2 billion. 
In the third quarter, we spent $232 million on capital expenditures. For the fourth quarter, we expect CapEx to be approximately $325 million. As I had mentioned previously, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level over the next several quarters, driven by campus construction primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations, integration-related operations and IT investments and the ongoing RF filter fab capacity expansion we discussed in the past. 
A total of $211 million in cash was spent on company dividend partnership distribution payments in the third quarter. And as I think you've seen already, our board just recently declared a dividend of $0.51 per share to be paid later in this fourth fiscal quarter.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $808 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $71 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $104 million, and the diluted share count forecast is for 448 million shares. 
Now that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, if you could, please open up the call for questions.",1022

You talked about supply constraints in the set-top box area. Was that all of the miss in the July quarter? And then when you look at the non-set-top box portion of wired for both July and October, I'm just kind of curious if you could qualify how that business is trending, especially because some companies have been talking about a reacceleration in data center spending in the back half of the year. I would think that you guys would probably be an early leading indicator for that because you really don't want to buy CPUs if you don't have kind of your top-of-rack switches. So any kind of color on that would be helpful.",123

I'm just kind of curious if you can help us understand what's unit-driven versus content-driven. And now that we're sort of a quarter in to some new builds of new cell phones, can you talk a little bit about your content growth expectation on both the FBAR and the connectivity side for some of those new phones?",92

This is a -- what we're seeing in this quarter, Q3 fiscal quarter and Q4 -- most of Q4 fiscal quarter it's not all of it, that ends in October, that represents a period when it's still a ramp, okay. So it's how one constructs the ramp, and that's tied to orders required of our key customers. And it's not necessarily representative of volumes that would eventually be sold through the various channels into end customers. So with that preface, what we're always saying is with the build year-on-year we compare to back to a year ago, the build in unit terms has not significantly changed. It's largely all about content change -- changes.",124

Can you just talk about -- Hock, obviously, you have one customer doing a big ramp. You mentioned one maybe flying [ph] out. Can you talk about the China market and what you're seeing there? And then on the connectivity side, can you just talk about the road map there for content increase? I know you're getting a little GPS this go-around.

Well, let's touch about WiFi, which is wireless connectivity with a combo -- a Bluetooth combo included in it. It's a -- what we're seeing now today is -- by the way, we are largely in the high-end phones, where we have -- where we are driving 802.11ac generation. And in that regard, we are seeing -- we are not seeing that much content increase, say, from a year ago. We expect to see that content increase as we move into next year as more functionality, higher performance multi-bands start to come into play, which includes not just 2.5 gigahertz but 5 gigahertz. We also expect to see beyond that 802.11ac moving into ax, which would be a big step up further in content gain. And in many ways, this is all about increasing capacity throughput of bandwidth of data transfers through these WiFi connections. A parallel situation to our LTE wireless situation were increasing bands, first LTE and then they're increasing the number of bands in LTE interconnectivity, leading to increasing FBAR content, very, very similar; may not match it to other as we move one generation to the other, but the overall trend upward is extremely alike.

And by the time it's all done, I'll be honest, I don't have a good idea what it is. And even I do, I probably wouldn't disclose it in this public forum. But that aside, we do -- we are very aware that we could ship more were it not for our supply constraints, and we've been improving that over the course of the last several months, actually, and we expect to be largely out of it by the end of this fiscal quarter Q4.",126

And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the leverage in the model. You mentioned you're already at your target operating margins by Q4, and I'm curious how much more room is there on the gross margin side. Is it possible to get to, say, 61% or 62%? And then on the OpEx side, I believe, Tom, you said that you would have the full realization of synergies in OpEx next year. And since you are sort of around $808 million, what does full realization of synergies mean in terms of either an absolute number or as a percentage of sales by next year?",108

We have said -- I know it's publicly disclosed early on when we closed the deal on -- in early February, February 1, that we target to exit fiscal '16, which is this current quarter Q4, at 40% operating margin. As Tom's guidance is showing, we're going to achieve that goal. Now is that our targeted end-state operating margin? Obviously, you hit it right, Vivek. No, that's not our targeted operating margin necessarily at all because we do see the operating spending in the current level is about $800 million plus, $808 million, to take a step down, especially -- particularly after we integrate our 2 ERP systems. As you know, classic Avago runs Oracle. Classic Broadcom runs SAP. After the end of November, which is our day 2, what we call day 2 when we integrate 2 systems into 1, 1 database, 1 ERP system, we expect to run only 1 system. That will be a step down in terms of our headcount requirements, in terms of our support cost and obviously, an improvement in our operating cost structure significantly. And that will come through, obviously, in fiscal '17 and which will then give our operating margin a further lift up, without due consideration to further expansion of our gross margin, which as you have seen over the last 2 or 3 quarters, it's likely to continue.",241

In the past, your seasonality has changed substantially in the January quarter.

Our seasonal -- the sharper seasonality in -- of the past when it was just classic Avago would probably have reduced simply, if nothing else, because wireless used to be north of 40% of classic Avago's revenues. Today, wireless, which is a highly seasonal part of our business, even as it's grown bigger in absolute dollars, represents closer to 30% of our total revenues and that -- and it is -- the bigger portion of it, the 70%, representing networking, enterprise storage and industrial, as you well know, are extremely stable, almost like to say predictable businesses. So it certainly have modulated down very well, volatility of our revenue seasonally. And so Q1, we don't give forecast, but we fully expect it to be not as volatile as perhaps it might have been 2 years ago.",141

And by the way, Qumran and Jericho are similar in some ways, different specific end application, but the Jericho ramp is just -- has just started. Tomahawk was about 6 months earlier, 3 to 6 months earlier. But again, many of these products have fairly been -- wired could have more extended life cycle. So I would say definitely, even Tomahawk is less than 40% of the way, maybe less than -- maybe no more than 1/3 of the way.

We continue to make conversion from 6- to 8-inch, and that's ongoing. And it depends on what frame of reference you're using in terms of how much we're adding, but it's approximately 50% at this point. I'd keep in mind though, if we talk about CapEx more broadly, the main reason at this point for the uptick is in a campus expansion strategy. We're moving from leasing buildings to buying and owning buildings, which drops our overall cost of inhabiting those campuses. So that's a key driver. The second key driver is we're also moving to consign testers. We're no longer leasing testers. We're actually spending money to own our testers and consigning to RCMs. Those are the 2 big drivers of the uptick in CapEx.",129

And as my follow-up, I had one on gross margins.

And each time we guide, we guide from what we've actually seen. We try not to guide from what we have not seen simply because gross margin is, as you put it, a lot of puts and takes. But as Tom touched on earlier, highlighted in respect to CapEx, we are taking -- we are actually -- we have initiatives on hand to actually improve our gross margin not just because of product mix but also the sheer fact that, for instance, in wireless, moving to 6- to 8-inch, increasing CapEx, reduces our cost of sales quite dramatically in our wireless business. Going from leasing testers -- and we use a whole lot of them in -- for semiconductor ICs, to owning the testers on a whole -- on a fairly substantial basis is also driving our cost of material -- cost of purchase material significantly down. And all these actions are ongoing and all these actions are continuing to proactively reduce our cost of sales and expand our gross margin. And you'll see that. And but it's -- but rather than forecasting what it will be, we're basically using the current reference point and telling you when it's likely to move to the next quarter.",241

But as you probably may know, the ASIC business, especially the high-end ASIC business, where one -- where your customer is requiring technology to where -- is pushing the limits of technology, be they SerDes, bandwidth, or be they IP in embedded processing that has very low power, very high performance and features -- IP features like that, it's not a business one gets into on an overnight basis. And your question is correct, it's a long-term basis, simply because first, you've got to get -- you have to have the strength of the IP portfolio, the capabilities, which we have in plentiful supply, if you don't mind my saying that. Number one, that's only a necessary condition. It's not even a sufficient. The sufficient one is that you are able to execute on silicon implementation. And you're talking about leading edge nodes related to foundries that have proven ability to deliver on those leading edge nodes and being able to execute your design well. And that comes -- the proof comes with the eating, which means you've got to have the confidence of your customers that you are able to do what they want you to do because if you don't, they are screwed, literally, simply because their road map depends on it. So they're not about to rush into any new opportunity even on a price, even on whatever nice stuff it is just because on the say so that might happen. It takes a long time. It's almost a catch-22. You want to get into this business, be it leading-edge nodes as a foundry or leading-edge SerDes or intellectual property in silicon, you have to convince your customer you can deliver. And your customer is putting their future at least in one next generation in your hands. Which customer in their right mind would easily do that? They won't. So they want you to prove it, but you can't prove it unless they try it. So it's a catch-22. So it's hard. And all I'm trying to say it's very hard. It's a long process. We have, fortunately -- we are fortunate to be in a position that we are -- we have proven ourselves, and so competition will come. It always does, and we will deal with it as we always have.",406

You know that every new generation, which is almost every year, we change our process. We just not only change our design. And I said that before, too, in several meetings, several calls of this nature, ago. Our FBAR process technology -- our FBAR technology grows or evolves on 2 fronts: on process as well as on the design so that a band 2 FBAR 3 years ago doesn't look like the band 2 FBAR today. And that band 2 FBAR 3 years from now will be also very different what it is today. And it improves on power, it improves on insertion law [ph]. It improves on performance. And so we continue to invest in that, and it's part of the reason why we go from 6-inch to 8-inch not only to gain more capacity, but to be able to improve the process we put into it. And yes, FBAR a bought technology or even sold technology temperature compensated continues to try to improve.

At any point in time, sometimes we have a tough time knowing where the particular chip we ship ends up in. I mean, we ship a lot to OEMs. And as you know, many of the OEMs ship to -- could ship to service providers or enterprise or even to the cloud guys. And that's a part of it why we're not 100% sure. But to try to answer your question in substance, we're seeing a lot of strength, a lot of demand driven from service providers today as well as from the cloud guys. Enterprise tends to be more stable as opposed to strongly trending up.",137

We're now shipping Grantley, as you know, and next year, we'll start shipping against Purley. So some of the interconnects expanding capacity though is -- for enterprise, it's -- a lot of it is SaaS and slowly, very slowly, perhaps considering a move into PCI Express or NVMe potentially as old flash arrays start coming into the picture. But to answer the question directly, it moves very slowly. Most enterprise today are still driven on SaaS.",147

Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a very transformational year for our company as we complete the acquisition of Broadcom Corporation. This acquisition, the -- and integration significantly increased our scale, added 7 businesses to Avago's existing portfolio of 12 businesses and roughly double revenue.
Since closing the acquisition at the start of our second fiscal quarter, we have made great strides in integrating classic Broadcom. As you may recall, going into the Broadcom acquisition, we had introduced an operating model targeting 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin that we had expected -- planned, I should say, to progress over the long term. I'm very pleased that we were able to make good progress with this target in fiscal 2016, and in fact, since closing the acquisition February 1, 2016, we have driven significant improvement in product margin and spending and exited -- and in fact, exited the fiscal year, exceeding this long-term target. More recently also on November 28, we had also made good progress on another major milestone with the integration of the Avago's and Broadcom's financial reporting systems.
Looking at 2017 and beyond. We expect our business to be continuing to be sustainable and in fact, becoming much more profitable. We are raising our long-term operating margin target to 45%, a significant increase from our prior model. We expect to drive to this long-term target through a combination of the full realization of material cost synergies and operating leverage on a larger scale. Reflecting expected improvement in profitability, we announced earlier today a doubling of our dividends. We are comfortable that our projected free cash flow generation will support this significantly higher return to shareholders while still preserving flexibility on our balance sheet for future M&A opportunities. As and when these new M&A opportunities materialize, they will enable us to further increase capital returns to shareholders.
Let me now turn to a discussion of what happened in the fourth quarter. We delivered strong results for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 with revenue of -- with revenue at $4.15 billion, up 9% sequentially. This result was at the top end of our guidance, primarily due to better seasonality from our wireless and enterprise storage segments. Earnings per share of $3.47 grew by 20% sequentially.
Talking about wired, our largest segment. In the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $2.08 billion, meeting expectations totally, and the wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment during the quarter was up slightly on a sequential basis. We benefited from increased demand for networking ASICs into data centers as well as strong fiber optic shipments into access and metro networks.
Our recently launched Jericho standard product line that target aggregation and edge routing applications continue its ramp during this quarter. We were also able to address the supply chain constraints we experienced in the prior quarter, allowing us to catch up to customer demand in our set-top box business. As we look to the first quarter for our wired segment, despite expected declines -- seasonal declines, I should say, in broadband carrier access and set-top box businesses, we anticipate continuing growth in fiber optics and strong increased demand from several cloud data center operators, which will keep our wired revenue in total at least flat sequentially.
Moving on to wireless. In the fourth quarter, wireless revenue came in at about $1.35 billion, and the wireless segment represented 32% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up 34% sequentially, a bit stronger than expectations. Growth was primarily driven by the full ramp of the new phone generation at our North American smartphone customer, further enhanced by an increase in Broadcom's cellular RF content and wireless connectivity content in this new generation of phones. 
We made great progress in relieving FBAR filter capacity constraints we experienced in late 2015. Over the course of 2016 fiscal year, we were able to increase FBAR filter capacity in our Fort Collins fab by approximately 50%. This increase was enabled by our new 8-inch wafer manufacturing process that came online with very good yields. As we look forward, we intend to add more capacity by continuing to convert existing 6-inch lines to 8-inch lines. This very capital efficient conversion approach will allow us to theoretically add another 70% of capacity over our existing 6-inch footprint within Fort Collins fab over the next few years. Because of this, we no longer need to keep the idle facility we had purchased in 2005 in Eugene, Oregon as a backstop pending the outcome of this 6- to 8-inch capacity expansion.
Turning now to our projection for first quarter -- fiscal 2017. Similar to last year, we expect a seasonal decline in demand and expect our wireless revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-teens on a percentage basis at least. Turning to enterprise storage, which is going through something of a resurgence that we expect will continue into the first quarter fiscal 2017. In the fourth quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $561 million, and this segment represented 14% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 6% sequentially and came in better than expectation. We benefited from the strengthening demand, both for our HDD, hard disk drive, and RAID host bus adapter products.
Looking into the first quarter. We expect the strength in the storage end market to continue to show momentum and drive enterprise storage revenue growth to 20% on a sequential basis. We're expecting growth from all our enterprise storage products. In particular, we're expecting a strong ramp in shipments of our custom flash controllers for SaaS enterprise solid-state drives that are increasingly being used in place of high-performance hard disk drives in data centers.
Finally, let's move on to our last segment, industrial. In the fourth quarter, industrial segment revenue came in at $162 million, down 20% sequentially. This segment represented 4% of our total revenue as expected, reduced shipments sharply into our channel as we headed towards this seasonally weaker end of the calendar year. Industrial product resales did decline but only in the mid-single digits sequentially, resulting in a sharp reduction in our channel inventory. Accordingly, as we look into first quarter, we plan on rebuilding depleted channel inventory and anticipate increasing shipments to our distributors. As a result, we expect revenue in first quarter from our industrial segment to increase sequentially in the mid-single digits.
In summary, after a strong close to our fiscal year 2016, we expect a solid start to fiscal 2017, as the demand environment for our entire portfolio of products continues to be very firm. In fact, we expect in the first quarter to largely offset the seasonal decline in wireless revenue through sustained strength from wired products benefiting from growth in cloud, broad strength in enterprise storage and a recovery in industrial.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 financials.",1166
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2016",2016-12-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3342.0,1113228.0,46202566.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.
Let me start by providing some comments on our long-term operating model and update on our capital allocation return strategy. As Hock highlighted, the integration of classic Broadcom with Avago is going very well, and we have made rapid progress towards achieving our original target operating model objectives. Looking forward to a fully integrated Broadcom, we recently announced an increase in our long-term target operating margin from 40% to 45%. We expect to make progress toward the new operating margin target through a combination of operating leverage driven by long-term revenue growth, which we continue to target at approximately 5% per year and the full realization of acquisition-related cost synergies from the Broadcom acquisition, all while maintaining a significant investment in research and development. In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Brocade, which we expect to complete in the second half of fiscal 2017. We expect that Brocade's Fibre Channel SAN Switching business will generate approximately $900 million in EBITDA by fiscal '18.
Turning to our balance sheet. We currently intend to maintain liquidity from cash on hand of approximately $3 billion to cover expected working capital needs and projected annualized dividends. As we have discussed in the past, we expect to continue to target gross leverage of approximately 2x EBITDA as long as the cost of that leverage remains attractive. Given our current EBITDA run rate, we don't intend to pay down additional debt going forward beyond the amortization obligations in our loan agreements.
Finally, long term, we expect CapEx to run at about 3% of net revenue, consistent with our largely fabless business model. However, you'll see for fiscal 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing test equipment to consign to contract manufacturers to support classic Broadcom businesses. In summary, as we reflect on all of this, we are comfortable that we can generate long-term free cash flow margins of better than 35%.
Turning to M&A and as Hock highlighted in his opening remarks, as we look at the landscape versus the scale of our projected free cash flow generation, we feel that we have reached the point where it makes the most sense to return a more meaningful portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. The substantial increase in our dividend announced today is the first step. Long term, we plan to target aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. Given our free cash flow generation, we believe that this will also allow us sufficient balance sheet flexibility to pursue opportunistic acquisitions that are consistent with our proven business model.
One note on the dividend, our board has decided to set dividend policy and the projected quarterly dividend amount for the full fiscal year rather than on a quarter-by-quarter basis as it did previously. However, the declaration and the payment of any particular quarterly dividend, if any, is subject to the approval of the board at the time of distribution.
Now looking below the operating line, I want to pause for a minute to provide you a quick update and some color on our tax situation. As you are aware, we're a Singapore company, and our IP is predominantly located in Singapore pursuant to our agreement with the Singapore government. When we acquired classic Broadcom, we intended to align the acquired operations with classic Avago's existing processes and structure as that structure has demonstrated long-term sustainability and relatively higher flexibility to deploy cash globally. This integration of IP occurred in the first quarter of fiscal '17.
As a result of acquisition accounting at the time we closed the Broadcom acquisition, we established a deferred tax liability on our balance sheet associated with the potential tax liability from our planned IP integration. This tax liability will only become payable upon the actual distribution of any earnings resulting from integrating the IP and may be partially offset by any qualifying tax credit and deductions available to us at the time of distribution. We expect to distribute these earnings over several years. The payment of these cash taxes will be in addition to the cash taxes that we pay on our regular operations and will, over time, reduce the deferred tax liability that you see on our balance sheet today. As a result, in fiscal 2017, we expect to pay approximately $400 million in cash taxes, which will include the impact of cash taxes, if any, associated with the IP integration.
With that, let me quickly summarize our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $4.15 billion, growing 9% sequentially. Foxconn was a greater than 10% direct customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60.8%, about 30 basis points above the midpoint of guidance primarily due to better-than-expected operational efficiency.
Turning to OpEx. R&D expenses were $666 million, and SG&A expenses were $137 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $803 million, slightly below guidance, reflecting the benefits from the ongoing realization of acquisition-related cost synergies offset by higher bonus accruals due to higher profitability. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.72 billion and represented 41.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $73 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected net income. Fourth quarter interest expense was $106 million, and other income net was $9 million. Fourth quarter net income was $1.55 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $3.47. Our share-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter was $208 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 48 days, a decrease of 4 days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.4 billion, an increase of $92 million from the beginning of the quarter. I would note that the starting inventory for the quarter included the impact of $86 million of step-up charges to reflect the impact of purchase accounting. However, our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of these step-up charges. Therefore, non-GAAP inventory days on hand reflect an aggregate change in inventory of $178 million in the quarter and increase from 74 days to 78 days. We increased inventory for some of our classic Broadcom products to improve operational flexibility to better meet customer demand.
We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $124 million in cash expended primarily in classic Broadcom restructuring and integration activities, including discontinued operations. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we spent $193 million on capital expenditures. A total of $213 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the fourth quarter.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4,075,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $785 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $73 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $101 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 446 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $210 million. CapEx will be approximately $330 million. And as a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for operating cash flow due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",1380

And so when we put that together and in light of the fact that we're very focused on the dividend relative to any buybacks, 50% made sense.",100

If there are interesting businesses out there that are actionable, we will consider and we will act prudently and appropriately.

And I guess, my one follow-up, it's very helpful to have the updated target of 45% on the operating margin. If I pull that together with the last couple of quarters where you've nicely beaten the gross margin side of the equation, gross margin wasn't mentioned in the levers you're going to use to get to that 45% operating margin, so I just wondered what your thoughts are on the -- at least the direction of gross margin going forward.",81

I did mention it. And what -- a key part of our realization of a benefit to all this, in particular on gross margin, is our gross margin continues to expand. You have seen that since we -- since February 1 this year quarter-after-quarter, and we continue to expand even as we guide Q1 fiscal '17. Q4 fiscal '16 was 60.8% gross margin. We're getting it up to 61.5%. If you look at it closely, we're stepping up. We weren't trying to tell you that's a long-term trend. We have been stepping it up about 50 basis points every quarter sequentially, and the benefit -- and the reason why that's coming from is simply because very simple. We're getting synergies from material costs. Tom talked about investing CapEx into testers, a lot of testers of our silicon-based products. These are very expensive testers. We're talking investing $200 million on a lot of testers because we believe we have a more efficient way of doing it. We do our testing through consignment of our test equipment, which we are adapting on. Basically the idea and the whole thing to all that is we're doing -- we're getting a lot of synergies on material costs, not just on our SG&A line.",215

We have seen this product been very, very sustainable with our customers, been very, very strategic to a lot of our OEM customers and continuing to be that way. We continue to invest a lot in those areas that we particularly find them to be very, very core and sustainable. And we haven't spent on any investment there, and we are seeing it pay back a lot. And by the way, when I say investments, it's not just hardware. We're investing a lot in firmware, software and support.

But overall, for wireless, we expect Q2, as always, to be a -- to be almost, I call it, the bottom of the seasonality. What's very nice for us right now is the strength that I purposely indicate to you guys in my remarks, opening remarks, in our wired. And a strong recovery now is on early recovery in bookings on our broadband set-top box, and carrier access in bookings recovery would actually then -- would actually help cushion that seasonality we expect in that March-April time frame, which is our Q2.

The answer is just timing of payments.

Q1 will be your high watermark for CapEx likely in this fiscal year.",65

It's just timing slippages of payments from Q4 to Q1 basically. But back to Oregon fab. Yes, I know there have been a lot of concerns, comments or chatter out there. At least I hear then from Ashish about why are we selling of this idle potential facility in Eugene, Oregon. As I said in my remarks, and you hit it right on, John, is -- and I said that right at the get go when we bought this fab. It's an insurance policy. That's the way I describe it. It's an insurance policy because we were in the midst of increasing our capacity in Fort Collins by taking all our 6-inch lines, which is an entire line group a year-plus ago, 2 years ago and bringing -- converting them into 8 inch, in phases but we're converting them to 8 inch. And we -- by the time we finish converting all 6 inch, we'll get a 72% increase in capacity refining [ph] for the expansion of the footprint, which is pretty cool, which will be pretty much what we need over the next few years, 72% increase. And our initial couple of phases of conversion, which has happened over the last year or -- 1.5 years has gone very, very well. Yields are up to normal. Everything is running very well. So we feel very comfortable. And in my usual way of making sure we don't overspend money, we don't want to hold on to a idle facility that we pay some operating expenses on, on an ongoing basis. In other words, I don't need the insurance policy anymore.",271

And if I do, as a policy, we generally don't try to break that in 10 ways [ph] because then you'll be torturing me every of this earnings call about what has this number gone then now. But broadly, it's not the size of HDD read channel at this point. Do we hope to cushion some of the long-term gradual decline in HDD SoC? Yes, we do. That's why we go into this because that has similar capabilities and designs that we transfer from -- and of our -- transfer engineers from our SoC to this area very nicely. And so we are seeing 2 streams of revenue in our, so to speak, our storage drive business right now. And it's just that in this season where flash is -- seems to be -- enterprise flash seems to be in short supply, we're seeing enormous demand from couple of OEM customers for flash controllers we do -- customized flash controls, I should add, we do for these OEMs that are used for SaaS-based enterprise drives, which are the high-performance enterprise drives.

We're still early in the ramp with Jericho and Qumran here. Port deployments, I think, by your cloud customers are still trending about less than 10%. From a silicon port shipment perspective, though, I think that the penetration numbers are obviously higher. So I guess the question is, where do you think we are in terms of silicon port shipment penetration for Jericho and Qumran? And then on the routing side, just sticking with that, is the team also benefiting from the data center routing port build-out via some of your ASIC engagements as well?",103

The 2 are running almost in, we'll call it -- well, not -- the 2 will be running in parallel down the road. You're right. Most of this routing program -- edge routing core or edge routing and aggregation to some – to a large extent, data centers now are using -- used to be using a lot of ASICs, which is great for my ASIC business. What we're also seeing is, in some of these cloud guys, they're moving to merchant silicon, which is Jericho, Qumran as you pointed, and that's early stage compared to the ASIC side. So we are very well positioned on the ASIC side, and we have good -- well positioned now as we ramp up Jericho in EDGE and certain parts of core route [ph] aggregation especially. And to answer your question, it's very early. That Qumran, Jericho side, I mean, is barely -- you say 10%. I'm surprised. I think it's a bit more than that at this point, but then, it could be data -- it could be -- we may be looking at different parts of different sets of data. But it's definitely not 1/3 yet. It's in the range of, I would call it, 20% to 35% of those parts available because there's still a lot of ASICs being used. But that push, that trend over the long term we are seeing is towards standard open merchant silicon. You're right. And we are seeing that especially not just on -- in the cloud, hybrid cloud Tier 1 guys. We're seeing that among the operators who are pushing for standard silicon, standard SaaS for their networks and data centers. And that's also putting a lot of pressure in push -- in driving up use of Jericho especially. But it's also interesting in the sense that many OEMs are now coming -- working with us on both sets in parallel, which is why I say there will be coexistence of the 2 approaches, an ASIC silicon for routing and together with merchant silicon.",354

It's happening a lot in the U.S. It's happening in China in spades, too, which is, by the way, a good way for us to sell our chips even to the low cost sensitive Chinese phone makers. They still need carrier aggregation in China. And those are very difficult chips to do, and we have the best performing chips. So we get a very good share in that even in China, where they're even cost sensitive. In other words, they have cheap stuff everywhere except the carrier aggregation chip, which is interesting. But in terms of the big flagship phone makers that I mentioned earlier, they have it all in spades. This is usually a downlink carrier aggregation. In another year or 2, we will see uplink carrier aggregation in addition, all towards saving infrastructure cost, base station cost and power. And that will be another lift. That's why I say, year by year, as I look over the next several years, that RF cellular permits that we develop and sell to those flagship phone makers continues to get more and more complex, more and more content.",199

It's more about targeting businesses out there that become available that are -- have a very strong potential to be -- to meet those criteria I mentioned about established markets, technology leader and very successful in the areas they are -- in the markets they're in, be they niche or mass. And if automotive is one, yes, we might enter in automotive, if there are potential opportunities there. But we don't stretch and go out our way to look at specific end markets where we want to play in.",178

We are not done with our synergies yet, especially on the operating synergies, OpEx synergies in below-the-line SG&A. And we will start having -- we are now running on one ERP system, which is great, which would be -- which would help us a lot in terms of headcounts and expenses to people running much more efficiently. And we will also see other synergies in other areas. That's in IT, workplace services that really [indiscernible] and a few other areas. And they all will come in over the course of, at least, the next 6 months, if not 9 months.",101

Just 2 quick questions. I think, first off, it looks like just based on modeling to the midpoint of guidance that operating margins could be about slightly north of 42%. I know you guys just talked about 45% as a long-term target. Going forward, is the -- getting to that 45% number, is it going to be more gross margin or operating -- or OpEx in terms of synergies?",77

We expect our long term, the integration rate 45% comes from, it comes from both places. As you see us keep expanding our gross margin, we see that continuing for some period of time. We will start to approach for the particularly product mix as well together with cost synergies and scale on manufacturing overheads as we cover -- as we broaden our product lines, scale our product lines over the same set of manufacturing support teams to come closer and closer to 65%. Our OpEx, R&D and SG&A will run closer and closer to 20% if it's not already there. R&D will continue to be at 16%, 17%. I think it's the basic thing. And our SG&A is hit a soft [ph] less than 4% now closer and closer to 3%. So you can see where 45% is. Now that's not going to happen in '17 yet, but it's where, over time, we will be able to drive this whole thing.",163

Next question, just congrats on the dividend increase. And probably not trying to push my luck here, but I would say, the 2 other factors that investors struggle with is the lack of buybacks and not including option expenses in the model. Can you just talk to your process around those 2 dynamics?",60

The -- on the latter question around the SBC, we certainly break it out very explicitly in our comments, in our results, so we think we're addressing that pretty much head on. In terms of the buyback, I mean, we've addressed this a number of times. We look at dividends as a more permanent return of capital, better indication of how we feel about our business. Obviously, we talk a lot about the sustainability of the franchises that we own, and I think that's consistent with our model.",92
