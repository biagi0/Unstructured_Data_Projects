At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Hock. Hock?",245
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3322.0,263263.0,13129671.0,Presenter Speech,Hock Tan,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent -- some our recent business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of the first quarter financial results.
Now as you may have seen from our earnings announcement just out, revenue for the quarter of Q1 fiscal '12 was at the top end of our guidance at $563 million, down 10% from last quarter, but up 2% year-on-year from the first quarter 2011. Now, results for our wireless communication end market came in much stronger than normal seasonality, and our wireline -- wired infrastructure, is the same, wireline market was basically holding up in line with expectations.
The gains is very favorable to end markets, however, we experienced a rather down industrial end market. Now generally, macroeconomic conditions have the biggest impact on our industrial market. In particular, we are seeing industrial spending in China continuing to be weak. And that has also continued to impact demand from our industrial OEM customers worldwide.
As we have also discussed previously, we also have seen the impact from the flooding in Thailand, which has exacerbated our ability to ship our industrial products last quarter. But as we sit here today, I feel demand for our products has stabilized in this industrial segment, and in some situations, may actually be recovering. 
However, we forecast too that some spending uncertainty remains, especially in Europe and in emerging economies.
In summary, we now believe our Industrial business has bottomed, but we've only seen limited signs of recovery. 
So now let's turn to results from each of our target markets. Within our wireless communications target market, as you know, we manufacture FBAR duplexers, power amplifiers, some light and proximity sensors and optical navigation devices for feature-rich and smart mobile phones. We also produce RF components for wireless base stations. Here, sales from our wireless communication target market represented 45% of our first quarter revenues, and our revenue from this market declined 2% from the preceding quarter, but rose 26% above Q1 last year.
Now to remind everyone, seasonality in wireless for us typically means revenue decline in the low-double digits on a percentage basis in Q1. But we obviously, showed much stronger than typical seasonality in seasonal performance. 
And there's a good reason for that. We have been and will remain focused on picking programs where we can insert content, products with high content, that is very differentiated from most standard commodity life products. 
Clearly, we saw the benefits of picking the right programs this particular quarter, and frankly, we would have grown sequentially in RF if not for our OFN and base station for component business been down.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect this momentum to carry into what would have been another typically weak seasonal quarter. As a result, we expect overall wireless revenue to be slightly up compared to Q1.
Next, within wired infrastructure, as also you may know, we design high-speed SerDes ASICs as well as produce optical transceivers for enterprise networking data center switching in the high-speed computing application. 
Revenue for our wired infrastructure represented 29% of our total Q1 sales. Our sales from this end market declined 8% over Q4, but grew 6% from that of a year ago -- from the quarter a year ago. Revenues from wired infrastructure were in line with our expectation, right at the beginning of the quarter. 
To give you a little more color, we experienced here during this quarter correction in supply-chain among several large OEMs in this segment. Notwithstanding, we managed to offset these because certain of our larger OEMs showed strength in carrier routing and data center switching.
Turning to Q2, with supply chain pretty much normalized today, we expect overall revenues from wired infrastructure market to increase mid-single digits quarter-on-quarter, driven by continuous strength in core routing and increase in sale of our ASICs and proprietary fiber optics into data center applications.
Next, in industrial and automotive electronics, we manufacture and sell optocouplers, motion encoders and industrial fibers. Net revenue from this end market accounted for 20% of our Q1 2012 revenues. Revenues here declined 29% compared to the prior quarter and declined 31% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Demand continued to soften during this quarter, but we also experienced a rather dramatic supply-chain correction with not just our distribution channels, but with also some of direct OEMs and industrial OEMs as well. Looking at resale, however, specifically North America held up, Europe and China were down significantly. Japan was down only slightly and overall, worldwide resales were down just around 10% against, as I mentioned earlier, a quarter-on-quarter revenue decline in ship-in revenues, I should say, of 29%.
As I also said earlier, it does look like we are now at the bottom in industrial, even though we don't see clear signs of a recovery. Accordingly, Q2, we expect revenue for industrial to be up mid-single digits as we replenish some of our resale inventory, even though we do expect resale to remain flattish in this current quarter.
Finally, in consumer and computing peripherals target markets, we manufacture navigation sensors for optical mice and motion sensors for printers. Revenue from this target market represented only 6% of our first quarter 2012 sales. Revenue here increased 27% of a small base, no question, from last quarter in group 14% year-on-year. We expect this business to be somewhat down in Q2.
So in summary, let me say wireless was strong. Wired infrastructure maintained, and industrial was significantly down due to supply-chain contraction, and continuing weak macro conditions. 
Looking forward to Q2, we expect trends to remain much the same. Wireless and wired infrastructure continue to look good, and the macro situation's stabilizing, industrial should be flat to slightly somewhat up. In other words, okay. And as a result, we believe total revenue for Q2 will increase. Our guidance between 1% to 4%, as compared to Q1. 
So with that summary, let me now turn the call over to Doug for more a detailed review of our first quarter fiscal 2012 financials.",1025
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3322.0,263263.0,13129672.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before reviewing the first quarter fiscal 2012 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today as always, will focus, primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Revenue of $563 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 10% from last quarter and an increase of 2% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was at the high-end of our guidance. Revenue from our wireless and consumer target markets came in better than we expected, and revenue from our industrial market came in well below our expectations, as Hock told you. 
I've mentioned that revenue in the consumer market benefited from a discrete IP sale. Resales and distribution declined in Q1 relative to Q4. Our sales into the distribution channel were down much more than the decline in distribution resale and as a result of that, inventory and distribution obviously, has declined.
And while resale has declined in Q1, we expect them to be flattish to slightly up in Q2. Q1 gross margin was 50.6%. This was down from last quarter and essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was affected by a number of factors this quarter. The biggest driver of the sequential decline in gross margin was lower revenue from our high-margin industrial end market. Relative to our expectations, our lower margin wireless business was strong and our higher-margin industrial business was soft. This negative mix was partially offset for non product-related revenue, again the discreet IP sale that I mentioned. 
Additionally, we realized greater-than-forecasted cost reductions in our wireless business. And I'd just point out the potential negative impact of the additional spending that we needed to incur from the Thai flooding was largely offset by insurance claims.
During the quarter, R&D expenses decreased $1 million to $78 million due to tight cost controls. SG&A decreased by $5 million to $44 million, also driven by those same cost controls but additionally, driven by a reduction in our litigation expenses. As a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 14%, while SG&A remained at 8% of net revenue. 
Income from operations decreased by $28 million sequentially to $163 million, and represented 29% of net revenue. 
Q1 income from operations compares with income from operations of $191 million in Q4 and with $169 million in Q1 of last year.
Taxes of $5 million for Q1 were slightly higher than we guided at $4 million due to the jurisdictional mix of income. These results translated into net income of $156 million, which is down 16% from last quarter. Q1 earnings per share of $0.62 compares with $0.73 in Q4 and net income in Q1 of 2011 was $165 million or $0.65 per diluted share. 
Total share-based compensation in Q1 was $11 million. The breakdown of expense for Q1 includes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $4 million in R&D and $6 million in SG&A. In Q2, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $14 million, growing as we complete our annual equity grants this quarter. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
So now, let me move to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding came in at 50 days. This was up 2 days from the prior quarter due to the timing impact of Chinese New Year on our collections. Inventory came in at $192 million, which was down 1% from last quarter, and this translated to days on hand of 63 days. I do think it's possible that inventory could grow somewhat next quarter. 
And now, cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $819 million. We generated $139 million in operational cash flow. During Q1, we repurchased and canceled approximately 2.6 million shares and this consumed $79 million of cash. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $47 million, which was slightly higher than our expectations for the quarter. And this was due to expenses associated with bringing secondary facilities online after the Thai flooding. We expect CapEx in Q2 will be in the range of $52 million to $57 million. The sequential increase is due to the capacity additions in our wireless factory that we mentioned last quarter.
Also in Q1, we paid more than $40 million in annual bonus payments that were based on our fiscal year 2011 performance. 
And finally, on December 30, 2011, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per ordinary share, which consumed $29 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And just to round out the cash flow discussion, I thought I'd point out now that we have been returning cash to equity holders for 5 quarters that cumulatively, we have paid $115 million in dividends and have consumed $172 million in share buybacks.
Now let me review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Revenue is expected to increase 1% to 4% sequentially. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 50.8% plus or minus 75 basis points. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $124 million, which is up slightly from Q1. 
Interest and other is forecasted to be approximately 0. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $7 million and finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",947

Just given that sales are down close to 40% from the peak and at the same time, you're seeing signs of resales at least stabilizing.

The only thing I didn't say and it was purposely so was when we will snap back, the answer is, I don't know when, Romit. But we do see, and this might be clutching at straws I know people want to see what they see, there's no further deterioration. That's pretty clear what we are seeing. But we see some improvement, but is that big enough to say there is a snap back happening? No. So my answer is very limited signs of recovery though things are not getting worse in industrial.",99

But it is a very mixed market, what we see out there. Wireless business, as you -- and you probably heard me say, continues to be very strong in the way they booked. Our wired infrastructure is also very robust in the way booking is happening. Industrial, obviously, over the last 4, 5 months, have been very weak, 6 months actually, have been weak. It has improved somewhat but not meaningful enough and sustained enough for me to pass any judgment at this point other than to say, we're pretty sure resale is holding up at flat it's at the -- kind of at the bottom. Snapback or recovery is not that clear yet. And because the improvement we have seen so far in industrial, and we have seen it, it's really because inventory is down so low, people have to replenish. The question is after they replenish, what then? And the data is still not out there. But there is replenishment and we are filling this replenishment, which is part of the reason why we are seeing industrial this quarter, Q2, we're guiding to be up single digits, Mid-single digits. It is the replenishment. It is not necessarily in a fundamental recovery or snapback of industrial spending. Now that might change if emerging economies start driving, spending in industrial infrastructure one more time as they did in 2010. But that thing is not very obvious as yet.",259

You had a bit of a headwind, you had one customer doing quite well and that has some implications. With the sequential guidance, does that mean you’re kind of through those types of headwinds? And I know OFN's small, but you saw a big correction, is that coming back? 
Just some color on the different segments within wireless will be helpful.",71

But yes, there are more than one customer that is giving us that who are growth drivers for us, especially this current quarter, more than one customer. Though, yes, it's obviously, we're picking the winners fortuitously in driving our business. But to answer your second part, and that continues and a lot of that continued strength relates to the handset smartphone business on RF. The OFN business, which is what you're mentioning or referring to, it's no longer a headwind neither is it a tailwind. 
It's kind of flattish at this lower level that we had indicated last quarter. So it's neither helping nor acting 
as a headwind in this whole thing. It's purely RF in mobile handsets. There's also some benefit, but not very much from wireless infrastructure, but my best guess on wireless infrastructure this quarter is at best, flat.",151

It seems the preponderance if not, the vast majority would be from one customer. And then also several of your competitors already feel the dual band pad and they're showing that. Are you offering a similar part now or do you plan to offer one before year end?",71

So wireless last quarter, 
Ed, was I guess was 45% of revenue and that was up from the prior quarter. I think the prior quarter was around low-40s, 42%, I think if I remember the number right. And it's not any one customer, Ed, it's across the board. 
Pretty much any OEM that's shipping smartphones in the marketplace is buying parts from Avago. It's pretty much pervasive across the spectrum. So it isn't driven by one customer necessarily. It's very, very broad-based. And then your -- what your question about architecture, would you say that one, one more time?",119

We've seen several of your competitors on these calls show a product in the dual band pad, and new architecture that are being offered now or by midyear or so.

We talk about pad architecture in fact, last conference call or the one before that for us. Pad architecture, which is duplexer with power amplifier in a module is something we have been promoting for a while. And obviously, we do it with RF very nicely. And this is something that's been going on. Nothing rather unusual. Now there are some OEM customers who has a preference for it versus others who prefer to use discrete components. And we address them were they will and it fits in with us and so in terms of where -- one you mentioned is concentration of revenue in wireless. Today's -- our concentration is pretty spread out among many handset guys because, as I mentioned, we chase programs not on customers as on products, products that we can differentiate ourselves. And so we have a lot of our products scattered all over multiple phone makers. In fact, just about every major OEM and smartphone maker, we probably have at least one, if not, multiple programs today. And that's because of the nature of products. We have integrated modules, front-end modules, that has both power amplifier and duplexers already shipping in many customers including in Korea and a few other places. And we already talked about PADS as perhaps a twist on a derivative of that structure down the road. So it's really nothing new and it's not a concentration issue. It's just a fact that we have products and they are similar that's spread across multiple OEMs. And in programs where again, we try to price ourselves where the customer is willing to pay a premium.",277

If I think about 1.5 years back to your Analyst Day, that was sort of the commencement of what, at that point, was a 3-year growth runway for the wireless business, including the ASIC business doubling, and the optical business enjoying a transition to proprietary from standard. From that sort of high-level construct that we developed 1.5 years ago, can you perhaps give us an update on where we are in that growth cycle? And what new developments have sort of come up over the past 1.5 years to give you confidence in the continued growth of the ASIC business and the continued margin improvement in optical?",122

It continues to be tracking up, in our view, and not perfectly as we like to see it, but one never gets it perfectly in a sense that our optical business is probably growing faster in some ways than our ASIC business. But having said that, on a total combined basis, still trending along the same direction. What's also interesting is, and we said that 2, 3 years ago, we see this product, this segment to expand fairly fast in gross margin, product margin, gross margin. And that's exactly also what's happening. Revenue may not be as fast as we like it to be, but not far from that. But our gross margin is certainly running higher than our expectations 3 years ago.

And in some of those key customers, we provide components in the smart -- as you correctly hit on, smartphones. Components for the smartphones, as well as I should add in the case of Huawei and ZTE data cards. These 2 have been some of the -- among the 2 largest producers of data cards in the world and we provide them with specific components that are very, very high performance, very low power, which is what they like. And that's how we developed that strategic relationship for our products. And we continue to have that. And I won't exactly say that they're a huge, huge customer. Though to us, they are very important customers and strategic and the components we provide meets their performance specs very well. Again, same old strategy. Do we see ourselves as a mass-market producer in China of components in smartphones? No. We're not. We don't for instance, produce in 2G EDGE market at all, but we obviously, are producing in the UMTS, CDMA markets where China does play within Chinese markets. And we have also product offerings into TD, TD-LTE and to some extent TD-SCDMA. And those are the areas where we tend to play in the high-end phones, smart phones where they produce them. But those are not necessarily the high volume that sells in China. Those are more the high-end niche markets, smartphone markets either in China or exported by people at Huawei, ZTE into more developed countries.",270

I'm wondering, first of all, if you could split up for us the share of the decline that was due to the Thailand flooding. I think you pegged that at $10 million. But then did the 90% of the rest of the inventory correction or are you seeing also sort of a bottoming of end demand and that, that went down? And then second part of the question is what do you see your market potential doing given that industrial is so far off of its peak? When it does come back, do you a have different view of your long-term gross margin given where we are today?",135

Let's answer the second question first because I like that better, JoAnne. It is that, yes, you touched an interesting point. Our gross margin, as we always say, has been expanding year after year. Quietly but expanding and of course, overlaying it quarter by quarter. We have ups and downs based on seasonality and unique situations of each product. And you all know that, I know, industrial has the highest product margins. Wired infrastructure is somewhat above average now. And wireless is somewhat below average. And the mix of it comes out very interesting and with Q1 mix the way it is, yes, it is not as Doug pointed out in his remarks, a quarter where we expect our gross margin to be stupendously glamorous. And yet we come out mind you, okay, 15.6%. So if industrial starts snapping back or recovering, do we expect gross margin to be at a different plateau? Yes. We say that every year. And every year it comes in at different level plateau. It just happens a bit differently as we go through a quarter of the year.",185

Right. But that's -- but your point is saying it's -- it needs a reflection of phenomenon that year-on-year, we tend to improve our gross margin 100, 150 basis points or 100 or 200 basis points a year. Not the same every year, and we still maintain that model, 100, 150. Don't let any one particular quarter lead you too far astray because it just ends up above them. But the thing we find ourselves very pleased about is even in Q1's revenue mix, which is not entirely favorable for margin, we do manage to come in at a level that is obviously, at a different plane from say, what it was if the same mix were in place 2 years ago. That is for sure. Then coming back to your first part of the question on industrial revenue and mix and all that, the bottom line is, we do not believe we lost market share at all. Now as you know in industrial, most of our revenue goes in -- are sold through distributors. To be precise, 80% of the revenue in industrial goes through distributors. And all the others item I want to point out is Q1, our revenue, which the shipped in, most of that's shipped in to distributors, dropped sequentially, almost 30% to be precise 29%. Yet our resale out of distributors dropped only 10%. So you would say the gap here, the difference here is all about reducing general inventory in the pipeline. 
And I might add, we did similar, the remaining 20% industrial, we have a similar positioning, the similar phenomenon happening on the distribution sitting in our direct industrial OEM customers. So most of it, not all, but most of that reduction, sequential reduction is coming out of inventory. But I should add, resale did drop 10%. So there was a general weakening of overall industrial demand from our perspective. That resale as we pointed out, and I'd like to, and obviously emphasize that in the context of this question, we have now seen it flatten and in the sense that we have about almost less or almost 1 month since the end of last quarter, it's more than flattened since Chinese New year. It has picked up slightly as Doug said, flat to up slightly.",388

Thanks so much for that extra detail. That really helped. And then if I could on the wireless side as a follow-up, so you had at least one major customer ramping up smartphones build this past quarter and you also remarked that you would have one cutting down their inventories, as they typically do at that time of year. So I'm wondering if the one that was ramping ramped more quickly than you expected or if the one that was taking down inventory perhaps did less of that. Or if there's a third factor involved, perhaps other OEMs arrest more quickly than you expected. And what does that tell us about the dynamics of smartphone builds for you guys throughout the rest of this year? Is this the early ramp that is going to flatten out or how should we think about the ramp up of smartphones you're in for the rest of the year?",156

To answer your first question, all 3, is my answer. All 3 things were happening is what you said. All 3 were happening. And not trying to be cavalier in a way in answering you. It's just that think of us as not your pervasive components supplier to all handsets in the world. We only supply in the first place to very niche areas, smartphones. Now you may say smartphones is growing very fast. It's still, what, 30% of all phone handset shipped out and that's all we supply. Then we do supply some feature-rich phones on where we are strong in CDMAs, CDMA phones we have. But smartphones is 30%. And in smartphones, there are areas in particular, certain bands of UMTS and 3G where we are strong, we supply and others we're not, we don't supply. And then there are some with different phone architecture that users -- PADS as I mentioned earlier. We had 1 band or 2  bands that we supply and those, well they do -- and those particular PADS that have those particular requirements using FBAR, we definitely supply. And there are others that don't, that make do with SAW, we don't need to bother supply. So it's a mix and match, it's a pick and choose and if we pick the winners, we do very well. And I guess in Q1, we picked a lot of winners. Q2, we expect to pick those same winners as the momentum go. For the rest of the year I'd like think we'll continue to pick more winners and losers so we'll continue to drive our revenue growth we expect for the rest of this calendar year because once you have that going, you keep going for a generation.",294

And part of it because there's a lot -- we have a lot of content on this. And I should say, if you look at it historic -- this past quarter though, it's a mix of both. But going forward, with the 8960 chipset coming in, the super chip set, the multi band PA that we have talked about previously, will probably drive a lot of content for us in PAs, more so than would be normally the case. So we see an increase of that. Having said that, FBAR abilities and FBAR based modules would still be a big chunk of it. It's just that there will be a rich or a higher mix of multimode PAs that drives it. By the end of the year, we might be back to normal where FBAR would become the dominant, especially with PADS running in.",158

And can you give us a framework for thinking about how or what determines how deeply penetrated FBAR will become in the market and maybe even specifically in the LTE segment?,34

It is, in fact, it the story of our life in terms of model. It's a very good representation. What it is, is FBAR is not used everywhere just because it provides much better, much differentiated selectivity performance for reception of signals. The only thing is it's priced higher. And so a lot of people don't -- a lot 
of old phone OEMs chose not to use it if their performance is not that critical causes and they trade it off by using SAW filters instead of FBAR. But where they like the performance and they like the power FBAR produces -- generally it consumes less power and the trend seems to hit it that way. And the phone maker can afford it, they use FBAR. Now there are some bands, some spectrum or wireless spectrum that makes it very important to use FBAR because the modulation schemes and the signals makes it very hot to use to allow SAW to perform well and one example is CDMA. The CDMA bands prefer to use FBAR just to get a minimum level of performance. Then in 3G, UMTS, certain bands like Band 2 also like well, in fact, require the use of FBAR. Then we start going to LTE, and as we move to LTE phones, LTE spectrum tend to be more tricky. And more than LTE spectrum are scattered all over the map in terms of whatever is available, especially in North America, they inserted LTE. And one example is, for instance, Verizon LTE, which is running at about 700 megahertz as you know. The Verizon LTE fits next to the public safety radio band, okay? And so it's important you don't -- one doesn't crossover to the other. And so selectivity of signals become important. You don't want crosstalk interference and therefore, using FBAR becomes more and more critical when you want to operate in the spectrum at a band next to a public band. And about as important, another example is in the case of -- as you all know, that occurred that example of LightSquared where there's interference with the world GPS system. Now if world GPS uses filters like FBAR, you can keep the signals up. So that where FBAR comes into very, very good use. And when you start using complex phones, smartphones for LTE, which have to be interoperable with 3G and 2G you get more and more bands stuck in together with Wi-Fi, you have a problem of what I call coexistence, which means interference of signals that operate very dense, very close to each other. Then you want to use FBAR. So getting phones more complicated, as they become smarter, they run in more bands, you start to need to use FBAR. So that's in a summary fashion, a long answer to your basic question, which is, is the trend heading our direction in FBAR and my question is, yes, absolutely. As you go into LTE more and more, the tendency to use FBAR becomes much higher.",507

No, I think we had a lot of content last year because of the unique nature of a phone that uses WiMAX. There were WiMAX phones last year, and has great content. And that was not obviously, a very sustainable phenomenon. But the sustainable phenomenon which is strictly -- and I consider WiMAX as L4G, which is the same generation of LTE. So forgive me if I seem to confuse you. But while last year, our strength in content was WiMAX. But the LTE side really didn't have that huge content. And the content, this second half of the year, one generation later will increase. To answer your question, yes, it will increase. As you heard an earlier question, you will increase to a point where you're starting to have modules that run with more and more with 2 bands simultaneously, front-end modules rather than just to give you 1 band. Modules that run with 2 bands and potentially even more down the road. So content will increase as phones, smartphones become universally more prevalent in a sense that you don't make a phone to run just one carrier by itself. You try to make the phones that can roam worldwide and run many, many bands, which increases the content and that just happens with the nature of LTE phones. And so, there is a distinct increase in content, not LTE per se but LTE as to the complexity of world smartphone and that enables people, I urge, to add more content.",271

Good afternoon, everyone. Now we're going to start today by reviewing our recent end market business highlights, then Doug will provide summary of our second quarter financial results.
Revenue for Q2 fiscal year was $577 million, which was at the midpoint of our guidance. This was up 2.5% from Q1, but only up 3% from the same quarter last year. While results for our wireless and wireline markets were in line with expectations, our industrial revenue came in stronger than we had forecasted. Nevertheless, year-on-year, industrial was still down 26%. In contrast, however, wireless was up a strong 26%. 
As we also discussed in our last earnings call, we saw stabilization of industrial market as we entered Q2. However, as March came around, we started to experience a strong recovery in China. As I sit here today, we believe the industrial market is now on a solid path to recovery with Asia Pacific leading the way, but Europe and North America continuing to lag somewhat.
Let me now provide more color on our end markets, starting with wireless. To put in perspective, the first half of our fiscal year would typically experience seasonal weakness. However, as you may recall, it was not that way in Q1 this fiscal year. In fact, wireless revenue in Q1 was robust as we ramp up volume in a major OEM. This held up in Q2 despite normal seasonality in the broader industry. As a result, year-on-year, our wireless revenue grew a strong 26% and in total, revenue from wireless represented 44% of our second fiscal quarter revenues of which approximately 3/4 were derived from smartphones.
Now looking to Q3, we do see 2 near-term challenges to sequential seasonal growth. The first is a constraint on availability of QUALCOMM's next-generation 28-nanometer fully integrated LTE baseband where we have been very well positioned. This constraint will limit our revenue for multiple OEMs this quarter and could negatively impact growth in Q3 by approximately $8 million to $12 million. 
Secondly, the ramp we enjoyed in Q1 and sustained in Q2 in a major OEM is now facing a significant product transition and could impact our Q3 wireless revenue by another $10 million to $15 million. Based on these 2 factors, we expect our wireless revenue to be flat, maybe slightly down in what would otherwise be a seasonally up quarter in Q3.
Having said all that, we expect shipments for the QUALCOMM's 28-nanometer baseband to reflect pent-up demand in our fiscal Q4. We also expect completion of the product transition and ramp of the next-generation product at that major OEM to drive fiscal Q4 wireless revenue growth again. And in fact, to prepare for this ramp in Q2, we invested approximately $40 million in process improvements and added capacity, and we plan to invest roughly another $45 million this quarter and reposition over $15 million of inventory ahead of this ramp to date.
Turning to industrial and automotive target markets. Revenue here accounted for 22% of Q2 revenues and grew 9% sequentially. But I must emphasize, this level is still 26% below the same quarter a year ago. As I mentioned earlier during the quarter, we saw the industrial market start to recover. China demand return in Q2, up over 25% quarter-on-quarter growth, and we expect the momentum to continue in Q3 driven by resumption of investment in power generation and distribution as well as for machine tools and factory automation. Spending in high-speed transportation has also resumed, though much of this spending appears to be benefiting largely indigenous industrial companies to date. 
Japan, North America and Europe have largely dependent on exports to emerging economies and are still in the very early stages of recovery due to a lag in their supply chains. As our OEM customers in these geographies recover, however, driven by China, we expect growth of our industrial revenue to accelerate to meeting sequentially in Q3. 
Moving on to wide infrastructure. Revenue here represented around 30% of Q2 revenues. As we expected, this revenue grew 4% sequentially, but a rather disappointing 5% from the quarter a year ago. While we continue to gain share in our service base ASICs going into data center switching, we're achieving this in a conservative demand environment for enterprise networking and carrier routing. 
Notwithstanding this rather flattish revenue, design wins were strong in Q2 as we continue to secure our next-generation programs in the enterprise for 40G, optical interconnect and more complex low-latency, low-power data center switches. We've also secured successfully design wins for next-generation core routing for 50G and 100G optical interconnects. But really what drives for short-term revenue is the conversion to 10G in networking and computing and should continue to drive sequential revenue growth low- to mid-single digits even in this uncertain environment.
Finally, revenue from consumer markets continue to be a small portion of our quarterly totals and represented only 5% of our Q2 revenues. This was a decline of 9% sequentially, flat from a year ago. Continuing this mode of harvesting our nonstrategic and mature products here, in consumer, we've decided to convert the business model of manufacturing and selling products to one of licensing designs and related IP, thus securing a future royalty stream instead of product sales.
So to sum up, in Q2, we grew 2% sequentially driven largely by industrial and automotive despite an uninspiring demand environment for wide infrastructure. For Q3, while we do not expect a typical seasonal uptick in wireless, we expect strong continuing industrial recovery to drive overall revenue growth of between 3% and 6% from Q2. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Q3 to be the transition into a strong revenue ramp in Q4 for our wireless business. Coupling this with continued recovery of industrial markets worldwide, we feel good about significant uptick in our Q4 consolidated revenue. 
Before I turn this call over to Doug, I would like to inform you of a recent material development. As you all know, we have been in litigation with TriQuint on several issues related to FBAR and BAW filters. We now have reached a settlement with TriQuint. Unfortunately, the terms of which are confidential between the 2 parties. One thing that I can tell you though is the settlement will have a favorable financial impact for Avago. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our second quarter 2012 financials.",1075
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 22, 2012",2012-05-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3789.0,314126.0,15290686.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2012 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today, as always, will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today, and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Avago Q2 revenue of $577 million increased 2.5% from last quarter and 3% versus the same quarter a year ago. This sequential increase was in line with our expectations, and as Hock reviewed, revenue from our industrial target market came in stronger than we expected. Revenue from our wired and wireless target market came in approximately as we expected. And then finally, for the consumer target market, revenue declined 9% sequentially, and this was a little bit worse than we expected.
In last quarter, we disclosed that Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer, and I want to let you know they continue to be one this quarter as well. Distribution resales during the quarter grew sequentially nearly double digits, while inventory at our distributors grew in the low-single digits. As a result of this, months of supply and distribution obviously declined. We remain encouraged by the trend in distribution resales we're seeing today.
Our Q2 gross margin was 51.1%, and this increased 50 basis points from last quarter and it was also in the upper half of our guided range. The positive gross margin result was helped by a favorable product mix from stronger industrial market revenue. 
So now turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses for Q2 increased by $1 million to $79 million. SG&A also increased by $1 million to $45 million. I'd like to point out that these spending increases were partially offset by spending reductions due to lower variable compensation accruals. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 14%, and SG&A remained at 8% of net revenues.
Income from operations for the quarter increased by $8 million sequentially to $171 million, and this represented 29.6% of net revenue. Compared to the $167 million for Q2 of last year, operational income increased by $4 million. Below the operating income line, we recorded a net gain of $3 million due to several factors, most notably from interest income as well as favorable foreign currency translations.
Taxes of $6 million for Q2 were $1 million higher than the prior quarter. Q2 net income of $168 million increased 8% from the prior quarter, and Q2 earnings per diluted share of $0.66 was $0.04 higher than Q1. Compared to Q2 of last year, net income was $3 million higher and for earnings per diluted share, it was $0.02 higher. And then just to summarize a little bit. The sequential increase in Q2 earnings was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and continued spending controls.
Our share-based compensation in Q2 was $13 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q2 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $5 million in R&D and $6 million in SG&A. In Q3, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $15 million. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
So now let me move to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 43 days. This was down 7 days from the prior quarter as we benefited from collections from shipments earlier in the quarter, the timing of Chinese New Year and the continued strong focus on collections.
Our inventory ended at $218 million, which was an increase of $25 million from Q1. Days on hand were 70 days, which increased 7 days from Q1. And as I stated in our last earnings call, we thought inventory would go up in Q2, which it did. This inventory growth is associated with higher revenue levels, builds to manage capacity as we head into a stronger Q4, as well as the purchase of wafers that enabled enhanced cost reductions from a specific supplier. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $954 million, and we generated $211 million in operating cash flow. We spent $56 million in total on new capital equipment purchases. For Q3, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $63 million to $73 million. At the beginning of the year, I told you our CapEx was expected to be approximately $200 million for the fiscal year. I now expect it will come in higher than that as we are adding incremental FBAR filter capacity to support new business needs.
During the quarter, the company consumed $6 million in stock repurchases. We essentially paused our repurchases during most of the quarter due to the timing of the annual shareholder vote on the authorization. After the shareholder vote, our Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $15 million of our ordinary shares. On March 30, 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per ordinary share, and this consumed $32 million of cash. The dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter, and since the inception of our dividend program in Q1 of 2011, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter. We also continue to evaluate potential strategic investments in acquisitions as another way of deploying cash to maximize the return to our shareholders.
So just to summarize my points regarding cash flow. Our Q2 cash level shows that our cash-generating capability continues to be strong despite higher cash outlays for capital equipment and increasing dividends for our shareholders. 
Now let me cover the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Revenue is expected to increase 3% to 6% sequentially from Q2. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51.5%, plus or minus 75 basis points. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $129 million, the increase being driven by incremental R&D project spending. Interest and other is projected to be approximately $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $7 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, if you would, please open up the call for questions.",1051

One is for the constraint on the baseband, what is missed out this quarter will reappear slightly next quarter, at least if not in whole, at least in part on the constraint of basebands to support it. In respect of product transition, the other issue, that's a separate issue. That one relates to 2 events. One event is existing product that is heading down, that is declining because of product life cycle, and a new product that will be ramping only next quarter. In between, that's the other spike of the product transition that we're talking about, and that will be translated to numbers. The number impact I mentioned of $10 million to $15 million for that product transition this quarter has necessarily no connection to what would be ramping up next quarter at all.",161

To answer your question, it's hard to break down between developed and developing, and it's not because we don't have the simple raw data or whether we sell products into Europe or U.S. versus selling into China, say. We have that data, but it doesn't tell the whole story because a lot of the large multinational industrial OEMs we sell our products to in Europe or Japan or U.S. reexport their systems or equipment into China into emerging countries. So the end demand really comes a lot from China, too. Having -- and so I don't -- splitting the 2 up makes less sense. But I will tell you this, the biggest -- the big driver in growth that we see here is in out of China right now, directly or indirectly. We believe it's out of China. And the second part of your question is, did end demand, alluded to by Doug in his comments about distributors resales and all that, we're mentioning purely resales. There are some large OEMs we sell direct and others we go to distributors, but we are measuring the strength been coming from resale of products to end customers, from distributors or directly to us to direct to OEM customers.",207

To answer your question more generically than anything else because look, I mean, I can't really tell you anything beyond 1 generation at a time in terms of specific design wins. But if you look at it from a trend point of view, smartphones going into -- going from 3G to 4G and having to support all these bands, all those major bands going around, content, we expect our content in those smartphones to continue to steadily increase quarter-on-quarter depending on mix of individual accounts and the phones we support in those individual accounts and the content we have. That might somewhat move around. But on a trended basis, it's steadily going up simply because there's more content of both duplexers and power amplifiers. But from a duplexer point of view, you can now integrate duplexers. So every new band requires 1 duplexer. So duplexer will linearly scale up volume-wise as more bands are supported by any cellphone. Power amplifiers do get integrated and may not scale up equally. But we do both expect content to increase from both sides, except we expect FBAR to increase faster from our perspective than power amplifiers.",194

And then one for Doug on gross margins. I think you're giving some hints about Q4 trends. I'm curious, as that wireless mix comes back up, how should we think about gross margins? I think the last quarter, October last year, when you had the big quarter for wireless growth. You had a few tens of basis points of margin compression because of the wireless growth. Do we expect something similar in Q4? And then structurally, Doug, how should we think about gross margins longer term if wireless continues to be the driver of top line growth?",99

But I think I've told you before that the wireless gross margin of that business in total is a little bit below the corporate average. So if that gets to be a bigger percentage, everything else equal, gross margins will pull back ever so slightly. Understand that what you also have going on here is what we see as a recovery in industrial, which is very good profit margin.

It's always been very lumpy or spotty, the best way to describe it. And we see that constantly. It's carrier spending, service provider spending. It's always been very hard to predict.

So obviously, in distributing inventory has come down pretty sharply since then. Now part of that reason for that sharp uptick would be the Chinese companies, the Asian -- and especially the Chinese companies, have during the industrial downturn in 2011, starting from early 2011 on to the rest of 2011, has brought down the level of inventory they were holding in the OEMs, not distributors, in the OEMs fairly, fairly sharply. So no surprise typically that they would be the first to bounce back on any increase in industrial infrastructure demand. The larger OEMs, multinational OEMs, I would say, as I indicated in my remarks, tend to have a much longer supply chain and would therefore lag behind those indigenous Chinese companies who probably are showing what I call the early indicators of a recovery in industrial demand over there.",192

But would it go to that level? I don't know the answer honestly. Would it even surpass? Don't know. Don't know when and what drives it. I'd tell you something new that is driving it is the fact that one more renewable is floating around now and that tend to be of a more permanent nature. How long that will last, who knows. And two is automotives, though they're more slowly, but more and more, automotives are going electric and hybrid. And that tend to use more of those -- most of our optical isolation products than, say, it had 2, 3 years ago. So maybe that might have an impact, but I'm not sure that's material.

So by the time they split up the business like for some of the components, I can't be differentiated, so they give it to my competitor.

But we are not taking a lot of it. Most of our CapEx investment, I want to add on to what Doug was saying, is really in FBAR. As Doug is saying, we're more in the FBAR demand now than we currently have capacity, which is why we are making all those big, substantial, accelerated investments to up our capacity and process, by the way, in FBAR. We did also early on make some investment in gallium arsenide capacity, but that's only to take up a relatively smaller percentage of our overall demand. Most of -- much of our demand is still outsourced for gallium arsenide.",115

No, we haven't changed our long-term business model because if you look back the last 2 years, we've grown 30% a year roughly in this business. What we're seeing now, I think, is a rather -- a somewhat, I hope, near-term change in thinking where enterprise seems to have held back somewhat on spending. But over the longer term, given bandwidth requirements, and you heard that story all over, we still see a lot of demand. And the best indicator of it is the fact that design wins are, in this area, are at an all-time high.

Hock, first of all, when you look at the wireless business and you're talking about the bands, as you look at a phone today versus a phone in 6 months and a year from now, how many bands do you see being incorporated into some of these world phones? And then concurrently with that, as you look at the bands for the FBAR, I know it's very popular in Band 2, but what are the bands do you see strong demand for the FBAR technology? And then a couple follow-ons for Doug if I can.",102

To give you, and if you can forgive me for that, because we are in this huge forum, and I'd be happy to do it separately on a different occasion. But really, what we do see is with LTE coming in, the phones have to be 3G and 2G, 2.5G compatible as well. So the number of bands you're including in those world phones, we get over 10, very fast, over 10. If you want to have a world phone that roams in multiple continents, easily over 10, which puts in a lot of content. And in terms of FBAR, you're right. CDMA uses FBAR. Band 2 uses FBAR and 3G. And in LTE, more and more of those bands in LTE are using FBAR for no other reason than that some of these bands may be difficult, like Band 2, for signal reception. That's why you need FBAR for better performance. But as you also have more and more bands crowded on the antenna on the phone, they start to interfere with each other; the issue of what we call coexistence. And when you have coexistence, problem for reception, your way to solve it is to put in an FBAR filter, and that's it. Just like you hear about this harbinger issue with LightSquared, a way to solve it, simplistic minded, is put in an FBAR filter. You immediately solve it. Of course, there's a lot of legacy equipment that you have to go retrofit, which makes it impractical. But for new equipment, put in FBAR and you literally solve that problem.",264

It depends on how the OEM runs their strategy on how they do their phone. Some OEMs decide to run their phones where they do a phone for a particular local market or regional market. So they don't need to kind of make all that bands into one phone. There are some who puts all the bands into a common phone so that they use a single platform.,71

Hock, you did talk about LTE and that is coming on board and it requires both filters and PAs. A little -- what I'm wondering though is both Skyworks and RF Micro have made no secret of the fact that their high-efficiency amplifiers, which are relatively new, are winning a lot of sockets. We've been out beating bushes, and they haven't seen a lot of competition. I know Avago's got stuff on the drawing boards. Do you expect to be competitive in that area before the end of the year? And then secondly, with regard to LTEs since most of these are going into LTE sockets, the majority I guess of LTE has been in 13 and 17 bands in the U.S. because of Verizon and AT&T. And given the frequencies of those, I think majority of the technology solving those band issues have been SAW, temp comp SAW given the size that the ball would be for that, how expensive would be. Is a lot of the growth that you're seeing in FBAR mostly in the traditional bands? Or are you -- do you feel like you're winning as much or more of your share in these new LTE bands given the, I won't say disadvantage, but the parity that SAW would have  cost in the lower bands? And then I have a couple for Doug, please.",231

Well, to answer your first part of the question, I really don't comment on my competitors' offerings, nor do we talk much about market share. If you noticed, Ed, really. My competitors, I'm sure, do talk about it. That's their business model. That's their prerogative. We chose not to talk about it. We do have competitive offerings, and that's probably as far as I would go. We do have very competitive offerings. As far as FBAR is concerned, yes, that is increasing demand for FBAR. And a big part of it, as I mentioned, is not just new bands that do require -- and that are difficult for single modulation to transmit and that because of that require FBAR versus SAW. I think that may happen less of an issue as much as the bigger issue. And you could see that in Europe in band -- in Band 7, Band 20 and 7, where it is an FBAR kind of requirement for that band. But more than that is, as you put in LTE and still have to run 3G, UMTS that is and 2G, you basically have so much signals of various types going through your phone. You have, as I mentioned again, the issue of interference or coexistence. And once you have that, the easiest way, the best way to solve it is to start putting in more and more FBAR. And that's basically the bottom line to it. And not to mention the ancillary benefits that FBAR does stand to bring to the equation. I know they don't cost cheaper, but it brings typically much lower power and very often, much smaller dimension, which in cellphones that are getting very, very crowded with other content becomes extremely important. So there are multiple reasons why FBAR get used, the price and other things.",306

You've given guidance that the wireless, and especially the gas business, a little bit lower than corporate averages. We've seen the last 9 months, some brutal pricing in wideband CDMA standard PAMs, which you guys are, by the way, the leader in, of course, on QUALCOMM's reference design. Is that guidance still hold if the mix doesn't shift towards some of the newer products given the pricing environment? And then also, in terms of the $15 million in inventory you said you built up in preparation for the fourth quarter or subsequent quarter ramp, is this finished goods inventory, you're building more wafers? And is it for a specific design, or you're building just general inventory because demand is going to pick up?",129

Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end market highlights, and then Doug will provide a summary of third quarter financials.
Now, revenue for our Q3 fiscal year was $606 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, and this represented an increase of 5% from last quarter but an increase of less than 1% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Now during this Q3, industrial was strong, driven by continued recovery in Asia. Wired infrastructure was modestly up. Enterprise was flat, but we were helped by strength from service providers. Wireless was down, below our estimate at the beginning of the quarter, because of product transition at one of our major OEMs.
Now looking into next quarter, Q4, however, we no longer have the revenue contribution, if you recall, from a consumer navigation product, which represented approximately 7% of Q3 revenues. 
In this Q4, we foresee, we forecast industrial and wired infrastructure to be down, which leads us really with only one cylinder running on turbocharge for Q4. I would like to point out, though, that the strength of this wireless will still enable us to grow modestly quarter-over-quarter in Q4. And if I look at our 3 primary target markets, excluding consumer business, our total revenue is actually expected to increase in the mid- to high single-digits in Q4 on an apple-to-apple comparison of, no pun intended, compared to Q3.
Let me provide more color on each of our end markets, starting with wireless. Second half of our fiscal year is playing out pretty much as we expected. Revenue from wireless declined 5% sequentially and represented 40% of our third fiscal quarter revenue. As you may recall during my last earnings call in May, I pointed out 2 near-term challenges to our wireless business in the third quarter, namely the supply constraint of Qualcomm's 28-nanometers LTE baseband chipset as well as a product transition cycle at one of our large OEM customers. These 2 near-term challenges were the main reasons wireless revenues were down sequentially in the quarter that is normally a seasonally strong quarter.
I also noted on our last call that we expected wireless to be very strong in Q4. As many of you know, we are very well positioned in Qualcomm's 28-nanometer LTE platform. The 28-nanometer supply has made some progress, as we have seen, as small supply becomes available to some of our -- many of our customers, OEM customers. Consequentially, we are now seeing demand for our RF front-end solutions associated with this platform accelerating with certain OEMs today.
In addition, we're now seeing the full benefit of the product transition at one of our large OEM customers. Our content at this OEM and volumes are also up significantly. And as a result, we expect wireless revenue to be up in the range of 20% to 30% in Q4 compared to Q3.
Moving on to wired infrastructure. Revenue here represented 29% of Q3 revenues. Wired was in line with our expectation at the beginning of this quarter, with revenues up 3% sequentially. We benefited from double-digit growth in 2.5G and 5G power optics used in core routing applications as we ship into major programs at service providers in North America and China. 
Demand for ASICs remained, and looking into Q4, we expect sequential growth in ASICs because of strength in data center switching. However, reflecting what we perceive as a hiatus in the implementation of core routing programs, we expect to see a temporary decline in our power optics, primarily tied to one of our large OEM customers. As a result, we expect overall revenue from wired infrastructure to decline high single-digits on a percentage basis for the fourth quarter.
Finally, turning to industrial and automotive markets. Revenue from this target market accounted for 24% of our Q3 net revenue. Net sales grew 19% sequentially, which was slightly better than our expectations, while worldwide resales were up again, growing 5%, and gave us confidence the recovery we saw last quarter is continuing.
As we expected, demand from China was strong. We believe government stimulus programs and a looser credit environment drove our distribution partners and local Chinese customers to more aggressively take product in the quarter. However, revenues remains -- still remains 17% below the same quarter a year ago. 
So China is recovering. Japan and North America were flat, but Europe remained a weak spot. Even though we expect resales to grow in Q4, given the robust revenue uptake, particular ship -- particularly our ship into distributors we saw in Q3 and a relatively soft demand environment outside China, we expect industrial revenue to decline mid- to high single-digits in Q4.
Revenue from consumer as note -- as a final note, revenue from consumer and computing peripheral markets represented, as I mentioned earlier, about 7% of our Q3 revenues, reflecting really last time buys resulting from our transition to a royalty business model in consumer navigation. And in this market, sales grew 47% sequentially from the prior quarter and grew 33% from the same quarter a year ago.
So in summary, as we mentioned, we grew 5% sequentially in the third quarter, driven largely by strength in industrial. For this fourth quarter, we forecast overall revenue growth of between 0 to 3% from Q3 caused the by the sharp fall-off in revenue from a consumer navigation business and, frankly, on certain demand in carrier routing, despite what is a very strong revenue ramp for wireless business. 
And again, to reiterate, without looking in revenue from our consumer business, revenue growth from our 3 primary targets will be projected to be up mid- to single-digit -- mid- to high single-digits.
With that, let me turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our third quarter 2012 financials.",978
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3723.0,348102.0,16840579.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this quarter. Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2012 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today, as always, will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and is also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Revenue of $606 million in Q3 represents an increase of 5% from last quarter and an increase of 0.5% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was in the upper half of our guidance for the quarter. Revenue from our industrial and consumer target markets were a little stronger than we expected. Revenue from our wired target market came in approximately as we expected. And then finally, revenue from our wireless target market came in slightly weaker than we expected.
And for the last 2 quarters, we've disclosed that Foxconn was a greater-than-10% customer, and they continued to be one again this quarter.
For the second consecutive quarter, distribution resales grew in the mid-single-digits. And as Hock described, the sequential growth of resales was primarily driven by strength in Asia, China in particular, while Europe remained weak.
Looking into Q4, we expect resales will continue to grow. During Q3, however, our inventory and distribution grew at a rate slightly greater than resales. Hence, we expect revenue into the distribution channel would decline somewhat in Q4. And then, just to remind you, the end market impacted the most significantly by distribution is our industrial and automotive target market.
Q3 gross margin was 51.2%, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance. This result was driven by a slightly negative product mix within the wireless target market as well as greater revenue from our lower-margin consumer target market.
So turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses for Q3 increased by $4 million to $83 million, while SG&A decreased by $4 million to $41 million, which left operating expenses unchanged at $124 million from last quarter. 
OpEx came in $5 million lower than our expectation a quarter ago, due to the timing of certain R&D programs as well as lower litigation spending. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 14%, and SG&A decreased to 7% of net revenue.
Income from operations for the quarter increased by $15 million sequentially to $186 million, and this represented 31% of net revenue. Compared to the $177 million for Q3 of last year, income from operations increased by $9 million. 
We recorded a net gain of $1 million in interest and other, primarily due to the interest on our cash balances. Taxes of $5 million for Q3 were $1 million lower than the prior quarter. The decrease was related to the jurisdictional mix of income.
Q3 net income of $182 million increased 8% from the prior quarter, and Q3 earnings per diluted share of $0.72 was $0.06 higher than Q2. Compared to Q3 of last year, net income was $6 million higher, and for earnings per diluted share, it was $0.04 higher. Earnings were higher versus the prior year, primarily due to lower spending. And the sequential increase in Q3 earnings was primarily attributed to the higher revenue.
Our share-based compensation in Q3 was $15 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q3 includes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $6 million in R&D and $8 million in SG&A. In Q4, I anticipate share-based compensation will again be approximately $15 million. And just to remind you, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
So now let me move to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 50 days. This was up 7 days from the prior quarter. The increase was due to the linearity of revenue within the quarter. 
Our inventory ended at $216 million, which was a slight decrease of $2 million from last quarter. Days on hand came in at 66 days, which decreased 4 days from Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $973 million, and we generated $128 million in operational cash flow.
We spent $65 million on new capital equipment. And for next quarter, Q4, I expect CapEx will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The increase is primarily due to incremental FBAR filter capacity to support growing customer demand.
During the quarter, we consumed $15 million on stock repurchases. And on June 29 of 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per ordinary share, which consumed $37 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q1 of 2011, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.
We also continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions as another way of deploying cash to maximize the return to shareholders. However, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculations regarding any specific acquisition targets or strategy.
Now let me cover the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.  This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. 
Revenue is expected to be in a range of flat to up 3% over Q3, driven primarily by growth in wireless. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51.25%, plus or minus 75 basis points. Operating expenses are estimated to stay flat at $124 million. Interest and other is projected to be approximately $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $8 million. Taxes are slightly up due to the timing of certain discrete tax items. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 253 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, would you please open up the call for questions?",978

You said the CapEx is going to be $70 million in the fiscal fourth quarter because you're expanding FBAR capacity. Can you just give us an idea of the magnitude of the capacity expansion you're thinking about for FBAR, perhaps over the next 1-year and 2-year period and also indicate what's driving the need to expand capacity?  Is it just one OEM? Or is it a broader trend that you're seeing in conversations with service providers?",96

I think we've kind of commented on this last quarter. We're on a path right now of doubling our FBAR capacity between now and, call it mid-next year. That capacity comes online bit by bit, but we're in the middle of doing the heavy spending right now. And we're investing in that capacity for the broad market. It isn't any one customer. I mean, certain customers do tend to use more FBAR than others, but we are investing for the whole market, Terence.",87

And then as my follow-up, I guess the question that I would like to ask is if I think about the $30 million drop in consumer and PC, roughly going to $14 million, my question is what's the gross margin of that?  Because if I were to assume that that's a licensing stream with a very high gross margin, then it appears that you're gross margin guidance in October for a 20-basis-point increase is conservative, even when taking into account wireless up 25% and wired infrastructure down mid-single-digits. So I guess my question is why are you guiding gross margins flat if we're to assume a much richer gross margin from that licensing stream in the fiscal fourth quarter?",121

There's a lot of moving parts in gross margin at Avago. We have our largest growth coming from wireless, which tends to be our lowest-gross-margin end market. That's a piece of it that's offset by the point that you're picking up on. I would tell you that that's not 100% profit in what's remaining in the consumer business. There are some costs associated with that. And then understand that each end market, gross margin moves up or down quarter-by-quarter. It isn't static. So things move around a little bit. And when you mix it all together, the 51.25% is where our estimate is coming out, Terence.",110

It makes all the sense in the world about burning some inventory, given what resales and sell-in did in the third quarter as far as your fourth quarter guide. But in prior quarters, you also talked about year-over-year, those revenues being down significantly. It still seems like they're down about 15% to 20% year-over-year, so I'm surprised you really think you have to burn a lot of inventory. Can you just talk a little bit about how we reconcile the sequential to the year-over-year, please?",95

Well, our industrial revenue is, broadly speaking, about 15% to 20%, still down from the same time a year ago. And so we still think that recovery has still some ways -- some possible ways to go. Having said that, I mean, the recovery is, as I pointed out, right now, as we see it, is very much limited in Central Asia in industrial, especially in China, where we see the strength of it. We see some -- we see flatness, not down, but flatness in Japan and Europe for industrial, and partly, maybe that's probably because things have gone down -- and they -- though they haven't gone down much in those home markets, but we also see the possibility of that -- some of those exports from those countries in Europe and Japan through industrial OEMs to China, too. And you're right, it's growing up. It is still improving. But as we indicated, it's growing at about 5%, mid-single-digits, we think. And against that last quarter, if you recall, we saw our industrial revenue, which we recognize on a shipping basis of closer to 17%, 18%, 19% sequentially. So we cannot think -- feel that our distribution market might be getting ahead of itself, and it might be prudent for us to kind of pull back. That's a forecast, obviously. And if, obviously, resale goes beyond the mid-single-digits we are forecasting for Q4, we might reassess and reevaluate what we do here. But this is basically our current thinking.",260

Hock, you mentioned Foxconn as a 10% customer. I was wondering if you could talk about Samsung also and just the broader context of how you think about the customer diversification, because October quarter is great. There is a big product cycle, but what happens a quarter after that? Or a quarter after that?  How long can you be sort of subject to all this fluctuation just because of these product transitions?  So if you can talk about diversification, if that is even possible, as you look out at the smartphone industry right now.",98

Let me try to address that. But to answer -- but to jump straight on, yes, we have a fairly broad customer base in wireless. We're pretty much doing business now with every smartphone manufacturer. Not every phone manufacturer, but every smartphone manufacturer. And that includes, by the way, the, obviously, top line -- the largest tier-1 manufacturers, including people like Samsung. You correctly pointed that. And we do a very good amount of business with Samsung, and they are very valued and very significant customer. But we also sell through tier-3 white-box phone manufacturers in China on a case-by-case basis, depending on the programs and when and the specific technologies they are using. So we are pretty broad-based. But you're right in that respect, it's a very interesting tiered market now. Very, very much a question of picking winners and losers, so to speak, in terms of OEMs. And we try to cover the full range with the products we have and the technology we have. And some customers really appreciate and are willing to, obviously, subscribe to our business model of very-high-performance RF components be -- and particularly our FBAR components. And some of them uses, I guess, front-end modules which pull along power, amplifies our power amplifiers, which help us increase volume. Overall, we -- but to address your question on the pattern of behavior, forecasting is always hard, but let me try to do that, draw some reference point by looking back to last year, the last 12 months. And typically, prior to the last year, what happens is in our fiscal Q3 is when we see strong seasonal uptick in the wireless business. Typical seasonality is end of the year, headed towards back-to-school and Christmas, so strong typical seasonality, up. And the continuing strong seasonality in Q4. And by that, I usually mean 10%, perhaps sequentially, maybe then mid- to high single-digits in Q4. Then Q1 will show a -- on the next Q1 following the fall will show a sharp drop and could be mid- to high single -- to even 10% drop. And Q2, from Q2, will be kind of flat from Q1, and the cycle repeats itself. And that used to be the case, say, 2 years ago, 3 years ago. Comes last year, we see a significant change in the pattern, in this whole pattern, and part of it is related to what you're pointing out, the way the market has segmented itself among OEMs and based on how those OEMs launch new products and the timing in which it launches. And what we've seen last year was, as we see now, is Q4, I mean, there was some seasonality in Q3. Q4 was a very strong uptick for us, in last Q4 -- not this Q4, last Q4. Q1 remained at Q4's level. And Q2 was pretty close to what Q1 was, flat at that high level. And then Q3 showed a sharp drop-off because of a product transition at a major customer. And Q4, as we see now, bounce right back up. So if I use, this, say, new trend, I would say following this new trend -- I'm not giving you a forecast, I'm just saying strictly following that new trend, Q1 coming up might be flat from Q4's level in wireless.",557

And for my follow-up, maybe one for Doug. Doug, as you think about these product transition issues that Hock alluded to, the fact that you're bringing a lot more FBAR capacity in-house, should we start bracing ourselves for a little more gross margin volatility over the next 1 or 2 years just because your largest customers do go through these product conversions, it's well known. But now that you control more of your own manufacturing, how are you reflecting that in sort of how we think about gross margins?",91

Vivek, there might be a little bit. But quite honestly, when you look at how we've come through this last transition through, we were building inventory in advance of a stronger back half of the fiscal year. We were building inventory in Q3 for Q4. And so we didn't have a big swing in utilization in the fab. Now maybe we were a little bit lucky this year, and that won't always the case. But we'll try to manage it that way, as best as possible. So yes, there could be a little bit. But understand still that 2/3 of our manufacturing spending is still outsourced. We are adding more internal spending, but there's still -- the vast majority of what we spend on manufacturing is outsourced, and that varies with volume.",133

And the price has changed dramatically based on the mix of product. Because, I mean, as you know, if you look at our categories of products, we have discrete FBAR; discrete PA, though that's not that big a volume except recently; and then we have front-end modules. And the prices on each are quite distinctly different. And that's a shift, obviously, based on the shift in architecture as we move on to new generations. So if I give you an ASP, which is content increase -- which maybe the answer you're asking for is content, but it depends on the phone we are using. To try to get to -- to answer your question, basically, don't know how to answer it,  but it's not an ASP push. It's more content, and the content is tied to an architecture that goes from maybe largely PAs to front-end modules. And that does definitely increase ASPs quite significantly.",184

Let me try to take them sort of some together. Well, as I mentioned in my -- as I respond to an early question, what we foresee, and it's pretty close, is that we want -- we obviously want to burn off inventory in our distribution channel in this current Q4 simply because we felt we shipped to much in the quarter before relative to resale. But if resale were to pop up stronger, we want to take advantage of the fact that we need inventory in the channel to maximize our return and maximize our share. So we might not be as aggressive in burning it off as we are postulating today, which we are. We are aggressively postulating that we will burn off a lot of inventory in Q4. That may not be the case if resales strengthen. And so it all boils down, really, at the end of the day to the strength of resale and the growth of resale. We are, obviously, forecasting mid-single-digits resale, which is something we have seen over the last 6 months in our business. And we continue to assume that's the case in determining the level of burn-off. So we might adjust that level of burn-off, which relates to our shipping revenues by -- based on that resale level, okay? And what was your second question again, if you don't mind repeating?",232

You hinted that you're increasing the capacity for Ball filters. Could you tell us what are you doing on the gallium arsenide side and also your views on whether there is room for you to differentiate on the gallium arsenide side as well?,51

Yes.  By the way, it's not -- we don't call it Ball filters. Just a small mint [ph] here. We call it FBAR just to differentiate somewhat a bit from one of our friendly competitors call theirs to be. But the basic technology is Ball, you're right. It's FBAR. And yes, we invest a lot on FBAR, because that's our very distinctly differentiated technology and process, especially in duplexing in handset RF signals. And we will continue. As Doug said, we're going to double our capacity over the next -- less than the next 12 months. By middle of next year, we expect to have doubled FBAR capacity. We have a year before that, which is this year. And we expect to fully utilize it based on demand we are seeing out there. So strategically, we think that's exactly the right thing to do. It is also a differentiated technology, which is exactly in line with our business model of providing that kind of products. In turning to one -- the point you have, gallium arsenide, we did announce about 2, 3 quarters ago -- 3 quarters ago, investment in a relatively small capacity in gallium arsenide HPD used for power amplifiers. In fact, they are used in the power -- used to produce power amplifiers we sell today. Most of -- many of which are in conjunction in front-end modules, we have our FBAR, but some discrete, like the multimode power amplifier we have been selling this year. To -- in answer to your question is there differentiation? There always is generation to -- in generation, based on mainly design, some process, but mainly design. But unlike FBAR, I do want to say to you, it's hard to make that difference a sustainable differentiation on power amplifiers, which is why our focus is really on FBAR. The reason we build that small capacity on gallium arsenide is that most of our requirements on gallium arsenide is right now outsourced through our foundry in Taiwan. We figured in the fall, second sourcing, security of supply purposes as well as to have the ability to tweak process, improve performance of some of the power amplifiers as we need to. That -- it's good to have a small fab in-house to be able to do that so that we can port that process over to our foundry. But most, by far, 75% of our demand, 80% of our requirements in power amplifiers will come from our foundry. And also we'll -- yes. that's about it.",425

Next question is about RF content in the handsets. You indicated that you're -- going into the next quarter, you're going to see a significant increase in the RF content. How much headroom do you have going forward? Do you think that are we -- your content is going to increase? Or do you see that letting out at some point of time?",64

Content does, in today's market on smartphones especially, will likely vary from generation to generation. And it would likely, given the trend or where the technology and industry is headed, will typically -- RF content in every smartphone will keep increasing. Why? Because of the fact that you increase the amount of functionality and capability of roaming with the same handset as you move up from 2G, 3G and now LTE. So there is that underlying trend. Having said that, depending on the phone manufacturer, OEM, a particular phone may have -- may not have as much content as phone from another OEM, simply because it depends on the carrier, it depends on the region and the band and the performance they want to make this phone. So it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a monotonic increase across the board as time passes on all phones. It depends on what particular phone program you're -- or we are designing and what particular OEM. So it does vary. It's -- my sense is that with among some of our tier-1 guys, customers, we tend to address the very-high-end smartphones which tends to lend itself to a lot of functionality, a lot of ability to support multiple bands. And because of that, the opportunity for us to increase our content keeps growing.",239

And how do you think things are playing out here? Where are you more worried? And how do you expect a recovery to look in some of the troubled end markets and geos out there?",51

I mean, our perception on the wireless side is -- on the high-end -- on the smartphone side, things to continue to look fairly strong, fairly robust.  Part of it may be a matter of -- fortunately, on our side, being as well as a strategic purpose in addressing more winners than losers in the smartphone area. And secondly, on those -- some of those OEMs we're addressing, our business model requires us to pretty much try to differentiate our products, differentiate in the sense of better performance, and better performance typically means more content in many cases. And we have the advantage of getting that in, especially in a situation where more -- in many OEMs, in certain bands in LTE, where the use of FBAR is increasing for duplexing for filtering. And so all that is good in the direction we're headed. But we -- as far as we see, that handset -- high-end handset market is still fairly robust. Turning to wired infrastructure, as I touched on lightly earlier, we see enterprise side, which is the large part of our wired infrastructure business, which is enterprise networking, enterprise computing and storage. We see that the market has been rather -- has been very flat, almost I use the word sluggish and flat. And that's been that way now for about 3, 6, almost -- at least 3 months, maybe even 6 months. It's not down, but it's not up either. And our overlay on it is a sector of the business we address, which is carrier routing from service providers, and that's a lumpy kind of business. We're seeing good strength or -- very a lot of strength on it, in investment in it in Q3. A big part of it is going into core routing, been using a lot of backhaul for wireless infrastructure investments, a big part of it. So we see that investment coming in chunks. And we sell a lot of content when that happens at very high margin, products of our fiber optics. And then on the end -- and then so -- but that's pretty much what we continue to see in wired infrastructure. In industrial, things have gone down a lot. Things did go down a lot late last calendar year and Q1, Q2 of our fiscal year this year and have since we have seen been on the recovery. The recovery has been very limited. As I said, we're very focused in Asia, and also been relatively slow in a sense that it's mid-single-digits if you look at it worldwide, and really what we see is China is probably growing faster than that, in maybe around 10% level. But the rest of the world is kind of flattish. So it's kind of been pulled up. When you average it out, it's mid-single-digits. And we cannot see that continuing for the next 6 months or so. Beyond that, I don't really know. But that's our view of the world as we see it right now.",511

Let me clarify. Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough. As you know, Romit, we -- most of our industrial go through distributors, whether it be Europe -- most of it, not all, but China, Japan or the United States or North America go through distributors, and we recognize revenue on a ship-in basis through distributors. On a resale basis from distributors as well as direct OEM business we sell to certain large industrial OEMs, the revenues -- resale, I should say, has been steadily recovering. As I say, worldwide, we see it around mid-single-digits for the last couple of quarters. So we're steadily recovering. Now a lot of that recovery comes from China, where we see resale actual consumption by OEM customers in China, industrial OEM customers, actually growing close to double single -- double-digits, 10%, sometime -- earlier on, it was even faster, it's kind of slowed down a bit. But it's still pretty okay. The rest of the world, be they North America, Europe, it's pretty flat. Even Europe was down -- has been down. Japan and U.S. has been pretty flat. So you average it out, mid-single-digits. And that's what we saw. What we saw last quarter, July quarter, was fairly -- was a continued recovery in industrial, especially in China. What we did was we replenished a lot of inventory, not distributors. And that's why when resale was growing last quarter, industrial resale was growing mid-single digits, we were growing double -- in the mid-teens. On a ship-in basis, what we're also saying, therefore, in Q4 is we're pulling back on that, and actually we'll lightly burn inventory because of what we are foreseeing is resale in industrial will continue mid-single-digits in our October quarter, Q4. But our ship-in to distributors, which is how we recognize most of our industrial revenue, will actually be down.",312

Most notably of which is, obviously, when you bundle -- when I say bundle, let me be clear about clarification.  We don't sell 2 discrete elements together. If we do, it certainly is coincidental more than preplanned. Because the customer, the OEM customer can design and have a duplexer, which is what an FBAR is, quite differently and laying it out there from designing in a power amplifier in that discrete element. What we do is many customers in architecting their circuit of their handsets would find it beneficial, and we totally agree. We find it beneficial that you put a power amplifier and a duplexer on the same -- of handling the same spectrum, the same band, in a single package.  They call it a front-end module. And it gives a lot of flexibility in design. We'd like to believe by matching the duplexer with a power amplifier ourselves, we optimize yield by optimize performance itself. And of course, for us, it's increased content. It doesn't necessarily improve our gross margin -- operating margin. In fact, usually it doesn't, as opposed to selling discrete FBAR. But it definitely increase the content, and it definitely, in our minds, improve design flexibility for the OEM customer.",215

It's very hard -- again, it's a very hard question to answer, because not every LTE phone would use FBAR. First of all, it depends on the bands. Certain bands are more harder for signals to receive, which is what a lot of the FBAR filters do. And so it tends to favor the use of FBAR. But then at the end of the day, depending on the OEM manufacturer, how much -- how important is it to them strategically philosophically that they want superb performance?  And because buying an FBAR will require them to pay a premium, typically. So they may choose not to. So it gets rather subjective on what -- who uses FBAR versus who doesn't.",125

See, our products go into a very specific area in carrier routing. We're not that much in edge routing. We are very much in the core routing side. So you're really talking about few OEM customers who do core routing. And just as few service providers who use those kind of throughput -- core routing throughput in their networks, especially in backhaul. So yes, it gets very lumpy, necessarily. But it's very substantial and very profitable but very lumpy. So you're right, I mean, you read -- even -- as you say, you read the Cisco remarks, it's hard to figure from that how it translates to our fiscal outlook. All I can tell you is what we saw last quarter, which was pretty good, and what we feel is likely to happen given how strong it is last quarter, in this current Q4.",166

Good afternoon, everyone, we're going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights, and then Doug will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results.
Revenue for Q4 fiscal year was $618 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This represented an increase of 2% from last quarter but a decrease of 1% from the same quarter a year ago. However, if we just look at our 3 primary target markets, revenue from those markets grew 8% sequentially on an apple-to-apple comparison basis. For the full fiscal year 2012, revenue was $2.4 billion, which represented an increase of 1% from fiscal 2011. Essentially here, a 20% increase in our wireless business was offset largely by a 23% decline in industrial revenues. Wired infrastructure remained relatively flat.
Back to Q4 results. Wireless was very strong, driven by simultaneous product ramps at 2 of our large smartphone OEM customers. While there was certain bright spots in wired infrastructure, wired revenue was down due to largely weak call routing spending with service providers. Industrial was also down below our estimate at the beginning of the quarter, here though is because our distribution partners reduced inventory levels. Looking forward to Q1, wireless demand continues to be strong. However, we expect that continued supply chain contraction in industrial and the continued hiatus in call routing spending will result in a sequential decline in revenues over all. Let me now provide more color on each of our end markets.
Starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless came in at the upper end of our expectations, growing 30% sequentially. This sequential strength was driven primarily by product ramps at 2 large OEM customers. I guess I will let you figure out who those are. We also benefited from seasonal demand from selected smartphone makers in China and Japan. And this particular strength resulted in a mix -- a shift, I should say, a mix shift in our revenue mix with wireless increasing to 51% of total revenue for Q4.
Looking at Q1 fiscal 2013. Follow-on demand from our 2 major smartphone OEM ramps remain strong. In addition, we're continuing to see demand from certain other smartphone OEMs as it's pretty normal at this time of the year, as they launch multiple high-end smartphone programs to compete against each other. The upping in demand is also helped a lot by the proliferation of LTE capability in these platforms, and the strength of our FBAR products offering, which now supports 15 LTE frequency bands, is supporting this very well. We, therefore, expect overall wireless revenue to be virtually flat in Q1 despite what would normally be a seasonally weaker quarter.
Stepping back here for a second. I'd like to add, we have, as a company, cumulatively invested, or are currently investing, approximately $300 million into putting in place additional FBAR capacity. We, in fact, from 2011 to the end of 2013, fiscal 2013, we expect to quadruple our FBAR capacity driven pretty much by our expectation of strong customer demand. The growth in FBAR, as a key point here, will improve our wireless gross margin going forward. 
Moving on to wired infrastructure. Revenues here came in slightly better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, notwithstanding, revenue sequentially declined 8%. We did benefit from double-digit growth of our ASIC business shipping into data center switching. However, the pullback in our call routing business at one of our communications, OEM customers particularly, more than offset the strength in the ASIC business. And looking forward into Q1, we expect wired revenue to continue to decline around low -- high-single digits, low-double digits on a percentage basis, caused pretty much by the continued hiatus in demand in call routing from service providers. 
Turning to industrial and automotive. Net sales here declined 11% sequentially due to inventory, correction, in the supply chain during Q4 fiscal '12. On the other hand, we believe industrial demand has bottomed and demand continues to be, in fact, to be largely flat and lightly, gradually improving going forward. Looking at Q1, OEM demand for industrial fiber and LED products in particular has been picking up and continues to do so. We expect global resales in industrial to continue to be flat during this holiday season. However, we do expect to see contraction in distribution supply chain worldwide, therefore, driving industrial revenue to decline low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared to Q4. 
With this as background and in summary, I will just add, we grew to 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter driven primarily by strength in wireless. Q1, wireless demand remained steady, however, supply chain contraction in industrial and weak call routing spending will drive our overall revenue to decline between 5% to 9% as compared to Q4. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financials.",827
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2012",2012-11-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3531.0,393275.0,18661771.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay, thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today, as always, will focus primarily on our non-GAAP numbers. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Revenue of $618 million in Q4 represents an increase of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 1% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was essentially in line with our guidance for the quarter. Revenue from our wireless target market came in at the upper end of our expectations. Revenue from our wired target market came in approximately as we expected, maybe a little bit better. And then finally, as Hock took you through, revenue from our industrial target market was a little weaker than what we thought a quarter ago, and that was driven by a contraction in our supply chain. 
For the last 2 quarters, we disclosed that Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer and when we file the K, you'll see that they continue to be one again this quarter. We saw the third consecutive quarter of growth in distribution resales in our 3 primary target markets. However, at the same time we saw resales improve, we also saw distribution inventory fall. This dynamic is the main reason we saw our industrial market revenues decline. 
Our Q4 gross margin was 51.1%, which was slightly below the midpoint of the guidance that we provided. This result was driven primarily by a stronger finish in our lower-margin wireless target margin, and a weaker finish in our higher-margin industrial market. 
Now let me turn to operating expenses. R&D in Q4 came in -- or I should say decreased by $8 million to $75 million, while SG&A increased by $1 million to $43 million, which drove operating expenses in total to $117 million, which was $7 million below last quarter's $124 million. 
OpEx also came in $7 million lower than our guidance and this was due primarily to lower variable compensation accruals as a result of lower attainment of our business and financial metrics. As a percentage of sales, R&D dropped to 12% and SG&A remained flat at 7% of net revenue. 
Given the swing in OpEx in Q4, I wanted to pause just for a minute and give you some color around how variable compensation at Avago works. The annual target for variable comp is in a range of $45 million to $50 million per year. This payout is based on attainment of overall corporate financial targets as well as organizational performance metrics, some of which are financial. It's typical that at the beginning of our fiscal year, we provide, on a pro rata basis, for 100% payout. We then true these estimates up each quarter. Some of the quarterly variation in spending is driven by our changing view of how attainment versus these goals will come out. We saw this specifically during Q4 when we took our accrual down. As you will see in a minute, the growth in spending for Q1 is based on our estimate of a 100% payout of variable compensation for fiscal 2013. Our philosophy here is simple. It is that when the company is doing well, our employee should get paid well and when we're missing our goals, we should all get paid less. It aligns incentives pretty well here. 
Now let me go back to Q4. Income from operations for the quarter increased by $13 million sequentially to $199 million and represented 32% in net revenue. Compared to the $191 million of Q4 in last year, income from operations increased by $8 million. We recorded a net gain of $1 million in interest and other. Taxes in Q4 came in at $6 million. Net income of $194 million increased 7% from the prior quarter and Q4 earnings per diluted share of $0.77 was $0.05 higher than Q3. Compared to Q4 of last year, net income was $8 million higher and for earnings per diluted share it was $0.04 higher. Earnings are higher versus the prior year primarily due to the lower spending that I described above. The lower increase in Q4 earnings -- or excuse me, the sequential increase in Q4 earnings was primarily attributed to higher revenue as well as the lower OpEx. 
I'd like to point out that both operating as well as net income in Q4 were record highs for Avago. Our share-based compensation in Q4 was $14 million, the breakdown of the expense for Q4 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $5 million in R&D and $7 million in SG&A. In Q1, I anticipate share-based comp will be approximately $17 million. And just to remind you, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation. 
So I go to the balance sheet now. Our DSO came in at 51 days. This was up 1 day from the prior quarter. The increase was due to the linearity of revenue within the quarter, which was driven primarily by the timing of product ramps in our wireless target market. Our inventory ended at $194 million, which was a decrease of $22 million from last quarter. Days on hand came in at 58 days, which decreased 8 days from Q3. Q4 inventory declined from Q3 primarily because we accumulated inventory in Q3 in anticipation of the Q4 wireless revenue growth, and in Q4, we shipped that inventory. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1,084,000,000 and we generated $215 million in operational cash flow. 
And just to foreshadow Q1 a bit for you, Q1 is generally a little bit weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual variable compensation relating to prior fiscal year. We spent $73 million on new CapEx, this was at the lower end of our guidance for the quarter, and it was mainly due to the timing of equipment delivery. 
In Q1, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. The increase is primarily due to the ongoing build-out of incremental FBAR filter capacity to support growing customer demand. 
For fiscal 2013, I now expect CapEx will be roughly flat to maybe slightly up from fiscal year 2012. The continued investment will be primarily in FBAR as Hock described and a little bit in the wired infrastructure area. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 294,000 shares, which consumes $10 million of cash. On October 1, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per ordinary share and that consumed $39 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And I just point out, since the inception of our dividend program in Q1 of 2011, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter. We also continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions as another way of deploying cash to enhance shareholder returns. 
Let me now briefly recap our fiscal 2012 full year results. Revenue increased by 1% to approximately $2.4 billion driven by the strength in our wireless business. Gross margin declined by 70 basis points to 51%, also driven by the slight decline also due to the strength of our wireless business. Net income for 2012 increased to $700 million or $2.77 per diluted share, and that compares with $692 million or $2.70 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. 
Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. I'll just let you know Q1 will be a 14-week long quarter, which happens every 5 or 6 years here for us. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we don't intend to update this guidance. As Hock told you, revenue is expected to be down in the range of 5% to 9% over Q4, caused by the weakness in call routing as well as the continued contraction in the industrial supply chain. I expect gross margin to be approximately 50.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The slight sequential decline is primarily a result of the end market revenue mix. Operating expenses are estimated to be $130 million and, as I explained earlier, this was driven by an increase in our variable compensation accruals. Interest and other is projected to be a gain of approximately $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $7 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 253 million shares. 
Let me just remind you, this quarter will be the last time that we report consumer and computing as a stand-alone target market. Starting with Q1 of next year, we'll group the remaining revenues from this business with industrial given the insignificant size of the remaining consumer revenue. And I just mentioned, revenue from consumer was down sharply in Q4 due to the last time buys in Q3, and we expect what remains as consumer revenue will be down again in Q1. We'll provide you with a recast of historical information in the earnings tables next quarter, so this change is clear.

And then perhaps the follow-up question that I have is around the call routing. It's a little bit of a surprise to see the magnitude of weakness 2 quarters in a row when some of the other competitors and peers in that space have actually seen some improvement. Can you help us understand what's driving that for Avago specifically, and do you have line of sight into that business improving in April?",74

A very interesting question, Terence, is on call routing, the products we supply -- these are fiber products we're supplying, proprietary fiber products I should add -- we're supplying to call routing is fairly unique. It’s proprietary by intent/definition, in the sense that there are not too many OEMs who make those call routers. They’re needed for very high volume, high bandwidth flow of data and usually invested in the backhaul side of any infrastructure development as opposed to the front side, which is more the base station display [ph]. This is really more related to backhaul as it connects interface to transport and those investments do tend to be rather lumpy. We do have some line of sight, but it does get lumpy and it’s fairly substantial each time a program comes in. I guess what I should have added is sitting here, looking ahead, as I used the word 'hiatus’ -- and it's true, there a hiatus in investment in call routing at this point by some service providers, but eventually such investments need to be made in order to create a bandwidth needed as there are more and more smartphones and especially LTE running. We do see, line of sight, that while this coming quarter -- this quarter, Q1, might continue weakness in call routing investments and for, therefore, demand for proprietary fiber products. We do see coming fall fairly shortly, broke a large program in China and probably another one in China later part in the year. You see one being recently awarded in Japan though it takes a while for it to translate into demand for our products, not very long. And we definitely do see with expansion of LTE networks, LTE networks in North America, for investments by carriers in North America to be made in call routing for the rest of this year. So we are pretty positive. So we do -- we are kind of, as I say, in the midst of a hiatus right now.",335

And that tends to -- that drew down a lot in inventory at distributors worldwide. Because of that -- simply because they couldn't ship much into distributors and end customers were pulling it out, out of these 3 channels. We are -- by the time we end this quarter, Q1, we would be pretty close to that level.",109

Year-on-year, to tell you experiencing one year doesn't mean it's the same the next year. And frankly, what we've -- I mean, as I've indicated to you guys I think a few months ago, we expected this quarter, Q1, wireless to be relatively flat from the preceding quarter, which is typically our strongest quarter in any 12-month period and its -- as we see it here now, we have Q1 running at the same rate as Q4. And -- but we do see -- it depends on how fast the product transitions occur at those 2 major OEMs. I think that's what, more than anything else, drives -- the characteristic that drives what one would call the ups and downs of the wireless business for us. And in other words, if the launch of new ramps on those -- one of those 2 OEMs, or both those 2 OEMs occur earlier, and as you saw in this year '12, it launched around September, October time frame, kind of later. But if that thing were to be pulled forward then probably product transition quarter would occur probably earlier than this year. This year it occurred in our fiscal Q3. If these things will pull forward, which it possibly could, though we don't know. It's too early to know. Then it could move forward one quarter, or it could push back one quarter, and could still be remaining -- remain at Q3 as we did in calendar '12. So given the information I have right now, I would probably say, most likely, we'll have the same situation as we had this year. Product transition in wireless, which means the lowest quarter of the year, would occur in our fiscal Q3. But I could be wrong by one quarter.",334

Because on your January guidance, it looks like industrial will be around 130 million to 135 million, that's up from where it was a year ago, but it's still well below the 180-plus you guys were doing in the back half of 2011.",63

Well, as I said, because it goes through distribution and we recognize revenue and you've correctly pointed out on shipped into our channels, you will see in periods of volatility -- on periods of uncertainty, I should say, this sort of thing happening. And part of it relates to the fact that tracing back to the beginning of this fiscal '12, another way of putting it, beginning of calendar '12, when we were just -- when we were experiencing, like many other industrial component manufacturers, the Thai flood at that time. We obviously, had to draw down substantially, our end customers have drawn down substantially on channel inventory to meet their needs and we weren't able to replenish those channel inventory in, obviously, a timely manner and that was the beginning of '12. And we obviously started to replenish it in our fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3. And since then, we've been drawing back down -- the distribution channels had been bringing down the inventory levels quite significantly. And that's pretty much what we're seeing over the course of fiscal '12 and that's why -- and to answer -- an answer to an earlier question from the audience was that by the end of this fiscal quarter, our inventory level in the channel would be as low as it was in January calendar '12 when we had the Thai floods and when inventory has really been drawn down. But through all this, my point is, as it gyrates our revenue, shipping that is, resale has been pretty flat.",259

And all that rolls into a situation where, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a situation where, when 5 years ago maybe 1 or 2 bands in the spectrum uses FBAR. Today, we have 15, 1-5, bands that uses FBAR. Of course, the number of bands have proliferated since then. I mean 5, 6 years ago maybe there were less than 10 bands. Today, there are 40 bands. But having said that, out of 40 bands, 15 uses FBAR. So those kind of trends and demand and the proliferation of smartphones and content in basically those smartphones is what's driving the need for us to expand occupancy in a fairly, fairly radical manner.",195

So now that they have already made the move to 4G/LTE, do you think it's possible that their next 1 or 2 products RF content perhaps on a like-to-like basis comes down because they're able to take advantage of integration and just a competition in the RF front end market?",98

So please bear in mind in the audience when I say it. It's possible because you're right, they'll try to integrate. I mean the number of bands hasn't changed. In fact, the number of bands will increase as we go into more and more LTE in various parts of the world, offsetting that number of bands with more content in theory, linearly but in practice your point is taken. The integration, also, that's right, the consolidation of RF components will reduce the content the other direction. Having said that, I do want to remind you from our very self-interest biased point of view, you tend to see that -- you can see that in power amplifiers, you don't see that in filters or duplexers. You cannot integrate duplexers or filters. Every band needs a separate filter. You don't integrate them together. But power amplifiers have been, as we have seen in our recent 8960 Qualcomm chipset have -- it supports power amplifiers 2G and some of the 3G bands integrated as 1 single chip solution in power amplifiers. But for duplexes and filters, which is the main thrust of interest for this company, it never gets integrated.",210

And it's a question I don't really know 100%. It's not as obvious it is driving, and so the best answer is not as much as it used to in the heydays of 2010 and definitely part of 2011, much less now. But it still does have an impact and quite a big impact because the multinational, industrial multinationals, we sell into Central Europe and into Japan, and a good part on North America, export a fair amount of their products into China -- for China programs. So it does have that, it still drives part of it but much less than it used to. If you ask me to quantify how much, I'm not sure. I couldn't quantify that. But it drives -- it has a much less impact, and which is probably the reason why we're seeing industrial resale among Tier 2, Tier 3, which tends to go through distribution a lot, to be very flat in countries like North America, and in countries like -- and more than flat, declining, in countries like Europe and Japan, offset by gradual increase in industrial resale in places like China and in emerging countries. So it -- and it balances out globally industrial resale, what we have seen over the last 9 months has been virtually flat. On the second question on renewable energy, there are 2 parts to it, but the major part you're talking about is demand into solar, wind, those kind of renewable energy things. Yes, there was strength a few years ago in the period of 2009, 2010. It's pretty strong. From 2011 onwards, things have come down quite dramatically and is now, I think, strong to a relatively small percentage of our total industrial business, probably maybe down to about 5%, 10%.",300

First on FBAR, what's your market share now, what do you think it will do over the next year or 2? And second, on the FBAR business, can you help us understand to what extent you get attached or you sell the FBAR part, which you guys have a great position in and you get attach rates of other silicon in the handset?",66

And I say, as I mentioned before, in simple terms, the 40 bands right now roughly operating in the world, 40 cellular bands, and 15 of that do use FBAR. It doesn't mean every one of them use it. So if I were to guess at market penetration by handsets, I would probably say 20% only, if at all. 15%, 20% is FBAR, may be even less, which is an interesting turn. It gives us a lot of room to grow. But only 15%, 20% uses FBAR at this point and that includes all the LTE bands. And the way FBAR pulls other components, that's very interesting, a good question and I'd like to highlight that and it refers back to an earlier question about, if FBAR is sold discreetly, that means as a standalone duplex or filter, FBAR creates a lot of gross margin, generates a very high gross margin for us. But they do not sell on its own most of the time. You pay an FBAR or you bet -- it pulls with it power amplifiers usually. Among other, small other components, largely power amplifiers. And so that's kind of dilute or makes [indiscernible] necessary thing that it gives us content and a lot of times those 2 pull together is packaged in a front end module, as we call it, or as some people call it FEM [ph] or front end modules. And which basically gives a higher price, higher dollar content but relatively lower margin. But as more of this front end modules requires FBAR, obviously, it’s also good for us in improving not only our dollars but our margin, but it typically -- not typically, but I would say 75% at least of our volume of FBAR are sole FEM [ph] with power amplifiers.",350

So in the past, you talked about doubling capacity by the middle of 2013.

And so that's why I told you next year CapEx will be at least as high as it was in 2012 and maybe slightly higher.

It's not that we change our intent, improve or increase our intention. We’ll still pull forward a part of that.

And it's hard to predict it accurately at this point, other than to be able to tell you, it will continue to trend out this capacity. It basically depends on whether we sell it individually, discretely as FBAR duplexer or we sell it in a front end module, which obviously affects the revenue but brings down gross margin somewhat. And it's a mix of the 2 and it's pretty hard to predict the mix going out that far. All we do know is the trend.",99

It's a normal pricing environment we see today and we -- which is roughly, frankly, depending on which particular generation of product it is, somewhere in the range of anywhere from 5% to 10% annually is what we tend to see in our mix of fiber optic products. Obviously the newer products tends to ramp down faster and stabilizes. The older products pretty much stays firm. The other products being the 1G tends to be more firm, 10, 100, if you imagine that still exists, still it's more firm. And the newer 8 gigabit per second storage product or 10 gigabit per second would tend to start off at a higher price and move down much faster. So the mix of that, I would say, on a steady-state basis will range from 5% to 10% a year, sometimes into the low double digits.",173

And then if we look at kind of how you're thinking about the FBAR business, it does sound like that the seasonality is changing again next year, how do you guys view -- I mean, I know you don't you want to give me full guidance, but are you guys seeing a change in how handsets are being delivered or designed for next year?",65

It's just that the dynamic, it is still very much there for most parts. I guess you do -- you probably see 2 big guys and a host of other significant OEM guys out there. And you still have the -- there's still seasonality for the most part which comes at this time of the year and everybody tries to get their products launched before or towards the seasonality. But the difference also is there are 1 or 2 of those big OEMs who go through more than one significant product launches a year, and the other big one do it once a year. And so you still see that, but it tweaks, one, as a component supplier to everyone, we see each year somewhat. In the old days when the OEM makers we're all not that far back in size, so for more or less about the same size, we do see the seasonality of year end, Christmas, year-end becomes very pronounced. Today, the seasonality is pronounced for the significant OEM but because of also the way size [ph] is shifted, that seasonality gets to a large extent muted by the size of the 2 big guys continuing their strong ramps.",209

And we're obviously very, very well engaged with them on that, and it definitely benefits us a lot to do that and we continue to do that. But in terms of specifics, pretty hard, that's a lot of designs. There are many, many designs that keep pouring out, and I can't even begin to tell you how many we have engaged in versus how many that are out there.
