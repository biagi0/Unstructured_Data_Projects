Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Doug Bettinger, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies. After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast as live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week and will be archived on our IR website.
During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Doug will be providing details of our Q4 and fiscal year 2010 results, background to our Q1 2011 outlook and some commentary regarding our analysis of recent market trends and the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.
In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.
Please also refer to our press release today for information on the specific risk factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. Additionally, our recent filings with the SEC discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our business and that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.
So at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?",280

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent business highlights and then Doug will provide summary of fourth quarter and full fiscal year financial results. Now as you may have seen from our earnings announcement, we had a solid fourth quarter with net revenue up 4% from last quarter, and net income, again, at record levels. I might add a lot of this net revenue growth during the quarter was largely driven by launch of proprietary products. And revenue in this fourth quarter 2010 was up 34% year-on-year from the fourth quarter 2009. We saw sequential growth in our Wired Networking business, including increased sales of 10 gigabit per second optical transceivers used in enterprise and data center networking applications, and a ramp of our SerDes ASIC business. We did also see seasonal strength in smartphones contributing to our fourth quarter growth.
But before I go on further, let's do take a step back at this point. During the past year, we have seen semiconductor companies grow faster than the end markets. This trend, we believe, is now causing the industry to slow production in order to bring inventory levels at OEM and in distribution channel in line with end demand. We're announcing semiconductor growth converts down to end market demand. However, the positive sign end market demand is still there, and in fact, it continues to recover and grow more strongly than 2010, especially with respect to products into emerging economies.
Now as I start to review the quarterly performance, I do want to remind everyone that we sell our products into four target markets. We define these as wireless communications, industrial automotive, wired infrastructure and, finally, consumer and PC peripherals. 
I will first provide color in each area on the performance of each end market and that's based on our own internal analysis of a number of leading OEM customers. I will then follow-up in each sector and discuss Avago's performance within that market. I should point out that our fourth fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2010, of course, while the target market data I will reference is, for the most part, based on the September-ended calendar quarter.
So first, let's discuss what we are seeing in the wireless communications market. OEMs in this target market saw their revenue grow sequentially by high-single digits percentage points on average. This revenue also grew low-double digit in percentage terms on average compared to the third calendar quarter of 2009. Wireless communications represented 38% of our fourth quarter revenue. Our revenue from this target market grew 6% from Q3 and rose 16% above Q4 last year. These gains are substantially in line with the growth seen by wireless OEMs, both sequentially, as compared to the third quarter year ago. Demand for our 3G RF front-end modules and leading smartphone makers and OEM drove this revenue growth.
And looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we anticipate revenue in this target market to fall in the mid-single digits sequentially, something we believe is still better than typical seasonality in the past due to specific programs, which we'd expect to ramp towards the end of this quarter.
Next, let's look at industrial automotive electronics. Our market data shows continued growth in this end market on average in the high-single digits percentage from prior calendar quarter. Compared with the same calendar quarter last year, this market experienced double-digit percentage growth. We believe this end-market growth has been driven in large part by broad infrastructure spending in emerging economies and renewable energy initiatives, particularly in the developed economies.
Our industrial, electronics net revenue increased 1% from last quarter. This end market accounted for 30% of our Q4 net revenue compared with the same quarter a year ago. Revenue from industrial, electronics target market is up 86%. 
Looking forward for Q1, we foresee resales to hold very steady, and we expect sales to the industrial end markets to be flat to up low-single digits on a percentage basis as compared to Q4. Long-term, of course, we continue to expect revenues from this target market to grow at a level similar to emerging market GDP growth.
Third, let's move to wired infrastructure. Based on our analysis, OEMs in this target market have grown revenues in the mid-single digits on average compared in the third calendar quarter over the previous quarter and experienced double-digit percentage revenue growth year-on-year. Our revenue from the wired infrastructure market grew 15% over Q3, better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. In particular, our SerDes ASIC business grew in the quarter due to new product launches, and we saw the strong demand from enterprise networking 10 gigabits per second and storage as OEMs transition to next-generation systems. Compared to Q4 last year, our revenue from this end market grew 37%, growing faster than OEMs, and demonstrating our increased penetration into customers in this end market.
Wired infrastructure accounts for 25% of total Q4 sales. We expect revenue from this target market to be flattish sequentially in Q1, even though we do expect demand from core networking service providers to improve as data requirements continue to grow.
Finally, let's take a look at our consumer and PC peripherals. Our data suggests OEM customersâ€™ revenue in this market grew low- to mid-single digits in third calendar quarter sequentially and experienced mid- to high-single digits growth year-on-year. Our revenue from consumer and PC peripherals declined 22% over last quarter. Year-on-year basis, our revenue shrunk by 9%. This was, of course, worse than we expected at the beginning of the quarter due to weaker PC and peripheral markets, some ASP erosion, but mainly inventory adjustment by our customers. The consumer income and PC peripheral target market accounted for just 7% of our fourth quarter sales. For Q1, we currently forecast that our revenue from this market will again be down as compared to Q4, probably in the double digits, as we have not seen any seasonal benefit in our PC-related business, and continued weakness in consumer spending and inventory adjustment in the optical disk drive business and PC mouse business.
Now while a big part of business is tied to general market conditions in summing this up, we are seeing market share growth due to the launch of proprietary solutions in wireless, fiber and ASICs as next-generation systems are introduced by our OEM customers.
Our new high-bandwidth embedded fiber in high performance computing, the ASICs we have in next-generation data center switching and cloud computing applications and our proprietary FBAR duplexers in new smartphone launches even in the North America, all these substantial programs are launching now and have the potential to provide upside.
While not necessarily -- having said that, while not necessarily a direct indicator of revenue, during Q4 2010, we did see bookings declined slightly. Accordingly, we expect to see revenue decline in Q1 2010 (sic) [2011] in the range of down 3% to 6% sequentially. This decline in Q1 net revenue is to be expected given the seasonality of our Wireless and Consumer businesses and will definitely in Q1 be coupled with inventory adjustment. With that summary, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 financial results. Doug?",1222
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2010",2010-12-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3397.0,90332.0,6360728.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everybody. Before reviewing the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 financial results, I need to remind you that as always, my comments today will focus primarily on the non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and is also available on our website at avagotech.com. 
Record revenue of $572 million in Q4 represents an increase of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 34% versus the same quarter one year ago. As Hock mentioned, the most significant growth came from our business in the wired networking market, where revenues grew 15% sequentially. This business has achieved another quarter of record revenue and it was driven by growth in enterprise, storage and data center spending, in particular driven by sales of our 10-gig and 8-gig optical transceivers.
Revenue in wireless communications grew 6% sequentially. Industrial and automotive revenue grew 1% for the quarter. And finally, revenues from our consumer and computing peripherals target market fell 22% sequentially and now represent just 7% of our overall revenue.
These results in aggregate were roughly consistent with our expectations. The end-market distribution came in slightly different than we expected, however. Results from our wired communications target market came in better than we expected and results from our consumer and computing target market came in worse than we expected at the beginning of Q4. And as Hock pointed out, our analysis shows that weakness in our consumer target market came from volume declines in mouse, in optical drive encoders, as well as inventory adjustments by our customers.
Resales from our distribution partners continued to increase in Q4. At the end of Q4, distribution inventory was up slightly from the prior quarter. We remained well within our inventory model for distribution and are very comfortable with the amount of inventory we have there. Q4 gross margin came in at 50.9%. This was flat with Q3 and was essentially in line or maybe slightly better than our expectations for the quarter.
During the quarter, R&D expenses increased by $3 million to $72 million. SG&A increased by $1 million to $48 million. These increases were driven by new product development activities, increase in litigation cost and higher bonus accruals.
As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13% and SG&A this quarter rounded down to 8% of net revenue. Operating expenses were slightly higher than I expected at the beginning of the quarter and this was primarily due to slightly higher bonus accruals. As a result of all that, income from operations increased by $7 million sequentially to a record $171 million and remained at approximately 30% of net revenue. Q4 income from operations compares with income from operations of $164 million last quarter and with $89 million in Q4 of last year.
We booked a tax benefit in Q4 of $26 million. This includes a $28.7 million discrete tax benefit in Q4, which equates to roughly $0.11 per diluted share. This takes a little bit of explanation. This benefit is the result of the release of tax valuation allowances which were caused by the redemption of our outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes. And basically, what it means is redeeming these notes requires us to record tax assets on the balance sheet that we didn't previously believe we would be able to utilize. These results translated in net income reaching another all-time high of $190 million or $0.76 per diluted share. And again, these numbers include the aforementioned tax benefit.
Q4 net income compares with net income of $152 million or $0.61 per diluted share in Q3, and with net income of $72 million or $0.29 per diluted share in Q4 of 2009. 
Total share-based compensation in Q4 was $7 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q4 includes a $1 million in cost of goods sold, $3 million in R&D and $3 million in SG&A.
In Q1, I anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $8 million. And just to remind you, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
So now let me turn to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding was 45 days. Inventory days on hand was 61 days. These were each down by one day from Q3. In dollar terms, inventory was $189 million, which was up 2% from last quarter. And I just point out that inventory dollars have now essentially grown back to the levels that we were at pre-recession. Our revenue is now 28% higher. We are comfortable with this inventory level, and I also expect inventory to grow slightly again next quarter.
At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $561 million. The increase in cash is primarily due to $217 million of cash that we generated from operations. Q4 is typically our strongest cash-generating quarter and the strength in this Q4 came from net income, as well as working capital management. And I just point out that Q4 operational cash flow equates to $0.86 per share this quarter.
CapEx in Q4 was $30 million and this compares with $22 million last quarter. We anticipate CapEx in the first quarter will be in the range of $32 million to $37 million. And I would point out I expect fiscal 2011 CapEx spending to be front-end loaded and so I'll give you the full year number that I expect, which is a range of $90 million to $110 million for the fiscal year.
The increase in Q1 is primarily the result of spending in mask sets for some of the new ASIC ramps that Hock talked about, as well as capacity expansion in both our Fort Collins RF, as well as Singapore optics fab. 
And given itâ€™s year end, let me now briefly recap our fiscal 2010 full-year results. Our revenue increased by 41% to $2.1 billion. Gross margin improved to 49.1% and this compares with 42.4% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin is a result of an increased percent of revenue, which came from our industrial market, as well as a greater percentage of revenue coming from our proprietary products.
Net income for fiscal 2010 increased to $547 million or $2.19 per diluted share and this compares with $147 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. And we'll not [ph] a fourth quarter event, yesterday we completed the redemption of the remaining $230 million of our Senior Subordinated Notes that were due in 2015. Charges related to this redemption including the premium we paid will be approximately $19 million and will be reflected in our Q1 GAAP results. And this means for the first time in Avago's history, we are essentially a debt-free company.
Additionally, Avago's board has declared our first dividend of $0.07 per ordinary share. This dividend will be paid on December 30 to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2010. I'd like to point out that our board remains committed to periodic reviews of our dividend policy with an eye towards potentially raising the dividend in the future.
Now let me review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we don't intend to update this guidance. Revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% sequentially. This reflects anticipated seasonality, or maybe a little better than seasonality in wireless, and continued softness in the consumer and computing target market.
Our gross margin forecast is for 50.5%, plus or minus 75 basis points. We anticipate operating expenses to be about $120 million. Interest and others is expected to be an expense of $3 million. This includes the remaining interest paid on our Senior Subordinated Notes, but it excludes the $19 million in charges due to the early extinguishment of the notes. That 19% will be in the GAAP numbers. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $4 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 255 million shares.
And so let me summarize. During Q4, we continued to generate record revenue, record cash and record profit. We maintained 50% plus gross margin as well as 30% operating income. Heading into the first quarter, we see a return to normal seasonal patterns in most of our businesses. We remain very encouraged by the design win momentum from our proprietary products that continue to ramp. And I believe Avago management continues to execute very well and is focused on delivering our financial goals.
And, operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions at this time.",1432

And then separately, in the communication space, one of your big partners has been outlining somewhat softer trends than normal. Could you talk about how that may have impacted you or what some of the offsets maybe? It sounds like your 10-gig business, for example, has been strong?",111

But we already started that as I did indicate in the previous quarter Q4 when we start to see the initial signs of that convergence, I think we will continue to see that in Q1 and, hopefully, that would be it. If not, certainly, I would say the back half of the year looks fairly, fairly positive with this adjustment of inventory and a closer convergence between semiconductor growth and broader OEM growth. And by the way, looking at our broader OEM growth, we are seeing, as I indicated, fairly healthy growth. In fact, in some end markets, they are growing faster than semiconductor companies at this stage, which is a pretty good indicator of recovery, as well as continuing end demand from the new applications on emerging economies. Then on the second part on networking, wired infrastructure, yes, we continue to see broadly okay demand in this space. A big part of it, I might add, is because we are gaining share both in our SerDes ASICs, as well as in the proprietary fiber programs we launched with several major OEMs, as I mentioned in high-performance next generation computing and next-generation supercomputer, in proprietary core routing programs, as well as even in some of these proprietary storage programs, more and more, we are seeing that carry the weight of our ability to grow in this end market. So it's hard to tell. At least what we do see is fairly decent trend here in this end market and I suspect a lot of it is market share growth.",289

But not withstanding on that and notwithstanding the fact that we think we're not sure about what is overall end market or what overall business our industry for OEMs in the end market is in this space. We kind of think that things could be flattish overall and based on that, we're guiding flat to well slightly up for what we call our Wired Infrastructure business. To be frank, we feel things are a little uncertain here and we think the broader market may be flat. We think there's a chance for us to gain market share, we're not certain. So we're guiding zero to low-single digit in wired infrastructure. Now as far as our SerDes is concerned, there's something we've been talking about now for the last six months, at least, which is that a lot of our products are pretty engaged into design into these next-generation programs in high data centers switching that are starting to be launched. Things like the Nexus 2000, Nexus 5000 and Nexus 7000 from, say, Cisco. And, obviously, we will be seeing the benefit of that ramp and we are really starting to see the benefit of that ramp, as I indicated in the remarks on our earnings announcement.",248

There are only a few major for phone OEMs and each of them are fairly lumpy in the way they launch a program. They don't launch it all at the same time. They launch at different times. So when you start taking specific quarter measures, you will see sometimes that some quarters you hit the right programs and the right OEMs, so you bounce. And in other times, it evens it out. So it's very, very possible and very, very normal and likely to do that, especially when it comes to people like us where we are still relatively very niche. We go after very specific smartphone programs where we can differentiate our products, and where we're not just going after market share.",139

As we have said before, in CDMA phones, FBAR is the way to go for duplexers. And we have a very, very substantial market share on CDMA phones with respect to FBARs. And with respect to UMTS, which is otherwise called 3G, again, it depends on the particular bands, the parts of the spectrum that are being used and there are some bands where FBAR has very clear differentiated performance benefit. And in those, we tend to win a high percentage of those bands. In certain other bands where SAW filters could perform adequately, not as well as FBAR, but adequately. Obviously, in non-smartphones, performance is also critical. We tend not to get those phones and even in some smartphones, between the trade-off of cost versus performance, we win some, we don't win all. So in 3G, UMTS, we are represented in only certain bands. But in CDMA, we are pretty pervasive.",163

Doug, in the press release it said interim cash dividend, is there something difference between an interim cash dividend and a regular cash dividend?

It's a legal term basically. Once the accounts are audited, you call it a final dividend. Until the audit is complete, which we're not done with our year end audit yet, you call it an interim dividend. That's the basic message there. How much cash do we need to run the business? I'd tell you, we have plenty of cash to run the business today. $100 million to $150 million at these levels is a comfortable level for us to run the business. We're fairly sophisticated about how we sweep cash to where we need it from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so we don't need a ton of cash.",124

You're talking about things like duplexers with power amplifiers? Well, typically, you don't integrate one to the other, at least not the technology is really not there yet to do it and be able to meet performance of even 3G, 2G, CDMAs. So it doesn't quite happen. They're very different -- tend to be very different processes, materials and there is really no integration from the pure sense of semiconductor integration as one piece of a chip. However, you're right in one regard, the integration in the form of putting bulk chips plus ancillary chips around it into, packaged into a single module is happening, has been happening, and the trend I would say tends to be that it is increasingly happening, where both the duplexer, which is, of course, FBAR filter combined with a power amplifier, is pulled together, packaged in a single module, called a front-end module, for any particular phone continues to be an increasing percentage of phones making it this way as opposed to discrete filters and discrete power amplifiers. And so that does tend to have -- that is a situation that has been happening. And for us, coming back to us in reference, it's a positive thing. In fact, it's a great thing because our FBAR filter, obviously, is a high-performance part.  Nothing comes close, especially in certain, as I mentioned earlier, certain bands of 3G and CDMAs. So when OEM customer wants a front-end module that meets all of the rest of the ancillary chips and the power amplifier package in together with a superior FBAR, we get to sell more content.",278

By the way, most of our Industrial business of ours goes through distribution, it's typically the case. It gets very fragmented, lots of many, many customers and lots of different products are very fragmented. And in our case in particular for industrial, resale has been steady and continues to hold up even today, industrial resale. And as I mentioned, a lot of it, it's driven a lot by still strength of emerging economies, renewable energy initiatives, which is increasingly a real percentage of the business. And what's even more interesting today is some of the developed countries are actually recovering, finally. So that drives good resale on industrial, and we see no change in that. What is happening in supply-chain? Lead time shorter now -- a lot of these distributors wants to reduce their risks. Many OEMs now feel that parts are out of allocation now, so the supply chain is contracting. And, accordingly, we see some of the effect of that and we started to see some of the effect of that in Q4 and we will continue to see some of that in Q1, whether as the early question raises, will it end in Q1? I don't really know the answer, but probably a good chance it will take a couple -- it will end by then given that it already started last quarter.",228

Mostly I would guess that would be on share gains, correct? Is this these new OEMs or existing OEMs with new phones? Or is it just your blend is going to wind up being better at some of the products you're dealing with now? And then secondly, given that more than 50% of your revenue is coming from FBAR on the wireless side of the business and that traditionally, you haven't had much competition there but I know TriQuint is ramping up their FBAR efforts significantly and going to have a lot of capacity coming on line by midyear or so. Do you see the dynamic in that business starting to change at all, maybe later on in the year even if it's not short term? And then I had a question for Doug.",148
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2010",2010-12-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3397.0,90332.0,6360772.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,47,"On the wireless side, to start off with, we do not see our business, in fact, across many of our business and definitely not in wireless as a share gain kind of business. We have differentiated products and unless we can differentiate ourselves with an OEM in a socket, we won't participate in it because we don't want to compete just on price. We only compete, in fact, on performance. So we are kind of a niche player, still is a niche player in fact in spite of our size in the handset business. We focus a lot on smartphones and in not even every smartphone maker. So to answer your question, it's not really about share gain that we have why we expect to be better than normal seasonality perhaps in Q1 as I forecast. It's more of the fact that the programs we are in happen to be launching around that time. And so gains and meanwhile a couple of programs as I mentioned are all similar to other. A couple of those programs were delayed from Q4 into Q1 so therefore, Q4 may have been lower than we thought it should be. But certainly Q1 could be better than we had originally thought it would be. So that's the real explanation for what it is. Itâ€™s that some -- many of these handset programs are very large and lumpy and given that we are not just about mass market share, those lumpiness does affect the way our revenue moves.",252

So I mean it seems to me that that's clearly a share gain based on your technology because you've got the best FBAR out there. But you look at it more as just -- I'm trying to get my arms around exactly how you're seeing if it's not a share gain, based on your technology you're just looking at it as what, just generic growth in the handset world?",128

We have a lot of intellectual property around FBAR and we probably remain there very well known. It's also very well known that we have a patent litigation suit with respect to TriQuint. And number three, FBAR is an extremely difficult product to develop, to design and develop. And it took us many, many years and a lot of money to do that. So not just to develop the product and design the product, to be able to ramp up high-volume production, which we are very, very good at doing, but it took us a long time to do it, and we have pretty substantial fabs in that regard. So I think it will take a while for the dynamics, the competitive dynamics in the FBAR space to really be impacted to any degree, even if there is a new player into it.",157

Yes, it's different product technology on this laser pad. And, obviously, there may be more than one different process in do it.

Yes, I guess the limit is 100%, but I'm trying not to be cavalier about it. But realistically, we could probably drive it all the way to 75%. And there's a long way to go and we will continue to because, obviously, I mean, we still have a lot of products that are standard and that are still very profitable and that are very sustainable lines. So it's about outgrowing those standard products, which are still growing in their own right with proprietary programs and, obviously, the bulk of our R&D are focused on proprietary programs. So that will make the growth even more -- much more than our overall  average growth. As you know, our overall average model long term is to grow 10% to 12% a year. And, obviously, for our proprietary programs on that long-term basis, for our proprietary products to continue to grow. We see proprietary products growing much faster than that, probably more in the range of closer to 20% a year than the average corporate 10%.",187

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent business highlights, then we'll have Doug provide a summary on the third quarter financial results.
Now as you may have seen from our earnings announcement, we had a strong third quarter with record net revenue up 7% from last quarter and net income again at record levels. In fact, our revenue in Q3 was -- is now up 23% from the prerecession peak quarter of fiscal fourth quarter 2008, largely driven by our proprietary products, well outperforming the semiconductor market as a whole, which excluding memory, is still below the peak levels achieved in net prior quarters according to industry sources. Now revenue in the third quarter of 2010 is up 52% year-on-year from that of the third quarter 2009. Q2 2009 marked a bottom on the recession. Much of the subsequent gain in revenue can be attributed to the general economic improvement we have seen since that time. However, in addition to strong expansion of our base business, which is largely inventory replenishment, we have also seen substantial revenue growth from ramp up of proprietary product launches in our wireless and wired target markets over the past year, as well as expansion of product sales into new growing areas such as renewable energy applications.
Now in particular, there were certain major group growth drivers in our Q3 2010. We again saw substantial growth in the industrial and automotive electronics business including increased sales of optocouplers, industrial fiber and industrial encoders. These products are sold primarily into applications such as inverters and converters, industrial, PLC or fieldbus communications systems and servo motor systems used in industrial automation. These applications are benefiting from the growing spending on industrial automation in Asia, particularly file management applications, mass transit and renewable energy generation.
So as I start to review the quarterly performance, I want to remind everyone that we sell our products into 4 target markets. We define this as wireless, communications, industrial and automotive, wide infrastructure and consumer computer peripherals. I will first provide color on the performance in each market based on our own internal analysis of our leading OEM customers. I will then follow up and discuss Avago's performance within each of those markets. I should point out that our third fiscal quarter ended August 1, while the target market data I'll reference is, for the most part, based on June ended calendar quarter.
So let's first, let's discuss what we are seeing in the wireless communications targeted market. OEMs in this market saw their revenue grow sequentially by mid single-digit percentage points on average in the second calendar quarter 2010. Their revenue from this target market also grew in the low single-digits on average compared to the second calendar quarter of 2009. Now wireless communication represented 38% of our third quarter revenues, and our revenue grew 5% from Q2 and rose 23% above Q3 last year. The sequential gain is in line with the growth seen by wireless OEMs during the quarter but exceeds their growth over the past year. Demand for proprietary Optical Finger Navigation devices and sensors and for our 3G RF front-end modules and leading smartphones OEMs drove the revenue growth. Our Optical Finger Navigation solution has now been commercially launched in 28 different handset programs over 10 handset OEMs.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter fiscal 2010, the quarter we are in right now as we look forward, we anticipate revenue in this target market to grow in the high single-digit sequentially driven by growth in a number of multimode, multiband smartphones we are designing. 
Next, let's look at industrial and automotive electronics end market. Our market data shows continued growth in this market on average in the high single-digit percent from the prior calendar quarter. Compared with the same quarter last year, this market experienced low double-digit percentage growth. We believe this end market growth is being driven in large part by broad infrastructure spending in emerging economies. We once again recorded impressive performance within industrial and automotive electronics as sales increased 16% from last quarter, which was better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. This end market accounted for 31% of our Q3 revenues. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, revenue from our industrial and automotive electronics market is up 143% and is now 25% above the prior peak quarterly revenue for this target market achieved in Q3 fiscal '08.
I would say since mid 2009, we've experienced a recovery in demand from inverter applications related to power generation and distribution and a certain demand for new applications related to renewable energy and transportation solutions. Growth in servo motors has driven demand for motion control encoders and increase use of PLC and other industrial data communication systems, which have driven demand for our industrial optical transceivers, all of which have contributed to the significant increase in our Q3 revenues from within this targeted market. 
Now looking forward for Q4, we expect sales in industrial market to continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate, and forecast revenue growth to be in the low single-digits over Q3. Having said that, though we have experienced recent strong growth in this targeted market, we have to believe and expect net revenue from this market to eventually revert to the level similar to emerging market GDP growth. We have said that for 4 quarters in a row, and obviously, we have been wrong.
Now let's move to the wired infrastructure market. Based on our analysis, OEMs in this target market have grown revenues in the low to mid-single digits on average in the second calendar quarter over the previous quarter and experienced double-digit percentage revenue growth year-on-year.
Our revenue from the wired infrastructure market was flat largely over Q2, while our SerDes ASIC business grew in the quarter, reflecting new product launches and leading OEMs. This was offset by slowing demand during the quarter, among service providers for standard fiber core routing products. Compared with Q3 last year, our revenue from this end market was up 41%, demonstrating our increased penetration into customers in this end market. The wired infrastructure market accounted for 22% of the total Q3 sales. We expect ramping of next generation data center solutions from our key large OEM customers, including Cisco, Juniper and HP, will translate into mid to high single-digit sequential growth for us in Q4 in this target market.
And finally, let's take a look at the consumer computing peripherals end market. Our data suggests that OEMs revenue in this market shrank in the low single-digits on average in the second calendar quarter sequentially, but experienced double-digit percentage revenue growth year-on-year. For us, our revenue from consumer computing peripherals end market grew 4% over last quarter, and on a year-on-year basis, our revenue grew 32%. The consumers' target markets accounted for only 9% of our third quarter revenues and for Q4, we currently estimate our revenues for this market will be flat from Q3. This reflects our expectations arising from what we see as a lack of seasonality in the PC-related business. We have once again exceeded our previous quarterly revenue pick, one not necessary a direct indicator of revenue. During Q3 2010, we also saw bookings continue to grow strongly. Accordingly, we expect to see revenue growth in Q4 2010 in the range of 3% to up to 6% sequentially.
We continue to manage lead times and this has not extended beyond our normal 4 to 8 weeks. We believe our ability to keep our lead times largely unchanged has mitigated the impact of potential double ordering and allowed us to gain share over the past year. 
With that summary, let me now turn over the call over to Doug for a review of our third quarter fiscal 2010 financial results.",1314

Thanks, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2010 financial results, I want to remind you that as always, my comments today will focus primarily on the non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP data is included with the earning release issued today and is also available on our website at avagotech.com. Net revenue of $550 million in Q3 represents an increase of 7% from last quarter and an increase of 52% versus the same quarter a year ago. The most significant growth, again, came from our business in the industrial and automotive target market where our revenues grew 16% sequentially. This business has now demonstrated its fifth consecutive quarter of growth and is now 158% above the trough that we reached in Q2 of 2009. Further, this revenue level is 26% above its previous record levels in Q3 of 2008. 
Revenues in wireless communications grew 5% sequentially. Wired networking revenues were flat for the quarter. And finally, revenues from our consumer and computing peripherals target market grew 4% sequentially. These results were roughly consistent with our expectations for the company at the beginning of Q3. I'm pleased that we delivered another record revenue quarter, and revenues from 3 of our 4 target markets once again achieved new records. Resales from our distribution partners continued to be strong in Q3. At the end of Q3, distribution inventory was essentially flat on a days basis and was modestly up from the prior quarter on a dollar basis. We continue to remain at the low end of our desired distribution inventory model. Looking forward into Q4, we expect to see inventory levels in distribution modestly increase in order to match resales requirements. 
Q3 gross margin was 50.9%. This compares with 48.2% in Q2. Stronger sales in the industrial and automotive target market, lower warranty charges and improved product mix in other target markets all contributed to the quarterly improvement.
During the quarter, R&D expenses increased by $1 million sequentially to $69 million. SG&A increased by $2 million to $47 million. These increases were driven by new product development activities, as well as increased litigation costs. 
As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13% and SG&A remained at 9% of revenues. I'd point out that while revenue grew 7% in Q3, operating expenses grew by 3%.
Income from operations increased by $29 million sequentially to a record $164 million or 30% of net revenues. Income from operations reaching 30% of net revenues is a record for us. The improvement was driven by the growth in revenue, obviously, the higher gross margin, as well as continued spending discipline. Q3 income from operations compares with income from operations of $135 million in Q2 and was $62 million in Q3 of last year. Taxes came in at $4 million. Interest and other expenses were $8 million in Q3.
Both of these items unfolded as we expected at the beginning of the quarter. These results translated into net income reaching another all-time high of $152 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Q3 net income compares with net income of $117 million or $0.47 per diluted share last quarter. While revenue grew 7% sequentially in Q3, net income grew 30% sequentially.
Total share-based compensation in Q3 was $7 million, up slightly from last quarter. The breakdown of this expense for Q3 includes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $2 million in R&D and $4 million in SG&A. In Q4, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $8 million. This $8 million includes expenses for an employee share purchase program that was recently launched. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet. Day sales outstanding was 46 days. Inventory days on hand was 62 days. DSO was up 2 days as a result of the timing of revenue within the quarter. And DOH was up 2 days from Q2, primarily due to the improvement in gross margin. In dollar terms, inventory was $185 million, which was up 4% from last quarter. And again, this inventory level continues to be at the low end of our model, and we expect inventory to grow slightly in Q4. I think it's important to note also that while Q3 2010 revenue is 23% above the prior peak level in Q2 of 2009, inventory is actually still 4% below its peak from the beginning of that quarter.
During the quarter, our cash balances increased to $367 million, and the increase in cash is primarily due to $137 million of cash from operations. And I just point out, included in this number is a $14 million interest payment on our outstanding notes. This operational cash flow equates to $0.55 per share in Q3. We built upon our positive net cash position in Q3 with cash on the balance sheet obviously exceeding the $230 million in debt that remains outstanding. The business continues to be a strong cash generator. And in light of the company's strong cash generation capability, Avago's board adopted a dividend policy authorizing a quarterly dividend commencing some time during fiscal 2011.
The actual declaration in payment of any such dividend will be up to the discretion of the board and will depend on various factors, including our business and financial conditions and the availability of sufficient distributable profits, out of which to pay the dividend. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $22 million, which compares with $18 million last quarter. We anticipate our CapEx in the fourth quarter will be in the range of $25 million to $30 million. The increase is primarily the result of spending on mask sets for new ASIC design wins. 
The midpoint of the Q4 CapEx range will have CapEx spending coming in at approximately 4% of revenues for our fiscal year.
We also spent $8 million during Q3 to acquire a small designer and manufacturer of motion encoders in China, which complements our portfolio in the industrial and automotive electronics businesses. Given the recent growth in that target market, we anticipate that this acquisition will both expand our customer base in China, as well as provide a local low-cost manufacturing base. Also during the quarter, Moody's Investors Service raised its rating on Avago and assigned a Baa3 senior unsecured issuer rating to Avago Technologies Finance, which is an investment-grade level. Achieving the milestone of an investment-grade company is something we were proud to have been able to achieve. 
Now let me review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we don't intend to update this guidance. As Hock mentioned, revenue is expected to be up 3% to 6% sequentially. This reflects anticipated strength in our wired infrastructure and wireless target markets. Gross margin is expected to be 50.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be $118 million. The expected increase is primarily due to new R&D projects, as well as modest increases in IP litigation costs. Interest and other is expected to be $8 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $5 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 252 million shares.
So let me summarize. Q3 was a strong quarter in which we continue to generate record revenue and record profits. Attaining both, a 50 percentage plus gross margin as well as a 30% operating income is something we have long been aspiring to. We also recently completed a 14.9 million share secondary offering on behalf of our private equity sponsors and other shareholders in what was a very choppy market environment. 
Heading into the fourth quarter, we see new product ramps in the wired infrastructure space, solid seasonality in wireless, somewhat moderating growth in industrial and muted seasonality in consumer. The Avago team continues to execute well in this market. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.",1335

By the way, it's the same range we put out over the last several quarters. So the range isn't any wider than normal. But the puts and takes, it's really end market driven. Wireless is particularly strong, and while margin within wireless end market is improving sequentially, it's at a lower gross margin than industrial, which we see growing less than wireless this quarter. So when you mix that in, margin kind of works out to be flat-ish, maybe slightly down this quarter and, hence, the midpoint of 50.5%.",95

What an OEM calls part of this environment of what you see as unified computing environment that. We're seeing implementation, we're seeing ramp of those product -- chips in those products that are been -- that are selling into the environment. Particularly, we are talking about systems like the Nexus 7000, the Nexus 5000.

And final question, if I may. On the dividend, it's authorized not declared yet. Could you just help us understand what -- how we should we think about the philosophy on growing the dividend?

I think just to describe what the board did, we've adopted a policy, you're right. And we haven't made a declaration of a dividend yet. And what we said is the declaration will happen when the board gets to the point of looking at what's in the quarter in front of us. It very likely happens in the beginning of 2011, potentially as soon as Q1. But we'll keep you updated as that goes. But I think it's important to understand, we have adopted a policy that we intend to return cash to shareholders through dividends. So that was important to us. And then in terms of amount of cash we need to run the business, I have more than we need to run the business today, honestly. And we continue to generate cash, as you would have seen from this quarter. So yes, it's probably $100-ish million to run the business on an ongoing basis. It's what we really need to have on the balance sheet. You never want to get that lean, but that's what we need to have. And it is likely that over time, the dividend gets increased, it's kind of a playbook with these things that year-by-year, you increase it as your cash generation grows. And that will be a discussion we have with the board on a fairly regular basis.",231

But if you go back to the prerecession days of 2009, you're right, our peak quarter is usually the fourth quarter. And that's -- a large part of it driven by seasonality in consumer and including wireless handsets. So therefore, Q1 tends to come down mid-single-digits also from Q4 as normal seasonality before pre-2009 recession. And now we look back, obviously, beginning of this year, Q4 of 2009 and going to Q1 of 2010, just past this year, we didn't see that kind of effect. We didn't see that kind of seasonality. And one could say recovery obscured that. The question is are we still in the stage of recovery of 2009 recession? Or are we back to the normal stability of what was pre-2009? I hate to say that, but right now, we have no visibility on that.",160

Hock, you talked about the automotive and industrial now being about 25%, 26% above the Q3 '08 levels. And I'm kind of curious, whatâ€™s been the bigger driver of that, the automotive section or the general industrial? And I guess, now with these levels, most investors are a little bit concerned about the overall economy. Can you help me understand how much of that business has been sort of content growth, Avago market share growth versus just general end-market growth?",84
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2010",2010-08-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3733.0,165168.0,10371946.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,32,"All right, a very good question. And believe me, we have spent oodles and oodles of hours trying to foster the data to also get to the bottom of this. So let me give you my best shot here. I guess, to start off with, automotive is only a very small percentage of this industrial business. I should just shut up and just call it Industrial business because automotive is less than 10% of that segment. And that whole segment is -- so which means of 31% of our overall revenues, automotive is less than 3% of our total revenues. That's how little it is. We will intend to increase it over time, and I'll tell you in the second why. But right now, it's in that level. And where we see what -- let me tell you what has happened. After the bottom of second quarter 2009, fiscal 2009, we saw a sharp recovery of industrial. First, it was slow then it became very sharp. And in the first couple of quarters after that bottom, which means the back half of fiscal 2009, we believe a large part of that spring-back, so to speak, is replenishment of inventory. Obviously, there has been a sharp reduction on inventory in the entire supply chain pipeline from OEMs, drew down a lot of inventories instead of purchasing channels, which also brought down inventory, and everybody else along the chain. It was replenishment. But what we see then going into 2010, fiscal 2010, especially the most recent 2 quarters is no longer -- is not much more -- no longer, for our case, inventory replenishment, okay? We kept our lead times for industrial products very, very stable during this time, about 4 to 6 weeks. We kept that purposely stable. And we have not been -- we believe the bottleneck, so to speak -- of the bottleneck to ability of our OEM customers to ship out their systems. So obviously, we see, we believe, less of this double-ordering phenomenon than perhaps could have existed. So what we see is inventory replenishment in the back half of 2009. 2010, it's really for us because our ability to keep standard lead times in place, gains and shares in many sockets, where it maybe more than single source, but also what became very clear and much clearer and clearer is a lot of stimulus money going into renewable energy. Quite a bit of money into development -- not modern development, launching, sale of mass transportation, electric trains, especially in emerging countries, which uses a lot of our product, be it fiber controls on environment, which are very hostile. And we obviously call this industrial products or inverters in nontraditional energy sources. And what we're seeing is the percentage of revenues going into this end market to the extent we could pause the data and analyze it has grown to be from very -- almost unmeaningful 2 years ago to very meaningful levels now. In fact, renewable energy, I would guess, might be in excess of 20% of industrial revenues to date.",515

And I guess, as my follow-up, Doug, you guys don't have to make any excuses for the gross margins you've been putting up. But I'm kind of curious, given the tailwind you've had from industrials from these levels, how do you get significantly more gross margin improvement? Or do you feel like you're now operating at what we should view as sort of target levels on the gross margin line?",74

We have also said all along, and that's as far back as 3 years back, that we're increasing our gross margin through product mix. Product mix being proprietary product mix, not just a mix of high-margin commodity products but trading of another low-margin commodity product. It's really about growing through proprietary products, where we have better pricing leverage and our percentage of proprietary products have continued to steadily grow, even through this downturn and in the trend up to another recovery. It continues to grow, and that's most of what's expanding our gross margin. You're right, the recovery of industrial helped, too, but I'll be direct. Industrial in 2008 was over -- was 33% of our total revenues, industrial products. Today, it's 31%. In 2008, our gross margin was in the low 40s. Today, it's 50%. It's much -- it's more than just industrial mix.",147

I mean, we hear numbers at 40%, 50% year-on-year. During quarter, there are more dynamics within as we move from quarter-to-quarter and reduce obviously different -- as dynamics in market share shift within one OEM to the other and within each OEM, just to preserve revenues and as they see end-markets opportunities, they might actually shift from smartphones emphasis to low-end phones emphasis. And we saw some of that in quite a lot of that in Q3 from some of the OEMs that we are very well positioned in, which kind of reflects on short-term impact on our revenue in Q3 quarter. As we go into this quarter, Q4, we are seeing, as everybody saw, the war of the smartphones now going on. Everybody launching for Christmas, back end of the year. And as you know, our strength is in smartphones, regardless of who we have our products designed in versus another OEM. They're all going great in smartphones in this fourth quarter.

I did try to explain it briefly on the previous question, but let me try it perhaps in a more contextual manner. What we -- I mean, we are in multiple OEMs out there, handset makers, but obviously not in the same level on each and every one of them. And on a couple of the OEMs that we were very strong in, in our designs, as you know, number one, we also are very focused on smartphones and feature-rich phones. That's the strength of our product mix because we differentiate our products, FBARs, as well as front-end modules. And in those particular OEMs, in the previous quarter, there was a strategic shift in their business mix from smartphones to more low-end phones. And most of those low-end phones are GSM/EDGE phones, for which we don't participate very much in. And so in a nutshell, we saw lost share there because of their strategic mix in their product mix. Come Q4, they shift back into a lot of smartphones, and so our share immediately popped right back up. And that's a large part of the reason why our revenue in Q4 are seeing the strong seasonality, which brings to the second question. So everybody jumps into the smartphones in the fourth quarter, and that's probably true. There is always a concern that with this war of smartphones going on, there will be -- and you don't know what sell-through is going to be looking like. All the smartphone vendors or OEMs, I would say, are pouring in more products than possibly subscription would happen. Having said that, all this is also good because with the amount of publicity and push into smartphones, consumers are buying smartphones. And as you're seeing year-on-year growth of smartphones are like 50% year-on-year. And maybe in this particular quarter, Q4, that this strong publicity and a plethora of very, very interesting and feature-rich smartphones out there would actually stimulate a lot more demand that the growth rate might even grow faster. So whether we might run into excess inventory at the end of this big promotion of smartphones, I don't know. But it's certainly something that we all are taking the opportunity to participate and we are.",378

We didn't see that much unusual inventory build. In fact, in some of the OEMs, because of the expected launch of new generation of smartphones that is imminently happening in Q4, they actually pulled back on inventory of a couple of the large OEMs we deal with, purposely pulled back, especially on older models.",60

And then last question on LTE. When we move to LTE, I guess, maybe some time next year, how do you think you're positioned? I mean, I know with FBAR, you should have a better position. But maybe you can explain that how you would compete versus the competitors out there.",52

But certainly, with FBAR, LTE are those bands that are falling in between whatever bands have been given out in 2G, 2.5G and 3G. So in simple terms, the bar has been raised. And usually, with the LTE phones, they run coexistence with multiple other protocols. You don't just have 3G LTE running with 3G and many LTEs are for data largely, so 3G is for voice together with it and other things. So you start running all those bands, all those protocols close to each other, and they run at frequencies that some of them are very close to each other or very close to even Wi-Fi. For instance, at 2.4G, it runs very close to some of the cell band frequencies. And when you start running that very close, you need very good filtering duplexers. In other words, FBARs. So we see this as trending, this whole technology roadmap as trending towards a situation where you run with more bands, multiple modes in each phone crammed together. You tend to drive on this towards using much, much higher-performance filters, which is FBAR. So we think it's all good in the long-term.",211

And also, you're defending your proprietary IP litigation right now in the courts. But could you give a little more color on just from a competitive standpoint how the pricing or competitive environment is looking like, especially with some of the other chip vendors from microcontroller and the multitouch world as they move into the optical navigation, how that is changing the dynamics right now or either now or longer-term?",96

First and foremost, actually up Optical Finger Navigation is another way of -- simply describing it is it's a mouse on a smartphone, on a phone basically. It's putting a mouse on a phone as a human interface device towards interacting with your screen on a handset. It's putting a mouse there. And it's an alternative -- a very viable alternative, we might say, to touch screens, like what the iPhone has and a few other OEM makers have, as another human interface device. And they run in parallel. And there will be -- the world will not move to any one particular one versus another. And it's just the 2 separate, very distinct human interface device and I think they will keep running in parallel. And so from that point of view, we don't really compete directly. Optical Finger Navigation do not directly compete with touch screen. I mean, OEM makers make some touch screen because they feel that will attract a certain category or niche of users and another bunch to Optical Finger Navigation because Optical Finger Navigation provides the best way, in our view, in terms of reliable, in terms of ease-of-use of scrolling through a smartphone versus, say, something else like a trackball, as had been prevalent before in the past. So this Optical Finger Navigation is coming in and replacing a lot of these other old mechanical human interface devices. It doesn't necessarily replace what's a touch screen. So it runs in parallel. And leading the space of Optical Finger Navigation, now we're making it clear that it's not really directly replacing touch screen. You're right, we're the pioneers in this area, just as we were the inventors of the mouse, by the way, of the optical mouse. We use that mouse, we use that same technology and convert it to Optical Finger Navigation for touch screen -- sorry, for smartphones. And we pioneered it. We were the first to launch with it, with some partners, some assembly system integrator partners. And we've been very successful in being able to because of early launch and because our products became more reliable and tested and proven, to gain a lot -- to basically gain share as we ramp into more and more OEMs and more and more OEM handsets. We are seeing a couple of potential competitors coming in. I used the word potential because they have offered similar products. And obviously, as you pointed out, 1 or 2 of them have obviously infringed our IP, we believe, and we have taken -- we have gone out to defend those IP. But we expect to see that kind of competition, but we have a huge headstart on those guys.",454

Thanks for all that type of detail. The second question I had pertains to your wired business, the wired infrastructure business. So you mentioned SerDes ASICs a lot, and I assume that's driving some of the growth in the current fiscal Q4. But I was just wondering in terms of other products in that portfolio or in that business, such as optical fiber and cabling, how important is that as a driver to the business or as a complementary product that you sell along with your SerDes? And just kind of also want to get your thoughts on whether or not cloud computing and virtualization, if that's, from an architectural standpoint, driving the need for more of your high-speed SerDes products?",123
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2010",2010-08-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3733.0,165168.0,10371980.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,66,"Okay. On wired infrastructure, what's driving us right now is essentially, by the way, design wins we secured 2, 3 years back. They're coming to fruition over that 3-year period. We've obviously designed, proven, validated with our OEM customers the SerDes and the SerDes and the ASICs that ramp around those SerDes chipsets, be it switches, front-side bus, or call chips that goes into those data center switching that are now beginning to sell out there. And that's ramping up our business and we'll continue to ramp it up, we believe, over the next 2, 3 years as these programs launch and get larger and larger traction, more and more traction in the marketplace. So that's a big part of driving our wired infrastructure business, in my view, over the next 12 to 24 months. Overlaying on that, especially beyond 1 year, we see obviously optical products that are in wired infrastructure that goes hand-in-hand closely with our ASIC SerDes business actually having more and more traction as we design in proprietary fiber interconnects, so to speak, between those switches, between those routers, between data centers to data centers, or servers to data centers, all those new fiber interconnects that we are now in the midst of developing for multiple OEMs as well. So it's a strategy where we normally drive in wired infrastructure enterprise, networking, in other words, drive a new generation of IOs and chipsets that drive these data centers. We also are developing, hot on the heels of that, fiber interconnects that can take the high bandwidth requirements with very low power, very low thermal stresses, low thermal characteristics needed to support those very high-dense data centers. And all that will take place over the next 2 to 5 years, in my view. And we're very well positioned to be a major player in this area.",309

That's interesting. On our industrial business, actually 1/3, more than 1/3 -- at least 1/3 goes direct to large OEMs and about 2/3 or slightly less than 2/3 go through distribution. And we look at both very closely. Obviously, the direct OEM business would be the fastest in feeding back to us softness in the marketplace. Of course, those tend to be the big OEM players, which obviously play in a different market sometimes than the Tier 2 and Tier 3 players we run through our distribution. But how much warning? For direct business in the industrial business, it's really, really very good, very fast. We're pretty plucked into them. Our products are very, very strategic to their industrial systems, be it inverters, power generation systems, control systems or shared with servo motor systems. We are pretty plucked in, very strategic. So we get feedback very, very fast. And through that, it kind of gives us a parallel warning on what's likely to happen in the Tier 2, Tier 3 distribution accounts, where things tend to be a bit -- that tend to be more latency of information flow. But generally, because our direct OEM, which is at least 1/3 of our business, we get pretty fast feedback.",209
