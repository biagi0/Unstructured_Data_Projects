251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2017",2017-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3802.0,1135588.0,47069876.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,1,"Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report that Applied Materials delivered another record quarter in Q1. With earnings and orders exceeding all-time highs, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. As I look ahead, I see broad-based strength in our markets as large multiyear inflections evolve and new emerging demand drivers layer on top of mobility and computing. I'm also increasingly confident that Applied is positioned to sustainably grow faster than our markets as we realize the benefits of the investments we have been making in our organization and product pipeline.
In today's call, I'll begin with a quick recap of our strategy and provide an update on the key trends and industry inflections that are driving our growth. I'll then translate these into an outlook for Applied's markets before concluding with a brief overview for each of our businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our performance and his perspective on 2017 and beyond.
The significant changes in semiconductor and display technology that are taking place today depend on materials innovation. At Applied, our strategy is to deliver innovative materials engineering technologies to enable these major inflections. 
Across the company, we are focused on extending our innovation leadership and delivering solutions that enable customers to build the devices and structures that were never possible before. As I've outlined previously, there are 5 large multiyear inflections that are underpinning our record performance today and, we believe, will fuel our growth for years to come. I'm going to take a few minutes to provide an update on each of these drivers as well as describe how our strategy of inflection-focused innovation positions Applied for sustainable, profitable growth.
Let me begin with 10- and 7-nanometer technologies in foundry and logic. We are seeing significant investments by our customers to meet demand for leading-edge silicon to power increasingly capable mobile devices, 4K video and new compute-intensive applications like artificial intelligence in smart vehicles. This sustained investment in advanced technology plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses where we have unique capabilities and high market share.
The second driver is 3D NAND, which is a great example of materials-enabled scaling. We believe NAND bit demand grew about 45% in 2016 and that 2017 will be similar. Major memory companies are saying this growth rate is sustainable over the next several years. 
Our opportunity in NAND is also expanding. While 3D NAND has significant performance and power advantages, the bit density increase achieved moving from generation to generation is slower than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, more wafer starts are needed.
The third driver for Applied is patterning, a market which is growing rapidly. It's important to recognize that as customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. Some layers will move to EUV and others to multi-patterning. This means that even in the most aggressive EUV adoption case, our patterning opportunity still expands considerably. Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments. We increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in 2016, and we have significant room to grow.
Beyond semiconductor, another unique growth driver for Applied is advanced display where 2 major market inflections are underway. The first is rapid growth in large-format TVs, 60 inches and above, which is driving investment in new Gen 10.5 capacity as customers optimize factories for bigger screen sizes. We are now tracking 7 Gen 10.5 projects.
In parallel, there's a battle for leadership in next-generation mobile screens, and demand for our OLED manufacturing equipment is broadening. We see half of this demand coming from new entrants. As a result, in the past few months, our view of display spending has strengthened further. We now see customers increasing their investments by around $3 billion in 2017, $1 billion more than we thought in November. Our early view of 2018 is also positive.
The fifth driver I'll cover is China, which is an important long-term growth opportunity for Applied in both semiconductor and display. While we believe 2017 spending will be similar to last year, based on the new factory projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant ramp in investment in 2018 and beyond.
Now I'll translate these major inflections into our market outlook. Due to strong shipments in December, we now believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year at around $35 billion. We expect 2017 to be higher still, up 5% or more year-on-year.
Within this spending, we see strengths across the board, with foundry, NAND, DRAM and logic investments all growing relative to 2016. Our early view of 2018 wafer fab equipment is also positive for a number of reasons. We see foundry investment broadening. We believe memory fundamentals will remain strong, fueled by explosive growth in data and investment in new technologies. When we look at customers' total capital spending, we see healthy investment in new factory shells, and we expect spending in China to accelerate in 2018 and beyond.
Looking to the future, we're increasingly excited about trends in virtual and augmented reality, big data and artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. These new applications require major advances in silicon and display technology and create huge demand for memory. These new drivers layer on top of existing demand for mobility, PCs and other consumer electronics and have the potential to fuel a new phase of industry growth. All of this reinforces our perspective that our markets are becoming stronger and less cyclical.
I'll now provide a brief update on each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, 2016 was a big share gain year for Applied. While we'll wait for Gartner's final sizing in April before providing all the details, we believe we have gained around 2 points of overall wafer fab equipment share. These gains are broad based with especially strong adoption of our new products. In 2016, about 40% of our revenue came from products that we've launched in the past 3 years. We have great momentum and fully expect to add to these gains in 2017.
In our first quarter, semi equipment revenue and orders were at a 16-year high, with our highest orders ever in etch, CVD and Process Diagnostics and Control. 
In display, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and orders. Since 2012, we have grown display revenues around 20% per year, and we believe we'll book $2 billion of orders in 2017. As display technology becomes more complex, we are focused on building out our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need. We have great traction with our new thin-film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that we'll announce later this year.
In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products. We're focused on reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield, and optimizing output and operating cost for customers. We're seeing the impact of our investments and are increasing our share of the service opportunity. On a year-on-year basis, we have now grown our service business for 13 consecutive quarters, and our orders in Q1 were also an all-time high.
Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q1 was another record-breaking quarter, and we expect 2017 to be an outstanding year for the company. The large multiyear inflections that are driving our business remain firmly in place, and our markets are growing and becoming less cyclical. We expect wafer fab equipment and display investments to be up in 2017, and our initial view of 2018 is also positive. 
Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We are outperforming in semiconductor with strong share gains, sustainably growing our service business, and we are uniquely positioned to drive significant growth in display. Overall, we are increasingly confident that we can maintain our trajectory of sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our performance. 
Now I'll ask Bob to provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?",1333
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2017",2017-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3802.0,1135588.0,47069877.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Gary. Applied's momentum continues in the new fiscal year, with record orders and earnings both up substantially from a year ago, and we're guiding for new revenue and earnings records in Q2. For investors with a long memory, this kind of performance raises old questions about peaks and sustainability. However, I'm confident that our markets are materially better. And I believe that Applied's ability to deliver value and profitability is increasingly stronger and more sustainable.
Last quarter, I gave you numbers showing that the industry is now larger and significantly less volatile. Some of you did the math and saw that this is true. I believe investors will come to recognize that the industry, truly, is more attractive, owing to 3 important factors. First is that our customers have fully absorbed a tremendous amount of productivity. The list includes: the 300-millimeter wafer size transition; cycle time reductions; supplier consolidation, including the IDM-to-foundry transition; the shift to highly productive mega fabs; better inventory management; reuse strategies; and disciplined, profit-minded investment by our customers.
Second is capital intensity. A steadily rising amount of capital equipment is needed to build each type of chip, and customers increasingly need the kind of equipment Applied makes. For example, patterning smaller lines takes more CVD, CMP and etch steps. Logic and foundry chips need more metal layers and new materials. And 3D NAND memories add bits at a slower rate than 2D shrinks. You can see these factors playing out in the capital intensity curves of the industry.
Third is that we are seeing more demand drivers. In NAND, server farms are early in the transition from hard disks to solid-state drives. In logic and foundry, leading technology and automotive companies are designing custom, high-performance chips for artificial intelligence. Manufacturers are adding sensors, intelligence and communications into all kinds of commercial and consumer products, creating the Internet of Things. The additional data that's being created drives further demand for advanced processors and memory. And we have many engagements with new companies in China who are strategically committed to participate in future waves of growth. 
Gary mentioned that we expect WFE spending to be up by over 5% this year, which would give us the highest level of investment seen to date. 2017 investment does not include a wafer size transition as in 2000 or a surge in commodity DRAM investment as in 2007 or an unusually large year of MOCVD spending as in 2011. In fact, I believe our 2017 forecast reflects measured, prudent customer spending designed to meet strong demand patterns that we are seeing continue into 2018 and beyond.
Our customers will continue to benefit from making big investments in leading-edge capacity to power devices and the cloud. I believe concerns about the cost benefit of Moore's Law are anchored on the value of yesterday's applications. Consider the value being created by companies who are using technology to transform industries like advertising, retailing, transportation, television and travel. Today, they are making massive investments in new applications that depend on further innovations in processors, memories and displays and a lot more capacity. I see a very healthy future in this for Applied Materials.
At Applied, we changed the investment model to deliver higher returns. We aggressively shifted dollars from G&A to R&D and from sustaining R&D to impactful new product R&D. We significantly increased the percentage of winning products, and we accelerated our new product development timelines. These trends have multiplicative effects and are continuing. As a result, we are outperforming our markets and benefiting from delivering more valuable products and services to our customers.
Let's start with revenue growth. As Gary said, we expect WFE spending to grow by around 5% or more in calendar 2017. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate that our services group will grow at twice that rate. Our semiconductor systems business will grow at 4x that rate, and our display business will grow at more than 10x that rate. As a result, we are gaining share in our markets. 
The best indication of the value we provide is profit margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 45.4% in Q1, the second-highest since 2008. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, a 9-year high. And next quarter, we plan to be higher in both. Our revenue growth and margin expansion are resulting in strong free cash flow, which grew by more than 300% in Q1 from the same period last year. And we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.
In addition, we're closely monitoring the policy environment. As a U.S.-based manufacturer with strong exports and a global manufacturing network, we have a great deal of flexibility in adapting to the new policies being considered. 
Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q1 as compared to the same period last year. Orders of $4.2 billion were our highest ever and broad based. We had a 16-year high in semiconductor systems orders, record orders in services and very strong display orders of $632 million. In Q1, we grew company revenue by 45% and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 300 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew by 14% to the high end of the guidance range. Our ongoing spending discipline helped us to more than double our non-GAAP operating profit. We've reduced the non-GAAP tax rate by 6.2 points, and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 158%.
Next, I'll compare our segment performance during Q1 to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 57% and non-GAAP operating margin by 11.5 points. We grew services revenue by 12% and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points. We also grew display revenue by 66% and non-GAAP operating profit by 8.4 points.
On the balance sheet, we grew cash and investments by 23% to $5.1 billion, and about 36% remained onshore. We paid cash dividends of $108 million and used $130 million for stock buybacks, reducing the ending share count by 5% year-over-year to 1.08 billion.
Now I'll provide our guidance for the second quarter. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion. The midpoint would be up by 44% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 51%. Services revenues should increase by about 9%, and display revenue should increase by about 122%. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $645 million, plus or minus $10 million. And non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80, the midpoint of which would be up by 124% year-over-year.
In summary, we are raising the ceiling on our expectations for the industries we serve, and we believe our markets will remain stronger. We have fundamentally changed our investment model to deliver greater value to our customers, and we are seeing that value reflected in higher market share and profitability. This stronger performance is sustainable, resulting in greater free cash flow.
Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.",1164

So let me give you some context for how we think about the year and longer term. We are really driving, Farhan -- frankly, achieving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue and share profitability. That's how we think about the business and look at it. As for 2017, this will be another good year. We see WFE up 5% or more in the year. And then for our fiscal year, as I said in the call, our semiconductor revenue should grow at 4x that rate. Our services revenue should grow at 2x that rate, and our display revenue would grow at over 10x that rate. So if you look at it, we gave you actuals for Q1, guide for Q2, our full year should model, just as I said just now. And with that, I think you get a pretty good feel for the second half of the year for us.",152

How should we be thinking about the linearity of spend there first half, second half on a calendar year basis? And then considering -- I think you said in the prepared remarks, you expect to book roughly $2 billion of revenues there here in the calendar year. How should we think about the trajectory of revenues through calendar '18? And I guess, as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts on new product introductions and when we should think about weaving, I guess, incremental revenues from there in there as well.",99
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2017",2017-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3802.0,1135588.0,47069884.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,9,"Sure. I'll start, and Gary can jump in. Display continues to go up for us, frankly. In terms of the market context, when we did at the Analyst Day back in September in New York, we thought that the '16 would be WFE numbers of around $14.5 billion, as I remember. And we thought that next year would be about a similar number in fiscal -- in calendar '17. Now we're thinking now it's about $17.4 billion in '17. So the market is up about $3 billion from where we thought. In terms of our own performance, I'll do bookings first. We booked over $2 billion in '16. We weren't sure we could get that same volume in '17 because some of those '16 bookings shipped through '17 and '18. In fact, we now think the bookings are pretty close in '17 to what they were in '16. What's particularly interesting for me in that bookings mix for '17 is, if you go back to history, we used to be about 60% or so of our bookings were mobile, 65% some years; and about 35% for -- 65% for TVs, 35% mobile. It kind of flipped last year. We thought it would continue that this year. We're stronger in both this year. TV has come back strong. We mentioned the Gen 10.5 fab. We see 7 more of those we're tracking. So this year, we think we'll book about 55% for TV, 45% mobile. So strong in both, frankly. Then if you look at the revenues, which you asked about, this year, we think our revenues are going to be pretty strong throughout the year. In terms of the quarterization, it's a little lumpy. Our Q3 is likely a little stronger than our Q2, but pretty strong every quarter.",299
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2017",2017-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3802.0,1135588.0,47069885.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,10,"I could add a little bit more also, C.J., on display. So if you look at -- put display in perspective, it's a great example of our ability to take materials engineering into an adjacent market. And if you go over a 4-year period of time from 2012 to 2016, our orders have increased from around $400 million to $2 billion. So over $2 billion. About a 5x increase in 4 years in display, which is incredible. But again, it shows the ability to take our materials innovation technologies -- CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation -- into a new market. And we've talked about -- Bob talked about the TV sizes increasing and the 7 Gen 10.5 projects. OLED, mobile is also expanding to new customers. 50% of our demand going forward for this year is new customers for the mobile OLED. And then we're -- we've been focused on inflections and increasing our total available market. We've talked about tripling our served market as we go forward. And certainly, as these new technologies like OLED or flexible OLED are adopted, that increases our total available market. We have been driving new technologies like thin film encapsulation and e-beam review, again reusing technologies that we have within our semiconductor business into display. You asked about the new products that we've talked about. And what we said is that we'll announce those sometime during 2017. But what I would say -- and we're not going to do that today. But what I would say is that those projects are on track and tremendous customer pull and investment for those new opportunities.",270

Just on the loadings for the year. So if you look at your run rate in -- based upon what you just booked. And if I assume roughly 25% WFE share, which is what's in your model, you're sort of run-rating at roughly $44 billion, not -- I mean, now you have a [ph] good industry. And if the year is going to be $37 billion, the math would say that you have to get to $30 billion sometime during the back half of the year. Now maybe things don't fall off that much. But I'm just kind of wondering if you can sort of take those numbers and tell us if you think shipments are going to fall off during the back half of year, because the math seems to say that either shipments are going to fall off quite a bit or WFE is going to be a lot better than $37 billion this year.",169

Yes, so Tim, I gave you some color on the first half, second half for us a little bit. I'll give you a little more specific to your question. I don't know that the industry is running at quite $44 billion now. And our model was to get to 25.5% market share at '19. We think we're well on track for that. I'm not sure we're at that point right now. So in terms of the mathematics, a little bit different. Further, what I'll say to you is that the stuff I said to you earlier would imply the strong -- first half is strong. I don't dispute that. But what I will also tell you is that we have seen the Q3 and Q4 numbers for us firm up as we go month-by-month the last few months. So my take on it, '17 is a strong year. It's going to be a particularly strong year for Applied as we gain more share and display does well for us. We also think that '18, '19, we see growth drivers that are really good for us and the industry in the next couple years. Will the second half be as strong as the first half? Not sure it is, but the overall trends are positive.",215

Let me give you some color on China. So what we're looking at in '17 for China for Applied Materials is up versus 2016, maybe something like 10% up overall for us. And if you look at '17 versus '15, it's up maybe an additional $1 billion overall. Semi is slightly lower in that mix. Display is higher, and service is higher. If you look at '15 versus '17, we've had 2x growth -- or anticipating 2x growth in semi revenue and about 50% growth in service and display. And China is really one of our strongest regions, both with the multinational companies and the domestic companies there. What -- and as we spend a lot of time and we have very deep relationships with those -- the companies that are there, basically, what we hear is that there is a big strategic drive in investment in China. There is a big gap in terms of domestic supply versus demand, and then there is also a drive to build a secure supply chain. So I think all of us see announcements and very large investments over the next several years in China. In talking to those customers, they, I believe, understand that this is a long-term strategy. They have Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. And in the beginning, those investments aren't going to be as efficient, especially in the more advanced technologies. But what I would say is that very consistently, we see a strong drive from a strategic perspective for an increased investment in China. And really, what we're seeing is 2018 and beyond, a significant increase. Again, we increased semi revenue 2x from '15 to '17. If you ask me what do I think '17 to '19, that's going to be up a significant amount in semiconductor opportunity.",302

This year, we're going to book over $2 billion, but we'll bill a higher percentage. Now, it'll still be north of $1 billion. In terms of the outlook beyond '17, '18, we see a continuing strong book to bill -- continually strong bookings, but the book to bill kind of narrows. Last year it was like a 1.6 or 1.7 or something like that. It was a big number. So that's going to trend down over time, but it will stay positive for a while. Oh, OLED was -- OLED, if you look at last year, OLED booking -- just mobile bookings were 65% of the total. And of the mobile piece, which was 65%, the majority of that was OLED.",155

TV is pretty big in China this year. But drilling into your question more around OLED and mobile, as we said on the call last time, I think we repeated it this time, we had orders from 10 different OLED manufacturers in the last year. Predominantly, in the last couple of quarters, 9 of those were for mobile phones; 1 was a lighting guy. So if you look at the mobile guys it's proliferating such that beyond the #1 leader in OLED, we think that in '17 our orders for OLED mobile is going to be probably over half from the followers, not just in China though.",144

So if WFE is coming in at $37 billion this year and you guys think it'll hold up again next year, what's -- Bob, what's maybe a more reasonable range to think about earnings in fiscal '19? Because the $2.80 does look increasingly conservative.",85

There's a few things there. I think we'll do very well against that model. That model had a few assumptions. We kind of assumed a $34.5 billion WFE. And right now, we're running a little north of that, frankly. There was a $37 billion model we showed that same day, which was 3 17. The -- and the second thing that with the market environment in that model was we assumed that the display equipment spending was going to be north of the historical number of $8 billion, but not necessarily up to what we realized last year of $14.5 billion. So I would say, market environment, condition #1 in those models, I'm more optimistic that the environment in 2019 is north of the $34.5 billion, and I'm more optimistic that the market environment for the display spending is north of what we have in our model. So the market is positively biased towards our base model last year, which was at $2.80, okay? The second thing is the share position we had in both semi and display. And we said we'd do 25.5 points in semi, and we thought we'd be in a strong position in display. We are very confident of that. We gained 2 points in 2016 up to about 22. So we got to get about a point a year the next 3 years. We'll hit those numbers, I think. Probably some upside. And then in display, the market and our products look good against the revenue in that plan. So I'd say that the function of share and market results in a revenue opportunity against that model. I think what kind of pleases me as much as anything, frankly, what were result -- the result that we announced today and for next quarter is the margin profile. We had in the past iteration of the model, we didn't move much on the margins. We said at the base model, we'd be at 44.6% gross margins. And some people were a little skeptical because we haven't moved too much. We reported today, what was it, 45.2%, I guess -- or 45.4%. No, the actuals -- 45.4%. And then what we said about gross margins last quarter was that in fiscal 2017, we'd be up to about 44% in the year. And that was a gain of 0.8 point. We now think in fiscal '17 alone instead of 0.8 of a gain versus '16, we're going to gain 1.5 points. So if you look at that on the model you asked about, we're probably very comfortable that we can hit the 44.6% gross margin, which is at the $34.5 billion; and the 45.1%, which is the $37 billion, we're probably pretty comfortable. And then we maintain a pretty damn tight control on the operating expenses, too. So if you back out, because the guide we give for next quarter -- now next quarter is a good quarter -- its operating margin is north of 27%. So in the annual models we showed for '19, we showed operating margins of about 25.1% in the $34.5 billion and 26.4% in the $37 billion environment. So at the operating margin, we're making progress, right? And then if you finally go down to the URs [ph], we said we'd shrink the share count to 1.044 billion. We're confident we'll hit that. So we're not going to redo the model today. But around the market environment relative to that model, around our share position relative to the model, around our execution on gross margins, OpEx and share count, we're pretty confident that we'll hit or potentially beat that model.",608

You guys obviously have made great inroads in terms of etch and deposition, capital intensity, but also your own share gains. As you look at the industry moving to 64 layers and then eventually to 96 layers, one, how do you see the capital intensity trends for the market overall? And maybe secondly, for Applied, how do you see your competitive positioning increasing as the industry progresses?",81

So as we talked about overall, we gained 2 points of share in 2016. And actually, our strongest gains are in 3D NAND. And one of the really big drivers for our company is that 3D NAND is materials-enabled scaling versus litho-enabled scaling. I met 3 of the top 4 memory CEOs in the last month, all of them are very bullish. The pull that they have for 3D NAND is really tremendous. And if you look in servers, for instance, and the total cost of ownership and the power consumption -- I was in our data center, it's 80% less power consumption. And total cost of ownership is significantly better. So all of the people I'm talking to are very bullish about 3D NAND. Our position in 3D NAND, as we've talked about, we increased our TAM, our total available market, by a factor of 3. And when we're talking also about operating margins and our opportunities in display or in semi, our strategy is to focus on inflections. So we're winning share in inflections, and we're also delivering new capabilities. And so that comes through in 40% of our revenue being introduced -- or from products that were introduced in the last 3 years. Just in 2016, our etch revenue was up 30%; CVD, 33%; CMP revenue up 33%. Our e-beam product, another area where there's a big inflection, the largest part of our PDC business, up 33%. So we see tremendous pull. And as you go to these future generations of 3D NAND, it's really all about materials innovation, how you scale to those additional numbers of layers. And we're in a really great position. The pull that we have from our customers is earlier, deeper and broader than we've ever seen in the past. And then, Bob, you could -- Bob can talk maybe about the capital intensity.",328

Which to which? Which layer to which layer? Well, I'll see if I can fill in. So the capital intensity for 3D NAND, if you go from planar to, say, 50 layers, the total CapEx is about $3.6 billion -- $3.5 billion on planar. At sort of 48 layers it's about $5 billion for greenfield. Now I think the thing that interesting is if you go from a planar reuse to a 50-layer or 48-layer, the total CapEx to upgrade is $2.6 billion -- $3.2 billion, almost the same as the opportunity in planar at $3.5 billion. Now what's really interesting for companies like us and Lam Materials (sic) [ Research ] is very etch and deposition-intensive. Now what's particularly interesting for Applied Materials additionally to that, to be frank, one, we didn't have the products or incumbent positions at the planar position, so the level of reuse for Applied is very low. And you can see in our share gains, which have really been driven in etch, CVD and some in CMP, is around the share gains we have made within etch, CVD and CMP around some of these conversions from planar to 3D NAND and also some on DRAM. So one, total spend is bigger; two, it's really etch and deposition-intensive; and three, it's been really good for Applied Materials within those products in the transition.",235

Just from what your last report to this report, have you seen more broadening of demand in 7-, 5-nanometer or in the trailing-edge? Sounds like you got the feed [ph] on China. And then on EMIS, specifically around 7- or 5-nanometer, in terms of opportunity of growth in 7, 5, is it more just complex transistor technology that demand more of your product, because you guys are strong around transistor technology? Or is it like you expect share gain around patterning at 7- and 5-nanometer that allows you to grow in that as those nodes go into production?",111

So on broadening, this has been a year that's interesting in foundry. What might surprise you that -- of the trailing edge, and I'll define trailing edge as 28 -- 20-nanometer, 28-nanometer and above 45, it's 40% in '17 will be that's those nodes. And you got 55%, we think, for 7, 10, and about 5%, 14, 16. So what's the point? 40% of spend this year in the foundries is 20-nanometer and above. So it's really strong. Last year, it was about 38%. So in a bigger spend year, things are actually a bigger percentage, which is interesting. Now what's -- so what you have this year is spending by the biggest foundry leader pretty strong and pretty big spending at the trailing nodes. And the opportunity you have to sustain foundry spending, which people are questioning about next year, is that we think that in '18, we're going to have continued spending at the trailing edge. We think, secondly, we're going to have a broadening of foundry spending, particularly next year. You asked about broadening spend. I think it's a bigger impact next year. Because when you look at the shells they're putting up and the opportunities in SMIC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in China and places like that, you're going to see some broadening of that. In terms of the leading edge on 10, 7, by the end of this year, you're going to have 120,000 to 140,000 wafer starts of capacity for 10 and 7. We think that could probably, at its peak, double, so there's still some chance at broaden out 10, 7 next year. So next year, we're not pessimistic on foundry. We think there's obviously, a, the trailing edge stays strong, number one; number two, we see some still significant additions for 10, 7 whether it's conversions or greenfield; and three, we see broadening amongst some of the customer base.",329

And we're seeing more steps and an increase in our total available market as you go to 7-nanometer. In addition to the 3 memory CEOs I met, I also met the Head of R&D for our largest logic and foundry customers within the last month. And what I would say is that we have stronger pull for earlier, deeper and broader collaborations than we've ever had in the history of Applied Materials. And one of the things that we're really focused on, if you go past 7 nanometers, how do we enable our customers to build devices that they could never build before. So certainly we have great pull for new products like Selectra, which again gives designers a capability that they never had before in designing new types of devices. And you will definitely see, and we're seeing, the ability to grow as fast as we can qualify with this kind of new capability. We have new films that our customers are adopting for 5-nanometer and beyond that also enable them to design devices in different ways. And certainly the transistor, interconnect -- patterning is another area we have talked about, where we have tremendous pull with Sym3 across the board for logic and foundry customers. The Selectra, Olympia, Precision CVD, PROVision, the LK Prime for CMP. We're in the early innings of adoption of many of those products. And as you go beyond 7, the opportunities for us even become much larger for these products and other products that we have in our pipeline. So for me, those conversations with those people running R&D are incredibly exciting, and the pull is really tremendous for Applied.",314

So the first part of the question would be, are you seeing that? And to what extent is that realized? And the second part of the question is, there should also be in that environment increased free cash flow predictability. And how does the company think about, in a more stable environment, more seasonal environment, increasing systematic cash return or cash actions to create value?",129

One, the volatility question; two was the benefits to the operating margins from volatility; and three, the benefits to cash returns. So in terms of the volatility, I completely agree with you, the volatility is trending down. Almost every metric we look at indicates that. I mean, the long-term metrics or the demand drivers for the industry are much more diverse and sustainable. And then layer on that, you got all these technology conversions. But I was just looking at some data today that -- the volatility is down, but within Applied, it's down, too, because we're a much broader company. So I'll give you a couple of data points that I hadn't shared before. So if you just look at our revenue split in semi in '15, '16 and '17, our percent that was memory has stayed pretty steady at 48%, 47%, 47%. And then the percent that's been foundry has ranged from 38% to 42%; and logic's 12% or 13%. So within device type, we are much stronger than we used to be. And we project in 2017 that our market share by device type in NAND, DRAM, foundry, and logic, in all 4 of the major categories, will be 21.5% or above, whereas we used to have a 10-, 15-point spread between our low -- some of our low memory ones and our high foundry. We've gotten a lot stronger in memory, okay? So the volatility in the industry is down, and the volatility within Applied is down a lot. And then you layer in the strength in the service business, which has grown a lot, and the display business, which has grown a lot and it's sustainable. So I agree with you on the volatility number. Where will we see the benefits in the operating margin? Looking to see them in a few places. One, we'll grow our revenue line, and it'll be more predictable. So that results in a few things. One is you tend to use factory utilization higher. So cost of goods sold, gross margins tend to trend up. So if you look at the benefits on gross margin, we are just grinding away on material costs and factory utilization, and that's helping us on these gross margins. As I said earlier in the call, we thought our gross margins would be up this year by 0.8 point to 44 points. We now think we're going to be up 1.5 points. And a lot of this kind of is just efficiency, griding away, sustainability, less -- more predictable, less volatility we talked about. And then I said earlier in the call that we predict our operating margins in Q2 to be north of 27%. So we are seeing it in the numbers, the company is becoming more efficient, more effective with the products we're doing. But also with this, less volatility is contributing. We are now, for instance, in our factories looking at being much more aggressive in what we ship in the first 4 weeks of a quarter to even more level-load our factories. So you're 100% right. In terms of the benefits to the investors, we are starting to generate significant -- more significant cash returns. So if you look at the operating cash flow, it was 20% this quarter, which is very high for us in Q1. Last year, Q1 was kind of like 9%. So we are doing it. Now the question is getting it back to investors. We are going to do it. We didn't do too much last quarter because of some -- we were looking at foundry [ph] conditions around what's going to change in the tax laws, movement of cash between overseas and U.S. But we see -- one, we are committed to do it; two, we think we'll have the flexibility to do it; and three, some of the changes that are being proposed in Washington may be beneficial to us in multiple ways: long-term tax going to a territorial system around a worldwide system. So I think it's a great opportunity for the investors of Applied on this.",694

I'll tell you what's encouraging for me in some of this stuff, if you look at NAND and DRAM -- I was looking at NAND the other day, and I'll do DRAM in a second. We look at NAND bit growth in supply as pretty much in line and growing about 45% a year. And that's 45% over a bigger and bigger installed base. So the end-use demand for NAND is pretty damn strong. And DRAM is pretty similar. We see bit demand in '16 up about 30%, and then we see server DRAM up about 40%, 45% in '17. And supply has been a little tighter. We see '17 it's only -- supply bit growth is only about 25% to 30%. And then we see a lot of smartphone consumption out for new Android 6 GB and the Apple third generation. But what's good for Applied is our market share within DRAM is up about 5 points from 2012 to '15, and we think we're going to get another point in '16. So we think, one, this marketing demand for DRAM and NAND is growing pretty healthily; two, it's growing pretty disciplined, more frankly. Even with the NAND capacity additions, what we see is big demand drivers for more NAND. For instance, another factoid I don't think we gave you is that as the solid-state drives become more and more cost-effective, there's probably going to be a need for up to about 500,000 more wafer starts greenfield to add capacity to what they have today. In other words, if you look in the world, there used to be about 1.4 million wafer starts of NAND. Now we might be 1.6 million wafer starts, but that's not even enough. Over the next 4 years, they probably have to add another 500,000 just for servers. Each 100,000 of NAND is worth about $5 billion. That's about $5 billion that they have to add to reach their growth in their markets. So what's the point? Good growth drivers for NAND and DRAM, number one. Number two, pretty disciplined even with the capacity they do in our NAND because their markets expanding; three, our position has gone up. We'll have gained -- by the time we're done in '16, we'll probably have gained about 7 points both NAND and DRAM from 2012.",397

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2017",2017-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3802.0,1135588.0,47069930.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,55,"We talk about a lot of esoteric stuff here: bit growth and materials engineering. When I step back even more than a few years ago, I think Applied has a really good business. I mean, if you look at our markets in which we compete are doing really well, better than they were years ago. Our position is much better. And as somebody answered on the call, our better execution and the less volatility of the market is resulting in significant improvement in operating margin to cash flow. So we have a really good business. And what we're doing here is driving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue share and profitabilities.
So the 3 things as I summarize again is, one, our markets are getting better, bigger and less volatile. WFE and display are both strong with positive long-term outlook. We have strong share, as I said, in all device types. We're up in memory in particular and foundry, we've always been strong. And then display is doing very well. And if you look at our service business, which was $2 billion back in 2013, we're going to hit the $3.2 billion in 2019. So that's grown a lot. And that's a very strong baseline business. 
Second, our execution is better. Our deep pipeline of products enabled by the product development engine where 40% of our equipment revenue now is generated from products we've introduced in the last 3 years. We have multiple years of share gain. And look, I don't think we mentioned it on the call, we have record backlog of $5.5 billion this quarter. So that's all around better execution.
And finally, the question I just got asked, the ability to return cash is better than ever. Revenue is outpacing our markets. Operating margin is growing. As I said, we're going to be over 27% next year, and we have a great deal of flexibility to return more cash to shareholders. So I just think Applied's got really good business when you cut through it. So I feel really good about the business.",345

I'm very happy to report another record-breaking quarter for Applied Materials with the highest revenue and earnings in our history. We've now set earnings records for 4 quarters in a row, and as I look across the company, I see tremendous momentum. Our markets are strong and getting stronger and we're sustainably growing faster than these markets by expanding our served opportunity and gaining share.
In today's call, I will provide our perspective on the factors driving the industry and our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth within this environment. I will then describe the key inflections and investments within our markets before concluding with updates on our major businesses. Bob will then provide additional detail about our performance and outlook.
Let me start with the big picture. This is an incredibly exciting period for the electronics industry, with a broader set of drivers and a wider spectrum of companies making very large investments to advance semiconductor and display technology. In the past, PCs were the dominant factor in semiconductor demand. PCs drove the technology road map and enterprise refresh cycles drove industry upturns and downturns. More recently, global adoption of smartphones, combined with social media, have created a much more pervasive consumer demand, expanding the market and making it substantially less cyclical. Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. The impact for Applied is twofold. First, our markets are growing and becoming more stable. Second, this is a period of incredible innovation in logic, memory and display, and we are in a great position to provide the critical building blocks needed to move the industry forward.
At Applied, our strategy is to be the innovation leader in markets that are evolving faster than ever before. To do that, we fueled innovation by reallocating resources and significantly increasing our investment in new product development. Then, to drive repeatable success and accelerate the pace of learning, we've developed a unique operating system, our product development engine, and trained more than 10,000 employees how to use it. Across the organization, we're focused on delivering highly differentiated products and services that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. I believe our innovation leadership is sustainable because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities. Our ability to combine unique competencies, technology and intellectual property, accelerates our innovation process and sets us apart from competitors.
Having provided this context, I'll now describe the major inflections and investments taking place within our markets. Sales of memory chips are at record levels, fueled by increasing content in smartphones to support better cameras and VR applications as well as the need for more and higher performance storage in data centers. Market fundamentals remain strong and as a result, we are seeing robust investment from our memory customers. We believe we will see double-digit growth in DRAM spending this year, and we expect NAND investment to be even stronger. Our view of 2018 and beyond is also positive for a number of reasons. The explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, big data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. Data generation from new categories, such as Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles, can potentially dwarf existing applications within a few years. As 3D NAND bit density increases and cost per bit falls, new segments of the storage market are opening up for solid-state drives. And at the same time, the bit density increase from generation to generation is slower for 3D than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, the industry needs more wafer starts and greenfield capacity.
In foundry, we're also seeing an acceleration of investment, both at the leading edge and in trailing geometries. In 2017, we expect investment in new leading edge capacity to make up about 60% of total foundry spending. This is driven by demand for more sophisticated smartphone processors as well as customers positioning to win the major inflections in high-performance computing and data centers that are needed to start unlocking the potential of AI. Within foundry, logic and DRAM, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities in patterning. As these customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. A limited number of layers will move to EUV, but significantly more will move to multi-patterning. This means our patterning opportunity will expand considerably over the coming years. Applied is making significant investments to enable the patterning road map. We've already increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in the past year and still have significant room to grow.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year could be up about 15% relative to 2016, and our outlook for 2018 and beyond remains positive. Our expectations for the display market also continue to strengthen as a result of large inflections in both TV and mobile screen technology. Average TV sizes are expected to reach 44.5 inches in 2017, up 5 inches in the past 3 years. One of the key factors driving this growth is demand for large-format TVs, 60 inches and above. As customers optimize factories for these bigger screen sizes, they are investing in new Gen 10.5 capacity. In parallel, we see investment in mobile OLED getting stronger as confidence in the adoption rates of OLED technology increases. Recent forecasts indicate that 2/3 of new smartphones could have OLED displays by 2021 and screen manufacturers are accelerating their investment plans accordingly.
My final comments about the market environment relate to China, which is an important long-term growth opportunity for Applied. We believe 2017 spending will be slightly higher than last year. And based on the projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant and steady investment ramp in both semiconductor and display beginning in 2018.
I'll now provide updates on the performance and priorities for our major business groups. Overall, Applied gained 2 points of wafer fab equipment share in 2016 and based on the strength of our product portfolio, I believe will add to those gains over the next several years. In our leadership businesses, such as PVD, epi, implant and thermal processing, where we have strong share and highly differentiated products, we're extending our advantage. The available market for our leadership products is also growing, specifically in PVD and CMP. In PVD, we expect our available market to expand by more than 30% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology for lower power devices. And the CMP market grew 40% in 2016 and is on track to grow another 20% this year, primarily driven by increasing steps in 3D NAND.
In our high-growth businesses, we are also outperforming our competitors in markets that are growing rapidly. In 2016, we gained about 5 points of share in conductor etch and 2 points in etch overall. This means that since 2012, we've won nearly 20 points of conductor share and 10 points of total etch share. These gains are driven by enabling technologies, like Sym3 and selective etch and new process steps. Our CVD business is also outpacing the market, gaining almost 6 points of market share in 2016. We have great momentum in these businesses and plenty of headroom to grow.
Service represents a stable and growing revenue stream for the company. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown service revenues for 14 consecutive quarters and our compound rate of growth has been around 10% over the past 4 years. Our expanding portfolio of service solutions plays an increasingly important role for customers, helping them compress ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimize output and operating costs. Because of this, I'm confident that we can continue to grow service at a similar pace.
Another exciting growth opportunity for Applied is display. Since 2012, we've grown display revenues around 20% per year, and we have great momentum. This year, we're on track to book more than $2 billion of orders. Display technology and manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex and Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. By leveraging our semiconductor experience and capabilities, we are delivering the innovative products our customers need to accelerate major technology transitions.
Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q2 was another record-breaking quarter and 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for Applied. Our markets are becoming even more attractive. They are growing sustainably and becoming less volatile. And Applied is playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road map. We have focused our strategy and investments to ensure that Applied is the innovation leader that consistently delivers highly differentiated products and services. As a result, we're raising the ceiling for our performance and potential. We're setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share.
Now, let me hand the call over to Bob.",1542
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, May 18, 2017",2017-05-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3866.0,1214880.0,49694994.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Gary. Before going into the details of the quarter, I'll touch on 3 things that are sustainably better for Applied: one, our markets; two, our improving position in those markets, which is enabling stronger gross margin performance; and three, our profitability and free cash flow.
First, our markets are more attractive. We believe wafer fab equipment spending will be higher and less volatile for the foreseeable future. Display equipment spending also looks higher and more attractive, for Applied Materials in particular, because we're greatly increasing our served addressable market. Many of you have added valuable insights as to why WFE has become larger and less volatile. I believe it boils down to 3 things: one, the semiconductor market is growing and becoming more diverse; two, equipment intensity is increasing; and three, capital investment is measured and rational.
This better industry environment is sustainable. As Gary mentioned, the semiconductor industry we enable has also become larger, more diverse and more critical to big innovations in the global economy. Today, we're seeing the emergence of new silicon-rich devices needed to enable the Internet of Things, cloud data centers and artificial intelligence. Data is becoming more valuable and harnessing the value requires silicon. For Applied, this translates to higher demand for logic and memory capacity at both the leading edge and trailing geometries. I believe the industry has seen a new wave of sustainable growth with economic value creation that justifies the cost of investment.
Next, Applied's position in the markets is sustainably stronger. The changes we've made since 2013 in strategy, capital allocation and business systems like the product development engine, have given us our strongest product pipeline in many years. I've been invited to an industrials conference this month to explain how our products are enabling big changes in manufacturing that many people call Industry 4.0. Here is how I plan to summarize our contribution without going into all of the technology.
Applied has a very strong overall business that can be separated into just 2 parts. First, we have our leadership semi equipment and services business, which together generate nearly 60% of our revenue. Our leadership semi businesses drive technologies that are critical to making transistors for data processing and networking. We've maintained steady growth and high share positions averaging about 70% because we bring unique value to our customers. Our services business is similar in that it is highly enabling to our customers and characterized by steady, profitable growth. We are deeply engaged with our logic and foundry customers to enable their advanced road maps with this part of our business. When you think about the big new chips used for artificial intelligence, think of Applied Materials.
Second, we have our high-growth businesses, which include etch and deposition used in 3D NAND and multi-patterning, along with inspection and display. Our high-growth businesses now represent about 40% of our revenue. We've made outsized investments in new and disruptive products in these areas to capitalize on the inflections we identified in 2013. Our high-growth semi businesses have been growing 40% faster than their markets and Applied's unique display equipment business is growing even faster.
Another way to measure Applied's stronger position in the markets is to consider the changes in our share by semiconductor device type. In 2012, our share in foundry was over 20%, but our share in logic, DRAM and NAND was under 15%. Today, we believe our share is at least 22% in all 4. In fact, we are the #1 equipment company by revenue in NAND, DRAM, logic and foundry. So regardless of the spending mix, Applied is well positioned.
A great measure of the strength of our products, the value they bring to our customers and our execution as a company is gross margin expansion. Since 2013, we have increased our gross margins in our semi, services and display segments across virtually every business unit. In 2017, I believe we will deliver company non-GAAP gross margin of about 46%, which would be up by about 5 points versus 2012, and the company's best annual performance in a decade.
Now I'll talk about how these changes are flowing through the income statement to enable stronger profitability and shareholder returns. Over the 2013 to 2016 period, we have grown the revenue line by 44%. When we compared 2017 to 2013, we can see revenue growth of 90%. This revenue growth demonstrates the compounding benefits of our share gains and new product penetrations across semi, services and display. For the year, we expect our top line growth, gross margin performance and disciplined R&D investment and spending to generate the highest non-GAAP operating margin of the past 17 years and free cash flow of 20% or more. The company has returned 100% of the free cash flow we generated over the past 5 years and stands committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.
Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q2. As a reminder, we no longer report quarterly orders because we are focused on driving year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. Quarter-to-quarter demand patterns can vary across our business. However, we have grown our revenue and non-GAAP EPS on a year-over-year basis in 14 of the past 15 quarters. In Q2, we grew company revenue by 45% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 3.6 points. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew by only 14% over this period, and we continue to invest 2/3 of OpEx in R&D to fuel our product development engine. We set new company records in profitability as we increased non-GAAP operating profit by 110% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share by 132% year-over-year.
Now I'll compare our Q2 segment performance to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 51% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating margin by 9.7 points. We grew services revenue by 14% to a record $724 million, and non-GAAP operating margin by 80 basis points. We more than doubled our display revenue to $391 million and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9 points.
Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash from operations by 87% compared to the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and investments, and nearly half was onshore. This increase includes proceeds from $2.2 billion in debt raised in March to increase onshore liquidity. Soon after the end of the quarter, we used approximately $200 million of the offering to redeem our October 2017 notes. We returned $390 million to shareholders in the quarter, paying $108 million in dividend and using $282 million to repurchase 7 million shares of stock at an average price of $38.15.
Now, I'll provide our third quarter guidance. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion. The midpoint would be up by 30% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 41%. Services revenue should increase by about 13%. And display revenue should increase by about 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $665 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87, the midpoint of which would be up by 66% year-over-year.
Finally, to help you with your models, we project revenue in Corporate and Other to be around $15 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses of about $42 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10.2%. And in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be around $675 million. The projected increase is primarily targeted at R&D for new opportunities we are pursuing in emerging inflections.
To summarize: one, our markets are sustainably better than at any other time in the history of the company; two, our competitive position and execution is sustainably better, giving us a strong pipeline of new and disruptive products and gross margin expansion; three, this growth, combined with disciplined investment and spending, is generating higher free cash flow, and we are committed to returning the excess to our shareholders.

Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than a point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it's starting with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? We're kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we are facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer-term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM, and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is in the intermediate-term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers, which are both driving us, which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long-term, which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years, and I think it's sustainable.",450

If you look out over time, what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And if you go forward, you talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries: transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory, which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer-term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward.",204

But especially on sort of memory in China, and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018?

China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap, and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018.

Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on the calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE, roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right.",126

The first one, we raised money, frankly, from an opportunistic point of view and, frankly, a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate's about 3.8%. So basically what we'll bring in to our capital structure is long-term debt at low rates, that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing is many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next, which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we are very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model, which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So our take on it is the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year is continuing to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year.",444

So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enabled memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past.",233

So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity, and that is broadening out to a large number of customers, and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers, and we are focused on the biggest technology challenges.

So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting to swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND far -- versus hard disk drive will trend up, and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition [ one ] 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same.",260

We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what are the applications driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see this AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much is AI? No. But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number, and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside.

If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data, and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long-term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers.",104

You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvements across the board?",74

If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third, which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really 3 things: how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So that this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better. Now we are benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins.",281

We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent, which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as the more structural aspect versus just better pricing?",152

Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020, and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we started to look at root cause, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of these budgets' being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably got a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good, and I do think it goes to this longer-term trends data in NAND. So then if you look at -- the final thing is, you say, well, how come you guys were low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes, which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is, I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. We say, okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers. At a simple level, it was, hey, use these PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you got all this big data stuff in content, which is going up. That's what's really happened last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis. They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative of what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think there are data that shows it's not overbought now, and there are longer-term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable.",526

Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front?",73

Although Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TVs are largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones, which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it'll keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you had extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we are tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those -- that equipment's just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think they spend about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good.",283

So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT?",57
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, May 18, 2017",2017-05-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3866.0,1214880.0,49695036.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,44,"Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see, and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars, WFE content, similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years.",197

The question is, to what extent is that more of a near-term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer-term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months?",91

I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE, and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%, we're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up, and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline's good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model.",346

There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent, is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going down. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better.",319

Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen.

I think it was averaging like 15%, and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long-term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years?

I think that the mix will probably morph over time to dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not what -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increase in yield.",177

And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year?",161

And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In the inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing a significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business, which is our largest part of PDC, which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15.

Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher, and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we are executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way.

With revenue and profits at all-time highs, I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials has now delivered earnings records for the past 5 quarters. We have tremendous momentum and a very positive outlook for the future. Our markets are growing with a broader set of demand drivers. Across a wide variety of industries, companies are making huge investments to drive transformative changes that shift economic value towards technology. At the very foundation of these emerging trends is Applied. And we are playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road maps in semiconductor and display. Our broad portfolio of technologies and businesses, combined with our strategy and investment, means that Applied has never been in a better position. This gives me confidence that we will continue to expand our available opportunity, gain share and outperform our markets.
In today's call, I'll outline key industry trends as well as our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. I'll then provide additional details about our markets and major businesses. Bob will then discuss how we're translating our broad portfolio of capabilities and products into differentiated performance for Applied. And after that, Dan will provide his initial impressions about our future opportunities as well as our outlook for the next quarter.
I'll start with the backdrop for today's discussion. These are incredibly exciting times for Applied, and I strongly believe that we have more opportunities today than at any point in our history. There are 3 main reasons for this. First, our markets are strong and getting stronger. Pervasive demand for electronics means that our markets are getting larger and substantially less cyclical. New demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. The Internet of Things, Big Data and artificial intelligence will transform industries over the coming years. In health care, transportation, manufacturing and retail, competition is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data and images. In these industries and many more, value is shifting towards semiconductors and displays. To realize the potential of IoT, Big Data and AI, major technology inflections are needed to advance the road maps in logic, memory and display. These inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and as the leader in materials engineering, Applied has a fundamental role to play.
Second, Applied is better positioned than ever before. We've aligned the company around our innovation leadership strategy, and we've made significant investments to accelerate R&D. We have developed a strong portfolio of differentiated products, with more in the pipeline. It's the company's breadth and depth of products and capabilities that sets us apart from the competition. We have, by far, the largest exposure to industry inflections, and we're combining our skill sets in deposition, removal, materials modification, inspection and metrology to deliver innovative, new solutions.
Third, we built a platform that gives us sustainable advantages over the long term. We've done this by strengthening our technical and management teams and putting in place a company-wide operating system, the Product Development Engine, that delivers repeatable success. Across the organization, I see stronger execution. Our product success rate is higher, we are transferring new technology to market faster and we're using our breadth more effectively.
I'll now describe the major inflections and investments within our markets. In memory, near-term market fundamentals remain strong, driven by high-performance storage for data centers and increasing smartphone content to support new features, including 3D cameras. We expect healthy investment in memory to continue as the explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, Big Data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. To keep up with demand, customers are aggressively pursuing their 3D NAND scaling road map, which has 4 major levers: increasing the number of pairs, shrinking film and stack heights, multi-tier schemes and lateral scaling. All these approaches are enabled by advanced materials engineering and expand Applied's opportunity.
In foundry, market dynamics are equally healthy. In the near term, we see capacity additions at trailing geometries to meet growing demand for sensors and IoT devices as well as strong investment in the leading edge. Looking ahead, advances in artificial intelligence are beginning to drive significant architectural changes, and customers are positioning themselves to win the major inflections in high-performance computing. In data centers designed for AI workloads, we see logic content growing at least twice as fast as memory. And as technology complexity increases, capital intensity is also growing about twice the rate of memory.
In foundry, logic and DRAM, dimensional scaling of devices remains a challenge, with 2 primary areas of focus: resolution and placement accuracy. New innovations in patterning are becoming increasingly important as customers move to advanced nodes. First, self-aligned multi-patterning techniques, SADP and SAQP, are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution road map. Regardless of the rate of EUV adoption, we expect our opportunity in traditional multi-patterning to grow. Applied has great momentum in this market and has gained 16 points of share since 2012. Second, new patterning approaches are being developed to address placement errors. As devices scale, the accuracy of vertical alignment between interconnect layers has a significant impact on performance and reliability. Placement errors cannot be addressed by advanced lithography alone and will require materials-enabled solutions. Applied has unique technology in this area, and we expect our opportunity to grow significantly over the next several nodes.
Looking at the market as a whole, our outlook is incrementally more positive. We now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year will be up 20% or more compared to 2016. We also expect 2018 spending to be higher than our current estimate for 2017. And in these forecasts, we made conservative estimates for spending in China. In addition, within wafer fab equipment, the ongoing shift to materials-enabled solutions in memory and logic opens up new opportunities for Applied. We now address 64% of the total market compared to 53% in 2012. Beyond semiconductor, our outlook for the display market has also strengthened. Display is growing even faster than wafer fab equipment as customers make multiyear investments to address large inflections in both TV and mobile. In TV, a major push to new Gen 10.5 substrates is underway. These huge 10-square-meter substrates are ideally suited for manufacturing larger format screens, 60 inches and bigger. We now expect 13 new Gen 10.5 factories to be built over the next several years. At the same time, mobile OLED investment is getting stronger as customers prepare for broad adoption of OLED in smartphones. OLED enables new form factors that result in a larger display area per smartphone, further expanding the overall market.
I'll now provide brief updates for our major business groups. Our semiconductor leadership businesses, where we have strong market share and highly differentiated products, are having an outstanding year, fueled by investment in leading-edge foundry and expanding applications in memory. Demand for our PVD and CMP products is especially strong. We expect the PVD market to grow by around 45% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology. And the CMP market is on track to grow 40% this year on top of 40% growth in 2016. Our CMP revenues were at an all-time high this quarter and on track to exceed $1 billion for the fiscal year. In our semiconductor growth businesses, we have great momentum in markets that are growing rapidly. Over the past several years, we have gained significant market share in both etch and CVD. Our combined etch and CVD revenues are at record levels, and we're in a great position to drive further growth.
Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio that has grown significantly. This year, we're seeing an acceleration of that growth. We delivered record performance this quarter, and for the year, we expect revenues to be up more than 15% over 2016. Demand for our service solutions is driven by our rapidly growing installed base, plus our customers' need to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs. We are investing to expand the services we offer, and we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth in this business. In display, as technologies and manufacturing are becoming more complex, Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. This year, display revenues are on track to increase more than 50% over 2016. And based on our strong position, we expect to grow display at least another 30% in 2018.
Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied is executing well, setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. I would like to thank our employees for their passion to create value for customers and Applied. I'm confident that together, we will raise the bar further. Applied is in a great position, working at the sweet spot of major trends that will drive tremendous shifts in economic value over the coming years. Finally, our breadth and depth differentiate us from our competitors. We have wider exposure to major industry inflections, and we are bringing together the broadest skill sets and technology portfolio to create new solutions for our customers and accelerate innovation.
Now let me hand the call over to Bob.",1547
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2017",2017-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3592.0,1284889.0,51926527.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll add my comments about the business environment, describe how our capabilities and products are driving competitive and financial performance and invite Dan to share his perspective, along with our Q4 guidance.
As you contemplate the markets, including record levels of demand for semiconductors and displays, I'd like you to note 3 things. First, I feel increasingly confident that our markets are becoming materially and sustainably larger. Gary explained the big picture, and I'll add some data regarding the near-term environment.
In semiconductor, 2/3 of NAND demand is driven by smartphones and SSDs. NAND demand for these devices is projected to grow by more than 40% in 2017 and 2018. Smartphones and servers drive the majority of the DRAM market. And demand from these devices should be up by 30% or more in both 2017 and 2018. In foundry, our largest customer recently announced that its 7-nanometer tapeout expectations have nearly doubled. And we continue to see new investment at trailing geometries as well. So the largest drivers of WFE demand are strong.
In display, OLED is quickly becoming the preferred technology for leading brands. Yet, the installed capacity supports less than 40% of the smartphone market. And the increasing technical complexity in semi and display gives us a growing opportunity in services. In short, I expect sustainable growth for our markets and particularly for Applied.
Second, Applied is uniquely well positioned in this improving environment, and we're driving growth and competitive performance across our markets. Applied has incredible breadth. And we're taking advantage of it across our semi and display businesses to help our customers solve their highest-value problems, with solutions based on unique combinations of our technologies. The investments we've made in our new product pipeline are already impacting the market. In 2017, we're delivering strong, double-digit revenue growth in every semiconductor device type. We project our share to be up for the sixth year in a row. And our share is balanced at greater than 22% across memory, logic and foundry. In patterning, we see continued growth and share gains because we're shipping newly designed products that address both line shrinks and edge placement errors. We've also put our services business on a growth trajectory, adding $1 billion in annualized revenues since 2013. And we built a unique and more diverse growth engine in display. In 2012 and 2013, our annual display revenue averaged $657 million. We expect to deliver a similar amount in the current quarter. Our display business is also becoming more profitable, and we're now targeting operating margins in the high 20s. So Applied has the broadest capability, largest served market opportunity and strongest new product pipeline of any company in the industry.
Third, and perhaps best of all, Applied's innovation engine and operating discipline are driving higher profitability. The value that our technology brings to the industry is increasing, and that's reflected in our gross margin, which has grown by 5 points over the past 5 years. In Q3, our gross margin was the highest in 9 years. At the same time, we remain focused on expense control. In Q3, our non-GAAP OpEx-to-sales ratio was 17.9%, a record low. As a result, we delivered our first quarter with $1 billion in operating profit, and we had record cash from operations equal to 36% of revenue.
Next, I'll comment on our Q3 performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew company revenue by 33% and non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 67% and increased non-GAAP operating margins by 5.9 points to a 16-year high of 28.7%. And we grew non-GAAP EPS by 72% to a record of $0.86 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash and investments to $8.3 billion, and 40% was onshore. We repurchased 9 million shares of our stock and returned $482 million to shareholders, including dividends.
Turning now to our segment performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% to a record $2.5 billion and grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars to a record of $920 million. We grew services revenue by 20% to a record $786 million and increased non-GAAP operating profit dollars to a record of $215 million. We grew display revenue by 31% and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 2.6 points.
In summary, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our teams, and I'm pleased with our top and bottom line growth. Applied's innovation engine is delivering sustainable momentum for profitable growth.
Now I'll hand the call over to Dan.",756

You've given me a warm welcome and a great introduction to the technologies we're preparing to launch into a growing market for our products. I'm incredibly impressed by the depth of our technical talent. Applied has a world-class team, and I believe we can do anything we set our minds to.
Gary and Bob talked about new advances in technology that are going to make dramatic change to our industries and to our lives. I saw this unfolding at my previous companies, and I'm excited to be here because these changes are enabled by semiconductors and displays, which begin with what we do at Applied Materials. I'll share more of my impressions about Applied at our Analyst Day in New York.
One thing that's already clear to me as a financial person is that Applied has a tremendous portfolio. The leadership semi businesses Gary talked about have some of the strongest product positions and profitability I've seen anywhere in this industry. The semiconductor growth businesses Gary mentioned are dramatically outpacing their markets. Etch is up 5x over the past 5 years, growing at 2.5x the rate of the market, and that's just one example. Display is growing faster than semi, and we have technologies in the pipeline that will enable us to grow beyond what we can do in OLED smartphones and LCD TVs. And services are a great way to drive growth and diversify the company in areas that are particularly stable and cash-generative. Applied's portfolio is incredibly valuable. I'm excited to be a part of this team, and I'll use all of my energy to help drive Applied's innovation engine and growth.
Now I'll provide our fourth quarter guidance. In Q4, we expect our overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 19% year-over-year. We expect our semiconductor systems revenue to increase by about 14% year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year. And display revenue should be up by about 48% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of about 46%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $685 million, plus or minus $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.94, the midpoint of which would be up by 36% year-over-year.
To help you with your models for the calendar year, I'll share some of our early views on Q1 of fiscal 2018. We believe semiconductor systems revenue in Q1 is likely to be higher sequentially and higher year-over-year, and we believe our display revenue in Q1 is likely to be lower sequentially but higher year-over-year.
Now I'll summarize by putting the company's guidance and momentum into context. In Q4, we expect the second highest semiconductor equipment revenue in our history, with continued double-digit growth momentum year-over-year. We also expect to set new record levels in services, display and for the company as a whole. We expect record earnings per share. We also look forward to another year of growth in 2018 based on strong customer pull across the portfolio as we supply our enabling technologies to drive the new data economy. I look forward to sharing our longer-term financial targets at the Analyst Day in New York on September 27 and especially look forward to meeting many of you there.
Now let me turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.",577

And it looks like you're guiding WFE around $43 billion, plus or minus, this year. And roughly 70% of that looks like it's coming from NAND. And so curious, as you look at that part of the market, can you talk to your visibility to both greenfield and shrink plans as well as your thoughts around demand elasticity and how you're thinking about spend from that business over the next 5-plus years?",81
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2017",2017-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3592.0,1284889.0,51926532.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,8,"Sure. I'll take a shot. Overall, we expect WFE in '18 -- I'll drill into memory, too. We expect overall WFE in '18 will be up from '17. By device type, we think logic and DRAM should be higher next year. And we think foundry and NAND should both be strong next year. I think the 70% of total spend, the NAND, I thought you said, C.J., sounds a little high because we have NAND at less than 50% of total spend. But I'll drill into the deeper dive on what's going on in the memory markets. So let me talk about DRAM and NAND together and I'll drill into NAND also. I think there's 3 important things to remember about customers and one about Applied in both NAND and DRAM. One, if you look at NAND and DRAM customers, very profitable now, and I'll give you the numbers. Two, second thing to remember is, demand is strong for both DRAM and NAND, looks sustainable. The third thing is, actual wafer start additions have been modest, and I'll give you the numbers. And then finally, thinking about -- remember that Applied Materials, we've gained 8 points of WFE share in both DRAM and NAND over the last 4 years. So let me give you more specifics. In terms of customer profitability, which was the first talking point I made, DRAM WFE spending as a percentage of total EBITDA for our customers used to be about 26% on average. That's DRAM WFE spending. That's the total EBITDA. And we think that's going to go down to about half, 14% this year and next. You know they're very profitable. When you look at the numbers, it's very profitable. The NAND similarly has gone down. Used to be about 26%, we see it down about 1/3 this year and next to 19%. But that's also sustaining more, higher growth rates in NAND, okay? The second thing to remember is bit demand. So if you look for smartphones and servers in both 2017 and '18, we see 30% bit growth demand. Now it goes down a point or 2 when you layer in PCs and stuff, but the big drivers are smartphones and servers. And we see 30% bit growth demand or gigabytes. Secondly, in NAND bit demand, we see 40% growth rate in '17 and '18 each for smartphones and solid-state disk drives. Then on capacity additions, if you go look at the data over the last, basically, 5 years, and we see this year basically the same, NAND -- DRAM wafer capacity has been basically flat. They got some bit growth, but because there are more layers, the actual wafers out of the building kind of goes down. So it's kind of flat, not a lot of capacity added. Then if you look at NAND capacity additions, they spend a lot of money, but the actual capacity additions have been somewhat modest, a couple hundred thousand wafers to up to 1.6 million now. And we project that they need about 2 billion in a few years -- 2 million, 2 million wafer starts per month, 2 billion a couple of years after that. But if you look at the 3 big things, customers are very profitable, DRAM and NAND. Secondly, bit growth and bit demand, bit demand is still very healthy, and we see it next year, too. And three, actual wafer capacity additions have been moderate. So we think -- I think NAND's pretty good for the foreseeable future.",588

I'll give you some factoids on the overall market, which you touched on, Harlan, and then a little bit on the OLED and then Gary might join on that one, too. So in terms of -- I didn't factor -- I don't think we've mentioned them. From our call, which I think was 3 months ago, our expectations for the total market of display equipment has gone up for all 5 years in our window, '17, '18, '19 and '20 and '21, all 5 have gone up. And we see strength across the board, basically, in both TV and mobile. A lot of big TV factories and increasing strength in mobile. So it's a very strong market position, even more so than 3 months ago. In terms of our product position, we're going to continue to reduce the price. In terms of OLED TVs, what they're kind of doing is this white backplane stuff with a color filter, I guess. So it's not the same OLED as you have in mobile, but it is a version of OLED. And our position is pretty good there. But it's not a big technology inflection which has as much percentage growth in TAM availability for everybody as you have in true OLED in the mobile phones.",214

Relative to the inflections and kind of the market outlook, we're still in the early innings of OLED mobile. So as that continues to get built out, that's a big positive driver for us. This adoption of larger screens in TV, we talked about 13 Gen 10.5 factories, that will be built out over the next several years. And then if you look at the investments that large technology companies are making, VR/AR, automotive, those are -- there are other types of display technologies, foldable displays, those other inflections that could be more significant if you look out in the 3- to 5-year time frame, but we have good exposure to all of those changes.",155

So we think the total spending by display manufacturers is up this year and up again next year. We think it's pretty strong in both TV and mobile. So the big TVs are driving the CapEx spending on TV and then mobile is mostly this OLED driver. So we see upside in total. We see upside in TVs next year. And we also see some upside potential in mobile next year. And part of that is you see a proliferation to mobile phone display manufacturers beyond the big one in Korea. So if you think of the factoid we gave you the last couple of quarters, if you go back to our sales of OLED equipment in fiscal '16, roughly 2/3 was to the biggest manufacturer of OLEDs. We've now proliferated to 10 different people buying some equipment from us. And the big guy, in terms of commitments of orders this year, fiscal '17, is significantly less than 50%. So what you're seeing is next year can grow because TVs are good and you have a proliferation of more people making mobile phones.",197

Thank you for the question. China is one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. Our business has grown a significant amount. If we look at '17 versus '15, we're up 2x in semi, 50% growth in service and 50% in display. In '16 to '17, we anticipate we're going to be up more than 20% overall in China. We track all the projects. We have very close relationships and very high share in China. So we're tracking all the projects for all of the customers. And we have leading indicators for the most likely investments. There's a lot of discussion about investment, but we qualify that based on these leading indicators. And based on all of that, 2018, we think, will be up an incremental -- at least $1 billion, probably in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2018. Longer term, we think that this number is going to continue to grow because of the strategic nature of the investment. In China, they're trying to grow the percent of domestic content, build a secure supply chain and it's a long-term strategy. The investments are not as efficient. Many of the investments next year will be in pilot lines in China, but we believe that this market will continue to grow over time. And our position is very, very strong in both semiconductor and display.",232

You talked about 15%, which is pretty good. I know you've had the strategy of kind of trying to prove that opportunity. Can you talk about how much of the growth you're seeing is just because of the significant increase in the installed base of tools versus some of the other things you might be doing to drive that growth?",69
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2017",2017-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3592.0,1284889.0,51926555.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,31,"Sure. If you look at it, you go back longer-term, historical perspective, we used to be kind of flat, around $2 billion a year back around '13. This year, we're going to do about $3 billion. If you look at the rate of growth year-on-year, it's 15.9%. But if you look at the quarters of the year, you'll see the momentum picks up even throughout the year. So I'm pretty confident that next year is a strong year for us and probably the momentum is as strong, maybe a little better than this year for several reasons. One, if you look at your service business, it's a function of 2 things: the market, your position and your strategy to attack the market. 3 things, I guess, market, product and strategy. So if you look at the market, WFE is pretty damn strong. It's pretty big number this year and next year, so that provides a tool set that you can service. And then if you look at the percentage of the market for us, we used to be 17.8% of WFE just for 300-millimeter tools back in 2013. And this year -- last year, we were what, 22%, and we're going to go up again this year. So we get a bigger piece of the market. Thirdly, if you look where we're gaining a lot of share, we're gaining a lot of share in places like etch, which is pretty good entitlement for service. So all the dynamics are the market, our position, the products we are selling is raising our service entitlement. And then secondly, what we have done -- or thirdly, that was marketing our position -- thirdly, in terms of our strategy, is improve more and more. So if you look at it, instead of selling parts and ad hoc labor, we are selling long-term service contracts. We talk about getting 1,000 extra service contracts per year. And that means we have a more predictable, more sustainable and greater value for the customers and ourselves that again raises our service entitlement. So my guess, the rate of growth in the service business is going to be pretty strong next year.",363

And that's well below what people are thinking in terms of DRAM bit demand, call it, 25%, 30%. So it would seem like next year, we do see capacity increase. And I know you guys are positive on that segment for 2018. And I was hoping you could just share your assumption for capacity additions in DRAM.",85

So if you look at the dynamics, 3 of our 4 big memory customers do both DRAM and NAND. I personally believe they have slightly different strategies in DRAM and NAND. If you look at NAND, the elasticity of demand for NAND is probably pretty damn big. There's a lot of growth in NAND and they're going to eat into hard disk drives. Then if you look at -- so they're going to spend there and grow their addressable market and make a bunch of money. If you look at DRAM, I don't think the elasticity, [ Dan, ] is quite as big. So -- and then if you look at shrinking, you nominally get 28% more bits, roughly, per wafer, but because there's more layers you get less wafers out of the same building basically. There's more steps. And that's where the capital intensity comes in. So you're sort of getting 14% growth in kind of output of a factory. So it's getting expensive to keep growing effective bits. So now what do you do? Well, if you have a total company strategy, you're probably going to invest pretty heavily, more heavily a little bit in greenfield for NAND to grow the addressable market and make money. You're probably going to do more heavily weighted on conversions for DRAM. So what we see, our estimate is in 2017, you probably got about 75,000 wafer starts adds and converts at 240 to 250, but the net adds is probably even a little less because I think it's like 50 or maybe a little less because you're kind of effectively shrinking your output a little bit with all those others because of more layer count. And we look at '18, similar numbers, kind of 75 adds and converts at 290 maybe, but it's more weighted to conversions than adds because of the economics.",323

But could you discuss maybe how that node may develop over time? And could you see that node being potentially as large as the 28-nanometer node, which has been very profitable for the chipmakers? Is it possible that this is the next big node that we see and this could be a multiyear event for the foundry segment?",79

So if you look at its peak, 28-nanometer, I think, peaked out at 335,000 wafer starts. Earlier in the year, about 9 months ago, our estimate that 7-nanometer would peak out -- it's kind of 10 going to 7, 7 I'll call it, would peak out at -- originally, we said 250, then 260, then 280. We're currently at 300,000 wafer starts. Might be upside to that because once you get more and more applications for 7-nanometer devices, there's going to be all the typical process stuff, mobile phone stuff, but you're going to get more and more into this cloud stuff, you're going to get into the cars with probably 7-nanometer device. So it's probably going to go long and big, right? It's sort of like [ 20 in there ]. Now the good news, there's a bunch of good news in there. One, it's big. That's obvious. Two, it's kind of long. So then you start to roll forward and you say, hey, does a lot of this roll to 5 or does it stay at 7 because you're thinking of product lives and clicks with the car industry, which aren't big now, you stay at a node for a while. So there's probably not as much really is my guess down to 5, right? The third thing, which is really interesting is, if you look at capital intensity, it's picking up. From 28 to 7, you'd say, ""Well, okay, Bob, it's 335 to 300, you're down 10%."" Capital intensity from 28 to 7-nanometer node is up over 90%. So to make those wafers, there's a lot more equipment sales. And -- so our position is really good. It's going to be a bunch of equipment sold. The customer is going to make a lot of money. It's going to be a big, long node.",325

So first I'll do service margins. Yes, he's looking at operating margins. So here's the trend line, and they can pull up service. Okay. Let me get the data here, Q3, Q4. Yes, I think service gross and operating margins are up a little bit in Q3 and up more in Q4, actually. And the trend line is they're going to go up. So I think what you'll see, I'll give you some longer-term perspective of where we're going. That might help. We used to be 23%, 24% operating margins in service. And then in full year '16, we were probably 26.5% or 27%. This year, the guide is like 28%, frankly. And we're going to trend up a little bit more. So the operating margins trend up, gross margin trended up some, too. So I think generally, the trend is pretty good. What's driving the trend line in margins? Revenue growth's pretty darn good. Gross margins will trend up a little bit. You get drop-through because you get the percentage gross margin and you get the leverage of the revenue growth. So I think operating margins are going to trend up and gross margins will trend up in service.",201

We're moving a lot more content into lower-cost regions. And customers are also facing big challenges in the technology ramp for logic and also for memory. Our opportunity, Bob talked about earlier in service contract is also increasing our revenue growth. So we're driving lower costs. We're driving greater value for customers. And that is increasing our overall operating margins and giving us momentum going forward in service business.",91

Display operating margins and gross margins are tending to trend up. If you look at operating margins for display, from 2012, they were about 9.8%. '13 was 16.8% '14 is 24%. About 25% in '15. '16 was about 20%, 21%, we were investing. This year we will be about 26%. Next year should be up with the volume. So I think we're going to do pretty well in display. Now if you look at the longer-term model, which we'll show in Analyst Day, last year, the Analyst Day model we showed that generally our operating margins and gross margins are higher in semi, but services and display are both -- they're all increasing. And what you'll probably get is high 20s in service and display and higher, 30-something in semi and the overall average goes up.",142

So I'll give you some historical perspective. We do forecast historically based on -- we talk to the account guys, who talk to the customers, then the marketing guys look at trend data and underlying drivers. When we do a kind of a 1-year forecast, it's a little bit more weighted to talking to the account guys. And the customers' communication of second half visibility to us is moderate. Sometimes they don't know and sometimes they don't want to disclose it, frankly, because it's a competitive issue for them. So my belief is that the semicap industry probably underestimated the second half of this year. And if we'd done a lot more deep thinking on it, we might have estimated a little higher number in the second half. And there's one particular customer, much bigger than expectations. So if you go look at -- we've spent, me personally included, have spent a lot more time on root cause drivers, what -- not just of what customers tell us, but what are they selling, what are the devices going into? What is the content of the phone? What is the content of the PC? What's the content of the cloud? So, for instance, if you look at the delta from what we thought ended '16 was content, wasn't unit count phones, it's content of phones, content of cloud. That is continuing for this year. If you say, what device type is up this year from earlier expectations, across the board, but it's NAND, DRAM and foundry, but NAND is probably the biggest increase, but it wasn't a particular customer in particular. So we're spending a lot more time going to root cause drivers of what's driving demand. So I'd probably have more confidence than I did a year ago about the outlook.",309

And the question is really around the equipment intensity that AMAT might be seeing with any of the successor architectures that would be there for DRAM. Is it higher? Is it lower? Is it a mix?

Gary will do the more technical stuff. I generally am optimistic about the industry and the various device types, but there's going to be granularity to some of that. So I believe that these drivers, that there's greater and greater valuable applications for silicon than there used to be. Because you basically, A, leverage all the physical assets in the universe more efficiently through silicon. And two, I think a lot of the incremental consumption of entertainment and health care will be leveraged by silicon. So I think the cosmic drivers, whether it's on automobiles, hotels, health care, you name it, silicon's going to play a big role in this. Okay? So that driver. Now that said, how you make money in life is 2 ways: scale and differentiation. So if you look at the scale of these things, they're very big, including scale up at the cloud where they have huge volumes. And the differentiations on these solutions, what does that mean? I think you're going to have more different tapeouts of more different type of devices than you've had before. I think you'll see the A6 chips. You'll see the graphics processor units. I think you'll see different types of high end, low end, different types of DRAM. And I think you'll see different types of memory. So I think you're going to get a proliferation, more devices and more design, which is all good for us, frankly. And then if you go to, what do I think about altered memory? I think NAND is going to grow for a while. It's going to eat into hard disk drive. I think DRAM and alternative forms of memory, they'll be ones that segment the market and sell different products because the volume up there and the differentiator is so valuable that you can go to different design types. I don't think it's going to be one shoe fits all feet. And then thirdly, in terms of capital intensity, capital intensity by device type is up across the board, from a few years ago, 30% to 90%, right? And I don't see that trend changing for all the new devices either. Gary?",369

And so the new baseline of revenues is increasing for display, which was one of your second parts of your question, Jagadish. And if you look at the inflections, it's not just bigger TVs in my mind. It's not just OLED. Those are really powerful. I think there's other inflections like the simple phone you have now is you go to the wraparound, take the top and the bottom off the chin and the forehead, you get 40% more surface area. We sell surface area, whether it's layers or size. Then I think you're going to have foldable in a few years, which doubles the surface area of a phone or an iPad, I guess. And then eventually you're going to have some OLED proliferation, as you mentioned, TVs whether it's white OLED or something further down the road. All of these lead to more spending. Now the question people would ask a year or 2 ago is, gee whiz, historically, you might have $32 billion in WFE spending and $8 billion in display spending and shouldn't it stay at 25%? No, because the drivers are very different. I mean, display is huge application across the world in TVs, mobile phones, which everyone has, and the layer count to increase the visual content of that is doubling. So I think the potential of display market is pretty big.",251

I think this year we've done particularly well. We're going to be up a couple of points, almost 3. We're going to be up like 2.9 this year or something like that. We're up a lot, okay? Now that's a lot of things. I mean, I think we've executed by product across the line. So if you're looking at our gross margins on every single product in the company, every BU in the company, which number between AGS, service and semi, like 13 businesses, every one of the gross margins is up from '13 to '17, so across the board, good execution. Mix this year is pretty good. It's a good semi year, but it's also a pretty big display and services year. So my take, there's an opportunity to grow next year, but we haven't run the models. But it will be hard to do as well as you do this year. So my average goal -- and Dan is going to go through the numbers, what I've said in the past, our average goal is kind of 7/10 of a point a year. And if we do anything like that, we're already kind of ahead of the '19 model. So I think there's still room.",216

On November 10, Applied celebrated our 50th anniversary, and in this milestone year, we delivered all-time record performance, far exceeding our previous highs. In fiscal 2017, we grew revenues 34% and operating profit at more than twice that rate. I'd like to thank all our employees for making this a great year for Applied and their passion for creating value for customers and shareholders. It's Applied's breadth that sets us apart, and across the company, we are firing on all cylinders. We have tremendous momentum and our outlook is strengthening. I'm confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor display and service businesses.
Applied is working at the foundation of major technology trends and playing a larger and more valuable role in the electronics industry. Our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we've never been in a better position to do that. 
In today's call, I'll talk about our markets and the large emerging trends that are driving sustainable growth in semiconductor and display. I'll describe how Applied is positioned, our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for the company. Dan will then provide more details about our execution, financial performance and outlook. 
Let me start by providing context. Our markets are strong and getting stronger because there's a much broader set of demand drivers than in the past. In the annual war for leadership in the smartphone market, handset manufacturers are adding more and more functionality to their devices. IoT applications are expanding rapidly and data generation is exploding. Major inflections are taking place in the data center, and there's an emerging battle for leadership in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. And there is huge demand for new display technology, while at the same time, average screen sizes for both TVs and mobile devices are growing considerably. A customer recently told me that this is the most exciting time in the history of the electronics industry, and I strongly agree. 
We are at the start of a completely new wave of growth. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform entire industries and create trillions of dollars of economic value. As a result, we are seeing a broad spectrum of companies investing in AI-related technology. From transportation and health care to entertainment and retail, future success is dependent on capturing, storing, and understanding vast amounts of data. This is driving major innovations in sensors, memory, storage, and especially compute, which is key to turning raw data into valuable information. 
Leading AI companies are telling us they need a step change in computing performance. This is driving a trend towards new, highly specialized architectures customized for AI workloads, as well as much larger chips. Huge advances in computing are taking place both in the cloud and at the edge. For applications where latency and security are important, like autonomous vehicles, natural language processing or safety systems, data will be processed and stored at the edge. This means more logic and memory content in edge devices where power requirements are much more critical than in the cloud. 
The AI architecture war is shaping up to be the biggest battle of our lifetimes, and is going to be a major driver for the logic foundry road map. The winning architectures will provide large improvements in performance and power, and Applied is in a unique position to deliver the innovative materials needed to enable AI leadership. 
I'll now translate these end market trends into an outlook for our served markets. In memory, shipments are at record levels, and market dynamics remain very healthy. DRAM and NAND content in smartphones is growing considerably. For example, the average NAND content in entry-level phones has doubled from 32 gigabytes in 2016, to 64 gigabytes today. 
Content is also growing in the data center, and the total cost of ownership of NAND-based solid-state drives is on track to cross over 10K hard disk drives in 2018, increasing the SSD opportunity to around 35% of the enterprise storage market.
Overall, bit demand growth remains strong, in a range of 20% to 25% for DRAM and greater than 40% for NAND. Our customers are making disciplined investments in both capacity and new technology to address the explosion of data generation and the need for high-performance memory to support emerging applications. And as the memory road map is enabled by materials innovation, this is very positive for Applied. 
In foundry, we see strong demand at the leading edge, driven by next-generation mobile devices, automotive and high-performance computing. We're also seeing significant investment in trailing geometries, especially for image sensors. This is driven by the adoption of dual cameras and smartphones, as well as IoT devices, including public safety systems. Looking ahead, we expect the emerging battle for leadership in AI and high-performance computing to be a major driver for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes.
Increasing investment in China is additive to overall wafer fab equipment, and especially good for Applied since we have very high share in this market. We now see total spending in China being around $2 billion higher in 2018 compared to 2017, with more significant growth to come over the next several years. 
Bringing all of this together, our outlook for wafer fab equipment spending has strengthened since our analyst meeting in September. We now believe combined investment in 2017 and 2018 will be several billion dollars above our prior forecast of $90 billion, and that 2018 will be larger than this year. 
This positive market environment increases our confidence that we will sustain our growth momentum in 2018 and make meaningful progress towards our 2020 financial model. Applied has never been in a better position than we are today, thanks to the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio. Our breadth not only gives us, by far, the largest exposure to industry inflections, it also is creating strong pull for earlier and deeper collaborations with customers. 
In these customer engagements, we are combining our unique capabilities to create new materials with our innovative technologies in materials removal, materials modification and e-beam inspection and metrology to deliver new integrated solutions. Our breadth also provides us with speed advantages. Speed of innovation is more important than ever for our customers, and bringing new devices to markets faster is tremendously valuable. Because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place, we can help customers to develop winning devices faster and more effectively. 
To strengthen customer collaborations that are made in technology center and in their labs, we recently aligned the organization to better connect our broad capabilities across the company. We also increased our R&D investment by more than $230 million in 2017. 
In semiconductor, our process equipment businesses that provide materials engineering solutions grew about 40% in fiscal 2017. And our inspection and metrology business grew at around 20%, delivering all-time record revenues. This was an especially strong year for our PVD, CMP and thermal products, driven by the mass adoption of advanced interconnection logic, as well as increasing use of logic-like processes in memory. 
We also made strong gains in patterning and 3D NAND, and we're in a great position to grow in DRAM as customers transition to new higher performance devices over the next several years. 
As we look ahead, we see customers increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures to derive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing in AI. As a result, there is increasingly strong pull for our leadership products that improved performance and power efficiency of leading-edge devices. 
In service, our momentum is accelerating as we introduce new ways to deliver value to customers. We delivered record performance in 2017, with fourth quarter revenues up 20% compared to the same period last year. In 2017, the fastest-growing business in our portfolio was Display, with revenue growth of 57% year-on-year. Due to the physical signs of Display equipment, lead times are much longer than in semiconductor, and that gives us extended visibility. We expect 2018 and 2019 will be very strong.
In our last earnings call, we said 2018 Display revenue would be up more than 30% versus 2017. Our view for 2018 is now even more positive, and we see revenue growth exceeding our previous estimates. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2017 was a record-breaking year for the company. We have great momentum, and we're confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses. This is underpinned by sustainable strength in our markets. As new demand drivers layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, AI will transform industries over the coming years, and Applied plays a fundamental role creating the materials that enable the next-generation of memory and high-performance computing. 
In addition, Applied is uniquely positioned to drive differentiated performance, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio of products and capabilities. 
Now Dan will give his perspective on our execution and outlook.",1522
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2017",2017-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3765.0,1353063.0,54178831.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Let me start by saying that the semiconductor industry is more exciting today than it's been in many years. This is absolutely the perfect environment for Applied Materials because we're the biggest, broadest and most capable company in delivering leading-edge process technology to our customers. The future Gary described needs an order of magnitude improvement in processing performance and in performance per watt, plus geometric cost reductions in solid-state storage. The future is not going to happen with the same chips and chip-making methods that got us to where we are today. 
Shrinking isn't enough anymore. We also need breakthroughs in materials, materials engineering, which is why we're so focused on disruptive products, new material combinations and rapid learning. 
For me, personally, it's been an amazing and eye-opening 3 months. So much of what the semiconductor industry does begins with Applied Materials. The talent and the technology inside this company are second to none, and we're going to play a huge role in enabling the new AI era of computing.
Now I'll talk about what we're focusing on and how we're executing as a company. First, we're focused on making sure we're putting our R&D dollars to work in the right areas, to create and enable the inflections and to grow in those inflections. We're also focused on being the disciplined execution machine we need to be to satisfy our customers and investors, and keep increasing our profitability and shareholder returns. 
Since it's the end of our fiscal year, I'll summarize how we're doing across the major parts of our portfolio. As I outlined at the Analyst Day in New York, our semiconductor systems group has a wide range of product lines that can be summarized in 2 areas: leadership and high growth. In leadership semi, we have unique, strong share businesses that enable high performance, low-power transistors and interconnects. Our team is focused on expanding our reach beyond logic and foundry, because DRAM and NAND chips also need to be faster and consume less power. This is increasingly true in both AI workloads and cloud data centers. 
Within memory, our leadership semi businesses were up 45% year-over-year. Over the past 4 years, they've grown by a factor of 4 in memory, contributing an additional $1.5 billion in revenue growth and 2.5 points of our company's share gain in memory over that same time period. I'll share some of the applications that are driving this great performance.
When NAND moved to 3D, our epi technology was adopted to increase read and write speeds. Today, in DRAM, the control circuitry is adopting advanced logic structures to increase data access performance and reduce power consumption. This is driving more demand for our PVD, implant and thermal technologies. 
The second area of our semiconductor systems group, our high-growth semi businesses, are about cost-effective 2D and 3D scaling. Our teams have been extending our wins in 3D NAND to new wins in 2D scaling. The old patterning steps are being replaced with new techniques, including self-aligned multi-patterning and EUV. Applied is growing and gaining share in these areas because we introduced new platforms, including Sym3 and Selectra.  
The greatest challenge in advanced patterning is aligning the features between the critical layers. We are solving this challenge with new materials based-alignment techniques, along with EB measurement and inspection. As a result, our patterning share is growing by 4 points year-over-year, and our imaging and process control group generated its highest revenue ever. 
Our services business is about helping our customers to manage the increasing process complexity and generate high returns in an era of higher capital intensity. This year, we drove a 25% increase in tools under comprehensive service agreements. The agreements enable us to generate more value by helping our customers get to yield faster, and maintain higher yields and lower operating costs over the life of each node. We grew our services business by 17% this year to a record $3 billion, and plan to keep growing at a 15% compound rate through 2020. 
Our Display business is about bigger and better TVs, along with mobile displays that are thinner, lighter and better looking than ever. The team has done an excellent job in ramping a new generation of our tools for Gen 10.5 Display factories. Gen 10.5 substrates are 80% larger and will allow customers to make the leap to affordable 65-inch and 75-inch TVs. 
In mobile, our team established the leading position in thin-film encapsulation, which enables OLED smartphones that are now the hottest selling products of the leading brands. We grew the Display business to a record $1.9 billion this year. While the business units are generating product wins and strong revenue growth, the manufacturing and support organizations are also executing well. Our manufacturing teams are delivering 1.4x the volume of prior years, and at the same time, they've reduced their cycle times, while improving our overall quality metrics. Going forward, we will keep a sharp focus on further improving our operational performance, cost structure and continuing to drive spending discipline.
Now I'll share our financial performance. We're pleased to report that in Q4, we delivered strong year-over-year growth across the company. In semiconductor systems, we grew revenue by 14% and non-GAAP operating profit by 19%.
In services, we increased both revenue and non-GAAP operating profit by 20%. And in Display, we grew revenue by 50% and non-GAAP operating profit by 109%. Applied as a whole delivered record revenue and earnings in Q4, landing near the high end of our guidance range.
Our 2017 fiscal year was our best ever. We grew revenue by 34% to a new record level. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We reduced non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue by 3.2 points. We increased non-GAAP operating profit by 6.2 points, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 86% to a record $3.25. All of this resulted in record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, equal to 25% of revenue. We paid $430 million in cash dividends, and we used $1.2 billion to repurchase 28 million shares of common stock at an average price of $42.08.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. Looking ahead to 2018 and 2019, one word leaps to mind: sustainability. Our markets are sustainably strong, and our momentum is sustainably strong. Gary mentioned that wafer fab equipment is going to be comfortably above $90 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. We believe WFE will remain sustainably higher and more stable than in the past. There are 3 strong reasons for this. First, unit demand is growing. Second, capital intensity is higher. And lastly, our customers are very healthy, and making sound investments to generate profitable growth in the next wave of computing, which will take a decade or more to fully build out. 
In fact, the markets for chips and displays are both fundamentally strong. And that's great for Applied Materials as the company with the most growth levers in our space. We enable better smartphones and TVs, and we power the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, which together, are creating a new data economy.
At the Analyst Day, Gary showed that Applied now captures 1% of all of the spending in the electronics industry and that our share has doubled in the past 4 years alone. In January, Gary and I are attending the Consumer Electronics show to meet with investors and explain how we'll continue to grow the company by enabling these major trends shaping how we live our lives. 
In today's earnings release, we included a table detailing our year-end backlog. It gives you a better sense of the year we just had, and more importantly, our momentum going into 2018. 
In 2017, Applied generated record orders of $16.1 billion, and we ended the year with a record backlog of over $6 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. Our backlog entering 2018 is large and broad-based. In semi, it's $3 billion. In services, it's $1.1 billion. And in Display, $1.85 billion. 
In 2018, we anticipate that each of our segments will grow faster than the rate needed to achieve our 2020 model on schedule. So we're off to a great start executing to the target model we discussed at our recent Analyst Day in New York. 
Now I'll share our guidance. In Q1, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion, the midpoint would be up nearly 25% year-over-year. We expect our semiconductor systems revenue to increase by about 32% year-over-year. We expect our services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year, but will be lower sequentially, which is normal seasonality due to the customer production schedules during the holiday season. We expect our Display revenue to increase by about 6% year-over-year. 
We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be about 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $715 million, plus or minus $10 million. This amount includes holiday shutdown savings of nearly $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.98, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of our range is up nearly 46% year-over-year. 
Lastly, because it's the beginning of a new year, I wanted to offer you some help with your models. Gross margins for full year 2018 are likely to be near our guidance level for Q1. We remain laser-focused on gross margin improvements across our businesses, and some of our progress is likely to be masked by our rapid growth in Display throughout the year. 
Our Display outlook is stronger. And while Q1 Display revenue and operating margin will be lower sequentially, we expect both to be higher in the balance of the year. We recently increased our Display operating margin goal to the high-20s. And our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 10%. I hope this additional color helps with your models. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.",1661

The company has made great progress over the last 4 years on margins. From a gross margin standpoint, the company's added about 1 point per year over that time period. If you look at our operating margins, since 2013, we've added over 14 points to our operating margin, so the company is performing and executing incredibly well. If we look at the way the company is compressing discretionary spend and funneling more resources to R&D, it's what's leading to the rapid organic growth that the company is delivering. Gary is an incredibly-focused, inflection-driven organic grower. And we're going to continue to execute against that strategy. So company's made good progress historically. We'll continue to make progress. You'll see operating leverage in the model going forward, and we're going to be looking for additional opportunities to improve margins beyond the target model and beyond the guidance that we gave on both the gross margin and operating margin lines.

This is Dan. Let me jump in. 2017 was a record year for the industry. At our Analyst Day, we said 2017, 2018 combined would be $90 billion. Gary, in his prepared comments, said several billion more than that, and we see the fundamentals into 2019 being strong as well. As we take a look at what's driving this level of activity, I've put it into 3 buckets. First, demand drivers; second, capital intensity; third, our customers are very healthy. From a demand drivers standpoint, we're layering in additional layers of end market demand, things like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, autonomous driving. We still have content gains to go -- significant content gains to go in the handset, and we're seeing significant demand for solid state drives. So as we look across the industry, the demand drivers are multiple and broad-based. And as we take a look at how that translates to activity within our industry, each of the device types is showing strength. Capital intensity is up across the industry. In foundry, it's up 100% over the last handful of years. And in that same time period, NAND is up 60% and DRAM is up 40%. And customers, they're investing a lot, but they're making a lot of money. The level of investment, as a percentage of their profitability, EBITDA is down over the last 5 years in memory. It's down 40% in foundry and logic, it's down 50%. So the ecosystem customers are healthy and will continue to invest and generate returns on that investment. As we look at the industry and where we're at, at the very highest level, I would say there's strong balance between foundry logic and memory, with maybe a slight weighting towards memory. And within memory, we see NAND about 2/3 of that market and DRAM about 1/3. In foundry logic, we see foundry about 2/3 and logic about 1/3. And in 2018, we see that same or similar profile that we're seeing in '17. So we think that the upside is broad-based. We see NAND up, we see logic up, we see foundry strong, we see DRAM strong. So we're pretty happy with the fundamentals through '18 and into '19.",373

Basically, 2 big drivers for Display. One is TVs and the other is mobile OLED. In the large screen televisions, we have 13 factories that we're tracking that are Gen 10.5. And data point for that is if you're building 65-inch televisions with Gen 10.5, large panels, you can get 8 TVs. If you're building that with Gen 8.5, you get 3. So as the consumers are going to larger screens, there -- it's a compelling value proposition to move to Gen 10.5. So that's driving part of the market. And then, of course, for smartphones, OLED is a big factor. And what we see through 2020 in mobile OLED, with the investment that's being made, you'll be able to build about 50%, right around 50% of smartphones with OLED screens in that time frame. So those are the 2 drivers: large screen televisions and mobile OLED. The mix relative to revenue, '17 is more weighted to mobile versus TV. The mix in '18 is pretty balanced between TV and mobile. But again, in both cases, we see these as multiyear drivers for Display. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have long lead times for Display, and we see Display-healthy '18 and '19. The only thing I'd mention about Display, is that it's unique for Applied Materials. In expanding our materials innovation into this market, the complexities increasing, and it really has been a great growth driver for the company.",250

And looking into next year, DRAM bit demand looks actually quite strong. You guys articulated some of that on the call. And I would argue for some growth in the installed base capacity in 2018. I think you guys also said last call that it's looking like maybe 75k growth and 50k net add of capacity to the total installed base in DRAM? So I guess the question is, has that view changed? Because we've heard of some potentially new greenfield DRAM programs, and the point here is we just want to make sure that, from your perspective, capacity growth outlook still looks relatively disciplined for this segment of the [indiscernible] market.",133

I think the short answer is yes, we still see a very disciplined market. We've got healthy customers, and the market is being demand-led. We see about 25% bit demand growth, and we see a very disciplined add of incremental bit capacity to match that bit demand growth. So we see, overall, a very healthy market. We see the market being demand-led, customers are healthy, making money, so we're encouraged by what we see. I think the news this year for us, the interesting news, is we increasingly see, in the memory market, adoption of power and performance capabilities in the memory devices, and we see it at both DRAM and NAND, which means our leadership businesses, as I said in my prepared comments, are showing strong growth into the memory market going forward, higher input/output feeds. And the logic periphery that sits around memory cells and DRAM are increasingly adopting logic-like power and performance capabilities. So we're really encouraged by what we see in this market.",169

And going forward, how should we think about margins and Display as you start to ramp your new products and as you expand your SAM?",85

Yes, so I would look at the scale of the business getting larger, the continual improvements, we put out a target for this business of being high-20s, that's what I would look to longer term out of this business.

I'm going to ask both upfront. One is, I think, Dan, you articulated the DRAM supply demand, wondering if you can articulate a similar one for NAND in 2018, if you think demand bit growth will exceed supply bit growth for NAND. And the second part question is that, I completely agree with you on the sustainability of WFE, but that question always comes up every now and then with investors. And if you believe $40-plus-billion or $45 billion is a new norm for WFE, why wouldn't you increase the dividend to reflect that so that it'll put some of these questions to rest?",110
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2017",2017-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3765.0,1353063.0,54178849.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,21,"Thanks, Krish. From a NAND supply-demand standpoint, I think we see bit demand growing 40% in '17, we see it higher into '18. As you take a look at the capacity adds, today, we've got 1.6 million wafer starts per month of installed capacity, half of that is converted to 3D NAND. We still have half of that install base to go to convert. And so we see, maybe, 1.8 million to 2 million wafer starts per month in the 2020, 2021 time frame. So that market looks demand-led and healthy as well. We see a lot of room to go for solid-state drives. We are in the very early innings of penetration of solid-state drives. Handsets still have lots of content gains to go. As you take a look at the 3D roadmaps going forward, 48 layers, 64 layers, all the way up to 144 layers, the road map extends beyond several generations. And incremental NAND bit growth, in the era of 3D NAND is more challenging. So all of this comes together to give us confidence that we've got a balanced market, opportunity is there and see demand in this market being fairly elastic. So we feel really good about what we see. From a capital allocation dividend perspective, so this company's had a long history and tradition of returning excess cash to shareholders. In the last 5 years, it's been 82%. In the last 3 years, it's been 89%. And we're going to continue to return cash to shareholders. As you take a look at the tax structure and the proportion of cash that gets generated overseas versus onshore, there is a structural impediment to us being more aggressive from a dividend perspective in the near term, but this is something that gets a lot of -- we're spending a lot of time discussing this and we're watching tax policy out of the Washington very closely. And when we get clarity on tax policy, then we'll be able to determine what the right long-term proportion of dividend versus share repurchases so that where we continue to return cash to shareholders in the most efficient optimal way possible to drive value for shareholders.",365

Dan, you laid out what we felt was conservative gross margin expectations at the Analyst meeting, 47% in 2020. And according to your plans this year, it looks like you'll get pretty close, 46.6%. And you alluded on the call, at least, that you think over time, maybe you could do better. So my question is, really, how high is the ceiling for gross margin?",78

I think we'll stand by our model that we put forward at our Analyst Day in 2020. We'll update that model at our next Analyst Day, to the extent there will be new news. And in the meantime, the company is going to be hyper focused on driving strong execution going forward, continuing to look for every opportunity we can to squeeze profitability out of this company and drive value for shareholders. We're off to a good start. If we were to take the current 2017 mix and apply it to the cost structure in 2017 -- I mean, I'm sorry, the cost structure in 2020, the 47% target gross margin would be over 48%. So the progress that we're making as a company, to some extent, will be masked as Display and services outgrow our semi business. But we like having multiple drivers of growth. We like our breadth and just gives us more opportunities to impact this industry in a really positive way, creating value for shareholders.",171

And is that -- did you guys underestimate how expensive this would be to add that amount of capacity? Or just, why are you so comfortable when you talk about this being sustainable out to 2019, when the WFE number has grown by so much?",116

I think when we look at what makes the industry healthy where it is today, again, it's diversity of demand drivers, supporting macro trends that are going to unlock significant economic value. Capital intensity is up across the board, customers are investing. But again, they're healthy and profitable. And the industry never went to 450-millimeter wafers. And so for a variety of reasons, we feel very, very good about where we sit. Is there opportunity for upside off these levels? If I had to take an overunder on WFE, I'd say over right now, but it's probably premature to see that. And again, we see the market being demand-led. And when you take a look at things like bit output per dollar invested, that growth is slower. And so it will just accrues benefits to companies that are in our business. And Applied is better positioned than any to capitalize on it.",154

Maybe -- let me add something. On kind of where we're at. We went from PC enterprise, everybody has long memories of waiting for the operating system upgrades to mobile and social media, pervasive demand, annual war every holiday season for all of the consumer electronics products. And now we're moving into this AI big data era. And many people talk about their opportunities to create trillions of dollars of economic value, transforming transportation, health care, many major industries. So if you look at what's happened over the last couple of years, the components of that are data generation, data storage and compute. So data generation, you have all of these smart devices and sensors that are growing very fast. And over the last period of time here, you now have foundry -- 40% of foundry spending is in the trailing geometries. And all of these smart devices are continuing to grow, and there's tremendous economic value that's created there. So that's one driver that wasn't there in the past. Then, all of this data is going up at a very high rate. We showed at the investor meeting that memory shipments are tracking data generation, and Dan talked about, memory has never been healthier in terms of overall profitability. There's a tremendous increase in data, capturing all of that information. And then, to really transform those industries, trillions of dollars of economic value, you have to process the data. And at the investor meeting, we talked about oil powering the Industrial Revolution, data powering the AI, the big data revolution. And so again, you have the trailing geometries, you have the leading geometries and the war for the AI architecture is on high-performance computing. You have drivers on the memory, the data storage and the crossover for solid-state drives. So a number of different things that are new drivers. The other thing I would add, it's some small incremental add, is China. We talked about China being up in 2018 in wafer fab equipment spending, by about $2 billion. And what we see is that, we believe that, that investment will continue to go higher in China, not a step function change, but incrementally higher going forward in the future. So you have all of those drivers kind of underpinning where we're at right now. And certainly, we were able to talk about 2018 double-digit growth across all of our different businesses because we have better visibility to customers and all of those drivers and all of their projects. So that also gives us increased confidence.",428

As we go through 2018, given that its growing above what you guys have targeted as 15% target you talked about. Is there a risk that since you signed all these big contract now, that there might be a slower growth rate as we go through 2018? And what -- you mentioned that your 25% increase in service contract. Is there a way to kind of think about how much of your installed base is in the service contract versus how much more room you can grow?",109

And as we talked about the revenue opportunity for us is dramatically higher when we have the service contracts versus no service contracts. So there was a big change in strategy around 2013. And since then, the service contract growth has been pretty significant. So if you look at what's happening with customers, they're ramping many of these new devices, 3D NAND going to 64 layers and 96 layers. And in the future, they'll be ramping one CDRAM and 7-nanometer in foundry and logic. These technology nodes are very different -- difficult. And we've reorganized service. So we're focused on being able to support our customers and accelerating yield, output and cost. And we have tremendous traction for customer. It's worth a lot of money for them to optimize those big investments they're making in their fabs. We've made changes within the organization, so that we're accelerating those new service products and we have very high confidence that we're going to continue to drive the service that is around the 15% rate. In the last year, as we mentioned, it's been faster than that. But the number that we discussed at the investor meeting, we still have high confidence in is around 15% in terms of the compound annual growth rate.",228

So if you look -- if you include this year, over the last 6 years, we've gained share 5 out of the last 6 years, and we were flat one year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we are anticipating double-digit, strong double-digit growth in our -- both our leadership and high-growth semiconductor businesses. So pretty broad-based. We have very good momentum in memory, we've gained several points of market share in memory over the last several years. Dan talked about the significant growth that we've had, not only in the high-growth SME, but in the leadership products where we have extremely high market share. We've grown in the last few years about $1.5 billion, I think, is the number in additional revenue growth. And we see, as Dan talked about, in memory, moving to more logic-like structures. So all of those leadership products where we have very, very high share in foundry and logic, we're growing significantly our share in memory also. So that gives us one driver. In patterning, we also have gained significant share over the last 5 years. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning. And what we showed at the investor meeting was another $1 billion growth over the next 4 years in patterning. And we have, again, tremendous momentum there. In foundry, as this war for AI leadership is happening, we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. It's a very unique position. And that is leveraging all of our leadership businesses, all of those areas where we have extremely high share. The power and performance for high-performance computing is coming from Applied Materials. And in China, we talked about $2 billion in growth in China. We have very high share in China. We will outgrow that market growth. It's going to be a fair amount of growth, I don't want to give a specific number, but it's a significant amount of growth for us in China in 2018. And then the last thing I would say that we're really driving that a bigger emphasis in the company is around connectivity. It's worth a lot of money -- it's worth a lot money for our customers to accelerate a new device to market. If you can bring a winning AI chip to market 6 months or 12 months faster, that's worth a lot of money. So we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. We have innovative technologies and modifying materials, removing materials and analyzing materials. We recently made a change in the organization to better drive speed of innovation, and especially, connectivity across the company. We have very strong pull from our leading customers across the board, real strong pull on new materials, new innovative materials. And we're the only place where you can work all of that at the same time. So this focus on connectivity is stronger than we've ever had at Applied, and the pull from customers for connectivity is also very strong. Again, if I can accelerate a chip to market by 12 months, it's worth a tremendous amount of money. We've put a tremendous amount of talent into that organization, and that's another driver in terms of our business going forward.",544

So it's clearly the support growth, new inflections and building up the field force to bring innovative products to market. As we think about the profile throughout the year, I think you could see, we're going to be up into Q2, and then, a little bit into the back half of the year and flat for the back half of the year. So you'll see that grow a little bit throughout the year.",140

A few companies have suggested that the first half of the next foundry will be slightly weaker. Do you agree with that? And if you look at the 7-nanometer ramp that those companies think will be as big as the 28-nanometer node, if this is being spread over, say, 4 years and we're halfway through that, does that mean the next 2 years, should we be also looking at kind of flattish foundry spending? Just try to get some color around your comment that foundry spending will be strong next year.",98

Again, as we look at 2017 shaping up to be a record year for this industry, as we look at how we are going to close out the calendar year in November and December, we see significant strength in our business rounding out the calendar year. As we look at the slope throughout 2018, we're confident and encouraged by what we see strength throughout the year. And the fundamentals, again, looked good into 2019. So we feel really good about where we sit, and how things are going to profile. From a foundry perspective, we do see the 7-nanometer node being on par with 28. Our estimation, given the spend that we see on the lagging edge, is 28 is still going to grow. Initially, we thought it was going to land around 320,000 wafer starts per month, but we do see that growing. And when you combine that with 22 optical shrinks off of 28, you're going to get something that tips over 400,000 wafer starts per month. And when we look at 10, 7, and 5, we see something that's going to be on par with what we just said. How it gets profiled, we think 7 is going to be large, and we also think 5 is going to be large as well. So when we look at foundry being strong on a go forward basis, we really like what they see, in terms of uptick in demand, and the diversification of those demand drivers.",250

This week, at an industry event, NVIDIA's CEO said that up to 70% of all data center workloads could be AI-enabled. And so the question is, as you're talking to your customers about your pressure this is putting on their capital investment, are you hearing that this is a gradual force through 10-, 7- and 5-nanometer? Or do they  see a step function coming at any one of those nodes? Or more of an investment in either logic or memory, where there are diversified suppliers?",109

Again, what we're seeing is, if you look at the data generation, already, we see a big impact in terms of wafer fab equipment spending in sensors, in those trailing edge geometries, smart everything. We see about 40% of foundry spending coming from those sources, and we think that's going to continue. And then, the increase in data, again, you have to capture the data before you can process it and create the value. We're certainly seeing tremendous increase in data. That's driving a healthier memory business than we've ever seen. And for high-performance computing, the key thing about Applied Materials is that we create the materials that enable high-performance computing. Our leadership businesses, if you look at epi and PVD and implant and the advanced process, all of those areas we have very, very high market share. So the pull that we have with customers is tremendous. The visibility that we have around those structures for 7-nanometers, for 5-nanometers is very unique, and that we have -- we're creating those materials. So the pull for us is very, very strong. I think the -- and the architecture war that's happening in AI isn't over. There's a lot of companies that are designing specific AI chips for different kinds of applications, so there's a tremendous amount of activity there. And we think that, that will ramp a significant amount over time.",235

Thanks, Mike. If I could, I want to say that this in an incredibly exciting time for me, our company, and the industry as a whole. Applied is a unique position and our breadth sets us apart. It allows us to drive the most inflections, and it generate the most growth opportunities. 
The company is executing extremely well. We're delivering record performance. But we're not going to be satisfied. We're not going to rest on what we did last quarter or last year. We're going to be relentlessly focused at driving execution. We're going to continue to make smart R&D investments to drive our organic growth. We're going to continuously improve our operations. We're going to look for more ways to increase gross margins, deliver more value to our shareholders, and we're going to continually drive spend discipline throughout all levels of this company. This execution is delivering great momentum for us. 
We're ending the year with record backlog and record orders in the year. We're going to expect double-digit growth across all of our businesses going into 2018. Personally, I look forward to seeing many of you, Credit Suisse, in a week and a half, at CES to start the new year. 
And I guess, lastly, for those of you who call Boston home, please make sure you give a warm Boston welcome to our friends from the Golden State, when they roll into town tonight for what is going to be an amazing game. 
With that, I wanted to thank you for joining us today and giving us your support. Thank you.",265
