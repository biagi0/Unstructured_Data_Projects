251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,282268.0,13892705.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Splinter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. On behalf of Applied Materials, I would like to convey our condolences to Steve Appleton's family and our colleagues at Micron. Steve's leadership in the semiconductor industry will be greatly missed.
Now let me comment on Applied Materials' performance and our industry outlook. I'm pleased to report that Applied started 2012 with a strong first quarter, posting revenue and earnings that exceeded the high-end of our ranges. Global demand for mobile electronics is driving strong capital investments by semiconductor customers, resulting in solid order momentum and higher expectations for our second quarter. The rate of technical change continues to accelerate in all of our markets and leading-edge technology investment remains a priority for our customers.
In early November, we completed our acquisition of Varian, and welcomed their talented team into the Applied Materials family. Bringing these 2 leaders together comes at a critical time as the industry accelerates its advanced transistor roadmap. Our combined capabilities in Epi implant and thermal processing enabled new opportunities to provide customers with high-value solutions for the next generations of high performance energy-efficient transistors.
Let me now turn to the economic outlook. Since the start of the year, we have seen improvements in a number of macroeconomic indicators. While the ongoing recession and increased austerity in parts of Europe remain a concern, we believe the global economic environment will support healthy spending by consumers and businesses.
I'll now provide an update for each of our segments. In semiconductor, 2012 is shaping up to be the year of the foundry. The mobility trend is driving growth and in the fourth calendar quarter, smartphone unit sales surpassed PCs for the first time. We expect between 600 million and 700 million smartphones to be sold in 2012, an increase of 35% year-on-year. In addition, we believe the tablet market will grow by more than 60% this year on top of 65 million units sold in 2011.
Smartphones and tablets are driving demand for application processors and as these processors become increasingly sophisticated, we are seeing a significant increase in die sizes. As a result, foundries are aggressively investing as they ramp production at the 3x and 2x nodes.
Applied is favorably exposed to foundry investment. In our first quarter, we saw 75% increase in revenue from these customers and expect sequential growth of over 40% in our second quarter, driven by record quarterly sales in our front-end products, metal deposition products and implant.
Mobile devices are also driving NAND bit growth rate, which is expected to exceed 70% this year. As a result, NAND manufacturers are investing in new capacity and moving to the 2x and 1x nodes. We believe PCs will be the primary beneficiary of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The new ultrabook categories in Windows 8 have the potential to drive a PC refresh cycle and spur growth in the second half of the year.
Oversupply in DRAM continues, with manufacturers able to meet the 30% to 40% bit growth that is expected in 2012 by migrating existing lines to advanced nodes. As a result, we expect another year of low-DRAM investment, although we do expect spending to be modestly higher in the second half.
Wafer fab equipment spending for 2011 exceeded our forecast ending the year at approximately $35 billion. Lithography investment reached record highs last year, as memory makers implemented device shrinks by upgrading lines with immersion systems.
As we look at 2012, we expect another solid year for capital equipment spending and currently estimate wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $30 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 15%. 2011 was a strong year for our inspection, transistor, deposition and electroplating businesses, and we expect to see share gains in all of these areas. However, 2011 was a down year for our share in etch and CMP, primarily due to spending mix.
Over the past 4 quarters, we have increased the number of tools under service contracts in Asia by over 20%, and as we progress with the Varian integration, we see opportunities to expand our implant-related services in the region.
During the quarter, we launched 2 new CVD applications on the producer platform, enabling enhanced device performance for our customers and adding to our served market. We also released the fifth generation of SEMVision, our industry-leading defect review system. As the industryâ€™s 450-millimeter roadmap becomes clearer, we continue to work closely with our customers and focus on developing early test wafer systems.
In Display, the low absolute level of orders show that we are continuing a long bottom of the current down cycle. TV unit shipments grew modestly in 2011, and holiday sales were encouraging, helping to reduce inventories and close the gap between capacity and demand. However, we do not anticipate significant new investments in television-related capacity until late in 2012.
In order to reduce our breakeven point, we've implemented a range of spending controls while continuing to invest in targeted product development. Our customers are starting to transition new technologies into volume production, specifically metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs. We expect these next-generation factories to increase the served available market for our CVD and PVD products by over 30%.
In solar, end market demand exceeded all expectations in 2011, with installations ending the year in the 26- to 28-gigawatt range. This was driven by an acceleration of panel consumption in Europe late in the year, combined with strengthening demand in China, Japan and the United States. Germany alone installed 4 gigawatts in the last 3 months of the calendar year. We expect strong end market growth to continue and anticipate 2012 installations to be in the range of 28 to 35 gigawatts.
In 2011, we capitalized on the industry's rapid capacity expansion, gained market share and delivered strong operating performance. While the industry is currently in a period of capacity digestion, several top-tier manufacturers have been running their factories at close to full utilization. We are also seeing unnecessary rationalization of capacity, as less competitive players consolidate or exit.
Given the depth of this downturn and equipment demand, we are taking significant steps to reduce our cost structure in EES. However, we remain confident in the long-term potential of this business. Cell efficiency is becoming increasingly important for customers and as new technology is adopted, we expect to see an increase in demand for our leading-edge products as some portion of the industry's current capacity becomes obsolete.
In summary, Applied began 2012 with a strong first quarter, and we enter our second quarter with order momentum, driven by our semiconductor businesses. Visibility for the second half of the year is limited, but we're optimistic about 2012 and expect the third consecutive year of wafer fab equipment spending above $30 billion.
Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1160
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,282268.0,13892706.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied delivered revenue of $2.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.18, both above the high-end of our outlook, led by strong net sales in our Silicon Systems business. The results included Varian's financial for the fourth quarter, which contributed net sales of $202 million and approximately $0.013 in non-GAAP earnings per share.
Applied's orders in the first quarter increased by 26% to $2 billion, as an increase in SSG orders offset softness in AGS and a weak environment for EES and Display. Our backlog decreased by 10% to $2.2 billion. The decrease reflected a 0.92 book-to-bill ratio and negative backlog adjustments of $146 million, partially offset by $94 million in Varian backlog acquired. The negative items consisted of $99 million in financial debookings with the balance from cancellations and foreign exchange effects. Financial debookings are made when the expected delivery date for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Our non-semi businesses accounted for over 75% of the negative adjustments.
Net sales were flat at $2.2 billion, exceeding the high-end of our outlook of down 5% to 15%, primarily due to SSG performance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.7%, up 1.2 points sequentially, driven by higher mix of SSG revenue that was partially offset by a $31 million inventory adjustment in EES. Non-GAAP gross margins excluded the effects of Varian acquisition adjustments, which I will take a moment to explain.
In accordance with purchase accounting rules, Varian's balance sheet was adjusted to fair market value with inventory essentially written up to sales price. This adjustment, along with the amortization of intangibles, was reflected in cost of sales. The adjusted inventory is expected to be consumed by the end of our second fiscal quarter. Varian acquisition-related charges in Q1, including the purchase accounting adjustments, deal cost and integration costs, were $153 million, of which, $96 million were reported in cost of sales and $57 million were included in operating expenses.
We are very focused on exceeding our synergy goal of $50 million to $60 million by the end of year 2. Our efforts since the close have been productive and we believe we will exceed the high-end of our 2-year target and will reflect more than 50% of our announced savings in our fiscal year-end run rate.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly better than the low-end of our target range due to favorable onetime items and spending controls across the company. We expect our non-GAAP OpEx in Q2 to be $565 million, plus or minus $10 million, with higher investment in Silicon Systems and lower shutdown savings, being mostly offset by lower spending in our non-semi businesses.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, down $4.2 billion from Q4, reflecting cash from operations offset by the Varian purchase and $304 million in cash returned to shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. 
Operating cash flows were $181 million or 8% of net sales. The cash flows reflect the impact of certain Varian closing and initial integration costs, continuing decreases in customer deposits in non-semi as we draw down deferred revenue and our annual variable compensation payout. We expect a strong recovery in cash from operations in the second quarter.
Our capital allocation priorities are to make organic and inorganic investments that provide attractive long-term returns. We are also committed to increasing the dividend, in line with the growth of the business, and to utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash after investment and debt service. Dividend payouts in the quarter were $104 million, and we used $200 million to purchase 18.3 million shares at $10.95 per share.
Next, I will comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders were up 53% to $1.4 billion, reflecting demand from foundry and NAND customers. Net sales increased 26% to $1.3 billion, above the high end of our expectations, led by a more than 75% increase in our revenues from foundry customers and growth in memory-related sales. Customer concentration remained high with 3 customers accounting for approximately 70% of revenue. The non-GAAP operating margin increased to 28.7% and operating margin dollars grew by 36%, reflecting the addition of Varian's equipment business.
In Applied Global Services, orders were down 8% to $517 million, driven by low customer factory utilization levels. We anticipate these levels to gradually improve throughout the year. Net sales in AGS of $534 million were at the midpoint of our outlook of down 10% to 20%. As a reminder, our lower guidance anticipated the absence of $71 million in some fab revenues that were reported in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin dropped to 21.2% on lower revenue.
In Display, orders increased modestly to $40 million. Net sales were down 39% to $104 million, in line with the downturn. Tight spending controls enabled the group to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. In EES, orders declined to $33 million and net sales declined 34% to $207 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was negative 8.2% on lower revenue and an inventory adjustment of $31 million.
We have taken several cost actions in EES to date including workforce reductions, shortened workweeks, product program rationalization and spending controls. Over the past few quarters, operating expenses have been reduced by approximately 20%, and we have removed over 50% of our manufacturing cost structure. Given the uncertain period to an uptick in demand, we are continuing to look for additional cost-saving opportunities in order to further lower breakeven levels. We'll provide an update of these actions at the Investor Analyst Meeting in March.
Now I will cover our targets for what is shaping up to be a very strong second quarter, led by our semiconductor businesses. We expect SSG net sales to be up 15% to 25% due to strong sequential growth in foundry spending. In AGS, we expect net sales to be up 5% to 10%, driven by improving customer utilization levels. In Display, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to down 25% off a low base, as the industry continues to absorb overcapacity. In EES, we expect net sales to be down greater than 40% due to continuing soft demand and the drawdown of backlog and deferred revenue. We expect our overall net sales to be up 5% to 15%, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share, reflecting the positive effect of higher semiconductor revenues on our margin structure.

And for my follow-up, I guess kind of more of the bigger picture question about the cycles and if they're changing at all, just from the standpoint of historically, when your customers [indiscernible] they probably ordered more, and when they weren't doing well, they ordered less, at the back half of the [indiscernible] we actually saw a change to that or it's actually a little strong, but before the customer stepped up and ordered tremendous amounts of equipment, especially the fourth quarter. Do you think [indiscernible] that customers are going to be ordering equipment [indiscernible] or adding capacity vis-Ã -vis their own business or do you think that was for a little bit of an anomalistic situation?",119

And we've been doing a lot of thinking about this particular issue. And the essence, I think, of what's happening kind of has a few elements. First of all, the smartphone and tablet demand is accelerating. So it's pretty fast, and to keep up with that ramp, foundries are going to have to move more quickly. Over the last couple of years, die sizes have doubled or you could say die sizes are kind of going up at a 50% a year kind of level, which is pretty unprecedented for the applications, processors, which are the major silicon consumer there. Then the other thing is that because these die sizes are going up, you've got to move to the leading edge very, very quickly. And as we've all certainly seen, as these smartphones change model, everybody moves to the new model immediately. So there's a lot of pressure for foundries to be ahead on capacity and be in a position to supply the demand that's coming, even though their utilization might be not the 95% or 90% where they use to wait until that point to order significant amount of new capacity.",210

The -- it's been pretty light on bookings and on revenues at the end of last year, but more so this -- in the first half of this year. We do expect that actually to pick it up though we're seeing signs from customers that they need to add capacity, particularly in selected areas. So we expect it to be a little down overall from last year, but to recover and that will be a source of improvement in the second half.",93

Mike, if I look at memory spending, I understand the secular drivers for NAND. And both NAND and DRAM, it seems like the beginning of the year, there's all this optimism that they come back in second half. But over the past couple of years, it never panned out exactly. I'm kind of wondering like what gives you the confidence this year memory spending will come back in the second half, and I have a follow-up?",86

Our expectation for DRAM is very modest, so it's just kind of a timing of when they're going to make their investments to move their lines to the next generation. They have -- just to be competitive, they have to keep moving node to node to node. We don't expect any capacity investments in DRAM at all.",112

I mean, when we first announced the synergies, Krish, we said that maybe 60% would be coming out of OpEx, maybe 40% in cost of sales. And what we're seeing is much more opportunity in cost of sales. And so we would expect maybe those ratios to change a little bit. We also have seen some additional opportunities in SG&A, so overall, we think that's why we're confident we're going to be able to increase the number. And as we get a little bit further along, we'll set a new and higher target.",94

First of all, our view on EUV is pretty consistent with what you said. I just add to that, that as it comes into production, it's really going to come in at one layer, probably contact layer first, get into production for one year or maybe another layer as we go through time. But I think the insertion, because of the costs are going to -- and need to get to productized are going to be relatively slow. So the net of that is that double patterning, quadruple patterning is pretty much here to stay. We kind of view that our SAM gets increased by about $800 million with those applications today as it gets applied to more layers, that'll grow over the next few years. So we think with or without EUV and how it's going to go into production, not much change to the current trends.",149

But let me just start with the Varian team. I mean that bringing the Varian team into Applied has already had some great effects. As you get to see how we're integrating the company, you'll see Varian executives and a number of different jobs throughout Applied. In the end, when you buy a company, you buy the people and the culture, as well as the products. So I mean that's one that we're really excited about, probably more -- way more excited than, certainly, the day we bought -- announced that we bought the company. Then just the way our technical people are working together and finding synergy and issues, areas to do experiments together on. I think we have a great opportunity. These will take some time to talk to customers about and get into solving the customer problems. But I think that's another one that is going to be very, very exciting. And then just the matchup of the strategies. We think the solar product is going to be very good over a period of time. And so when you put all those things together and we save more than we announced at the beginning on synergy, we're still incredibly excited about acquiring Varian. George, would you add anything?",219

But obviously, they were non-GAAP accretive, and they're right out the gate as we said they would be. And in the second quarter, as we look, they could be close to GAAP accretive. So they got a lot of leverage in their performance model, as do we. I think that was maybe underestimated by -- as you could see in the consensus, why we came in so much stronger when you saw an uptick in the semi business. So there is just -- their business model works well with ours. The people are outstanding. And not only are we able to help them in areas, but they've got some practices that, quite frankly, that will help us and we're adopting as well. So it's the kind of acquisition you like to see and everything we've seen so far says it's only better than we thought.",155

One is we saw actually very strong December quarter performance from a few of your Japanese competitors. But then we saw these competitors guide March bookings down, contrasting what you and your U.S. peers have seen.

And if you look at their order pattern over time, it always moves with more of a 6-month cycle than a 3-month cycle. So I [ph] know that I could say anything more intelligent about what -- how their business goes, but for us, it's clearly exposure to foundries. Our strong position with those foundries that are buying today. And so that's really the essence of it for us quarter-over-quarter and how we see the first 6 months of the year.",93

And then my follow-up question with the year coming to a close, if you look at your market share in silicon equipment throughout 2011, how did that market share progress compare to the targets that you set out one year ago? And what are your targets looking forward one year? If you can maybe highlight some of the share gain opportunities and challenges in your silicon business now.",69

So I said some things during my prepared remarks, but maybe I can just kind of summarize. On the macro, on wafer fab equipment spending including everything, including MOCVD, we saw a pretty big spending shift towards lithography. That spending shift basically on a percentage basis, shrinks our TAM or shrinks our SAM. So we saw a 2- to 3-point downward shift because of that during 2011, primarily -- and that was -- caused a lot of line upgrades, also in logic, a big shift to immersion lithography. We expect that to -- and you can kind of see the change now that we're maybe through that period except for DRAM. I think DRAM's only going to do technology upgrades for a while. But as we look at our product line, we think we have great opportunity to gain share virtually in every area. We did gain share in all of our major areas. ECP gained double digits last year. We gained in metal deposition, in CVD. We lost in CMP and etch where we have good chance to bounce back this year and gain points there. In our Inspection division, we gained last year, at least one point of overall share. We expect, with wins weâ€™ve already seen this year, that we'll also gain this year. And in that area, in Inspection, we really had a shift in the business over the last few years to really the bulk of our business was with the top 3 or 4 manufacturer customers as opposed in previous years, it was quite different. If there's any specific product line that you'd like to know about, we can cover it or we can cover it after the call.",286

It seems like we've had a little bit of adjustment here. Could you give us a little thoughts on maybe, over and under, it sounds like flat panel and EES might be weaker than you thought, maybe that's offset by better silicon -- semi equipment sales?",70
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,282268.0,13892753.0,Answer,Michael Splinter,,Executives,50,"Yes. Certainly, back in November when we started, we certainly underestimated where we thought we would -- where we are today with semiconductor equipment sales. As we said, really, the thrust by foundries to get capacity in place has been the biggest part of that. Our flat panel display seems to push out -- has been pushing out. We've been expecting factories in China that buildings have been built to start to get facilitized. Those things seem to be getting pushed out. We're seeing a little bit of capacity digestion in touch panels right now, but we do expect that technology and that product line to come back with the growth in tablets and during this year sometime. In solar, I think this is pretty much what we expected. If anything, we're surprised by how strong the end demand is. So if we look at the kind of effective capacity there, we think there is kind of effective capacity of 40 -- a little over 40 gigawatts. There is nameplate capacity over 50 gigawatts, but when you look at who can make solar cells that will sell, it's really a little bit over 40 gigawatts. If demand gets up to 35 gigawatts, this year, that's a significant closure of the gap of the capacity demand gap that we're dealing with right now. And you could see a more normal kind of buying pattern than we're seeing today.",237

And then the second question I had was just kind of tied to gross margin expectations throughout the year. You have a very concentrated customer exposure beginning the year and it sounds like you expect this to kind of mitigate as we go through the year. So in general, should this improve overall the gross margin structure for the company or how do you think we should kind of trend that out?",73

I think what you're seeing is a couple of factors: Number one, gross margin improving, in general, in our semiconductor businesses with volume and -- but also the gross margin improving as the mix of our business changes in the year. With the softness in our non-semi businesses, what we referred to as the semi-businesses, which is SSG and AM AGS, which is largely serving semi customers, you get a close to a 90% mix now of those businesses which were down in the kind of 80% or less range last year. So you're getting a much better flow-through and that's reflected in the margin.",110

There is certain segments like PVD and RTP, Epi. CMP, where you have more than 70% market share. As your customer prepare to move for 450 nanometer -- sorry, 450 millimeter. Do you think that the smaller competitor can survive, can take and invest in the 450 millimeter and as a result, on that concern, you might begin to get 100% market share on those segments?",70

What we're trying to do here is work closely with the customers, understand their needs and timing so that we don't, first of all, invest too soon or too late, that we put our investments in the places that are going to be needed. I said earlier that we're looking at the early test wafer systems. And we're pretty specifically focused there because that's what our customers need first. So that test wafers can be run, robotics can be tested, defects can be measured and the like. So we're going to make sure that Applied Materials is very well positioned going into 450 millimeter so that our solutions are there for the customers. We're solving their problems in the 300-millimeter generations ahead of 450 millimeter because we believe that there is a lot of risk in transitioning to 450-millimeter. If we can maximize our position in 300 millimeter going into that transition, that will be the best possible scenario for Applied Materials. Then we have to make sure we're managing our spending very tightly so that we don't get ahead of the game or behind the game. But we're going to be lockstep with the customers is the best way that I can try to describe it.",229

That's very helpful. And also on the SSD subsegments, where are you most excited about in terms of above market growth? I mean, there is -- you participate in several segments, but my sense is that transistor is becoming a lot more complicated and you have several markets, I mean, implant RTP, Epi, metal gate, if I take all these together, where do you think you see more growth, I mean, if I look at all your SSD subsegments?",80

But if you make me pick 1 or 2, especially focused in on the transistors where we're going to see a lot of change. We're going to see a lot of change on the memory cells. So we're getting ourselves prepared to help customers make those transitions. Epi has been one of those areas that doesn't get noticed a whole lot. It's a product inside of our front-end products group. But pretty much now with each generation, there is an added Epi step, at least in Logic and foundry. In the future, weâ€™re going to see a need for Epi in the channels, so we'll have additional Epi steps. We'll see probably in generations to come, Epi needed on memory devices to enhance the performance of the transistors. And then as we go to vertical NAND, I think we got a lot of opportunity on both our deposition, our CVD products and our PVD products. And finally, if you look across all these different things, they're all going to need more and more implants. It was part of the analysis that we did when we bought Varian, but we see the number of adjustments and dialing in of the performance of the various transistors to accelerate with time here. So we think that, if I really, really have to narrow it down, then I get to Epi and implant.",238

So especially during this last year, we suffered quite a bit because of the low spending in those areas. Spending mix was down, so that certainly hurt our Etch business substantially. Where we're really focused with the etch business is on the patterning applications. We think that the solution that we have with Centris offers better performance, certainly better productivity and uniformity than the competition. So we think our focusing in into that area should give us an opportunity to grow back some share this year and then in the years to come. In CMP, it was really just a spending shift, who is spending more, who is spending less. And I think that we'll see a pop back on CMP share this year to previous high levels.",141

And then on a longer-term question on NAND flash, SanDisk, on its Analyst Day, said a few things, what -- they expect the long-term cost reductions for NAND to almost decline in half to maybe 30% a year down from the low-50% it used to be. And they expect, I guess, that might slow down the rate of wafer capacity adds. How do you sort of think about NAND evolution, longer-term, if the cost reduction were to slow? And what can AMAT do that could push the cost reduction backup?",91
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,282268.0,13892770.0,Answer,Michael Splinter,,Executives,67,"Yes. I'm not sure of everything they said. But NAND certainly benefited from being able to go faster than Moore's law for many, many years. So I think that's one of those impacts that's affecting NAND. I still think the biggest cost reducer is how much of their mix they can put on multicell -- multi-bit devices. But I think the demand is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly because of this mobile trend. So perhaps more of the footprint -- more of the dollar footprint ends up in NAND or we decide we don't need as much capacity. But I think the trend has been pretty clear that for servers with Windows 8 and ultrabooks coming in SSDs will grow dramatically. And the amount of flash in the rest of the mobile world will grow with each generation. We're working very hard, double patterning, quadruple patterning works the best in flash. Then moving to a vertical NAND structure should allow them to get significant cost-per-bit reductions. So we're working very closely with them. We think we have some enabling technology, especially for vertical NAND. But that's still a few years away from getting to production, but those discussions are happening today.",203

But last year was pretty close to 50% and we didn't see -- we just saw, really, conversions coming through. So we'll wait and see, but I think the key still with DRAM is how fast do PCs and how fast the ultrabooks get adopted, and how many -- how much DRAM capacity per PC. That starts moving up, you could easily see 50% growth, but we just don't see it today.",102

As we cited, we think we've been in a strong position and improving our share in electroplating and in CVD and PVD, which have been prime competitive fronts with one of those 2 companies.

251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179586.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Splinter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered another quarter of solid financial results, posting $2.5 billion of revenue and earnings at the high-end of our target range. These results reflect strength in our semiconductor equipment business, driven by robust foundry spending. Investments in areas related to advanced transistors are particularly strong, enabling our front-end products and implant groups to achieve record quarterly sales.
In contrast, the environment for our Display and Solar businesses remains weak, as television sales continue to be sluggish and solar market adjusts to excess manufacturing capacity. We recently announced the details of our EES restructuring plan. The actions we are taking are consistent with our previously stated goal to reduce the annual breakeven level for EES to approximately $500 million. Our success in driving operational improvements across the company has bolstered our confidence in our ability to deliver strong cash flow performance throughout our business cycles. As a result, in March we announced the 13% increase in our quarterly dividend and a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion of buybacks in the next 3 years.
Let me now turn to the economic outlook. While a number of indicators point towards stronger growth of our global economy in the second half of the year, we remain mindful of the consumer spending implications resulting from macroeconomic risks in Europe and the emerging markets. Mobility is the prominent macro theme impacting Applied's business as it drives significant changes in consumer behavior, including faster adoption rates for new products and shorter refresh cycles. Global appetite for mobile devices with new features, longer battery life and brighter, higher resolution displays continues to strengthen. We now see smartphone sales in the range of 660 million to 710 million units for the calendar year and maintain our view that tablets will grow approximately 60% year-on-year to more than 100 million units. 
As these devices drive demand for leading-edge foundry capacity, the market leaders are aggressively accelerating their ramps at advanced nodes. Foundry investment has contributed almost 60% of our revenue in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2012. 
Over the past 2 years, seasonal buying patterns have become more pronounced, as the foundries need capacity and production that supports smartphone model changes later in the year. We see their equipment spending peaking in the second quarter. And despite the uptick in Q2, we believe foundry investment will be maintained in the second half of 2012 and distributed over a broader base of customers.
Unit growth of smartphones and tablets is also driving demand for NAND. However, the average content per box remains relatively flat. We believe bit growth will be about 75% for the year, with approximately 1/3 of investment representing new capacity additions and 2/3 technology conversions. This is resulting in softening of spending in the near term. With hard disk drives supply issues now resolved, global PC sales are recovering. DRAM bit growth is in the 30% to 40% range and process equipment investment remains at historic lows. However, we believe ultrabooks and Windows 8 will have a positive impact on logic and memory spending starting in late 2012.
Across the industry, factory utilization rates and wafer starts are steadily increasing, and this is reflected in revenue growth for our services business. As a result of sustained investment by the foundries, we are narrowing our wafer fab equipment forecast. We currently see spending in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 10% compared to 2011, with a relatively even split between the first half and second half of the year. 
A favorable spending mix also contributes to our positive outlook for fiscal 2012. As foundries introduce advanced transistors schemes at 28-nanometer node, the number of selected epitaxy and ion implantation steps is growing. Applied's market leadership in epi and implant resulted in record quarterly revenues for these businesses. Our metal depositions group also posted its highest quarterly sales in more than a decade, reflecting the increased complexity in PVD for metal gate structures. 
We expect continued strength from these product lines as transistor formation becomes more process-intensive at the 20-nanometer node. The Varian integration is progressing to plan. We are pleased with our customers' response to the acquisition. We are on track to exceed our target synergy savings. As we integrate the 2 companies, we're deploying several members of the Varian management team to roles in other business units and functions.
In Display, near-term orders are being supported by mobility applications, as high-resolution mobile displays migrate from smartphones to tablets and as touch panel manufacturers add capacity in anticipation of touch-enabled Ultrabooks. While investment in TV capacity remains at low levels, we see a number of indications that the market is improving. With panel prices increasing and factory utilization trending higher, and as customers start to build out new factories in China, we expect TV-related orders to pick up as early as the fourth quarter.
In addition, the adoption of metal oxide transistors is accelerating. This technology increases the served available market for Applied's deposition equipment by about approximately 30%. And we expect this to have a positive impact on revenues in 2013. 
In solar, our view of the end market has not changed materially since March. Germany remains the leading consumer of PV and has once again delayed their feed-in tariff reduction. Demand in China, the U.S. and Japan is also accelerating. Marginal efficiencies are steadily rising. And as manufacturing cost continue to fall, we are starting to see the economics of solar working even in non-incentive markets.
Investment in new capacity remains at extremely low levels, despite the top panel makers in China, and Taiwan running their factories at high utilization, and noncompetitive capacity being taken offline. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of the EES business, we are scaling back our development program for LED equipment, consolidating administrative and support functions in our solar business units and moving manufacturing for our wafering products in Asia. These actions will improve profitability across cycles, while still allowing us to invest in the products that are critical enablers for our customers and for long-term growth of the business.
In summary, 2012 can be characterized as another strong year of wafer fabrication equipment spending. Applied is delivering the solutions our customers need to meet their aggressive capacity ramps and rapid transition trends to new technology and volume production. 
Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1095
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179587.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. During the second fiscal quarter, we exceeded our expectations for revenue and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 at the high-end of our target range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share. Strong performance in our semiconductor equipment business was the largest contributor to these results. Our Solar and Display businesses continue to focus on next-generation technology, while managing their overall spending in the face of weak markets.
As Mike indicated, after the end of the quarter, we announced the restructuring of our EES business to lower the cost structure and the operating breakeven level. We expect to incur charges of $70 million to $100 million for costs relating to employee severance, inventory write-downs and other asset impairments over the next 12 to 18 months. These costs represent approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share on a GAAP basis and up to $0.01 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We will keep you updated as these charges impact our financial statements.
I'll now compare our second quarter results to the prior quarter. Orders increased 38% to $2.8 billion and net sales increased 16% to $2.5 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog grew 10% to $2.4 billion, in line with orders. Backlog adjustments were a negative $24 million, as cancellations, financial debookings and foreign exchange impacts of just under $100 million were partially offset by $73 million of re-bookings, primarily in Display. Our backlog aging remains healthy, with over 80% of backlog expected to turn in the next 2 quarters.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.1%, up 1.4 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of SSG revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $580 million, slightly above our target range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect to be in line with our target range for the current quarter. 
Spending on SSG programs continues to increase in line with a rapid acceleration of technology adoption and the early work on 450-millimeter. Overall, we are seeing some benefit of early synergy capture. We expect the impact of further synergies and our broader EES actions to bring operating expenses to the lower end of our target range over the next several quarters.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% and for the fiscal year, the rate expectation remains at 26% to 27%.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.2 billion, up $289 million. Operating cash flow was $603 million or 24% of revenue, driven by higher earnings and a reduction in working capital. Improved inventory and payables more than offset increases in receivables associated with higher net sales.
Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash. In addition to increasing our dividend and setting a new 3-year repurchase program in the quarter, we paid $104 million in dividends and spent $200 million to purchase 16.2 million shares. At current price levels, we continue -- we expect to continue to be an active buyer of our stock. 
Next, I will comment on our signal results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 39% to $2 billion, reflecting continuing strong foundry demand. Net sales increased 32% to $1.8 billion, above the upper end of our outlook. Customer concentration remained high with the top 3 customers representing 72% of orders and 68% of revenue. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased to 32.3% on higher revenue, with improved earnings flow-through more than offsetting spending increases for new programs.
In AGS, orders grew 26% to $650 million. Excluding a thin-film solar line booked in the period, orders would have been 7% higher compared to the prior quarter. AGS net sales were up 3% to $551 million, slightly below our outlook due to the timing of some 200-millimeter equipment shipments. Non-GAAP operating margins declined slightly to 20.1%. 
In Display, orders increased to $84 million, driven by advanced mobile display investments. Net sales for Display were up 29% to $134 million and above our outlook due to earlier-than-anticipated tool sign-offs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.7%. Display has maintained its spending discipline and will remain profitable in a challenging environment. 
In EES, orders increased $29 million to $62 million, reflecting very low levels of demand. Net sales declined to $79 million. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $57 million on lower revenue and a $20 million inventory charge.
Next, I will talk about our expectations for the third quarter. We expect SSG net sales to be down 5% to 10%. This decrease follows a stronger-than-expected second quarter. In AGS, we expect net sales to be flat to up 10%, driven primarily by improving wafer starts. 
In Display and EES, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to plus or minus 20%, with both operating from a low base. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 10% and we expect our non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.29 per share. This estimate includes a non-GAAP charge of up to $0.01 per share for the EES restructuring actions.
For the fiscal year, the company expects net sales and earnings per share to be at the high-end of the company's previous outlook, which estimated net sales in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.95.

But you also said that Q2 may be a peak for foundries and you think memory is likely to remain weak. Could you just give a sense of the moving parts between first half and second half? What's sort of coming up to make it flat in the second half?",79
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179591.0,Answer,Michael Splinter,,Executives,7,"Sure. So I think first of all, to kind of understand our view on this, you have to think about -- what the foundries need to supply model changes and the buying season at the end of the year. So what it does is peaks out foundry spending in this kind of second calendar quarter, end of the first quarter, beginning of the second calendar quarter. Now, since if you look at both our fiscal year in the very beginning of the calendar year, spending in wafer fab equipment was a little bit weak. So as you go through the -- when we add it up, we get pretty much flat first half, second half, even though we see a peak in this time period of March, April, May. Then if you we at the other kind of segments of wafer fab equipment spending, in the DRAM area, we expect low levels of spending throughout the year, modestly down in the second half of the year. NAND spending, we previously had thought it would be better, but we now think it's not going to be better. It's going to be a little bit lower in the second half of the year as well. And then we do expect logic spending to perk up at the very end of the year as new tech -- the next node of logic technology starts to be purchased. So the summation of that is foundry will end up being pretty flat first half, second half; logic will pickup; and memory will be modestly down in the second half.",264

One quick follow-up. If I take a step back from the seasonal trends in foundries and all that, if I look at how big this 40-nanometer node is at all the foundries, and if I look at how much capacity is being added at 28 nanometer, and if I sort of try to think about the capacity at the end of the year, relative to how big the opportunity is, do you think that we are labeling the 28-nanometer additions or later links or early links? How do you sort of think about the overall opportunity for 28 additions?",100
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179593.0,Answer,Michael Splinter,,Executives,9,"Our view on 28 is that this is going to be the largest node. We think demand on 28-nanometers is very high and there's still constrained supply. The speed of the ramp is about something in the neighborhood of 50% faster than the 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer ramp. And we think in the end, when this -- when 28-nanometer peaks out over the next few years, it will end up being something on a range of 40% higher than the previous generation peak. So right now, we think 28-nanometer is going to be strong through the year. It's going to be strong into 2013. Assuming that our customers can find a place to put equipment, they'll continue to add equipment as quickly as they can.",123

First in the EES segment, what does normalized profitability have to get to over the next couple of years, post the restructuring in order for you guys to want to stay in the business? That would be the first question. Second question is on the NAND side, obviously it's been a little lower than we all would have thought this year. Is it just pricing that we need to look at in order to determine when that segment could pick back up, or is there some technology transitions coming along that could create a need for increased spending, even in the absence of a pickup in pricing?",109
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179596.0,Answer,George Davis,,Executives,12,"Jim, it's George. I'll the question on the EES segment. I think if you look at the new EES model that we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we showed that operating margins went to somewhere between 16% and 19% when we to get to a $1 billion of revenue, which is about half of the run rate that we saw last year. So we think as EES moves up into that range, it starts to show the underlying benefit of the core operating businesses. It continues to be an investment vehicle for us. We think this is an attractive long-term business and so we'll continue to invest in next-generation cell technologies. But we think in that range, it will be a positive contributor to the company.",127

But the NAND follow-up question, what we're seeing right now is about a 75% bit growth. But within that, there's a number of things, maybe I can address first supply and then demand. On the supply side, we're seeing a number of things happening here. A lot of the legacy demand is kind of falling off for things like cameras, iPods or MP3 players, and USB drives. So that allows them room to upgrade their legacy capacity, so factor one. Then additionally, the 3-bit per cell technology is getting qualified in many more applications and much faster, probably, than we thought it would. On the demand side, I think the biggest factor is that the footprint in tablets and smartphones of NAND flash is not moving up as fast as we thought. So while they're affected by that big growth rate of 60% in tablets and 30-plus percent in smartphones, they're not getting a big additional kicker on the bit growth because the number of bits per box are staying relatively flat. I think that part of that is pricing, but I think part of it is just what consumers demand for storage in these devices. So until solid-state drives get into PCs or the footprint dramatically changes, I think we'll see this kind of growth rate, bit growth, in NAND.",233

I wouldn't say that they're giving us a lot more lead time. I think they're telling us as soon as they know that they need more capacity. In part, you can see that here in our Q2, where demand was a bit higher in our semiconductor group than we thought it would be. And I think that actually is extending into Q3. So I don't know that we get anymore lead time on this. But we would like to get more lead time but the way this business is working right now, I think customers let us know as soon as they know.",139

So we said by our fourth fiscal quarter, we said as early as our fourth fiscal quarter, but the biggest thing that we continue to see some increase investment in mobility, for tablets and for touch-enabled ultrabooks. But also to really have the orders pick up, we have to see TV investments increase. And that, particularly, will be in some factories in China. The factories are built, and it's a matter of customers deciding when to facilitize those. But we think that could be as early as fourth quarter. There's been pretty significant underinvestment this year, CapEx as low as $3 billion. Our equipment CapEx as low as $3 billion. So very significant underinvestment here. Meanwhile the market is growing, so the shortages are improving, prices are improving. Supply and demand is getting more in balance. So we think that there is needed investment and as we projected in Analyst Day, we think 2013 can kind of get back to 2011 revenue levels for us.",166

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,29,"That was very helpful there. And then going back to silicon, just I guess a question on foundry. I think one of the foundry, or at least one of the foundry or some of the foundries, are starting to talk about 20-nanometer as the new node and I think some people are speculating that will be a bigger node and if you listen to what Intel is talking about in terms of 20-nanometer, it's seeing basically bigger [indiscernible] because you need more equipment. So are you guys anticipating that to start to come in calendar fourth quarter of this year? And do you expect that to be, I guess, a longer-term driver for the foundry business?",116

We'll see some R&D equipment, but we don't expect a major ramp in 20 nanometers in the fourth quarter. Really, what we expect is logic spending to increase at the end of the year as 14-nanometer capacity starts to get built. Both of those technologies are quite good for Applied as the advanced transistors take a lot more steps. They'll take more epi steps. They will take more metal steps to be able to develop those high-performance low-power transistors.",94

We'll continue to support those customers in their efforts to get our products into production. But we're going to pull back on how much we've been spending on the new capabilities and the new products in the MOCVD area. So we will pretty significantly pullback on the spending there. And really, the rationale is we have a lot of areas that we are looking at that have good return for the company and for shareholders and we have to prioritize our spending. And this is one of those areas where the return looked quite far out, so we made our choices to spend in other areas and also cut back and get our profitability in our Solar business up.",140

Technology shrinks are ongoing. The DRAM guys have had -- primarily, where they're spending their small capital budget is on technology shrinks. But we've been encouraged to see prices stabilize here.

These things seem to transcend some of the economic environment, but it depends on how bad a situation we can imagine. Certainly, if there's a situation like 2008, I think everybody pulls back like they did in 2008. But I think with any kind of modest pullback, there's a good chance that these electronic devices continue to be sold in nearly these kind of quantities that we're talking about.",83

You mentioned turns business continues to be high. I guess is that any indicator for us to look at how orders are or what's the discrepancy? How can I reconcile the strong order flow that we've seen versus the revenue guidance for July?,80

Also, remember we had a large, close to $100 million booking in AGS related to a SunFab project and that won't actually revenue until after the third quarter. So that may be part of what, if you're trying to reconcile, that may be part of the math.",72

And also, a second question in terms of the margin profile on a going forward basis. You mentioned a lot of the gains you hope to get on the margin profile from the cost savings efforts. As revenues begin to grow again to what I would characterize as more normalized levels, how much does just the impact of increasing revenues contribute it to say the gross margin, more particularly?",71
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3406.0,310712.0,15179637.0,Answer,George Davis,,Executives,53,"Well, I think you're already going to see it. In the third quarter, we said we'd be down on revenue. I think we're going to be fairly flat on gross margin as some of the improvements help offset the effect of volumes. So one of the things in margin that is the big factor is going to be mix. And as we get -- continue to see a strong semi mix, while we're -- particularly while we're seeing the non-semi business is still at absolute levels, we still have some room for upside. But really it's when the non-semi businesses start to recover, which we expect to happen in '13, that I think you're going to see some real lift on the margin side.",124

It's a month that'll be in our competitors' next quarter and it won't be in ours. But we had very, very strong, particularly foundry orders in the second quarter, and that really was the foundation.

But I think there's time yet to get those technologies to really be production-worthy. And so as soon as they can get them into production, they will.

Okay, so first on bit growth. Our view on bit growth really hasn't changed much in the last few months. DRAM in the 30% to 40% range, not a lot of momentum there although we see increased footprint on DRAMs and smartphones, which again is another one of those positive signs for DRAMs. And then flash in the 75% bit growth regime. And that's resulting -- and about 1/3 of that results in capacity additions and 2/3 in upgrades -- that they're achieving through upgrades. We think the 20-nanometer technology is going to be between 30% and 40% more complex. Layers that are deposition layers, etch layers, inspections that all could accrue to Applied Materials. So our overall SAM, if you will, should increase by roughly that amount on a per wafer start or per 10,000 wafer start basis.",140

I'm just wondering how that -- you might think that might affect your EES business?",40

These tariffs are on top of some tariff -- some countervailing duty tariffs already levied, so this seems to be pretty steep. It will certainly cause changes in the supply chain. For those global companies, I think they will be able to adjust their supply chain, move around, get access to cells from other regions. It'll also give opportunity, I think, to Taiwanese manufacturers and of course, it will give some benefit to U.S. manufacturers as these tariffs get levied. For Applied Materials, we're selling to pretty much every solar -- every crystalline silicon solar manufacturer. And our focus with them is on reducing cost and improving efficiency. We certainly -- our goal, and I think the goal of most of our customers is to drive the cost down so that governments don't have to intervene into the business either from incentive or tariff kind of situations. So we're going to keep our focus up in this area. In the end, if it doesn't affect demand, my biggest worry that these tariffs would affect in demand, slowdown in demand, that would be a negative for every part of the solar industry, so hopefully they don't do that. But I think there's a pretty big risk of that.",236

251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2012",2012-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3325.0,347801.0,16827621.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Splinter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered solid financial performance in line with our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, display and solar. Thanks to strong execution demonstrated by our teams around the world, we posted $2.3 billion of revenue, with earnings near the midpoint of our target range. Strong cash flow performance enabled us to return $615 million to shareholders while maintaining our cash balance. 
Over the past 3 months, we have made excellent progress with the Varian integration. We are accelerating our compliance to combine the 2 companies, and we are on track to exceed our targeted synergy savings.
In June, we announced the appointment of Gary Dickerson as Applied Materials President. I've asked Gary to focus his attention on the company's product strategy and development engine, with a view to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our R&D investments. Gary is fully immersed in this endeavor, and will provide an update at our next call in November.
As we outlined at SEMICON West, demand for wafer fabrication equipment has softened dramatically since the first half of the year, with sharp declines in foundry and NAND investment. As we look to our fiscal Q4, we see a combination of macroeconomic and industry dynamics contributing to a very weak business environment. We believe this pullback in demand is seasonal, and we expect it to be short-lived, with orders and revenue recovering in our first fiscal quarter. 
During this period, we will diligently manage discretionary spending, while focusing our investments on critical programs that support our strategic priorities to grow share in wafer fab equipment and expand our total available market.
From European austerity to slowing growth in China and the U.S., economic uncertainty is weighing on top of a seasonal pullback to produce weaker near-term demand. And our customers are choosing to delay their investments until they see stronger demand signals. China is now the largest market for TVs, PCs and smartphones, and the Chinese economy will play a pivotal role in determining how quickly industry investment levels recover.
While mobility remains the most significant driver of growth in the semiconductor industry, this is also causing changes in market dynamics. For the second year in a row, we are feeling the effects of more pronounced seasonal buying, as consumers wait for new smartphone and tablet models to be released. 
With foundries representing about 45% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2012, the investment patterns of these customers are the single most important factor impacting our business today. In addition, lower-than-expected PC sales have held back DRAM bit growth to the 30% range and consequently, investments in new capacity remain at extremely at low levels. 
The adoption of solid-state drives is not ramping as quickly as forecast and with only modest increase in the bits per box for mobile devices, we now see NAND bit growth in the range of 60% to 65%. As a result, customers have announced they will cut production by roughly 150,000 wafer starts per month on top of reduction in their capital spending.
Looking at the industry as a whole, we are maintaining the 2012 wafer fab equipment forecast that we shared at SEMICON. We believe spending will be in the range of $30 billion to $33 billion for the year, and there is a firm foundation for the multiyear capital investment cycle to continue.
As the mobility trend gathers pace, we believe foundries will need between 100,000 and 150,000 wafer starts per month of additional 28-nanometer capacity next year. In addition, ultrabooks and Windows 8 have the potential to spur PC growth and drive resurgence in demand for both DRAM and flash memory. 
Within this investment cycle, the spending mix favors Applied's leadership areas as customers introduce increasingly complex transistors schemes. We expect 2012 to be a record year for our Epi business, driven by an increasing number of selected Epi applications. Our metal deposition group also delivered another strong quarter, benefiting from broader adoption of metal gate transistors.
With the 450-millimeter road map becoming clearer and timing of major milestones more predictable, we continue to ramp our development program to be in the right position at the right time to serve our customers through this transition.
In Display, mobility-related markets represented 100% of our orders this quarter. We expect investment in these markets to remain at healthy levels as customers shift production of displays and touch panels for both smartphones and tablets to larger substrate sizes and more advanced technologies. 
In contrast, TV sales for the first half of the year were around 90 million units, which is below the level needed to stimulate capacity additions. 
In the near term, TV-related investment will be limited to development tools for new technology, focused on metal oxide transistors and organic LEDs. 
As macroeconomic conditions improve, we believe that TV supply and demand can rebalance quickly, and this will provide a catalyst for customers to resume their plans to populate new factories in China. We expect to see the first orders for these factories before the end of the calendar year.
In solar, end-market demand is still robust and we maintain our view that global installations will be in the range of 27 to 35 gigawatts for the year. The industry is relentlessly driving down manufacturing costs and making conversion efficiency improvements. As a result, TV-generated electricity is reaching parity with retail electricity rates in many areas of the world. 
At the same time, overcapacity within the supply chain has created an exceptionally challenging environment for wafer, cell and module manufacturers. Our EES results reflect an environment of extremely cautious investment by our customers as they focus on conserving cash.
Industry consolidation is occurring, albeit slower than anticipated, and this rationalization of capacity will be a critical factor in determining when the supply and demand come back into balance.
We remain focused on lowering our cost structure in EES, and have made significant progress shifting our manufacturing footprint to Asia while exiting LED.
In summary, we are currently navigating a period of turbulence in our markets and managing a rapidly changing demand profile in our semiconductor equipment business. We delivered solid results for the third quarter, and we're operating the company efficiently with disciplined spending, aligned to the contours of this business environment.
Although we see a weak near-term outlook, we firmly believe that the fundamental trends in mobility and solar energy adoption provide a strong platform for Applied Materials to generate long-term value and attractive returns for our shareholders.
Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1114
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2012",2012-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3325.0,347801.0,16827622.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied generated strong operating cash flow and ramped the return of cash to shareholders, buying back 3.6% of shares outstanding in the quarter. In a difficult environment, we are controlling spending while ensuring we prioritize investment in key areas to support future growth.
Let me start by comparing our third quarter results to the prior quarter. Orders declined 35% to $1.8 billion, reflecting push-outs in semiconductor equipment, lower AGS orders due to the absence of a finFET thin-film solar order and continuing weak demand in our non-semiconductor business. 
Net sales decreased 8% to $2.3 billion due to lower semiconductor equipment sales. Non-GAAP gross margin was down slightly to 41.6%, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, 6% below our Q2 levels and 4% below our outlook of $565 million plus or minus $10 million. Adjusting for onetime beneficial items, our run rate was approximately $560 million.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to lower our target run rate to $545 million plus or minus $10 million, as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while selectively increasing our investment for critical programs in SSG.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% and for the fiscal year, the rate expectation remains at 26% to 27%. The modest uptick in the rate reflected the impact of lower revenue on our global tax structure.
Cash and investments ended the quarter approximately flat at $3.2 billion, as our operating cash flow offset total cash return to shareholders and CapEx. Our strong cash flow performance was due to effective working capital management, with improved inventory and receivable balances offsetting the impact of lower revenues.
Our capital allocation priorities for cash continue to be investing in attractive opportunities in our businesses, increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash.
We increased share buybacks to $500 million in the quarter, repurchasing 46.7 million shares at an average price of $10.71 per share. We also paid $115 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase that we announced in March. 
Over the past 4 quarters, we have repurchased approximately 97 million shares or more than 7% of shares outstanding at an average price of $11.08. We expect to continue to be an active buyer of our stock in this environment.
Next I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 41% to $1.2 billion, led by foundry customers. For our fiscal year, we expect SSG orders will be weighted 60% to 65% in the first half, with nearly 70% of foundry orders in the first half of our fiscal year.
Net sales decreased 13% to $1.5 billion, consistent with our outlook at the SEMICON West briefing. The largest sequential declines were from foundry and NAND at 17% and 18%, respectively.  SSG's non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, in line with model performance.
In AGS, orders were $531 million.  Excluding a thin-film solar line booked in fiscal Q2, orders declined 4% sequentially. AGS net sales were up 5% to $579 million, as strengths in spares and services offset weakness in 200-millimeter equipment demand. AGS achieved model performance, with non-GAAP operating margin increasing to 23.3%.
In Display, orders decreased to $67 million, as LCD equipment spending continue to push out. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with orders below $100 million, reflecting exceptionally low demand for television manufacturing equipment. Net sales for Display were up 6% to $142 million, with mobility investments for touch panel and high-resolution screens accounting for the majority of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 8.5%.
In EES, orders decreased to $35 million, reflecting low solar equipment demand as capacity continues to be absorbed. Net sales were approximately flat at $77 million, with solar sales largely reflecting deferred revenue. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $64 million, which included an inventory charge of $26 million.
Next I will talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. As Mike indicated, we are seeing strong seasonal effects in our wafer fab equipment business, along with macroeconomic uncertainties that are leading our customers to reduce spending until they see signs of stronger consumer demand over the next few months. Accordingly, absent further weakening in the global economy, we expect the company's orders and revenues to bottom in our fiscal Q4.
Turning to our business segments, we expect SSG net sales to be down 45% to 55% in Q4, marking the low point of our business for the year. We are seeing a strong pullback across all categories of semiconductor equipment customers, and this is the primary factor in the near-term reduction in earnings for the company.
In AGS, we expect net sales to be up 5% to 15%, including more than $75 million in revenue from a thin-film solar line. 
In Display, we believe net sales will be down 25% to 40%, as the TV capacity ramp in China is pushed out for at least an additional quarter. Despite the low level of revenue, we expect Display to remain profitable in the quarter.
In EES, we expect net sales to be down 10% to 30%, as the timing of the solar equipment recovery remains uncertain.
We expect our overall net sales to be down 25% to 40%, and our non-GAAP earnings to be between $0 and $0.06 per share. 
Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions.",930

And I guess what gives you the confidence that they were in this seasonal pause and that we will see a recovery? And as part of that, where do you expect to see customer spending come back strongest?",74

As we look at what's happening in our Q4 and a drop-off in our discussions with customers, this is pretty much the seasonal low. We're also obviously discussing what's ahead, so our capacity is ready for them in the next month ahead. So we're quite certain that this is on the bottom from those discussions. But I would also add that we still view the 28-nanometer build-out for capacity in 2013. We still need between 100,000 and 150,000 wafers or so to fuel the growth in smartphones and tablets, as well as the build-out of the LTE infrastructure. And then we also think in 2013, we're going to see investments of about 50,000 wafers of 28 nanometers. That will come a little bit later in the year. But I think when we look at last year's pattern, this year's pattern, this year's more accentuated, but really quite similar in this seasonal cycle. I think my big caveat on that is what's going to happen macroeconomically. But macroeconomics are kind of pushing everybody down not only in the foundry sector, but in the other sectors as well. But we really think foundry is going to lead the way out of this in the calendar -- late in the calendar fourth quarter.",213

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,11,"So a question on the WFE, Mike. You didn't change the WFE, even though you provide a pretty weak outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Is that just a calendar versus fiscal thing? And then regarding recovery, I think on an answer in prior discussions, you said that mostly will come from foundry. What do you think will happen on the memory side?",63

Thanks, Edwin. Yes, what we're looking at is really calendar versus fiscal here. The timing of our particular fourth quarter gets us into this air pocket. But we're expecting that foundries will lead the way out, and we will see the overall WFE in the range that we had talked about earlier. When you look at it -- if you said, ""What's going to happen to drive it to the top end or the bottom end?"" We would have to, to get to the top end it would have to be all about foundries pushing harder for capacity in the last few months of the year. And the downside is both NAND, I think, and foundry even pulling back a little bit more than we currently anticipate. But -- so in large part, it's a foundry story for the last part of the year.",145

One of the reasons why we're not changing it, when we updated at SEMICON, we talked a lot about the uncertainty in foundry and the outlook that we have seen, which was a strong pullback in foundry. So when we lowered it, we already have the foundry action pretty much in our thinking. I would say the one thing that is marginally worse than we expected at SEMICON has really been NAND push-outs have been stronger and deeper than we anticipated.",84

That's was helpful. And then, George, a question on R&D expense. I think on your prepared remarks, OpEx was down again in the October quarter because of the cost reduction. But I think you guys are also starting the investment in 450. Do you see that as the bench that you would drive your R&D to go back up in the coming quarters?",64

I think what you've seen is if you kind of compare year-over-year, that's probably the easiest way to think about it. We've had -- the biggest drivers of increases in our OpEx is number one, we didn't have Varian last year at this time. So we've got the Varian spend and then youâ€™ve got 450. And what you're seeing there though is a reduction in OpEx from a variety of discretionary activities which quite frankly, we also had some of those in Q4 last year, because that was the down quarter for last year. But if you look at our non-semi businesses, they're down between 17% and 20% in their OpEx year-over-year. And that's helping us be able to kind of manage some of the fluctuation and also it's part of obviously the restructuring program that we have going on in EES as well.",145

It's -- the difference is the inventory charges taken. And we've been running with some degree of inventory write-downs as we've been going on. And that -- if you look at the underlying operating impact of that business, it will be about $0.06 for the year, and then the inventory adds another, say $0.04 to that picture.

And then as my follow-up, it sounds like since SEMICON West, where you were expecting foundry spending to be down about 30% in second half, it seems like things have slipped a little bit more since you're now thinking that it's going to be a little bit of a steeper decline. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking has developed since SEMICON West with regard to foundry spending? Have things weakened even further from what you had seen in the later months of June? And also is it broadening out to other customers, or is it just deeper cuts at the top foundries?",107

I would say again, I think directionally, foundry is where we thought it would be. We gave it a range, we said foundry would have about a $0.15 to $0.20 impact on the year. I would say we're probably more at the $0.20 end of the range as we look at what actually came out. But it was within kind of our view of what could happen. Again, I would go back to the fact that NAND has been a little bit weaker in the second half. That's been a factor that's certainly impacting us in this quarter. But also as Mike said, the macroeconomic effect is if you look at DRAM customers we think could be down, this is on a revenue basis, close to 35% to 40% in the quarter as well. Logic will be down probably 20% to 25% quarter-over-quarter as well. Obviously the big hitter is foundry and NAND, but even the other customers are down in the quarter.",164

I mean is it just the fiscal versus the calendar year for AMAT? You need to see a very, very sharp pickup in your January quarter for making the WFE numbers remain consistent with what the chip companies are saying? Or perhaps we have some downside to WFE? So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about perhaps the magnitude of the pickup that you're expecting to see in January.",129

Thanks, Satya, for the question. The euro has changed kind of pretty dramatically. I think from our standpoint, we thought that wafer fab equipment was going to be closer to flat year-over-year, and now we're in the kind of down 10% to 20% range. And so that's a pretty big impact over the last few months. We really -- I think our supposition earlier in the year was that foundries needed to power through the seasonal curve that we saw last year because of the shortage of capacity, and that's clearly not the case. They added a lot of capacity in Q2 and are now more in the put-it-in production and produce phase of adding capacity. As far as chip companies' projections on their overall capital spending, I think there's 2 factors: one, it may be at somewhat at a lower range of what they projected; and two, then there's the mix of what they're spending, their CapEx on how much is really on wafer fab equipment versus buildings and other equipment. So I think that's one of those factors that we know is going on because some of our customers need more space and capacity to add the next phase of capacity.",204

My question is more on semi, but the answer was useful. A follow-up question for, I guess, Mike. On the Display business, if you just look, take us back, look at 10-year trends in the industry, and it's clearly benefited the last 10 years with LCD TVs have become a bigger part of the mix. More people bought TVs and the size of the TVs increased. As you look at those sort of fundamental drivers over the next 10 years, has something structurally changed relative to area of demand growth? And as you look at that, I mean, how do you think about sizing the Display business over the next 10 years?",114

I think the drivers for the Display business that -- I don't know that I can talk about 10 years, but kind of 5 years, number one, is still build-out in emerging markets. TV -- flat panel TV penetration still has a long way to go. We've been disappointed with the demand in China. But I think that is coincident with kind of a slowdown of the economy there. So I think as maybe stimulus comes back there and the economy improves, we're going to see a significant build-out. Then there's the change in technology that we're seeing that -- moving to OLED, moving to metal oxide, these experience-oriented elements, we believe, are going to shorten the replacement time for TVs coming up, certainly over the next 5 years. And then the final element is we still believe that smart TV or potentially Apple TV, if it's a disruptive factor, can spur a replacement demand for TVs. So we still think there are elements out there in the market that are going to push demand even though today, flat-panel TV is the -- we've moved from the flat-panel TV build-out era, if you will, where every 1.5 years we change the size of the glass to now we're really looking at viewer experience, working with the customers on how to improve the technology to deliver that.",227

And then for my follow-up, not just Applied Materials but most of the semicon companies now are referring to the seasonality in the business or a seasonal decline on top of the macro issues. And the discussion around seasonality in semi equipment is something pretty new, I think, relative to the last 10 or 15 years. It used to be the customers just kind of had to order relatively far in advance. Is this -- is the discussion of a seasonality emerging in the equipment business a function of shorter lead times? Or is it a function of just business kind of what happened last year, so everybody kind of running the playbook back for this year? Or are there other dynamics at work?",125

But the primary driver of this seasonality is the introduction time of new models, so smartphones and tablets and the buying pattern of consumers. And then our customers are backing up from that when they need to have those parts in production to the dates they need equipment. And because those are pretty consistent, I think, among most of the process equipment companies, you can see these kind of seasonal peaks. And I would say that we've mapped this out. Actually, you can see it for 3 years, at least maybe you can see it for longer. But in the last 3 years, each year the peak has been getting higher in and around our Q2 time period. So that's kind of how we're looking at. It takes more than one factor here to produce this. But you're right, part of it is supply-chain compression.",159

Memory is really still largely tied to the success of PCs. So if we see more strength in the PC business next year, that could provide increase in capacity. But in flash, flash factories are under loaded today. I think we've seen cap -- investment pullback fairly significantly. We're kind of down to $1 billion a quarter in both DRAM and NAND investments per quarter. I don't -- I would not predict that we're going to see an early change in that vector. Maybe later in the year as we see more momentum. We would expect more mobile DRAM and some increase in bits per box on the mobile devices. But that's just not enough to provide greater than, let's say, 70% bit growth in NAND that we kind of need to see increased investment and greater than 50% -- 40% to 50% in DRAM to get that kind of investment growth.",153

And whether that divides out by Korea and Taiwan versus U.S., it may. But I think there is somewhat different. But the rest of the foundries can't make up the difference for the 2 biggest foundries major seasonality that we're seeing. On Varian, actually if you look inside our businesses, the products that are aimed in and around the transistor are doing better than those that are more mature processes. So I think that's kind of a general statement that we're to look where we have real strength even in the bottom of this cycle. So I think when you look at some of the CVDs, some of the metal depositions in and around the transistor where things are changing very, very rapidly, people have moved high-k, then to High-k/Metal Gate, metal gate last, and now to finFETs, we're going to be seeing rapid changes here. So customers have to invest in those areas that are really making the transistor. And of course that includes the implant, Mehdi, to your point.",204

I think if you adjust for Varian, you'd have to look back probably closer to Q4 '09 to see this kind of quarter. And I would say what you're seeing is hyper-seasonality this quarter where you've got not only kind of the typical pattern that we've been talking about. But you can see, if you look from the peak to the bottom, you've gone almost 11 -- we had about 33% of our SSG quarter was in our Q2. 14% of our full year will be in our Q4. So you've got a major delta between the high and the low. And I think that's really seasonality. In fact in the first half of the year, I mean there's a lot of observation about how we were outpacing the rest of the industry. So you're really seeing more timing and seasonality.

We've been quite disappointed that tablets and smartphones haven't accelerated the use of flash capacity. It's been -- really DRAM per box has been very, very modestly increasing. Right now, our estimates are that the NAND business is $26 billion, $27 billion. DRAM is $28 billion to $30 billion. So they're pretty close right now.

So I believe that's primarily it. There are some facility issues we know that have pushed out some of the equipment demand. I think the only thing that would slow down a recovery or a bounce back where they're putting on capacity, again getting ready for next year is a macroeconomic slowdown that's more pronounced than what we have today. We have to remember if we look back to the first part of -- first half of 2012, foundries were short of capacity. It has spurred a lot of talk about customer owned capacity and the like. I don't think that the foundries want to get into that situation again, if they can avoid it.

In our fourth quarter, Applied posted profits at the high end of our outlook, despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, solar and display.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Applied Materials team. Their focus and commitment resulted in the company delivering $8.7 billion of revenue and $0.75 of non-GAAP earnings per share for the year. Our strong cash flow performance allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend and share buybacks, returning $1.85 billion to shareholders.
Since completing the Varian acquisition, we have made excellent progress with integration. Exiting the year, we have realized over $50 million of run rate synergy savings, well ahead of our target. In addition, we have deployed key talent from the Varian management team to new roles in the company. In June, Gary Dickerson joined as our new president to bring renewed focus on our growth strategy. Gary is leading important changes that will strengthen our product development capabilities, and he will provide details in a few minutes.
2012 was a year characterized by significant fluctuations in seasonality and demand for semiconductor equipment, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar. We see improving business conditions entering 2013, with orders projected to increase after bottoming in the fourth quarter.
In semiconductor, the mobility trend remains the biggest influence on industry spending, with annual smartphone sales expected to surpass 700 million units and tablet sales to grow in excess of 100% year-on-year. Increased competition is fueling innovation throughout the supply chain, and we see demand for advanced application processors, driving the foundries to build out their 28-nanometer capacity and ramp investment for the 20-nanometer node. We expect healthy investment by foundry customers in 2013, albeit at a lower level than 2012.
Although growth in mobile is also driving demand for memory, the adoption of cloud-based storage means that we are seeing only a modest increase in the average bits per box. And consequently, NAND bit growth is projected to be in the 50% per year range.
Given the low level of NAND capacity investment, there is potential for increased spending in the second half of 2013. DRAM spending is expected to continue at low levels, and we anticipate total memory to remain approximately 25% to 30% of wafer fab equipment investment next year.
Soft macroeconomic conditions, combined with the timing of Windows 8, resulted in subdued back-to-school PC sales, and we expect negative PC growth for the calendar year. As a result, we are tempering our expectations for logic spending in 2013. However, the release of new touch-enabled ultrabooks can spur PC growth, providing a potential upside for both logic and DRAM investment.
We now believe wafer fab equipment spending will end the year in the $30 billion to $32 billion range. Based on our expectations of a pullback in logic and foundry spending and continued weakness in memory, we see 2013 wafer fab equipment investment down 5% to 15% or falling in a range of $26 billion to $30 billion. We foresee consumer buying patterns and customer concentration again driving seasonality in the demand profile.
In Q1, we expect wafer starts and utilization rates to trend lower for the second consecutive quarter, further impacting our service business revenue.
In Display, this was the weakest year for TV investment in the history of the LCD industry. Despite low revenue levels, our Display group executed well and remained profitable in every quarter. Supply and demand is coming back into balance, and equipment orders are picking up. We are seeing a significant increase in average TV sizes, up to 2 inches year-on-year, compared to a typical increase of 0.5 inch per year. In addition, there is strengthening demand in the emerging markets. Together, we believe these factors will support industry investments in a range of $8 billion to $10 billion next year and provide a catalyst to build out factories in China.
Mobility-related markets represented over 80% of our display revenue for the year, and we expect capacity investments for high-resolution mobile displays and touch panels to remain robust, as smartphones and tablet shipments grow and as these technologies migrate to ultrabook PCs.
In Solar, the industry is on track to install over 30 gigawatts in 2012, and we expect double-digit growth of the end market to continue. This demand growth is starting to consume excess manufacturing capacity within the supply chain. However, today, conditions for our customers are extremely challenging, and investment in new capacity remains very low. Until we see clearer signs that solar equipment demand is recovering, we will take additional steps to reduce our cost structure and associated losses.
Looking forward to 2013, we are optimistic about the potential of our markets. In all the industries we serve, we see accelerated changes in device technology and the adoption of new materials. This increasing complexity provides opportunities for Applied to build on our leadership and grow our market share.
We recently announced a restructuring plan that will free up significant resources to fund the product development needed to support our customers' roadmap and drive Applied's growth. Our strategic priorities for the year ahead are clear. We'll focus on growing our share of wafer fab equipment. We'll make prudent and targeted investments in Solar and Display, and we will continue to strengthen the organization in areas that are critical to our success.
Now let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our business segments and strategic priorities. Gary?",919
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4412.0,389925.0,18541733.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Mike. And I'd like to start by adding my thanks to our employees for their achievements in 2012. Since joining Applied, I've been very impressed with the talent, strong customer relationships and outstanding technology I've seen across the company. Together, these provide a tremendous foundation for growth. I believe we have a significant advantage in the depth and breadth of our expertise, and I'm delighted to be a part of this great team.
Over the past 4 months, I've been spending a large portion of my time with customers, and I'm excited by the opportunities they are sharing with us. In Semiconductor, Display and Solar, our customers are accelerating changes in device technology and new materials. As a result, there are increasing numbers of device performance and yield challenges that fall in our leadership areas of precision materials engineering, creating great growth opportunities for Applied Materials.
In order to drive growth and increase shareholder value, we are focused on 3 strategic priorities. Our #1 priority is to grow our share in wafer fab equipment. To support this objective, we will increase investment, focusing on 300-millimeter R&D and building a stronger technical team in the field.
In Display and Solar, we are investing to extend our leadership in enabling technologies. But as Mike said, until solar market conditions improve, we are implementing a significant reduction in our operating expenses to mitigate the impact of this business on our earnings.
We are also extending our planning horizon, and we'll make incremental investments in technical capabilities and R&D programs in current and new markets, where we see clear opportunities to leverage our precision materials engineering leadership and drive profitable growth.
To fund our strategic priorities, we have conducted a comprehensive review of spending across the company. As a result, we have been able to identify approximately $200 million that could be made available for growth programs. We have stopped programs where we don't believe we have valuable sustainable differentiation or cannot deliver a good return on investment, and we will continue to review our R&D portfolio and shift investment to our best opportunities.
In Solar, we will reduce our operating expenses, going significantly beyond our previously announced plans for this business. Additionally, we are restructuring our workforce through a voluntary retirement program, as well as reduction in force.
Beyond reprioritizing our investments, we are implementing changes to the organization and our business processes to upgrade our product development engine to make it more effective and more efficient. These changes will ensure that we develop products with an architectural advantage in device performance, yield and cost. They will also enable us to accelerate development of disruptive technology and time-to-market for new products.
Now let me briefly outline the opportunities for each of our businesses. In Semiconductor, the mobility trend is driving customers to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor. This translates to major inflections in lower leakage transistors, low-resistance interconnects, advanced patterning, wafer-level packaging and 3D NAND flash technology. These inflections create spending shifts that are favorable to Applied, as well as high-value device performance and yield challenges that we can address with our technology.
As foundries transition to 20 nanometer, they will fully adopt high-k gate-last transistor technology. This moves right into the sweet spot of Applied's leadership areas, and we expect a greater-than-30% increase in our available market.
2013 is a critical positioning year for 20 nanometer, with many process tool of record decisions being made that will impact our future market share. Our organization is focused on winning these decisions, and we anticipate strong growth for our PVD, epitaxy, implants and inspection products.
As a result of rising capital intensity in the transistor area, our Front End Products Group, which includes our epitaxy products, posted record revenue in 2012. We expect continued strength in this business as new Epi steps are added to foundry device flows. The move to gate-last transistors also supported the strongest year in a decade for our PVD business. Strength we believe will continue, as customers add new PVD steps to their 20-nanometer processes.
Looking ahead to technology changes that will happen in the next 12 to 24 months, we are focusing our investments on key inflections, including 3D finFET, 3D NAND and extending the interconnect roadmap beyond 20 nanometers. These inflections expand our market and provide opportunities for share gains. For example, 3D NAND structures require multiple film deposition steps, which leverages our advantage in depositing very thin film with precise control.
In addition, we expect strong growth in selective material deposition and removal. Beyond our core leadership areas, our Inspection and Etch businesses provide opportunities for growth. The inspection market includes many segments, some where we are strong such as defect review and others where progress has been more difficult.
We have been adding technical and marketing talent to our team and have substantial customer pull for our Inspection products, including our latest generation Brightfield tool. We have recently penetrated new applications in advanced logic, foundry and memory, and these positions provide a platform for us to grow share in the inspection market.
Etch is a large multi-segment market, and our actions have been to build a stronger team and product development in the field. We are focusing this team and our investments in areas where we believe we have differentiated solutions, which are primarily in conductor etch. The customer penetrations we're making in patterning, NAND flash and packaging applications provide a good opportunity for us to grow our share in etch.
Turning now to Display. The transition to new technologies, specifically metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for organic LED and high-resolution LCD, is challenging for our customers. To address these inflections, we recently introduced a new PVD tool that enables the formation of higher-stability metal oxide transistors and a suite of CVD tools that address customers' requirements for advanced film. We expect the next generation of factories for high-definition televisions and mobile displays to ramp with technologies that increase Applied's market for our CVD and PVD products by at least 30%.
In Solar, we remain confident in this market as an attractive long-term growth driver for the company. Our current product portfolio, as well as new technology and development is focused on enabling higher cell efficiency and driving much lower cost per watt. With this portfolio, we believe we can capture approximately $100 million of revenue for each gigawatt of new capacity the industry adds. The combination of our strong field team and product leadership puts us in a great position when customer investment resumes. However, as long as the current market conditions exist, we will significantly scale back our investment in this business.
In summary, as we refine our plans in the year ahead, our direction is clear. We will implement the organizational and portfolio changes required to fully fund our largest growth opportunities. We will expand our planning horizon to make sure we win future technology inflections, and we will focus on converting our development tool of record positions at the 20-nanometer technology node into volume orders.
Let me now hand the call over to George for further details on our performance and outlook. George?",1202
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4412.0,389925.0,18541734.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Gary, and welcome to everyone on the call today. In our fourth fiscal quarter, Applied delivered revenue of $1.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06, the upper end of our outlook.
Fourth quarter GAAP results included the charges of $124 million related to our workforce actions and a $421 million impairment of EES goodwill. These actions, coupled with $0.06 of acquisition-related charges, resulted in a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share. Full year GAAP earnings were $0.09 per share, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.75.
Orders in the fourth quarter declined 19% from the prior quarter to $1.5 billion, reflecting lower semiconductor equipment demand, partially offset by modest order increases in our other segments.
Net sales decreased 30% to $1.6 billion, led by a greater-than-40% reduction in semiconductor equipment sales.
Non-GAAP gross margin declined to 38.4%, primarily due to lower volumes, inventory reserves and lower factory absorption.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $518 million, below our $545 million target, primarily due to accrual adjustments for variable compensation and other employee-related costs.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $525 million to $545 million.
During the quarter, we took a number of actions across the company to enable increased funding for our critical priorities. These actions include further reductions in solar spending, the workforce restructuring, varying synergies and the reprioritization of existing spending. In total, we expect these actions will make available approximately $200 million in 2013 for critical programs and new capabilities that support our highest ROI opportunities. Our focus is on funding to grow share and expand our markets.
I will now cover the expected financial impact of the voluntary retirement program and reduction in force actions announced in the quarter. When fully completed, these actions will make available more than $140 million annually for new investments. The total cost for this program is expected to be between $180 million and $230 million. We incurred a charge of $106 million in the quarter for the program and expect the majority of the remaining GAAP charges to be incurred primarily in the first half of 2013.
The impairment of EES goodwill recognized in the fourth quarter reflects the deterioration of the solar equipment market and our customers' financial condition, coupled with lower market valuations. These factors led the company to reassess the recoverability of EES goodwill.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 26.2%. We expect our fiscal 2013 rate to be in line with 2012 and within a range of 25% to 27%. Cash from operations was $411 million, reflecting our continued focus on working capital and the impact of lower revenue. Share buybacks in the fourth quarter amounted to $516 million or 3.6% of the shares outstanding, and we paid dividends of $111 million or $0.09 per share.
For the fiscal year, we repurchased 126 million shares or just under 10% of shares outstanding at an average price of $11.22 and paid dividends of $434 million.
Given the cash requirements for severance and variable compensation programs in Q1, we expect our share repurchase for that quarter to be at a reduced level.
Cash and investments ended the quarter and our fiscal year at $3 billion. We are entering 2013 in a strong position, following a year in which we completed the $4.2 billion Varian acquisition and returned $1.85 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchase.
Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 36% to $741 million, driven primarily by a lower foundry and NAND bookings, partially offset by logic. Net sales decreased 44% to $870 million, in line with our outlook, with declines across foundry, memory and logic customers. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin was 10.9%.
In AGS, orders were up 8% to $576 million, reflecting the seasonal effect of annual contract renewals. AGS net sales were up 7% to $621 million. This result includes $85 million for a thin-film solar line. Excluding this item, revenue would have been down 7% on lower wafer starts and utilization rates in semiconductor factories. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5%.
In Display, orders increased modestly to $83 million. Net sales for Display were $93 million, with mobility investments again accounting for the majority of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.3%, as the segment remained profitable despite the low levels of revenue in the quarter.
In EES, orders increased to $65 million, led by orders for our WEB Coating tools with solar equipment orders remaining at depressed levels due to ongoing overcapacity issues and cash [ph] conservation by our customers. Net sales were approximately $62 million, at the mid-point of our outlook. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $46 million. We expect losses to narrow throughout the fiscal year, as we reduce the combined OpEx run rate for the solar and WEB businesses to below $30 million per quarter by the second half of fiscal 2013. This new OpEx level reflects a nearly 50% reduction from where we started in 2012, while absorbing the solar implant spend, which had remained at SSG for the first year of integration, but now will be reported in EES.
Next, I'll turn to our outlook for Q1. Net sales from our Semiconductor business should be in the range of flat to up 10%. We expect orders to be up more than 25%, as customers prepare to increase capacity.
Net sales in AGS are expected to be down 15% to 25%, reflecting the absence of the thin-film solar revenue of $85 million we received in fiscal Q4 and the effects of lower factory utilization.
Excluding the thin-film solar revenue, net sales would be down 5% to 15%. We expect net sales in Display to be flat to down 30% off a low base. We are seeing the beginning of the order ramp to support LCD capacity additions in China, with display orders expected to exceed $150 million in our Q1.
Net sales in EES are expected to be down greater than 30%, again, off a very low base. Overall, we expect net sales for the company to be flat to down 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 0 to $0.06 per share.

Gary, you talked about share gains as your #1 priority, and you also had a chance to do a strategic review. The question is, are you at a point where you think you have done a strategic view of the entire silicon business and the other businesses? And are you willing to share what your maybe near- to mid-term share gain goals are in etch and inspection?",71

Let me just give an overview. As we talked about earlier, we've made significant reductions in OpEx to focus on growing our share in wafer fab equipment. And as I said earlier, this is the #1 focus for the company. If you look at what is going to happen over the next 2 years that will have a big impact on our performance, it's really the 20-nanometer transition. And this transition is really focused on the transistor, low leakage, low power, high performance. And this is in the sweet spot of our leadership in transistor equipment technology. As I said earlier, we anticipate in this transition, significant growth in Epi, PVD, implant and inspection in this 20-nanometer transition. The transition creates a great opportunity for us to grow our available market and increase share. We also -- there are also a number of other device technology inflections that are good for Applied, and this is where the majority of our spending is being focused. Within SSG, we've shifted a large amount of R&D dollars to focus on areas with the best returns, some of those we talked about earlier in the call. So I would say, again, overall, I'm optimistic -- very optimistic with the major transition that will impact our business being right in the sweet spot of our leadership position. And overall, I think we have a great opportunity to grow share. I don't -- we're not going to give specific market share goals in all of the different segments. But I do believe, based on customer pull and penetrations that we're making, that we have a good opportunity to grow share in those businesses.",278

Mike, a question on the 2013 WFE. You had previously said you expect a similar seasonality at 2012 into 2013. So should we expect a much stronger first half '13 as we come out of the second half '12?",44

When we look at wafer fab equipment spending for all of '13, it's a little bit hard to tell right now what the second half will look like. I really think the big part of that is how the macro environment plays out, economic environment plays out and, more specifically, how well PCs do in that environment because that could stoke spending, both in logic and DRAM for the second half. The first half, we will see logic increase, as I mentioned, but we'll also see the foundry spending profile. And as I said, that for us is second quarter and third quarter of our fiscal year. So that kind of plays in -- cuts across first half and second half calendar year, but generally stronger in the first half. Overall, I would say, as we look at the total WFE, we think it will be weaker next year based on lower foundry and logic spending.",158

I think, actually, we would say, from our projection -- our original projection last quarter was that we thought WFE for 2013 was going to be a little bit stronger, especially in logic. I think we've lowered our expectations on growth in logic spending. I think our expectations on foundry are pretty much where they were. We thought that it would be down off a high peak in 2012. Now the -- if we look at our seasonality picture that we've seen now for 2 years in a row, we start to see orders grow for SSG products in Q1. We believe that's what we're seeing today. It is not -- we don't believe it will be as accentuated as it was last year with such a high peak in Q2 and dropping in Q3. A little hard to tell right now, but maybe a little more muted trend than we saw last year.",155

That's helpful. And then, if I could ask a follow-up. Gary, thank you very much for the color. I guess a question in terms of magnitude of share gain and timing wise -- and I get you don't want to put numbers around that. But I'm just curious, when you think about the inflection at the transistor level at 20-nanometer and how AMAT is really at the sweet spot there, plus new investments in hiring as well as investments in field services, what will drive the most share gain near term? And then, how do you think about the layer in of other share gain from those other levers as you invest in the business?",116

Again, the 20-nanometer is really the major focus over the next couple of years. It will -- some 20-nanometer investment will hit towards the end of 2013, the majority in 2014. And as I said, it's really focused on the transistor, and this is where we have clear leadership in a number of different enabling products. So we've seen record performance in Epi, best performance in PVD in a decade. Certainly, there are more steps that are being added in this 20 -- the full adoption of high-k gate-last 20-nanometer processes that will fuel significant growth in those businesses. Implants and inspection, also, we have a really good position in 20-nanometer based on our DTOR positions with customers. So that's really the major focus for us and the major opportunity for us. And as I said, it's a more than 30% increase in our available market and really right in the leadership areas that we have as a company. So we look at this as being one of the best transitions that's happened for Applied Materials in many, many, many years.",182

And we can add about $100 million per gigawatt of new capacity, given a reasonable market. This can be a good business for Applied Materials. We have a strong position in technology to enable higher cell efficiency, enabling lower cost per lot, and a real advantage in products that are important to making this happen. The spending reductions -- there's always a balance in these types of situations. We clearly understand that we need to reduce the drag on earnings, impact on the company overall.

You guys seem to be seeing the market a little more clearly than some of your competitors. At SEMICON, when you guys kind of had a -- announced a more dour market outlook, a lot of people said, ""That's just AMAT losing share."" And then, lo and behold, over the next 2 quarters, they were all missing numbers and guiding down to where you guys already were. Now your competitors are insisting on a flat to up market next year, and you guys are calling it, I think, more consistent with what the customers are saying, which is down 10% or so.

We really do take this item seriously because we have to plan our business around where we believe wafer fab equipment spending is going to end up. And I think that's the primary aspect. But I think, overall, our planning team has a good approach to figure out really what the puts and takes are on figuring out what's driving the market as well. When you think you have negative PC growth, I think, there's an aspect to the logic spending that we have to take into consideration and how much impact that then has in particular on DRAM spending.

I think maybe I can be helpful if I look at the top end of the range and the bottom end of the range. On the top end of the range, we would have to see a return of strength in PCs, a big -- pretty big uptake in ultrabooks. I think that's possible. There's some compelling models out there. That would drive increase in logic and DRAM spending. And then we would expect 3D NAND to come in a little stronger probably than we're projecting right now, as that technology gets ready for production. On the downside, I would say, first of all, on the downside, we would have to expect that the overall world economy is not good and not as maybe as good as it is today. And then continued slide in PC sales, which we're not expecting in our current model. I think that would be the big aspects. And then when you look at the segments inside of spending, we think foundry and logic spending are going to be down modestly next year, kind of in that 10% range. And then memory spending is pretty much going to be flattish at a low level of 25% to 30% of overall wafer fab equipment spending. With some bias, that NAND spending could go up later in the year, but I think it's too early to call that.",232

And then I had a quick question on the OpEx maybe throughout -- this next fiscal year. Obviously, you're reducing some expenses in what you consider some noncritical areas. But in the end, when you think about the restructuring of the EES division and some of these cuts, I mean, should we assume that you're just simply going add OpEx cost back for areas of growth?

I think Gary laid out pretty clearly also the opportunities that we see to gain market share over the next 12 to 18 months. And we want to make sure that funding is not the issue there. So we are taking significant actions. We do think, as we said, that it frees up $200 million of investable funds relative to what we saw in 2012.

I'm just wondering your forecasting, if it's more top-down driven or more your visibility from the customer. Because what surprises me is that last year, when the NAND was in oversupply and the prices were declining 20% quarter-over-quarter, most of the companies were pretty bullish on NAND spending. And now, we have prices stabilizing to going up. And I hear a very, very muted outlook. So I'm just wondering what am I missing? Why the outlook this way?",83

And to really get a need for increased wafer capacity, we believe you have to get that bit growth above 70%. So that's the reason that we do see that supply and demand is coming. Customers have taken actions to get supply and demand into much, much better balance in flash memory. But our thinking is that they're going to be able to achieve a 50% bit growth through technology improvements, moving to the next generation of technology as opposed to building new factories and facilitizing those factories and adding wafer starts. We'd love to see solid-state drives really take off next year. That could happen with ultrabooks. And that would certainly drive that bit growth above 70% and then require more investment there. But that's kind of our rationale that, I think, is consistent with the view.

We see 3D NAND really as a great opportunity for us. On this multilevel, stack type of process, there are many very precise film deposition steps where we have leadership and some additional high aspect ratio etching also, where we've had good customer pull, additional CMP steps. So overall, the 3D NAND we see as an opportunity that can grow our available market more than 25%. So we look at this as really, really a great opportunity.

And this is, as I said, really all about the transistor, low leakage, low power, high performance and really in a sweet spot of where we have leadership in transistor equipment technology. So we see ourselves as being very well-positioned. The pull from customers is very, very strong, since we have a lot of the enabling technology for that transition. And we're in a good position.

As you know, the last couple of years, that our business has been sustained primarily by mobile investments. And the thing is that's happening now for us is that there's a lot of technology change happening. So that as we look to this next phase of investment, our TAM should be about 30% higher than it was in the previous investment cycle, as customers go for metal oxide transistors on the backplane, or they're going to go for LTPS with organic LED displays.

This is the -- well, we're not making a full year revenue projection at this time because our visibility in the second half isn't what we would like it at this time. We do see that we are in, again, the seasonal pattern that we've seen the last few years. We're still in a market where solar is depressed and wafer starts and utilization are not good in semiconductor factories. So we'll see a dip in service in this first quarter.

And you're right, we're starting with a very low absolute level of backlog in SSG. One of the things to remember that is different in the foundry-LED world, the turns business that we see in SSG is -- has grown over time. So you can have a quarter where 70% of your orders were booked and shipped within the existing quarter. So I think we really have to see to what extent foundry spends this year relative to last year. The heavier the foundry spending, obviously, the more rapidly you'll see a closing between growth and the backlog.

And so the spending that you're seeing there is really for our core leadership positions in a very select set of technologies that we think are going to be the most leveraging to our customers' technology roadmaps going forward.

Or whether that's something you have to go out and acquire? Because you've typically worked with the materials suppliers. But it sounds like you think you want to sort of own that expertise a little more.",94

So again, 20-nanometer, FinFET, is all about the transistor. And the 3D memory is also a number of new materials where we have leadership. So I think -- and this is over the next several years. If you look at what technologies people will be introducing beyond the next several years, I think this trend towards materials being critical to enable the device performance and customer differentiation is going to increase and create a great opportunity for us. And I'd say it's not just in the semiconductor business, as Mike talked about, and I had in the script earlier in Display, we're seeing an increase in the materials that we will deliver in the Display industry and increase our available market by more than 30%. So I think this trend is one that hasn't happened to Applied in many, many years and creates a great opportunity for us going forward.",179
