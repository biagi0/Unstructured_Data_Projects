This is an unprecedented period for Applied Materials and the semiconductor industry. Demand for semiconductors has never been stronger or broader, and the supply chain's ability to fulfill this growing demand is constrained in the near term.  
While the supply environment remains challenging, we landed our first fiscal quarter of 2022 towards the high end of our guidance range and delivered our highest-ever quarterly revenues. These results are a testament to the capabilities and commitment of our global team who are executing well and focused on doing everything possible to deliver for our customers.  
The industry clearly has a long way to go before supply catches up with demand. Applied's orders for the quarter were an all-time high, beating our previous record by $0.5 billion. To ensure our own manufacturing capacity is not a limiting factor, we've made and continue to make strategic investments in our global infrastructure. This includes our state-of-the-art logistics service center in Austin, Texas that we're bringing online this month.  
Like many in the industry, the biggest challenge we face today is the availability of certain silicon components that go into subsystems within our products. We are working closely with our suppliers to find solutions and eliminate bottlenecks. I would like to thank them for their partnership as we collaborate in new ways to overcome near-term headwinds and build a stronger supply chain that better supports the future needs of the industry.  
In today's call, I'll talk about our demand outlook, which is very strong and strengthening. I'll provide our longer-term perspective on the secular trends reshaping the semiconductor industry. And I'll give you some updates on the progress we're making against our strategic goals and how we're positioned to outperform our markets over the coming years. Later in the call, Bob will share his perspective on the state of the industry and our financial outlook.  
Let me start with market demand. It's clear that wafer fab equipment spending in 2021 was limited by supply, with some unmet demand pushing into 2022. If we look at our Semiconductor Systems revenues from the second quarter of 2021 to the end of Q1 2022 and compare to the prior 12-month period, they were up 43% year-on-year. We think this is a good approximation for industry growth in calendar 2021, which would put WFE in the mid-$80 billion range.  
Demand is very strong and continues to grow. We believe wafer fab equipment spending could reach $100 billion in 2022. And since we are already close to being sold out for the year, we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023.  
Within WFE, foundry/logic spending grew faster than memory in 2021, and we see it growing faster than memory again in 2022. We believe foundry/logic made up more than 60% of total WFE investments last year and will remain at these levels or increase as a percentage of the mix over the next several years.  
Innovation at the edge and in the cloud means that foundry/logic demand is broad-based and split relatively evenly between the most advanced nodes and ICAPS customers who serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensors markets.  
It's also important to put this near-term demand outlook in the context of the secular trends, driving longer-term growth and structural changes in the industry. While digital transformation is already reshaping the global economy today, it will take decades to fully play out around the world, and that the foundation of this multitrillion-dollar inflection is advanced silicon. Today, 9 of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world either design or build chips. Eight of the 9 are now designing their own customized silicon in-house, and the other one manufactures a large percentage of the world's chips by value. I think this is a great example of the fundamental role silicon plays in driving the system-level power, performance and cost improvements that will unlock the full potential of digital transformation and the metaverse.  
Back in 2018, we introduced our framework for describing the semiconductor industry's future technology road map. We call this the new PPACt playbook and said it had 5 key elements: new chip architectures like workload-specific ASICs; new 3D structures like gate-all-around transistors, backside power distribution, next-generation 3D NAND and 3D DRAM; new materials in gate, contact and interconnect; new ways to shrink from EUV lithography to advanced patterning; and advanced packaging from 2.5D silicon interposers to 3D chiplets and hybrid bonding.  
As the major technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook take shape, it's clear this future road map is more multifaceted and complex than anything the industry has done before. This increasing complexity has positive implications for Applied Materials. First, we expect capital intensity to remain at the levels we have seen over recent years; and second, Applied's broad capabilities are more valuable because they allow us to address higher order problems for customers and provide them with more complete solutions.  
On top of the opportunities created by the PPACt playbook, major supply chain inflections are underway that are also positive for industry economics. This starts with a shift from just-in-time to a just-in-case philosophy. The most visible example of this is the automotive industry where the major carmakers are quantifying the cost of lost business in 2021 and rapidly changing the way they work with suppliers of their most critical components.  
We're also working differently with our customers. They are providing us with longer-term visibility, and we are collaborating more closely on capacity planning.  
In addition, the strategic and economic importance of semiconductors is being recognized at a national level. In the coming years, government support and incentives in the U.S., Europe and Japan will translate into regionalization of supply. As I've highlighted before, these regional supply chains will be more resilient but also less capital-efficient, which is an additional tailwind for us. 
Overall, our outlook for the next decade is very positive. We expect semiconductor and wafer fab equipment to grow significantly faster than the economy with outsized opportunities for Applied Materials.  
To be ready for this exciting future, we've aligned our organization and investments around 3 strategic pillars. First, to be the PPACt enablement company and provide the foundation for customers' road maps for power, performance, area, cost and time to market; second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions; and third, to generate incremental free cash flows and profitability from our businesses in adjacent markets.  
Earlier, I talked about key technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook: gate-all-around, backside power distribution, 3D NAND, 3D DRAM, new materials in the gate, contact and interconnect and advanced packaging. All of these inflections are primarily enabled by materials engineering, Applied's core strength. And as a result, they grow our total available market. Thanks to our relentless focus on developing differentiated technology, to enable these inflections, we are also in a great position to capture more of that growing TAM.  
For example, in the transition from FinFET to first-generation gate-all-around, our transistor TAM grows by more than $1 billion per 100,000 wafer starts per month. And based on our tool of record positions, we expect to capture the majority of the inflection. We will provide more details about these inflections and how we expect them to play out in our 2022 master classes.  
While current supply constraints mean that we can't fully realize the strength in our business, we are executing very well against our product road map, and there are clear leading indicators of our future growth potential. I'll highlight a few recent examples. In etch, we've recently won multiple tool of record positions at advanced nodes and foundry/logic across all 3 leading-edge customers. This is significant because these wins are in areas we haven't served in the past and demonstrate how our next generation of etch solutions address customers' most challenging applications.  
In inspection and metrology where we have fewer supply chain constraints, our trailing 12-month revenues were up 68% year-on-year, and our e-beam revenues nearly doubled in that period. We expect to outperform the market again in 2022 with especially strong growth in optical wafer inspection, combined with further extension of our e-beam leadership.  
Beyond unit process excellence, Applied is able to combine the industry's broadest technology portfolio and unique ways to create co-optimized and fully integrated solutions. For example, co-optimization of hard mask, deposition and etch is an enabling solution for high aspect ratio structures. Adoption of our co-optimized Draco solution is accelerating and on track to generate an incremental $600 million of revenue this year. And we recently secured our first wins with a new carbon hard mask, deposition and etch solution at a leading memory manufacturer.  
Another key component of our technology portfolio is our digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer and ramp, and optimize productivity in high-volume manufacturing. We are engaged with a broad range of customers. In this quarter, we secured a new strategic penetration for R&D acceleration using our AI(x), Actionable Insight Accelerator platform, at a leading customer. As part of this engagement, we will use our unique sensor technology and proprietary machine learning algorithms for rapid process window tuning and process variability reduction.  
We're also making progress on our multiyear journey to increase subscription revenues. Within AGS, more than 60% of our parts and service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. The average tenure of these agreements is now 2.3 years, up from 1.9 years 12 months ago, and the renewal rate is over 90%. In addition, when we look at our combined software business in AGS and semi systems, which are also subscription-based, we expect them to generate more than $300 million of revenue this year.  
Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied and our global teams are executing well in a challenging and dynamic environment, and our near-term focus is on doing everything we can to expedite deliveries to our customers. Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains strong and continues to grow. There's still a long way to go before supply catches up with demand.  Our outlook for 2022 and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher.  
In addition, the major technology inflections that make up the industry's PPACt road map expand Applied's addressable market opportunities, and our broad and differentiated technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets in years to come.  
With that, Bob, it's over to you.",1755

I'd like to begin by thanking our teams and our partners for doing everything they could in a challenging supply chain environment. We still have a lot of work to do to satisfy our customers' needs, and this is job 1 for all of us.  
I have 3 main messages for you today. One, demand for Applied's products is very strong and continues to grow. Two, we remain supply chain limited, and we forecast gradual improvement over the course of the year. Three, we expect to grow our revenue and earnings each quarter through the end of the calendar year. And we believe it is increasingly likely that 2023 will be another growth year.  
Next, I'll summarize our Q1 results. Then I'll provide details about the demand environment for Applied Materials. And finally, I'll share our guidance for fiscal Q2 and the rate of growth we expect to see throughout the year.  
In Q1, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. The supply chain environment was challenging. Our teams collaborate broadly with partners upstream and downstream of Applied to maximize the supply of components to our manufacturing sites and service locations. This work enabled us to deliver record semiconductor systems revenue, which we grew by 29% year-over-year.  
We grew fastest in foundry/logic year-over-year, and we continue to expect foundry/logic to outgrow WFE in 2022 with strength in both leading edge and ICAPS. From a product perspective in Q1, we generated record quarterly revenue in process control, CVD and CMP, and we achieved our highest-ever DRAM revenue. We also grew non-GAAP operating margin in semi by 280 basis points year-over-year. In AGS, we grew revenue by 14% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 110 basis points. About 3/4 of the AGS' year-over-year growth was in recurring revenue. Our AGS service revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year. We increased our tools under comprehensive service agreement by 13% year-over-year, and our subscription renewal rate was 92%.  
Our parts business met our expectations but could have been even higher. AGS includes our legacy 200-millimeter equipment revenue, which was below our expectations in Q1 due to supply chain constraints that prevented us from shipping to demand within the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect AGS to grow in the low double digits, with potential upside depending on the supply chain recovery.  In display, we exceeded our revenue goal in Q1 and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 280 basis points year-over-year.  
Summarizing Applied's Q1 results on a year-over-year basis. We increased revenue by 21%, non-GAAP gross margin by 140 basis points, non-GAAP operating profit by 270 basis points and non-GAAP EPS by 36%. In addition, we generated record free cash flow and distributed over $2 billion to shareholders, with $1.8 billion in repurchases and $214 million in dividends.  
Next, I'll address the impact of the supply environment on our business in the near term. Underlying demand for Applied's technology is very strong and growing. And we believe that as we work through the supply chain constraints, we will demonstrate the progress we're making toward our market share and gross margin targets.  
Although we don't usually report backlog on a quarterly basis, I'm going to give some further color on today's call to help you understand our confidence. In Q1, our semi systems backlog increased by more than $1.3 billion to a record $8 billion. Moreover, the backlog includes a rich mix of products that are highly enabling to our customers' road maps. What this tells us is that in an unconstrained environment, we would have produced substantially higher revenue and demonstrated a healthy share gain in calendar 2021.  
Also, absent the supply chain issues, our gross margin in fiscal 2022 will be very close to the targets in our 2024 financial model. We are laser-focused on improving the supply chain, which will enable us to support our customers and demonstrate the strength of our business.  
As Gary outlined, we expect the WFE market to grow by over 15% in 2022 to $100 billion or more. Even with the constraints, we expect to outgrow the market in our semi business and carry sizable backlog into 2023.  
Now I'll share our guidance for Q2. We expect to increase revenue to $6.35 billion, plus or minus $300 million, which is up almost 14% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS in Q2 to be around $1.90, plus or minus $0.15, which is up around 17% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue of around $4.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year; AGS revenue of around $1.35 billion, up 12% year-over-year; and display revenue of around $380 million.  
Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47% in Q2 as we absorb near-term cost pressures primarily related to expediting shipments to our customers. After Q2, we expect to gradually increase the gross margin by mitigating cost pressures and shipping a richer mix of high-margin products.  Non-GAAP OpEx should be around $1.015 billion in Q2, and our non-GAAP tax rate should be around 12%.  
Looking ahead, we expect we can grow revenues by increasing mid-single-digit percentages each quarter through the end of the calendar year. And based on customer conversations about semiconductor demand and technology inflections, we're increasingly optimistic that 2023 will be another growth year for the industry and especially for Applied.

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760607.0,Question,Christopher Muse,,Analysts,6,"I guess a question on gross margins, particularly in the current challenging supply environment. You guided at 47% and expectation is for that to grow through the year. Can you speak to what it'll take you to build out greater scale upstream for your key suppliers? What impact that might have on input cost for you and then your ability to pass those down to your customers? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to that 48.5% as part of the target model? And I guess as part of that, if you could frame what your expectations are, when you might be able to hit that type of number?",112
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760608.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,7,"Let me take those 6 questions, C.J. So first, what's going on with gross margins? What's the outlook? And what can we do? So what's going on with gross margins? As you know, in Q4 of 2021, we did [ 48.2% ]. The long-term model in 2024, I guess, it is, is 48.5% at $87 billion, 48.8% at $100 billion. We were down 47.3% this quarter. We guide around 47%. We go up half a point [ the other year ]. There are 2 things that are hitting us. One is cost increases from logistics, inefficient factory ops -- operations like overhead and [ burn ] absorption, and thirdly, some material cost issues. I'd price those in at 1% to 1.5% on gross margin impact, probably about 1.2% is the middle point. I would say that most of those are transitory, factory absorption, logistics and a bunch of the material cost stuff should get better. So I'd say, over 2/3 of that is kind of transitory.  
The second one is mix. We have a couple of [indiscernible]. We have very, very strong orders and backlog, particularly in semi. So if we had a higher mix of semi versus non-semi, we help our gross margins. Secondly, if you had a better -- if you look -- we priced out the mix of our semi backlog. So our mix in the semi backlog is very attractive. So if you look at those 2 mix things and you normalize by past backlog levels, well, we could ship. You pick again another 1 to 1.5 points of gross margins. And again, the sweet spot is kind of 1.2. So if you're at [ $80 billion, 47% ] next quarter, if you could get 1 point to 1.2, you're pretty much on model. You might be above it a little bit actually. So that's the scale of what we're looking at. So we're pretty confident we're on the model trajectory of 48.5% at $87 billion and 48.8% at $100 billion WFE.  
Secondly, the cost increases, can we do anything to mitigate that and pass it along? With customers, our 3 primary issues are: one, we have to do better on deliveries. Job 1 for us is to ship more tools, get them out the door on time to customers. And that's our commitment to customers. Secondly, for a long time, we have created really valuable tools and shared that value with our customers and ourselves. And I think we've done a good job on both sides. Now that we have these unusual cost pressures, I think it's fair to have that discussion with customers. But job 1 and job 2 is to get our product shipping in volume on time and also to create value for customers. But I think we can have that type of conversation.",472

And I guess along those lines, like what gives you confidence? Is that just your visibility on how the supply constraints themselves are easing? Like are you shipping, for example, like partially done tools? Or you just have to supply like a final module or something to make it work? Like what gives you the confidence that the supply constraints will actually ease along that trajectory?",68

We -- they were up kind of mid- to high single digits. And if you look at that type of increase in Q2, we think that's similar. But I think we'll have a better match of the parts.  
If you remember what we said last quarter was there's a lot of stuff we're tracking, but the hotspot is kind of some semi device-type things that are supplied through the distribution channel to our customers. So we think it's a fair estimate of what we could do. It's not internal capacity constraints. It's more some parts in the supply chain, but I think it's a reasonable estimate.",134

Thanks, Stacy. And then those numbers are right for semi systems. We would say that AGS year-over-year, AGS tends to grow a little bit slower than semi systems. So it's probably just up low double digits. And then display, you already have our view that it's probably up a little bit year-over-year, also depending on the supply chain, but that'll help you with the [ 5 7 ], 9% for semi, and that gives you the shape of the rest of the revenue.",84

I guess Gary and Bob, the bookings number and the backlog number in the Jan quarter were extremely impressive, but the cynic in me would argue that when your customers can't get what they want, they always order more than they need. And so from your perspective, how do you safeguard against the fact that you and all of your peers are having supply constraints right now? And if I'm your customer, I at the very least better get in line or I might not get what I need to kind of grow supply. How do you kind of safeguard against the dreaded double ordering?",110
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760619.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,18,"Well, I'll give you my perspective, and Gary talks to customers a lot, I think he has. So I think, one, if you look at the magnitude of the orders and how much they're growing, it's a pretty big number. So we're not going to be overbuilding inventory or anything. The second thing is if you look at the mix, I think that's what it's doing.  
So if you go look at memory -- so I'll give you some data, John. So if you go look at the history of the industry the last 15 years, 20 years, some of the leading indicators of when you overbuild is particularly strong memory is 3 years of a strong memory year: '07, '17 and '18, we're all over 50% in memory. So if you look at it right now, memory was 40% of WFE in 2021 and going down several points in '22. So we look at memory as moderate growth and we don't see double bookings there.  
Second thing is a leading indicator of whether they're overbooking in the short term, we look at wafer starts and we look at fab utilization. So I said last quarter, fab utilization was at a record at our fiscal Q4. In fact, in Q1, fab utilization is slightly higher, so very high.  
Thirdly, if you look at wafer starts over the last several years, wafer starts from '16 to '21 in memory, DRAM and NAND were both 19%. That's not a compound rate of growth, that's a total growth from '16 to '21. If you look at 200-millimeter, it's 17%. If you look at where the growth was, it was kind of 300-millimeter stuff, 100% from '16 to '21 in logic and foundry, right, logic/foundry. So now you go, well, so gee-whiz, let's look at logic/foundry. 
So if you look at TSMC has put long-term spending out -- forecast of $100 billion kind of CapEx, $40 billion, $42 billion in CapEx next -- this year. And we've talked closely to them. I mean they're pretty committed to spend. If you look at Intel, pretty committed to spending and announcing new fabs. We're tracking fabs. Last quarter, we stated a number of 59 shells with $300 billion of -- $335 billion -- $300 billion to $335 billion. That number is up to 68, $365 billion to $385 billion. So if you look at shell counts, you look at growth in starts, you look at fab utilization, and you look at what the foundry/logic guys are committing to, who are a little more predictable and you look at memory mix, it's pretty good. Then you look at ICAPS mix versus trailing edge, right? Because ICAPS historically wasn't too big.  
Now ICAPS we define as 10-millimeter above, right? So if you look at that, it used to be pretty moderate because the business model for customers was to roll over tools from leading edge to the trailing edge, and that was enough tools to do trailing edge. But if you look at trailing edge demand, it's through the roof. If you look at the WFE by application base from '21 forward to '26, some of the biggest growth areas are, if you look at its data center, the accelerators, but it's also automobile, IoT, comms and some stuff in phones, particularly sensors. So there's big demand on this ICAPS sensor stuff. So if you look at it, the demand is there. And the funding of that through tools is not there because you don't have enough rolling over from the leading edge because the demand is going up on the trailing edge, right?  
So then you look at it and say, well, what is the actual demand? So we said 53% in '21 and '22 for ICAPS. Well, if you drill into 20-nanometer and above, so -- or 10, 14, 16 and look at some of the older stuff, particularly 28, it's gone up as a percentage of WFE from 31% in '20 to 43% in '21 and 44% in '22. So because of 2 factors, demand going up and less tools to roll over to those. So somebody might say, well, gee-whiz, that's overheated. Well, if you look at the rate of increase is declining, right? It went 31%, 43%, 44%. So it's strong, but the rate of increase is declining. So the very long answer, but I gave you data, is I don't think we're overheated right now. We have lots of orders. The mix is the type of mix, it's not crazy mix. Now you can drill into ICAPS in China a little bit. But I think we're pretty good this year and probably next year.",782

The semi industry has been constrained for a while, but you and your equipment peers have been experiencing it for a few quarters now. And it seems like now you're talking not just to your suppliers, but their suppliers and also a few levels below that, and some of whom might end up being direct customers as well. So I'm kind of curious, has that level of depth in your supply chain giving you better insight into when these issues could abate? And is that what is informing your mid-single-digit sequential growth for the next few quarters in semis?",111

I'll give you some more color than yes. So we buy -- an average tool has got about 5,000 discrete parts for us. And then those parts have many subcomponents down to our level of suppliers. And so some of our suppliers run MRP, some of them run build to stock, stuff like that. So our historical visibility today builds a material and their supply chain was limited. We've gotten into a lot more depth to understand our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, which goes back to our customers. It's kind of a circuitous route. And at many times, they get their parts from our customers through distributors, not directly from our customers. 
So as we have gotten visibility into this, we've gotten a much more in-depth understanding of the choke points and ways to manage this tactically and, frankly, long term strategically. So I think our visibility is a lot better. Our management [ area ] is getting incrementally better every quarter. And how we think about it strategically long term, I think, is a very big benefit to the company. 
So yes, we got, again, better visibility. I think we're tactically managing better. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think there's going to be long-term benefits to the company in terms of our depth of understanding.",220

You talked about advanced nodes across foundry and logic. You also talked about inspection and metrology and how you've done well there on a trailing 12-month basis and the outlook into '22. When you think about those wins and the momentum you have, how should we think about your overall WFE market share in '22? I realize in the near term, you're still supply constrained. But once supply eases, should we expect you guys to outperform the market this year and perhaps into '23?",108
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760628.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,27,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. No question that the areas that you mentioned, etch, PDC, are significant opportunities for us both now and going forward. I'd say the biggest thing for us is capturing the inflections. We talked about gate-all-around, wiring. We mentioned a few months ago bringing a new tool to market, 7 different technologies and an integrated platform to lower wiring resistance by 50%. And that one platform -- combined platform is worth billions of dollars. So you've got the transistor to process the data, wiring to connect the data, all of the technologies associated with those inflections. We gave some examples around capacitor scaling in DRAM, the CMOS logic also, inflection in memory. All of those inflections are really, really great opportunities for Applied. 
Really, the unique thing for us when you look at whether it's the leading logic, ICAPS, memory, packaging is another one where we have over 50% share of our served markets, we have very deep visibility into all of those inflections. And it's really about creating materials to enable the electrical performance, shaping those structures, modifying the materials, analyzing to really drive the T in the PPACt for our customers. We're in really -- we've never been in a better position in any of those different areas. 
In the specific products you mentioned, in etch, certainly, that's been a really great growth platform for us. The Sym3 etcher has significant technical advantages, higher conductance with a larger chamber volume, unique materials on our chamber wall so we can provide better defects and better yield. And again, really, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not only are we doing really well in memory there, but we're gaining significant share, double-digit share at all the leading foundry/logic customers. 
PDC, that was another one that you mentioned, really tremendous growth in PDC, 68% in terms of the overall revenue growth. A really significant position in e-beam and -- or e-beam overall, the review, inspection, measurement where we doubled in 2021. We have significant leadership there. In '22, we'll have significant growth not only in e-beam, but even faster growth in optical wafer inspection. 
So I would say on the unit processes, we're in a really great position. And really, what I'm most excited about is our ability to capture these big inflections that I talked about in the prepared remarks. Relative to what you see in the revenue growth, and Bob mentioned that earlier, you just can't see it because we can't ship it. And also what Bob talked about earlier was that our backlog, we're booking into 2023, especially in some of our leadership areas. Bob mentioned our metals for wiring. And again, big inflections in wiring where Applied has tremendous leadership. epi, implant, that's another one that will grow significantly for us in 2022. So yes, I -- really, we've never been in a better position, Toshiya, than where we are right now. 
The biggest challenge for us right now is really to close that demand-supply gap.",505

And I assume that you guys have good visibility as to what those suppliers can ship against your orders. So if you put all of that together, can the team meet its forward backlog and forecasted customer shipment requirements for this year? Or do you think that there's a likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers' demand requirements? In other words, is the 2022 WFE of $100 billion for you and peers below what your customers require? And if so, like what do you think is the true 2022 equipment demand profile?",128

Well, you've got a couple of questions in there, Harlan. Mechanically, what we do; two, the visibility; and three, what do we think unconstrained demand is in '22. So if you think about how we do it, we send signals to the supply chain through MRP. And they say they can meet or not meet. Frankly, they are struggling to understand what they can meet more than a quarter or 2 out because it's their suppliers, right? So I think visibility is kind of gray. So we mechanically do it, but nobody is sure, right? 
The second thing is -- but we see improvement, right? The second thing is what do we think unconstrained demand is? I think the tactical question you asked, too, could we go out of the year with demand still north of supply? Yes, we could. We're into '23. So I think our backlog probably grows throughout our fiscal year. 
If you go look at unconstrained demand, I think WFE, $100 billion is defined as what we ship for the industry. And you see our competitors are also constrained this year, and they're booking into '23. I think unconstrained demand is several billion more than $100 billion. I think it's less than $110 billion, but it's more than $100 billion.",215

And the question really is how much semiconductor revenue can this WFE backstop? So if you take everyone's reporting, and they've sort of commented on Q2 as well, it seems like we're doing about $45 billion here in the first half and maybe $55 billion in the back half, something like that to get you to a $100 billion number. And I think in the past, Gary, you talked about 14% WFE intensity. So that would have to support like $800 billion in semiconductor revenue. And this year, if we're lucky, we're going to be at kind of $650 billion. So I'm just wondering if you agree with all that math and sort of how you think about maybe how far out in front of semi revenue WFE is.",158

In terms of WFE or the capital intensity, the number is definitely higher than 14%. If you look at all of these big inflections that the customers are ramping, the capital intensity is probably around 18%, I would guess, right now but definitely higher than the 14% number. I'll let Bob come in, in here in just a second. But just one example is in wiring resistance where that really is one of the biggest areas of focus for all of the foundry/logic customers. If you look at back-end interconnect steps from 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer, they're increasing by about 2x. 
Now the other thing that's happening -- and by the way, it's also increasing in not only foundry/logic, but also in memory. So that -- again, that's just an example. To get that 50% reduction in wiring resistance, it's pretty complex. That complexity also impacts the output of the system. So not only are you seeing step -- steps increase, but you're also seeing a reduction in output. And then certainly for Applied, our metal deposition products where we have a very, very high share, that's an example of a really significant driver for us and one of the factors on why we're booking into 2023 for those products. 
And Bob, I don't know if you want to add any more color.",229
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760640.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,39,"Sure. It's a good question, Tim. I think the 14%, 15% is running a little higher. I think sustainably, you're at a good 15%. If you look at the trend lines and just split it out, WFE intensity, just WFE divided by customers' revenues. If you look at foundry/logic, DRAM and NAND, foundry/logic is the most, and it's trending up for a couple of reasons, leading edge and because of there's not enough tools for the trailing edge. So the revenue dollars take more WFE. And you can sort of see customers talking about that, too. And you see customers like TI who haven't spent in years having to add trailing capacity. So the CapEx as a percentage of WFE of revenue is trending up. 
If you do a rough cut and you think with this foundry/logic mix with more ICAPS, with more greenfields and technological inflections around 3D and gate-all-around, which will drive a little more spending, I think 15% is kind of the new normal, frankly. 
If you look at electronics spending in 2025, it's about $780 billion. So if you take 15% of that, you're about $117 billion WFE in '25. So I think kind of sustainable growth rate is high single digits for WFE, and it's driven partly -- and half of this has got a capital intensity, half is growth in wafer starts. And if you drive the capital intensity at 50%, I think the numbers all kind of work to high single-digits sustainable cross-cycle growth rate for WFE.",254

Thanks, Joe. I'm living this every single day relative to going deep in the supply chain with all of the components that are constraining our output. I really think the guidance we've given, Bob talked about relative to quarter-to-quarter improvement, is really in the ZIP code of where we're going to land. We definitely have much, much deeper visibility, even then we had -- we were on this call a quarter ago. As Bob talked about, from a chip perspective, in a lot of cases, these chips are buried down in components. They come from our customers through distributors, and they really don't know the end destination for those chips. 
As they learn that where the constraints are, they've certainly responded in helping to resolve those issues. But there are just a number of those different constraints. I wouldn't say it's only chips. There are also other areas of the industry. I mentioned again in our metal deposition products where the -- really the demand has just went up so much higher than where they were. 
There are other components that are also constraining us. But I think that we do have much deeper visibility. And what Bob said earlier, I think, is also true. We will come out of this stronger. I think there's no question we'll have better visibility. We have very -- we'll have deeper relationships with our suppliers. So again -- but I think from a ZIP code standpoint, the ballpark of what Bob talked about in terms of the incremental growth quarter-on-quarter is about right. Again, it may not be exactly those numbers, but that's really the relative trajectory.",275

I think you guys reiterated your view that memory WFE will grow but less than foundry and logic. But based on some of the comments you had earlier, you're looking at the kind of low teens growth rate for memory. Just curious, has your view changed much given the memory market seems to have improved in the past 3 months? Or they are so supply constraint that you can't really service the upside? 
And maybe just one more. I think last quarter, you talked about the NAND side is up but the DRAM is down. Is there any update to that as well?",113
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2022",2022-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,2496518.0,94760646.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,45,"Sure. Good question, Sidney. I think that there's 2 reference points for our view of DRAM, NAND growth, foundry/logic and the mix. And I think our view has changed a little bit since last quarter. I think last quarter, our outlook for '22, we were probably a little low on outlook for China, and we're probably a little low on DRAM in particular. So if you look at our reference point, we now believe that in a constrained environment, which is kind of the $100 billion number, we think that DRAM and NAND are kind of flattish from '21, maybe down tiny bit, but kind of flattish. And if you look at foundry/logic, that's the biggest growth, and we think that increases from 60% to several points higher than that in terms of mix in a $100 billion environment. 
So number one, I think we're more positive on DRAM and NAND, DRAM particularly than we were last quarter. And we are more positive on overall WFE in '22 than we were last quarter. I think we still remain positive on foundry, but DRAM probably had the biggest delta on our view from last quarter. 
And then in an unconstrained -- and I don't think they're growing too fast, frankly. If you look at fab utilization by memory and DRAM, it's pretty darn good. So I think they're okay. And I think it's a little more second half weighted.",238

So what we did is we broke down ICAPS a little bit. We define ICAPS as everything, except the leading node. So that's 10-millimeter and above, okay? But then I drove into it some more, and I said, I want to look at 20-nanometer and above, including 200-millimeter stuff because if you look at the last 3 years, the sales on those have grown. Now where you particularly had growth is 28-nanometer stuff. So the percentage of foundry and logic that was 20-nanometer and above in 2020 in the WFE numbers was 31%. And then our revenue mix for us for foundry/logic, pretty similar, too. We had 43% for 2021 and 44% for '22. And where you see the biggest growth year-on-year is 28-nanometer is up; 45-nanometer is up the strongest; 90-nanometer, not too much. But we went into depth by node by year. 
So our conclusion is -- so the other thing that's interesting, Mehdi, was it's gone up. The rate of acceleration has diminished somewhat. And then if you look at a curve in the out-years for ICAPS, leading edge, DRAM and NAND and their share in growing of WFE, you see ICAPS growing in absolute volume. So what also you have to think about is where do the ICAPS tools come from? Not only are the number of devices coming, but where did they get the equipment for that? So they used to take that equipment and roll it over from the leading edge. 
So let's make up an example. So in the leading edge, you might run it for a couple of years, 2 nodes, and you might roll 90% of the equipment forward to the next node and then 10% is for reuse so some gets left behind. But if ICAPS, trailing edge isn't growing much, you have most of your equipment for the trailing edge fully depreciated to use on the trailing edge. But an incremental growth in ICAPS, they believe your ICAPS grows 2x. Your capital equipment requirements for it goes up like 10x, relatively speaking, because you don't have that much equipment rolling over from the leading edge. So the WFE spend on ICAPS is driven by not just growth in ICAPS but the availability of tools to roll into it, they generally have to buy new.",387

I would say, Mehdi, just one more thing. That's -- a dynamic over the last few years used to have used tools that were available for ICAPS, that's all gone. And more of that has moved from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter. So all of those transitions have increased capital intensity for ICAPS.",52

If I may have just a quick follow-up. And thanks so much for the all the insights, it's very helpful. If I were to think about these mixes, Bob, you referenced, I think the majority of this is actually being installed in China. And we're dealing with the situation that for most of the OEMs, China has become -- domestic China has become more than 1/3. So I'm assuming that the investment in China for 20-nanometer and above for logic and foundry will continue, will sustain regardless of what happens outside of China. Would that be fair?",98

I think that's fair. The other thing you might look at, Mehdi, which is interesting is where is the growth in WFE spend by application. And you've got a pretty big growth in the out-years for automobiles, IoTs, some of the sensors stuff and phones. So I agree, the China stuff will sustain stuff. I agree that the long-term demand is pretty good. I agree that they can't keep growing forever. But I think it's already started to decelerate a little bit in the relative growth rates from '20 to '21, '21 to '22. And you have to look at that availability of tools to roll over from the leading edge when you look at WFE because it's a compounding factor.",122

The global semiconductor industry and Applied Materials continue to navigate an unprecedented set of challenges. Demand for semiconductors has never been stronger or broader while the industry's ability to fulfill this growing demand remains constrained by ongoing supply chain issues. 
I would summarize Applied's second fiscal quarter of 2022 as a two-part story. During February and March, we successfully resolved some key component bottlenecks only for this progress to be offset in April as COVID-related shutdowns further disrupted already stretched supply. These shutdowns are impacting a small number of our suppliers and ultimately delayed around $150 million of revenue in the quarter. 
Today, our #1 priority is to work quickly and creatively across the supply chain to bring more industry capacity online. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team and our suppliers, who are doing everything possible to meet our customers' needs. 
In my prepared remarks, I'll cover 3 key topics: First, the supply situation and how we see this evolving over the coming months; second, the near-term demand environment and why we believe this remains strong and sustainable; and third, our long-term view of the markets, the industry's road map and Applied Materials' unique and differentiated capabilities that together create a rich landscape of opportunities for our company. After that, Brice will provide more color on our financial performance and share some of his initial impressions. 
Brice has been with us for 8 weeks, and we're delighted to have him on board. He brings deep and broad experience to our leadership team at this critical time for Applied and the industry. 
Let me begin with the supply side of the equation, which is our biggest area of focus in the near term. The supply situation continues to present multiple challenges that we are working hard to address. Our key issues are shortages of silicon components as well as certain other parts that go into the subsystems of our tools. 
We are doing whatever it takes to deliver for our customers from sending applied resources to supplier sites, qualifying alternative parts, investing in our supply chain to working with customers in creative ways to accelerate shipments, including merging system modules at their sites. 
In addition, we're collaborating with customers using our technology-enabled services to fast track the start-up and qualification of equipment once it arrives at their fabs. For reference, if you map out a typical time line, starting with the shipment of a tool from our factory and ending with the first production wafer out in the customer's factory, the time to install and qualify tools for high-volume production can take months. 
We are seeing strong customer pull for new ramp acceleration services to cut down that valuable time significantly. A positive consequence of our current challenges is that our supplier engagements are becoming much stronger. Not only are we partnering with our suppliers to overcome near-term constraints, we are also building more robust solutions to support industry growth over the coming years. 
As we focus on the needs of our customers, by addressing parts scarcity, expediting deliveries and adding labor in our factories in the field, we are incurring additional costs that are impacting Applied's near-term financial performance. As issues are resolved and we implement effective long-term solutions, transitory cost headwinds will abate. We're also taking actions to improve value capture, including price adjustments. 
Turning to the demand side of the equation, our outlook remains positive. The picture for 2022 is clear. We have the orders booked, a full build plan and a large and growing backlog. We believe unconstrained demand for wafer fab equipment would be $100 billion or more. The key question is how quickly supply issues can be mitigated and how much the industry will actually be able to ship this year. 
The primary focus for our customers is now securing supply for 2023. The visibility our customers are providing is both longer term and more detailed than in the past. On this basis, we currently see 2023 remaining strong and being higher than 2022. 
There are several additional factors that give us confidence in this assessment: First, end demand for silicon continues to grow driven by content growth in existing and new applications. Second, fab utilization is very high even as newly installed capacity comes online. Based on almost 10 years of analytics, this is the highest quarter for industry utilization on record. And third, customers are starting up new capacity faster than ever. Essentially, all tools are being installed by our Applied Materials service team as soon as they arrive at customer fabs, which we have not seen before. 
As we think about demand sustainability, we also take into consideration the broad-based composition of wafer fab equipment spending. In 2022, we expect foundry/logic to make up more than 60% of total WFE investments. This spending will split relatively evenly between the most advanced nodes and ICAPS, production for the IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensors markets. 
ICAPS demand has grown significantly over the past several years, and we see sustainable investment by these customers. The edge applications are consuming more and more silicon. One example is automotive, where the global average silicon content is now $600 per unit, almost twice as much as in 2015. And this will continue to grow with the adoption of electric vehicles. 
Another example is a 5G phone that has 40% more RF content than a 4G handset. The need for extreme power efficiency and battery-powered edge applications is enabled by innovation in materials and structures and is driving an increase in layers and process steps. 
Over the longer term, advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration also support sustainable demand for ICAPS nodes as chip designers can use the optimal node for power, performance and cost for each chiplet in a system. ICAPS customers are more focused on innovation than ever, and we are meeting these needs with new application-specific products. One example is an implant where over the past 5 years, we've introduced 10 new systems developed for specific ICAPS applications. 
While navigating near-term challenges remains our top priority today, we are not losing sight of the bigger picture and long-term opportunities. It's now consensus within the industry that there's a clear path to a $1 trillion semiconductor market before the end of the decade. That would represent a high single-digit compound annual growth rate from where we are today. 
In other words, it took the industry more than 5 decades to reach $0.5 trillion of annual revenues and we will add another $0.5 trillion within the next 6 to 8 years. We feel even better about where Applied Materials sits within the ecosystem. Because technology complexity is increasing, we expect equipment intensity will remain at today's level or increase further over that period. 
As a result, WFE will grow in line or faster than the overall semiconductor market. Then within equipment spending, major technology inflections are enabled by materials engineering, shifting more dollars to our available market over time. We described the industry road map that will deliver future improvements in performance, power and cost of semiconductor devices as the PPACt playbook. 
While different companies have their own version of the PPACt playbook, the fundamental components of the road map are the same: new architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink and advanced packaging. Within each of these 5 pillars, clear technology inflections are emerging that can be quantified in terms of impact, value and timing. 
At our recent Master Class, we described the industry's transition from FinFET to gate-all-around, which is a new 3D structure. Applied has the broadest portfolio of solutions to enable next-generation transistor technology. 
With the gate-all-around inflection, the total available market for our transistor product portfolio grows by more than 15%. Based on our tool of record positions, we expect to increase our share of that available market by more than 5 points. 
And in terms of timing, we expect to start ramping shipments next year. In our next Master Class at the end of the month, we'll talk about wiring and chip integration innovations. Contact and interconnect are in both major focus areas for our customers as they develop new materials and new 3D structures, including backside power distribution networks. Between the 7-nanometer and 3-nanometer node, contact metallization steps are growing more than 50%, and our total available market is expanding almost 80%. 
For interconnect layers, process steps are being added even faster, and we expect our revenue opportunity to approximately triple. We'll also provide an update on our momentum in advanced packaging. At the investor meeting a year ago, we said we expected to double our packaging revenue between 2020 and 2024. Today, we believe we're on track to hit our 2024 packaging revenue goal 1 year early by winning more than 60% share of our served market. 
Beyond equipment, we are delivering and capturing more value with advanced services. Facing both supply constraints and record fab utilization, customers are seeing significant benefits from using our proprietary parts management and service agreements. We see this reflected in our results as AGS delivered record revenue in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year. 
Before I hand the call over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Semiconductors are the building blocks of the modern world, making them more strategically and economically important than ever. Today, the entire industry is working hard to keep up with the world's rapidly growing consumption of silicon. 
Demand for Applied's products and services is strong, sustainable and broad-based. We anticipate our ability to fulfill this demand will remain constrained by ongoing supply chain challenges in the near term with incremental improvements beginning in our fourth quarter. 
Our #1 priority is to continue working collaboratively with customers and suppliers to bring more industry capacity online. We are making progress in key areas, although it is not yet visible in our results. Longer term, we see incredibly exciting opportunities as secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor market by enabling the PPACt road map with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Brice.",1695

First, I want to thank the Applied Materials team for such a warm welcome. Across the company in manufacturing R&D, the business units, operations and functions, people have shared their enthusiasm for the business and invested in helping me get quickly up to speed. The company's dedication to its mission and its customers is tangible in every setting, and I'm thrilled to be included. 
I've been working in the industry for almost 30 years now. And being new to Applied, I'll share a few of my observations so far. For most of my career, semiconductor technology advanced almost like clockwork and became the engine of global economic growth and productivity. We all knew the playbook. 
Looking to the future, the semiconductor road map is fundamental to rapid advances and competitive differentiation in all fields, including health care, transportation and education, where we will leverage massive data collection and analysis and do so using less energy and resources. But today, many people are concerned that the growth and benefits we envision are at risk because the traditional playbook has stalled, making progress more difficult and uncertain. 
Applied focuses on exactly this problem, working closely with its customers to identify and invest in the materials innovations we need to create a new playbook and a new road map and enable higher semiconductor performance, lower power consumption and lower cost. So it feels great to be a part of this team and this important mission. 
Now I'll share three of my first impressions. First, the company is highly execution focused. The team has used its in-depth understanding of the global semiconductor ecosystem to battle almost daily challenges with chip and component availability. The manufacturing teams have been flexible and relentlessly hardworking to deliver for customers in a way that inspires my confidence that we will resolve these issues. Over time, I'd like us to smooth out the heavy quarter end production schedules to make us less vulnerable to supply disruptions. 
Second, Applied's road map extends well beyond the emerging technologies we are talking about today. And this gives me confidence in the industry's ability to continue to drive performance, power and cost for many generations into the future. When I was on the customer side, I didn't realize just how much capability there is. 
Third, the business is highly efficient in terms of capital intensity and operating spending. It's a great model with an excellent return on invested capital. I'm excited to work with Applied's investors and analyst community, and I hope to meet many of you in the near future. 
On today's earnings call, I'll provide more context on Applied's financial performance, position and outlook and emphasize three key messages: One, demand is very strong, both in the short term and long term; two, we are supply chain constrained, but we are poised for growth as the situation improves; and three, we are confident in the future of the industry and increasing our capacity to support the growth we and our customers see ahead. 
Now I'll summarize Q2 results. First, we generated revenue of $6.25 billion, which was up 12% year-over-year. However, revenue was 2% below the midpoint of our guidance because a COVID lockdown in a key region resulted in factory and shipping closures for a number of our suppliers. To size the impact for you, if the COVID shutdowns had not occurred, we would have exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance. 
We met our non-GAAP gross margin target of 47%, which was down 70 basis points year-over-year as the higher input costs we have been experiencing flowed through inventory and into our revenue shipments. We increased non-GAAP operating profit dollars by 8% year-over-year to $1.91 billion, benefiting from revenue growth. 
Operating margin of 30.6% decreased 110 basis points year-over-year due to higher R&D and infrastructure spending. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 13.5% year-over-year to $1.85, which is $0.05 below the midpoint of guidance due to the supply chain constraints. 
Operating cash flow declined to $415 million in Q2 because shipments were back-end weighted during the period and because we increased raw material and work-in-process inventory. Year-to-date, operating cash flow as a percent of revenue was in line with our historical performance. 
During the quarter, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders, deploying $1.8 billion to repurchase 15 million shares of company stock and paying $211 million in dividends. During the quarter, we announced a new $6 billion stock buyback authorization and increased the dividend by 8.3%, marking our fifth consecutive annual dividend increase. 
Next, I'll summarize our segment results. We continue to generate strong orders in Q2 in both semi systems and AGS. Our backlog continues to grow and we have visibility from our customers extending into 2023 and beyond. 
Our semi systems revenue grew 12% year-over-year but was about 3% below our expectation due to the COVID-related supplier shutdowns. Semi systems non-GAAP operating margin declined 200 basis points year-over-year due to increases in manufacturing costs and R&D program spending. 
In AGS, our teams went to extraordinary lengths to keep customer factories running at high utilization, which is particularly difficult in the regions impacted by COVID lockdowns. We delivered record revenue and exceeded our segment revenue guidance, growing 15% year-over-year. 
We also increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year. The ability of AGS to deliver sequential growth in Q2 demonstrates the recurring nature of Applied services business. As a reminder, around 87% of AGS revenue comes from services, parts and software. And this strong services mix enabled AGS to grow despite the supply chain disruptions affecting wafer fab equipment. 
Our strategy is to grow the subscription portion of our services business, which gives us predictable revenue, brings us closer to our customers and generates over 3x the revenue per tool. I'll share some of the metrics we use to gauge our progress. 
In Q2, the Applied Materials installed base grew by 8% year-over-year and is over 40,000 systems. The systems under subscription agreement grew by 11% year-over-year to over 15,000. The average tenure of our agreements grew from 2.3 years last quarter to 2.5 years in Q2. And the subscription renewal rate was 92%. 
Next, our display revenue was at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, up 2% year-over-year. And we increased non-GAAP operating margin by 390 basis points year-over-year. Recently, however, there has been weakness in consumer demand for products like smartphones, PCs and TVs. 
As a result, display equipment demand has softened. And we are making adjustments to our revenue outlook and curtailing our spending in line with the demand environment. We will manage the business with the goal of maintaining healthy cash flow even at lower levels of revenue and operating margin. 
Next, I'll address how we are preparing for our longer-term growth opportunity. Today, we are working with our customers using much longer planning horizons and receiving better long-term visibility. 
We are working closely with our supply chain partners to remove bottlenecks and increase capacity. And we are adding incremental capacity at our R&D and manufacturing sites to increase longer-term efficiency and output. As a result of these efforts, we expect to achieve a more robust supply chain and manufacturing capability along with deeper strategic relationships with our customers and suppliers. 
Now I'll turn to our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue to be $6.25 billion with a wider range of plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.77, plus or minus $0.18. 
Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue of $4.48 billion, a number that is well below demand and assumes the supply chain constraints will persist during the quarter. We expect AGS revenue of $1.43 billion, up 11% year-over-year and display revenue of $310 million. We project non-GAAP gross margin of 46%, non-GAAP OpEx of $1.06 billion and a non-GAAP tax rate of 12%. 
Finally, I'll comment on our gross margin outlook beyond Q3. We expect to gradually increase our gross margins beginning in Q4 through a number of actions that include pricing adjustments, manufacturing cost reductions, logistics improvements and product reengineering. Over time, as the supply chain recovers, we expect a number of transitory costs to abate and to ship higher volumes and a richer product mix. We are fully committed to achieving our longer-term gross margin targets. 
In summary, our demand outlook is very strong in the short term and in the long term. And we are investing to further strengthen our strategic customer relationships and drive profitable growth and shareholder returns.

It sounds like in the prepared remarks, you talked about smoothing out build and shipment plans. And I'm curious, does this mean a vision to work from a longer lead time permanently? And does this mean upfront payments from customers? I would love to hear your thoughts there.",84

CJ, thanks for the question. A question about supply constraints and commitments from suppliers and commitments to our customers. 
Starting with the supply side of the equation, we've been working tirelessly with the entire supply chain to improve output to get toward the levels that we see later in the year and through the horizon on the growing WFE demand. 
On the commitment side, we've definitely made lots of progress. We look at the situation as frustrated by the lockdowns that we've described. But most of these problems are being solved. And we expect to gradually increase output as we get past this quarter that's right in front of us. 
If we think about our customers, we've talked about how orders are at the highest level they've ever been. We've talked about how our backlog is increasing. We're not intending to change the commitment in terms of deliveries to our customers. We're working instead to open the aperture on supply and begin working down the backlog as we start to get more of the critical components in. And we've described our Q4. 
As we think past Q3 and into Q4, we expect to gradually increase revenue from that point on. So no changes from the customer commits. We'll work on improving the performance as we get the supply chain open, and we've made tons of progress with our suppliers.",230

Yes. What I would add is that relative to the customer visibility, it's better than ever. A lot of our customers do have longer-term contracts with their customers. And so we're unfortunately booking all the way into 2024 at this point in time. 
But as Brice said, we're definitely driving our supply chain to improve delivery times for customers. That's priority one. But I would say our visibility is significantly better. And actually, the conversations that we have with customers relative to visibility is further out than we've ever seen.",95

So you said the backlog is strong. Is the backlog at record levels right now? Or has it been stronger in any of the prior quarters in the past? 
And I know you talked about your -- obviously, you're shipping some tools. They're missing modules. How much revenue would you have in that backlog that may be represented by tools that have already been shipped and actually just waiting for final modules in order to recognize that revenue? I guess I'm trying to get something how much like where the backlog is and how much of it is actually like really baked at this point.",114

Thank you for the question. I think the first question, we're not -- we've actually seen the backlog continuing to grow. So that's been a dynamic that's been consistent for the last quarters. And it's not something we're celebrating. We're looking to open the aperture and begin supplying at a faster rate and work the backlog down. But at this point, we still have more than 2 quarters of backlog looking forward. 
As far as the missing modules go, we won't specify exactly what the overhang from quarter-to-quarter is, but you've got the right dynamic. We are shipping a number of tools that are missing 1 or 2 parts for the accountants and the investors. We cannot recognize revenue until we complete those tools. 
So as we work through the quarter, we work to complete all of the tools we've shipped at customer. There are some that are incomplete. We haven't recognized revenue for those. Those go into the next quarter as we get the critical components. It's not a significant overhang. And I wouldn't look at it as necessarily a head start into the next quarter. 
When we think about our guidance to the next quarter, we have carefully mapped out all of the supplies from our supply chain and how they'll help us close the machines that we need to complete in the field and also the orders for the quarter. And so when you think about that overhang, it's not overly significant, but it does exist. Thanks for the question.",254

That's if I heard correctly in terms of demand and output for Q2 in semi systems. I was hoping you could give us that delta for Q3. And given that we are kind of past the halfway mark for your fiscal year, how should we think about the floor for WFE this year? Is it something closer to $90 billion instead of $100 billion? Or is it a different number, assuming the supply situation doesn't dramatically improve even in your Q4?",87
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2022",2022-05-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3731.0,2574632.0,97288310.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,14,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Vivek. So on the overhang for the quarter or on the ownership for the quarter of approximately $150 million, that's the right number. We think if -- and that goes specifically toward the lockdowns in April. That hit us in the last month of the quarter. It affected -- we have a significant number of our builds in the last month of the quarter. So it definitely put a bump in the supply chain for us. And we think we would have exceeded our guidance had that not happened. 
When we think about Q3, again, we've mapped out all of the key components into Q3. And what I want to communicate here is we are forecasting and relying on the factories, our supplier factories to continue to reopen, continue to be staffed and the shipping lanes to continue to open from that area of the world. And we have intelligence. We have the ramp plans. We have the product plans. So our forecast is built on that. So when you think about the delta for Q3, I would say that we've done our best on the guidance side. 
Our capability and our demand is much higher than our guidance for Q3. So what you see there is a forecast that's metered, if you will, by the speed the supply chain is going to pick back up. And that's why we're also saying we expect in Q4, we'll say for today that we expect incremental improvements, and we'll see how this resolves for the quarter. 
And then on the last piece, on WFE. We're sort of running at the same rate. You can look at our last few quarters. We've sort of been running at the same rate. You know that last year was a $87 billion WFE. We're probably running today, at today's speed in the low 90s from a WFE perspective. So we would say that's the floor because as you know, we continue to get orders. We have a long backlog. So at this point, it's just how much can we crank it up as the supply chains open in the Q4, Q1 time frames.",362

And Brice, you used an expression that I was not familiar with, opening up the aperture on supply. I was wondering, could you just spell that out? What does that mean to open up the aperture on supply? And how does that help you close the gap between the demand you have and your ability to supply? 
And Gary, when you talked about building tighter relationship with your suppliers, my understanding is you get subsystems also so then you have suppliers and your suppliers have suppliers. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of spell that out. Like how does like that manifest in mechanically in helping to avoid the situation you're in right now in the future?",137

This is Brice. I'll just make a quick comment on the open the aperture concept there. So what I'm thinking is if you look at our inventory position, our inventory increased $500 million quarter-over-quarter. Our capacity is high, higher than where we're operating today. And our backlog is very large. So from my perspective, we're poised to grow quickly. And what we need to do is get the supply chain on the key components operating. We need to ramp the factories in Shanghai, get the supply chains open and keep going. 
So the concept there was just if you think about the aperture of a nozzle or a hose or something like that, just open it up faster so that we can actually execute what we're prepared to execute. And I think the best place you can see that is in our inventory position looking forward.",148

Mark, on the supplier relationships, probably the biggest thing that we're doing differently now is the multi-tier visibility in our supply chain. So previous to this situation, we never really had to focus on chips and components that are deep in our supply chain. 
So now we have that visibility and just very strong and fast support from our biggest customers to close those gaps. But again, those gaps, frankly, are still coming. One of the situations we just encountered in this lockdown, COVID lockdown that happened on March 28, we had wafers that were completed from one of our big customers and they were packaged in that region. And again, prior to the situation, we would have never known those wafers were going into that region. 
But I would say that what's encouraging to me is the engagements we have with those suppliers, we're also extending our planning horizons with those suppliers. We have tremendous focus within all of our different business units with tremendous engineering horsepower focused into the supply chain. 
So we've made actually some tremendous improvements in fundamental bottlenecks over the last few months. But you can't see it, again, because of the COVID lockdown that started for some of our suppliers on March 28. And that went on for several weeks really with no people in those factories. And even today, some of those suppliers have significantly less than 50% of the people back in the factory. 
So this multi-tier visibility is dramatically better. The engineering horsepower we have focused and really, the joint problem solving, I'd say, with our suppliers, it's really been great. There's been tremendous support, really joint problem solving. I just have tremendous appreciation for the focus and the work that all of our suppliers are doing. 
And Mark, we are making progress. Again, as Brice said, the biggest uncertainty right now is in this COVID lockdown, how quickly is that going to resolve is really the gating factor for us in terms of incremental improvement.",336

I have a big picture question for Gary. Gary, clearly, demand has been strong. And you've been supply constrained for a long time. It seems like that has been the theme from semi and semi-cap companies for the last 9 months or so. 
Now let's just say, assume for argument's sake, demand actually slows down in calendar '23. So from your experience, Gary, where would you see that impact WFE first? Would it be mature nodes? Would it be China? Would it be memory WFE or something else?",94
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2022",2022-05-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3731.0,2574632.0,97288317.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,21,"Krish, thanks for the comments. It's Brice. I'll take a shot at this first and see if Gary wants to add anything. The first thing I want to say in case someone joined and didn't hear the situation early. The situation that we see today is that we're getting more and more orders each quarter. Our backlog is increasing. Our customers are calling us, telling us to speed up. And our customers' customers are calling us and telling us to speed up. 
And when we look at utilization, we've talked about this in previous calls and Gary mentioned it in his overview. When we look at utilization, we track utilization of equipment across the entire industry in all applications, in memory, in foundry, in ICAPS, et cetera. And we see utilization at record levels. 
So finding my way back to your question, you asked where would we see any change if the environment turned. We think the first place we would see that is you wouldn't get new orders. So the fact that we're getting such a high degree of new orders says that not only are customers trying to reschedule their orders or thinking about a different schedule on their own, they're actually adding to it. 
The second place we would see it is there's been discussion of some of the consumer demand, companies may be having less demand. But the second place you would see it is actually wafer starts, and we're not seeing it there either. So we're not getting any of those signals. But to answer directly, we would see it in the new orders slowing down. I think that would be the first place we see it. We're not seeing that today.",287

Krish, this is Gary. What I would add is that I have numerous conversations with a number of different CEOs. And really, the focus of those conversations is on supply. And in many cases, they do have long-term agreements, multiyear agreements with their customers. And the first priority is tools that they need to qualify for that incremental capacity with all of those customers. 
But again, the thing I would say that's different from what I've seen in the past, I'm meeting some of our customers' customers. And they're describing really what they need relative to chip content and innovation in the leading edge. Certainly, again, a lot of the conversations are also in the ICAPS space, where those customers have multiyear contracts and visibility, again, with those customers. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. I've never seen that in my entire career in the industry.",149

On the timing dynamic, Brice, I guess you're guiding fiscal Q3 gross margin to 46%. Any pricing adjustment or the impact from pricing embedded in that number? And if not, should we expect some of the tailwinds to show up in fiscal Q4 and into fiscal '23? 
And then on the scope of some of the pricing adjustments, maybe one for Gary. As you have these discussions with your customers, should we expect positive pricing in your leadership products primarily and not so much in the areas where you have more competition? Or are customers receptive to pricing adjustments in areas like edge and, say, process control?",135
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2022",2022-05-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3731.0,2574632.0,97288321.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,25,"Thanks, Toshiya. I'll start with that. So on the pricing, first, I'd like to communicate that we're doing everything we can to offset the cost side of the equation. So we've got more than a couple of points of headwind over the last few quarters and being off our model. And those things go to things that we've described as we've gone along. It's the labor and overtime that's higher expense. It's the materials inputs. It's the freight and expedites that we're having to pay. And because we can't get all the tools out right now, there's a little bit of a mix impact. 
When we think forward in our 46% gross margin guide, it does include some pricing improvements in Q3. And those will grow over time as they get more traction and we work those across along with the cost reduction efforts we have for the company. 
So as we think about Q4, we're focused on improving logistics, improving the supply chain, making cost reductions with some of our key projects in terms of reengineering and finding more commodity solutions for some of our products. So those are all things that we'll do to bend back the cost side of the equation and help us and help our customers. 
And then on the pricing side, you'll see that increase over the coming quarters, gradually helping each of Q3, Q4 and then Q1. And then on the scope, I think the scope is very broad, and I'll let Gary comment on that.",253

Toshiya, what customers are really focused on with Applied is really the first focus is accelerating capacity and really closing the gap between supply and demand. So as Brice mentioned, there's a number of different headwinds there. Customers all understand that. They want us making those investments. And everything that we can do to help them accelerate chip output is a major focus. 
And then the other thing I would say that -- and by the way, the May 26 Master Class, I would really encourage many of you to come and see that. The wiring innovations are really one of the biggest bottlenecks in the entire industry. And Applied really has many differentiated unique technologies to solve maybe what's the biggest bottleneck in the entire industry for power and performance. 
But obviously, technology, innovation and value pricing, Toshiya, is also key for our customers in terms of driving innovation and creating value. So anyway, those are the things that our customers are focused on. And as Brice said, it's not limited in terms of scope.",177

In other words, foundry and logic all had plans to expand capacity to a certain level to close the industry supply-demand gap. But how much slower will capacity grow with all of the equipment shipment delays this year and next year relative to your customers' targets? 
And then in memory, right, for DRAM, do you think that your customers are going to be able to expand bit supply by targeted 15% to 17% or NAND output by 28% to 30%? It seems as if all of this is just going to result in a longer time to close the semi industry supply-demand gap.

Thanks, Harlan. This is Brice. I'll start on that one. So we do think you're right from the perspective of the growth has been metered this year for sure. And so I think we talked about one of the earlier questions kind of the level we're running from a WFE versus what the natural level will be if we can open things up and speed up in Q4 and Q1. 
So I think the way we would think about it is we're a few quarters behind what raw demand is, and that's probably what's happening across the industry. When we think about the sustainability of the demand, we study all the end markets, as you've described, all the different ICAPS markets, the edge devices, the leading-edge logic area, et cetera, including the memory components. And we see a consistent growth across the horizon from a demand perspective. 
So this just looks like it's -- the supply chain situation is going to meter the beginning of the cycle. And it gives us confidence as we think forward over -- Gary mentioned that we're starting to look at demand into '24. We have high confidence that as we ramp up, that demand will continue through '23 and even into '24 as the industry works to work on its backlog and work on catching up to the real demand that's underneath.",229

And I assume a lot of these are manufacturing on site. But semi systems revenue obviously hasn't really changed over that time period. So I guess when I think about the margin structure, how do we think about the cost absorption or the magnitude of that cost absorption relative to maybe the price adjustments that you're putting through as we think about the improvement in margin over the next several quarters?",91

Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, on the hiring, you're right that there's a significant amount of manufacturing hiring as the flow in manufacturing isn't perfect at this point as we have to react to sort of less predictable inventory and supply. And we have burst of manufacturing to meet the customer needs. 
We also highlighted earlier in the call that we're actually working a number of reengineering projects to improve both the cost profile and the use of alternate parts for some of our products. And we have to do the reengineering and the qualifying of those products, so that takes personnel. 
We're also actually helping some of the suppliers with -- improve their supply situation. That takes personnel. And then of course, we're continuing our growth trajectory. Looking at the WFE going forward, we have lots of projects underway from an innovation perspective to continue the road map. 
So we're continuing on that path. And it's a fair question whether we should in the current environment, but we're definitely looking at the environment as supply constrained, we're going to solve those problems and get back to the growth that we've been forecasting. And we're ready to do that with both inventory and manufacturing capabilities. 
And on the last point, from a gross margin perspective, it is one of the headwinds in the gross margin. I listed 4 headwinds. I'll just say them again. It's freight and expedites, labor and overhead and material cost and mix. So as one of those components, we look at those as approximately equal in strength if you want to think about how that looks against our gross margin. Thanks for the question.",283

But the company had said that revenue would grow kind of mid-singles off of that level throughout the rest of the calendar year. So off that baseline, that sort of implied $6.65 billion for July and about $7 billion for October. So we're coming at about $400 million light of that for July. 
So the question is, can I push that $400 million into October so that October is sort of maybe in the low to mid-7s? I guess I'm just asking you to help us sort of like reshape the year just given that you had shaped it 3 months ago.",144

When we think about -- let's start with the guide for this quarter. When we think about the guide for this quarter at $6.25 billion, what we did was we carefully have worked through the supply chain to find out how quickly will the factories -- our suppliers' factories restaff? How quickly will the supply lines open? When are the exact delivery dates that we'll get through the quarter? Will we get them early enough to make the quarter, et cetera? So -- and we've got a slightly wider range. You'll see to recognize that we're forecasting based on a continued and accelerating reopening schedule that is our best intelligence today. So we've got some risk there. 
When we think forward to the next quarter, we're going to enter the next quarter with also no inventory on those critical components because we will have used all that inventory to satisfy our Q3 demand. So when we think about Q4, we're saying it is gradually or incrementally larger than Q3. 
So I think -- thinking of the previous discussion, we don't know yet what Q4 will look like, which is one of the reasons we won't guide it. It will be metered depending on how quickly the supply chain opens up in Q3. We have the manufacturing capability in Q4 to go much faster. We have the inventory on the nonconstrained components to go much faster. So there's a wide range of possibilities for Q4. And we just need to continue progress on the key components and lockdown factories in Q3 if that makes sense. 
And the last thing I will say though that there's not any perishable demand for us. As you think about one of your questions, would you push that forward? I absolutely think you will push it forward. Nothing will perish in this situation. It's just going to be metered in Q4 by where we are with the supply chain. Thanks for the question.",332

Can you just talk about -- it looks like you're going to track to down double digits this year. What's going to return that business to growth? Is it just smartphone? Anything from kind of an application or a technology perspective that will lead that business to grow down the road.,67

So this is the one place in the business where we have seen some impact from the change in consumer demand at this point. So definitely, weakness in the outlook for display for the next few quarters sort of corresponding to what's been characterized as weakness in smartphone and PC and TV, et cetera. 
And so what we're doing is resizing the business from a spending perspective to make sure that we can deliver the amount of cash returns that we've been delivering for the past few years and still leave us ready to grow as the demand picks back up and some of the new applications pick back up. 
So you'll see us make those adjustments as we go forward in the next few quarters. It will be a lower revenue number, but it will still be a good return on investment. Last thing I'll say there is, most of our investment has largely been made in that business. So we're able to deliver to customers and execute against investments that have been made. 
So it's a good cash flow business, good cash returns, and that's sort of our perspective. And it does leave us ready for new demand on some of the new applications. Gary, if you want to comment?",231

Joe, thanks for the question. So as you mentioned, this year, double-digit, will probably be down roughly 10% versus where we've been in -- will be down about 10% this year. And as Brice said, we really have resized our spending. We've made a lot of investments. 
I think, as you know, we have very, very high share in the parts of the market that we participate in. But we are committed, as we've discussed in our investor meeting, to returning free cash flow from this business. And so we'll be, as Brice said, able to deliver similar free cash flow even at a lower level. 
I would say right now, if we looked out into '23, we don't really see strengthening today in terms of where that market is going. We will be able to continue to deliver similar levels of free cash flow with the resizing that's in progress. And that business really is leveraging semiconductor deposition technology into larger panels. 
One thing that's also another synergy for us. If you look at the advanced packaging road map, going to larger substrate sizes, there is technology and display that will strengthen our already strong position in packaging in the longer term. 
So there are synergies there. It's a good free cash flow business. Longer term, some of the OLED technology barriers, once those are solved, we could see a step-up back in that market. But we really don't see that over the next several quarters.",248

And I appreciate all the metrics you disclosed in your prepared remarks. But considering last quarter, you talked about supplies constraints impacting the 200-millimeter product line. Can you talk about what drove the upside? 
And the follow-up to that is you previously suggested low double-digit growth for AGS in fiscal '22. Has anything changed there? Can you touch on the risk that COVID lockdowns may have on AGS?",86

Thanks for the question. Yes. On the services business -- thanks for the question. I think it is important to recognize that the business did grow quarter-over-quarter, 5%. And it did grow 15% year-over-year. 
And our investors probably know it's been a key part of our strategy to shift more and more of our services business to the subscription format because that's better for our customers and it lets us plan better also and provides them more technology, advice and capability. 
So when we think about the indicators that we give for that business, that portfolio is getting stronger and stronger. And when we see the supply constraints for the rest of the business, it's not surprising to us that, that recurring revenue, the way that business is set up is low beta or a little bit more resistant to changes in the rest of the business. 
What drove the upside was really the high utilization across the ecosystem. There is still a transactional element to that business. And when we talk about utilization across 200-millimeter, 300-millimeter, all of the different product types, it's just 92%, 93%, 94% record levels we talked about. And that drives spares and parts and service components across the entire ecosystem. So that's really where you see the strength in the quarter. We would have been even higher had we had more supply, but we're working on that. 
And the last piece on COVID lockdown, I guess that was related to supply. So we do think the business could have been stronger in Q2. And we would have served more parts on the parts side of the business. But it's a first priority for us, and we're working on improving that as we look forward.",291

Sidney, this is Gary. Just another point. One of the things that's driving our growth in subscription revenue, subscription services. Our customers are really focused on increased output. So we have part management services. And I can tell you that many of those customers that have those services are very happy. 
They don't have shortages and they're increasing chip output. We have managed services to increase yield and optimize productivity for good chip output. That's another one we see tremendous pull from our customers. And by the way, this is driving increased headcount as we're supporting some of these service opportunities. 
And then the other thing is ramp services, ramp acceleration services, time to ramp, as I said in my prepared remarks, is months for many of our customers. So every week that we can accelerate the time for those tools to drive chip output, everybody is focused on that. 
So there are a number of these services that are increasing our subscription percentage, increasing our subscription revenue. Again, that's really in the theme of everybody's focused on good chips out as fast as they can.",187

In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered results at the high end of our guidance range and record quarterly revenues. The actions we've been taking to mitigate supply chain challenges are beginning to have an impact, and we expect steady incremental improvements from here.
Resolving supply issues has required new levels of collaboration between our global teams, suppliers and customers. While all of this hard work is yielding results, global supply chains remain stretched. Demand for Applied's products is still higher than our ability to fulfill it, and our backlog continues to grow. In addition, our relentless focus on meeting customers' needs in this very difficult environment has created margin headwinds that we're working hard to overcome. We're driving actions to reduce costs and improve value capture, including price adjustments.
In my prepared remarks today, I'll cover 3 key topics: first, our near-term outlook on supply and demand dynamics; second, our longer-term view of the markets and the industry's road map; and third, Applied Materials strategy, priorities and progress. After that, Brice will provide more color on our financial performance in key areas of operational focus.
Let me begin with our near-term perspective on the market. Due to large gaps between demand and supply as well as equipment companies shipping partially finished systems and emerging components in the field, overall 2022 wafer fab equipment spending is difficult to quantify with precision. Our best estimate is that it will land somewhere in the mid-$90 billion range. For Applied, the picture is clearer. If we use the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we expect our wafer fab equipment revenues to be up approximately 15% for our fiscal year.
As we look ahead to 2023, there are 3 major factors shaping our view of the market. First, memory spending is expected to be lower than in 2022 as macro uncertainty and weakness in consumer electronics and PCs causes these customers to defer some capacity additions. Second, leading-edge foundry/logic looks strong with customers battling for leadership and racing to be first to implement major technology inflections. Third, ICAPS customers who serve IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets, are reporting areas of strength and weakness. These customers serve broad and diverse applications. They're seeing softness in consumer-centric markets, which are being impacted by macroeconomic factors.
Auto and industrial demand continues to be solid because those investments are driven by large inflections, such as electric vehicles and industrial automation. In these areas, chip makers are securing long-term capacity agreements that underpin their capital spending plans.
While it's too early to provide a forecast for 2023, we believe our business will be more resilient than in the past if there is a demand pullback in certain areas of the market. We expect Applied to remain supply-constrained for the next several quarters. We're working through our very substantial backlog of orders, which provides a buffer to in-year demand fluctuations. And in addition, customers are providing us with longer-term visibility and commitments in response to their own customers' actions to lock in the strategic capacity they need.
Although we're confident in our ability to perform well in a range of market scenarios, we're mindful of the current macroeconomic trends. As a result, we are slowing down hiring while ensuring we fully fund the R&D programs and strategic operational capabilities that support our long-term growth. Regionalization of supply chains is also something new for the industry. We expect this will provide a small positive tailwind for overall wafer fab equipment spending starting in late 2023.
Also, because of the time-bound nature of government incentives in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we see a higher degree of certainty for these investments. Last week, I was in Washington, D.C. for the signing of the CHIPS Act and met with government officials and leaders from across the semiconductor and automotive ecosystems. I'm happy to see the critical role that semiconductors play in the economy being recognized and acted upon.
The need to build more resilient and flexible supply chains remains a key theme for these leaders, and the CHIPS Act will enable many companies to accelerate their investments in strategic capacity. I'm also excited about the potential to create a new high-velocity innovation platform in the United States to accelerate the development and commercialization of next-generation technologies.
As I look further to the future, I feel very positive about the direction of the industry and our long-term opportunities at Applied. Consensus within the industry is that semiconductor revenues can reach $1 trillion before the end of the decade. That translates to a high single-digit compound annual growth rate from today.
In parallel, the technology road map is becoming increasingly complex. As a result, we expect equipment intensity, the ratio of wafer fab equipment investment to semi revenues to remain at today's level or increase over this period. Then the major technology road map inflections, including Gate All Around transistors, Backside Power Distribution networks, new materials for interconnect and contact, and heterogeneous integration of chips and chiplets, are enabled by materials engineering where Applied Materials is the leader, and this shifts more dollars to our available market over time. We've invested ahead of these inflections to create a portfolio of differentiated solutions that positions us to outperform as these new technologies transition to volume manufacturing.
Applied Materials strategy is built upon the breadth and strength of our technology and capabilities. This provides us with a unique ability to engineer, co-optimize and integrate solutions that address our customers' highest-value technology challenges. Co-optimized solutions, where we optimize adjacent process steps, and Integrated Material Solutions, or IMS, where we optimize a combination of process steps in a single system under vacuum are becoming an increasingly important part of our product portfolio.
In our recent Master Class, we talked about a breakthrough IMS approach for tungsten-only contacts that are free of conventional barrier materials. This provides significant improvements in contact resistance and is critically enabling for smaller foundry/logic nodes. The number of process steps are growing as these customers migrate to this pure metal technology, and these low-resistance integrated solutions for contact and wiring represent new multibillion-dollar revenue opportunities.
Over the past 2 quarters, we have secured multiple tool of record positions at all leading customers. Our ability to co-optimize materials engineering solutions with novel inspection and metrology is also driving record performance in our Process Diagnostics and Control business. We expect PDC revenues to be up almost 40% in fiscal 2022 with broad-based customer adoption of our eBeam metrology and new optical wafer inspection platforms.
In the quarter, we also strengthened our ICAPS portfolio with a tuck-in acquisition. Picosun is a leader in batch ALD technology, and we're delighted to welcome their talented team to the Applied Materials family.
Turning to service. AGS delivered record quarterly revenues despite headwinds for our transactional spares and 200-millimeter equipment businesses due to supply chain constraints. The subscription portion of AGS continues to demonstrate strength. Installed base tools under long-term service agreements grew 9% over the past 12 months. Our renewal rate for these agreements continues to be strong and is currently running at 93%.
Before I hand the call over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. We're beginning to see gradual improvements in our supply chain, which enabled us to deliver record revenue for the quarter. We expect demand to remain higher than supply for the next several quarters, and we're continuing to drive actions to close the gap.
The changing macroeconomic environment is causing some customers to adjust the timing of their investments. However, we're confident that our business will be more resilient, thanks to strong pull for a uniquely enabling technology, our large backlog, longer-term visibility from our customers and industry-wide investment in strategic regional capacity. Our long-term view of the market remains unchanged as multiple parallel secular trends drive the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher. At the same time, large technology inflections that are enabled by our core capabilities in materials engineering create outsized growth opportunities for Applied Materials.
Now I'll hand the call over to Brice.",1348
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,2634890.0,99323646.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. I'd like to begin by saying thank you to our teams and our supply chain partners for helping to increase our output despite ongoing constraints and unexpected shortages. Our factory and logistics teams operated with agility, adjusting to almost daily changes in supply schedules. We are still not meeting all of our customers' demand, and solving the supply chain shortages to increase our manufacturing output remains our top priority.
Before I summarize our Q3 results, I'd like to emphasize 4 points. First, our overall demand remains healthy. Specifically, our orders remained strong in Q3, our backlog increased, overall factory utilization remains high, and customers have added 4 new factory projects to the long-term road map. There are pockets of weakness in the semiconductor market, and a number of affected customers have asked us to reschedule their capacity additions. At the same time, there are areas of strength, and we have broad market exposure and strong customer pull for technology investments.
Second, our supply chain improved incrementally in the quarter, as Gary mentioned. We have added significant investments in talent to our supply chain teams to resolve bottlenecks and to improve our inventory and overall output.
Third, we remain committed to our long-term gross margin targets. Today, we are still experiencing the effects of higher costs and unfavorable mix, which are being partially offset by pricing adjustments. We expect to incrementally improve gross margins over the coming quarters driven by forecasted improvements in manufacturing volumes, product mix, pricing and logistics costs.
And fourth, we are confident in the industry's underlying growth trajectory and our unique materials engineering capabilities for process innovation. While we are slowing our headcount growth, we have increased our R&D spending by around 10% year-to-date and remain fully invested in enabling our customers' road maps.
Turning to our Q3 results. We delivered record revenue of $6.52 billion, which is in the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin of 46.2% declined 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP operating spending was $1.06 billion, which is right on target and up $39 million quarter-on-quarter as we increased R&D and added supply chain resources. Non-GAAP operating margin declined 60 basis points to 30% driven by the lower gross margin and headcount additions primarily in engineering. Non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 grew $0.09 quarter-on-quarter and matched our previous record.
Turning to the segments. The semi systems team did a great job maximizing shipments, growing revenue by $276 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter. Segment non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points sequentially to 36.1% due to higher materials, freight, expedite and labor costs, partially offset by price adjustments.
The AGS team delivered record quarterly revenue, growing $37 million or 3% quarter-on-quarter. We continued to deliver healthy year-over-year growth in subscription revenue, while the supply chain shortages constrained our growth in transactional parts and 200-millimeter systems. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 30.6% and slightly up quarter-over-quarter.
I'll take a minute to share a few observations about AGS. Next month, we'll host a services Master Class where you'll have an opportunity to learn more about our strategy to increase our recurring revenue. The 3 key drivers are the growth of our installed base, equipment service intensity and long-term service agreements. AGS is making excellent progress toward our 2024 financial model. We exited Q3 tracking around $500 million ahead of the base case of our AGS revenue plan and around $250 million ahead of our high case. In addition, the services business is capital-light and produces excellent cash flow.
Moving on to display now. The market is weaker due to its high exposure to consumer portion of the economy. During the quarter, we lowered spending in line with the current market environment. Our display revenue declined by $48 million or 13% to $333 million. The business contributed $70 million of non-GAAP operating profit, which is down sequentially by $12 million or 15%.
Turning to our cash flows. We generated $1.47 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 23% of revenue. We returned $1.23 billion or 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders, deploying $1 billion to repurchase 9.8 million shares of company stock and paying $225 million in dividends. We also deployed around $440 million for 2 strategic acquisitions. We expanded our ALD portfolio with the addition of Picosun, and we acquired a talented simulation software team. Year-to-date, we have produced over $4.5 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $4 billion in free cash flow and returned $5.25 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'll share our guidance for Q4. We expect revenue to increase to $6.65 billion plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $2 plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue to increase to $4.93 billion or up 14% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to increase to $1.43 billion or up 4% year-over-year with continued healthy growth in services and ongoing supply chain limitations in 200-millimeter systems and transactional parts. Display revenue should decline to around $250 million. We expect to incrementally increase our non-GAAP gross margin to 46.4%. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly to $1.08 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 11.8%.
Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to summarize our company's position in the current environment. We continue to see very strong customer pull for advanced technology in all of our markets, and our backlog continues to grow. We believe some of our customers will moderate their capacity additions in areas that have been impacted by weak consumer spending. However, I expect Applied's business to be more resilient than in past periods for 3 reasons. One is that we have strong exposure to technology investments, particularly in the foundry/logic market, which has grown to become approximately 2/3 of wafer fab equipment spending. Second is that we have multiple quarters of backlog for products that are essential to our customers' technology road maps, and we expect to continue to increase supply over the next several quarters. Third, that our services business has grown to over $5.5 billion in size and generates 87% of revenue from recurring demand for parts, services and software.
And now, Mike, please begin the Q&A.",1038

Just -- yes, good question on supply constraints and timing versus the demand environment, et cetera. So let me explain what we've done the last couple of weeks. 
We just went through a cycle where we reconfirmed all of our 2023 demand with our customers, something we do once or twice per quarter on a regular basis. And it gives the customer base a chance to signal if they want to make changes, they want to make adds, they want to make drops. And in a constrained environment, that lets us balance our supply across the customer base in the best way.
So we've just completed that. And there are a number of changes, but what we see for 2023 and the next 3-plus quarters, as we said in our initial comments, is that demand is still significantly above our ability to supply, but we've got the confidence that we just reconfirmed all of that. And then when we think about supply, our comments -- we've invested significantly in the supply chain. So we're working to identify issues and loosen the supply chain and solve problems in the supply chain both at our direct suppliers and our secondary suppliers. So our expectation is that we'll increase output for the next several quarters and continue to work on that backlog, which, as you highlighted, has been -- has continued to grow.",234

I guess also relative to supply chain, what we've been -- certainly the Zero-COVID lockdown in Shanghai, March 28, that set us back relative to overall supply chain. We're continuing to make incremental progress. And I just -- right now, we see it still being incremental going forward. We're doing everything we can, making investments, adding manpower, but it's more incremental.
And I think the same thing is true on margins. I think last quarter, we said that we would see incremental progress from where we were. And I think that's really the direction both for supply chain and for margins is more incremental improvement throughout '22 and going into '23.",116

So do you push there? Are you able to like take the slot that you have allocated for them and push them back a quarter or 2? Or do you -- at some point, do you just say, ""Listen, we can't push this back anymore. You either got to take it or go to the end of the line."" If you could just provide some color about what you're seeing real time on the ground. Is -- like how many people are pushing back? Is it a quarter? Is it 2 quarters?

I know Gary's going to comment. I'll just make a quick comment, Mark. When we go out and test the backlog with the customers, if they want to make changes, a lot of times, that's a mutually beneficial change. We have another customer that's interested in taking the tool because the demand is exceeding supply at this point. So the first thing we do is try to accommodate those changes. We're not trying to demand the customers stay on the schedule that they have, et cetera. So we try to be flexible. And that was really the point of going out and retesting and reverifying all of the demand that we have across the customer base. So Gary, you may want to add to that.",126

Again, the challenge we face right now -- again, many of our customers are really driving major technology inflections. And Mark, I think you see also, especially in high-performance logic, everyone is racing to these new inflections. So we just have tremendous demand from those customers in ICAPS, automotive, industrial automation. So unfortunately, we're not able to supply to that demand. And as Brice said, memory is weaker. And we try to manage and work with the customers to come up with the right outcome for them and for us.",96

One, I think, Brice, you mentioned you're going to be increasing capacity over the next several quarters. But then from a demand perspective, I believe, Gary, you said that memory could be down. I think you've said kind of mixed views on ICAPS, but then leading-edge should be up.
So my specific question is based on -- I know you're not giving next year's guidance per se. But based on what you see, are we looking at kind of a garden variety, flat to down 5%, 10% in terms of the spending environment? Or is it very different than that view? Just so that we have some baseline view of how you're thinking about the industry going into the next year given you do plan to increase supply.",137

So to reconcile those 2, I think the first thing to be clear on from our side is that demand for the next several quarters, 3-plus, is far higher than supply. So we are going to concentrate, like we say, on increasing our supply and we'll do our best to do that over the next several quarters. And that's our expectation, is demand will stay above where we can supply across that time period.
So I think someone said it before that we're underserving the market so far that -- such that if there's a change in demand, it's still above where our supply line is. That's the perspective we have. And if you think about -- or if you're asking about '23, like we said, it's too early to make a call on '23, but what we would point out is different areas of the market, sure, are having some weakness, some inventory issues, other areas are very strong and are on schedule to build the processes that they need for customer products that are also on schedule. So we think those puts and takes more or less will continue the demand signal for us into next year.",202

So I assume the memory backlog is coming down given it's weaker, but it sounds like your overall backlog is still increasing if your demand is still well exceeding supply. So is it a case of like your foundry backlog is increasing more than your memory backlog is shrinking? Or like how do I think about the different pieces of that?",77

Exactly right, Stacy. This is Brice. Definitely, the backlog is increasing. And definitely, the foundry/logic backlog is the strongest or -- yes, strongest component of that in terms of orders and adds to our order book. I'd say that's good.
We know there has been reductions on the memory side. I don't actually know if the memory side is down in total overall, but I think that's a fair way to look at it. Some customers have reduced backlog on memory, but overall foundry/logic and some of the ICAPS customers are driving an outweighing increase on the positive side.",100

So also the foundry/logic is an increasing percentage of overall wafer fab equipment. So if you look at the percentages, foundry/logic is really around 2/3 of total wafer fab equipment. And so certainly, the rates for competitiveness in high performance, you see that with companies making significant investments. ICAPS, you've seen a lot of announcements with companies making long-term investments in the ICAPS capacity. So certainly, you see that in the increasing percentage of foundry/logic in the overall market. So yes, I think that what Brice said and what you had also asked in your question, certainly, foundry/logic is strong. And that backlog still, unfortunately, we're not able to meet demand.",115

Brice, any color you could give there and how to think about revenue and operating leverage in that environment would be very helpful.",64
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,2634890.0,99323669.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,26,"Sure. Thanks, Krish. So the first thing, just to remind investors, you kind of made the point in the question about our backlog. We do have, as you said, a large backlog, and we expect for the next 3-plus quarters, we'll just be working on raising our output and serving that backlog. But if you want to do a what if, if revenue goes down or if WFE goes down, the first thing I would remind investors also is that our services business doesn't fluctuate or correlate 100% with WFE. It's driven off our installed base, which grows every time we ship a tool. And the utilization across the entire factory network that we're serving, transactional spares and subscription service agreements across that.
So that portion of our revenue tends to dampen any weakness that we would have from a lower WFE. I would just highlight that for people that are thinking model. So whatever would change on WFE and change on the equipment side, it would be a dampened signal on the services piece of the business.
And then for overall modeling purposes, I would look at probably as a proxy year 2019 to see how the business reacted to a lower revenue environment, where you can look at the margin performance in 2019, which was down 1 or 2 points. And you can look at spending where it was controlled, relatively flat. I think those would be the same sort of reaction the company would be able to implement in that sort of environment if you were doing a what if, which again is in our forecast.",269

I think you stated in your prepared remarks that you expect it to be a small tailwind or a minor tailwind starting in late 2023.
First of all, if you could sort of quantify that for us for '23 and '24, that would be super helpful. And then more importantly, how has the conversations you're having with your customers changed since the CHIPS Act has gone through? I guess the main question that I get from investors is if a big foundry in Taiwan decides to build capacity in the U.S., isn't it sort of a zero-sum game where you sort of subtract from what could have happened in Taiwan and you just kind of take that over to the U.S.? So net-net, isn't it sort of a zero-sum? But how would you kind of respond to that?",168
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,2634890.0,99323672.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,29,"Yes. Thank you, Toshiya. So on the CHIPS Act, first, I'd say just I am very happy to see the CHIPS and Science Act pass and become law. That's really positive to the United States and the overall industry. And then relative to the investment question that you asked, I would look at it as a small positive tailwind for overall wafer fab equipment spending and really timing-wise, starting in late 2023. If you look at the investments, at least the ones that have been announced so far, it's really in high-performance logic, some ICAPS investments, those kinds of things.
So as I mentioned earlier, again, 2/3 of wafer fab equipment is in that foundry/logic space today. And so that's going to be incrementally positive going into late '23 and beyond. Those investments also are time-bound. If you look at the incentives, there are certain time frames where the funding is available and investments have to be made. So that creates a higher degree of certainty. I would say, as those companies -- I've talked to many of them. And as they move to new locations, there is start-up costs and some incremental less efficiency, as they start those fabs and especially for our service business, that's an incremental positive.
So I think you'd see small incremental spending late '23 and beyond as all of those investments and those factories are starting up. Over time, Toshiya, I think really as they -- it really depends on the scale of those factories. A bigger factory is more efficient than a smaller factory. And so until they build them out, which will take many, many years, there will be a degree of less efficiency for some period of time. But again, if you look at it in the grand scale of overall WFE, it's not a huge tailwind, but it's definitely a tailwind.",311

Maybe this is a plug for your upcoming Master Class. But I mean in the event of a weaker WFE environment next year, you have several positive buffers. I think the biggest one is that your services business historically does not decline during downturns. In fact, over the past 11 years, and I think that's 4 WFE down cycles, I believe that there's only been 1 year that AGS was down.
And it's driven a pretty stable like 8% to 10% sort of revenue CAGR over that period of time. So outside of the annuity-like subscription contracts that I assume will be partially offset by, let's say, 200-millimeter equipment sales, which may fall off in a weak WFE environment, what is the team doing to ensure continued outperformance of services doing WFE weakness and your confidence on driving growth in services if WFE is down next year?",159

Thanks for the question, Harlan. If I got it there, what we're focused on, the 2 drivers for that business, as you kind of hinted to, are really the installed base that grows every time we ship a tool, and then as you highlighted, our ability to serve that installed base both through transactional support spares and services, and then the subscription agreements that we have with customers that offer spares, plus insights that we have across the network on how to optimize for yield and how to optimize for capabilities.
So I think what we're doing is increasing our portfolio of service offerings that make it more valuable to the customer. It allows them to ramp more quickly, reach higher yields and really benefit from the intelligence that Applied has across the whole ecosystem of tools that they don't have potentially on their own. I think that's the focus area for the company, and that's what gives us confidence that as that installed base grows, we'll be able to continue to grow our subscription agreements.
And just the last piece is, you're right, we have the same analysis on not being 100% correlated with WFE. And even as -- if there's changes in WFE or weakness in the revenue and the rest of the business, it's really about the underlying utilization in the factories that exist and the need for services and intelligence in those factories. So I think those are the key drivers.",246

The one thing that I think has helped us also -- so if you -- you talked about 10, 11 years. If you go back over that time period, we, I think, close to doubled our percentage of subscription agreements versus transactional. So certainly -- and we've increased the length of those agreements to 2.5 years. So that percentage of agreements being so much higher, and it's still growing, that makes that business more resilient.
And I think that also relative to the environment we've been in, where everybody is focused with chip shortages, producing good chips out, it really has also highlighted more value in our services. Things like managed part services, where people have the parts available versus competing for what's available from a transactional perspective, along with all the things that Brice talked about, I think that's really helped highlight the value of these longer-term subscription agreements for our customers.",169

Thanks for the question, Joe. Yes, the way I would think about it -- first of all, I think, yes, we've highlighted that demand is higher than our supply level. There's been changes. I think in total, that demand came down a little bit, but it's still above what we're able to supply for the out-quarters.
But I think the way we think about it for a leading-edge foundry is they're building processes that their customers are building products on, and they need to be able to hit those schedules for the customer products. So they're fairly committed to getting that technology in place.
And then you're right, the volumes will fluctuate depending on what the market is for those products. But if you're building a logic node for a product 2 years from now, you're really thinking about what the market is 2 years from now when you're putting that equipment in place. So it's not as simple as just looking at the current quarter's macroeconomic environment, GDP and lowering your demand. You really have to think about that forward-looking function. But the dynamics -- you have the dynamics, right? We just retested all of the demand for next year, and that's what all the customers are thinking about.",211

And on one hand, customers are pushing out, but you also mentioned that you're getting long-term commitments from some other customers. I was wondering what that means because it kind of sounds like you're confident that foundry/logic is going to hold up at this time even as memory pushes out. And that's not usually how it works. Is it something that there's such a concentration of leading-edge foundry capacity and there's going to be others such as your neighbor that are trying to compete to get back in the foundry business? Is that what's different this time? Because I'm hearing these mixed signals, and there's something obviously different. So I'm just wondering if you can call on your past knowledge to help on that.",137

Just 2 comments. The first is we've definitely expanded the horizon with all of our customers from a planning perspective. They're giving us longer signals than before and giving us the opportunity to engage in the discussion on capacity planning with them. And second, some customers are also giving us a sense that -- or a promise basically that they'll operate within a certain band of capacity. So they're giving us additional confidence to what we should plan for from a high-confidence perspective, and that's a little bit different than what we've done before.",96

I would say one other thing that is helping us in this time frame. If you look at the relative investment for the upcoming inflections, more of the dollars are going to new materials and new structures. Gate All Around, we talked about that in the Master Class. Wiring for interconnect from 7 to 3 goes up, I think, 3x dollars per wafer as you go because you have -- go to the 3-nanometer node, there's more steps. We have these Integrated Material Solutions that combine 7 technologies on one integrated platform to lower the wiring resistance by 50%.
Backside Power Distribution, if you look at what one of our customers said recently, they talked about significant increase in materials and structures relative to power performance for them going to their future technology nodes. Backside Power Distribution is another one that's a significant inflection. You can reduce the area up to 30% without shrinking the features by placing some of the structures on the backside of the wafer. So again, for us, that relative contribution and the relative investment in our types of technologies is going up, and that's another thing that's helping us.",198

And I guess if we sort of -- if we think this is a memory downturn that looks similar to 2019, should we think about WFE being down similarly to 2019? Or do you think that would be too pessimistic? And why is that?",72
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2022",2022-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3652.0,2634890.0,99323687.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,44,"Thanks, Joe. The first part, I guess I haven't thought of it like that, but I would say that we are resilient -- a more resilient philosophy or position would play to memory only. And the reasons that I would point to are, first, the backlog that we've talked about. Even though memory may be weaker than it was last quarter, we still have significant quarters of backlog for memory customers. So that dynamic is the same. And the overall backlog strength is one of the reasons we're saying we're more resilient than in other periods.
And the second is the services business is one of the reasons that we're thinking that we're more resilient, and that also applies to memory customers and customers that we service from a spares perspective, et cetera. So I think that also is larger than it has been in the past and is more resilient relative to changes in WFE.
And then the last piece, just to make sure for everybody else, I wasn't implying that 2019 would be the P&L for the company. We won't go back to 2019, but that it was a good proxy for how gross margin and spending would behave if we were in a weaker environment. So just to clarify that.",213

Joe, this is Gary. I think if you say what's changed -- or what's the same and what's changed, certainly, the percentage of foundry/logic is significantly higher than it was back in that time frame. Again, it's tracking around 2/3. There's this race for leadership in high-performance logic and significant investments that are happening in that part of the market. And we see customers -- our customers announcing longer term agreements with their customers, and that's something that we didn't see back in that time frame. So I think the foundry/logic percentage and the relative strength there is definitely different than -- certainly than it was in the 2019 time frame relative to the overall wafer fab equipment market.",120

Maybe you can talk about the demand strength from domestic Chinese customers versus multinationals and the foundry versus memory. That will be great.",88

This is Brice. Yes, I think one specific driver and one just general observation. The specific driver is most of the downside on our display business relates to customers in China. So that's the -- probably the primary change element. The rest is just the ins and outs normal quarter activity. We don't think the China market, as we look forward, is any weaker. We think the ICAPS investments that are being made there are largely on schedule. No real change in signal there. So it's just the ins and outs of having different-sized deliveries in the quarter. It happened to be a quarter overall that was a little smaller than the prior quarter. So we would point to display and then just general ups and downs for the rest of the change. And just to reiterate, no change on the -- no change because of the trade rules like we said before.",155

The clarification is, when you talk about memory reschedules, are these memory customers just pushing out delivery dates by some number of quarters? Or are they canceling the tool entirely and you're just taking that slot and reallocating it out to one of the foundry/logic customers? The question is just on the memory rescheduling. Is that equally happening across DRAM and NAND? Or is it predominantly on the DRAM side?",79

Quinn, thanks. On the clarification, there are both -- there are all 3 events happening with basically all customers. So there's adds, there's drops, and there's schedule changes. I think on the memory, there's more drops than there are adds in the short-term window. So those are cancels. And there are plenty of reschedules and there are even some adds for memory. So I hope that clarifies. It's a mix. But overall, we would say memory -- cycle-over-cycle, memory is lower than what it was in the last cycle.",90

No, ICAPS is very strong for our -- ICAPS is very strong overall for the company. PDC is up 67% in 2021, and we're up almost 40% in fiscal 2022. What I would say relative to the breakdown of the different markets, certainly, it's stronger in high-performance logic than in any other part of the market, although we are seeing growth in memory, and we are definitely also seeing growth in ICAPS.
The biggest thing for us, if you look at our PDC business last year, eBeam pretty much doubled. So we have vertical integration with our electron optics, leadership in resolution and imaging technologies. And that business is also very, very strong into '22 and then also going forward. We are seeing incremental strength also in optical inspection, and we believe we'll outperform the overall market in optical inspection. And overall PDC has a really strong tie to PPACt inflections.
So when you look at Gate All Around or some of these other big inflections, our unique imaging capability enables us to map out those processes in fingerprints faster and better than anyone else. So that synergy, not only do we see really strong growth in PDC, but real strong synergy with the rest of our semi portfolio.",214

But the increase -- I'm looking at the number, sorry, right now -- relatively balanced. I mean here's what's happening on -- here's what's happening dynamically. We have a much more raw inventory coming in as we're trying to solve the supply chain issues, and 95% or more of our parts are available and we're able to build inventory. And that shows up in our WIP in raw material. And on finished goods, what's happening is we do have material -- or tools that are complete or nearly complete that are awaiting one part or close to being shipped to customers, and that inventory is also growing.

Applied Materials delivered a strong finish to our fiscal year with record quarterly performance. Throughout 2022, the company has demonstrated solid execution while navigating COVID-related restrictions, supply chain shortages and a challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment.
I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team and our suppliers who are doing everything possible to meet our customers' needs.
As this is our year-end call, I'll begin my prepared remarks with a quick review of our performance and progress over the past 12 months. I'll then give our latest outlook for 2023 before describing our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied.
After that, Brice will provide more color on our financial performance and key areas of operational focus. Like many others in the technology sector, our performance and priorities in 2022 have been shaped by an unprecedented set of challenges. Our top priority has been mitigating supply chain constraints that prevented us from fully meeting customer demand.
In Q4, we made incremental progress, and we expect to continue closing supply gaps over the next few quarters. As well as finding creative short-term solutions, our team has been addressing root causes and building a more resilient, scalable supply chain and stronger strategic relationships with our suppliers. In addition, we are strengthening our own manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management.
While I'm pleased with the recent improvements in supply chain performance, we are still supply chain limited across a number of key product lines and our backlog grew in Q4. The biggest supply constraints are in our metal deposition business, where customer demand is very strong. This is our largest business unit and where we have highly differentiated solutions for advanced foundry/logic and DRAM. The market for these products, which enable next-generation wiring, is expanding considerably.
In addition to supply shortages, we're also navigating a difficult geopolitical environment as reflected in the new export control regulations enacted by the U.S. government on October 7. These new rules are complex and cover a broad range of semiconductor technology that includes wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services. We have taken all the necessary actions to comply with these new rules, including suspending shipments and support where required.
We estimate that the unmitigated impact to our fiscal 2023 revenues could be up to $2.5 billion. We believe the actual impact can be reduced to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This will depend in part on how quickly the government provides licenses and approvals as well as how impacted companies refocus their investments.
We are also mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and softening consumer demand. To offset the inflationary cost increases we are facing, we are driving multiple initiatives that include reengineering our products and implementing price adjustments.
While it's too early to forecast 2023 with any precision, I can describe what we're currently seeing in the market and hearing from our customers. Starting with memory, spending is expected to be down year-on-year as weakness in consumer electronics and PCs prompts some customers to defer capacity additions.
In leading-edge foundry/logic, demand looks strong, with customers racing for leadership and driving major technology inflections that determine their relative competitive positions. In ICAPS, chips for the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets, demand is mixed.
Consumer-driven markets are clearly softer, while the automotive, industrial and power markets remain robust. Those investments are underpinned by large inflections, including the transition to electric vehicles, accelerated adoption of industrial automation and growing demand for renewable energy solutions, especially in Europe.
While all of this adds up to an expected pullback in overall wafer fab equipment spending next year, we believe that Applied's business will be more resilient than the underlying market for 3 key reasons: First, we have a significant backlog, the highest in our history, measured on both an absolute and percentage of revenue basis; second, demand for some of our most differentiated product lines where we have uniquely enabling technology remains much higher than our capacity to fulfill that demand; and third, our service business is positioned for steady growth with an increasingly large portion of this business being converted to subscriptions.
Over the past 12 months, our installed base of systems grew 8% and the number of tools under comprehensive long-term service contracts grew 16%. The renewal rate for these agreements is well over 90%, which demonstrates the value customers see in our subscription services. Looking further ahead, our long-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied Materials has not changed.
Semiconductors are the foundation of digital transformation that will touch almost every sector of the economy over the coming years. This puts the semiconductor industry on a path to a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade. And while every year will not be an up-year, the overall trajectory is clear.
We also like where Applied Materials plays within the ecosystem. As technology complexity is increasing, we expect equipment intensity to remain at today's levels or rise further. This means wafer fab equipment is likely to grow faster than the overall semiconductor market.
Within equipment spending, major technology inflections are enabled by materials engineering, shifting more dollars to Applied's available markets over time. We think about the industry's future road map in terms of power, performance, area cost and time to market.
The PPACt playbook has 5 pillars: new architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink and advanced packaging, with each pillar made up of multiple technology inflections. For example, new 3D structures like gate-all-around transistors and backside power distribution networks are materials engineering enabled inflections that grow Applied's total available market.
As I referenced earlier, wiring is a key bottleneck for chip performance and power at advanced nodes. And this is driving significant innovation in new materials. Between the 7- and 3-nanometer node, contact metallization steps are growing more than 50% and our total available market is expanding almost 80%.
For interconnect layers, process steps are being added even faster, and we expect our revenue opportunity to approximately triple through these node transitions. Advanced packaging represents a new era for integrated circuit design that opens major new vectors of innovation for chip designers.
Advanced packaging is also enabled by new materials engineering solutions. Although the industry is still in the early stages of adoption, we have already grown our packaging equipment business to nearly $1 billion. Our Process Diagnostics and Controls business also has broad exposure to these inflections and delivered significant growth in 2022. Our progress and opportunities in eBeam will be the focus of our December technology briefing.
Given our positive long-term view of the semiconductor market, the outsized opportunities for Applied Materials within the market and favorable global government incentives, we are making investments in R&D and infrastructure to support industry growth and position the company for future success.
We will provide more details about our specific plans in the coming months. At the same time, with the current macroeconomic conditions, we are carefully managing discretionary spending and limiting hiring to only strategic positions. Before I hand the call over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize.
Applied Materials ended the year strong with record performance. In the past quarter, we made incremental progress, overcoming the supply challenges that have constrained our performance in fiscal 2022. However, there is still work to do and our backlog continues to grow. We expect 2023 to be a down year for wafer fab equipment spending, but we believe that Applied's business will be more resilient, thanks to our large backlog, growing service business and strong customer demand for our leadership products that enable key technology inflections.
Longer-term secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor market by enabling the PPACt road map with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. We are making strategic investments for the future while slowing spending growth in the near term.
Now I'll hand over to Brice.",1325
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2022",2022-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3594.0,2713385.0,101812641.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. I'd like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping to further increase our output for our customers. On today's call, I'll summarize our results for the fiscal year and Q4 as well as provide our guidance for Q1. I'll also discuss the impact of recent U.S. export regulations on our revenue and gross margin.
Before going into the results, I'd like to make 3 points. First, despite a weaker customer demand outlook, we generated strong orders in Q4 and ended the year with record backlog, particularly in some of our leadership product areas. Combined with the resiliency of our AGS business, the strong backlog puts us in a good position to offset some of the market weakness expected next year.
Second, we have not changed our view of a $1 trillion semiconductor market by 2030 with a high single-digit CAGR for semiconductors and similar or faster growth for equipment due to added process complexity. We grew our headcount in R&D spending significantly in 2022 to develop new leadership products and further expand our broad portfolio. While we are slowing our spending growth in the current environment, we remain committed to research and development, enabling critical inflections that support our customers' road maps.
And third, we returned nearly $7 billion to shareholders this past year, including buybacks equivalent to 6% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period. With record demand and financial results in 2022, a strong growth opportunity through 2030 and our broad and unique portfolio of systems and services, we're confident in our financial position and our future.
Next, I'll summarize our fiscal year results. Although supply chain constraints impacted our output all year, we delivered record annual revenue and EPS. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased nearly 12% to $25.8 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased by around 90 basis points to 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating profit grew by over 7% to $7.86 billion.
Non-GAAP operating margin decreased by 120 basis points to 30.5%. And non-GAAP EPS increased nearly 13% to $7.70. We generated about $5.4 billion in operating cash flow this past year and over $4.6 billion in free cash flow. We returned 151% of free cash flow to shareholders, including $873 million in dividends and $6.1 billion in share repurchases.
Our cash returns for the past 3 years were equivalent to over 100% of free cash flow. In the year, demand for our products and services was very strong with record annual bookings in Semi systems and AGS. On a year-over-year basis, our total ending backlog increased 62% to $19 billion.
Our Semi systems backlog increased 90% to nearly $12.7 billion. We expect to reduce our Semi systems backlog as supply chain performance improves. Our AGS backlog increased 30% to over $5.6 billion. The strong AGS backlog reflects a large increase in long-term service agreements, which gives us confidence in the continued growth of this business.
Moving to our Q4 results. We delivered record quarterly net sales of nearly $6.75 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially to 46%. And non-GAAP OpEx grew 3.5% sequentially to nearly $1.1 billion, with most of the increase in R&D.
Turning to the segments. Semi systems revenue grew more than 6% sequentially to $5.04 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 36.9%.
AGS revenue was flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.42 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin declined to 28.3%. AGS key performance indicators continue to be positive with strong year-over-year growth in installed base systems, service intensity and subscription agreements. As a result, AGS continues to grow faster than the pace needed to achieve our long-term revenue targets.
Moving on to Display. Revenue declined as expected to $251 million. Segment non-GAAP operating margin also declined to 13.5%.
Turning to our cash flows. We generated $857 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 13% of revenue. We returned over $1.72 billion to shareholders, including $223 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in buybacks. We repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $88.05.
Next, I'll discuss the impact of the new U.S. export regulations to Applied Materials. We currently expect that the unmitigated revenue impact of the new rules could be up to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023. We continue to work through the regulatory requirements, including seeking licenses and approvals where appropriate.
We hope to reduce the revenue impact by between $500 million and $1 billion to a net impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We also expect the rules to reduce our non-GAAP gross margin by up to 1 percentage point. While this creates a headwind to meeting our gross margin targets for 2024, we remain committed to our goals and believe we can achieve and exceed them over time.
In Q4, the new rules reduced our semi systems' and AGS' revenue by approximately $280 million, which is in the range of our expectation on October 12. Inventory charges in Q4 were lower than our preliminary assessment. In Q1, we expect the new rules to reduce semi systems and AGS revenue by approximately $490 million combined and reduce our gross margin by around 1 percentage point, both on an unmitigated basis.
Now, I'll share our guidance for Q1. We expect revenue to be $6.7 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.93, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue to be about $5.15 billion, which is up nearly 13% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.33 billion, which is slightly up year-over-year.
Display revenue should be around $170 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.1%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 13%, which is up from 11.8% last year, primarily due to mandatory capitalization of R&D expenses effective in our new fiscal year.
Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to summarize our company's position in the current environment. We have record backlog, notably in the highly enabling technologies for next-generation nodes. Our supply chain and manufacturing output are incrementally improving. We expect our services business will continue to grow and generate strong recurring revenue and free cash flow. And the longer-term growth outlook for the semiconductor industry remains strong.
Applied is in a great position to invest in future growth and deliver strong profitability, free cash flow and shareholder returns. Now Mike, please begin the Q&A.",1088

And really, the question is, what changed between October 12 with your press release and then October 30, where it looks like there really wasn't much of an impact at all?
And then my -- I guess, real question is, as you think about calendar '23 WFE, it sounds like companies are providing kind of a top-down view that things for WFE are -- look weak and declining. However, every company bottoms up based on deferred revenues and backlogs are much more optimistic on the outlook. So can you kind of talk through the moving parts there? And what kind of range or outcome you see today for year-over-year silicon declines in calendar '23?",124
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2022",2022-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3594.0,2713385.0,101812645.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,7,"Sure. C. J., it's Brice. I'll start on this one. So relative to the preannouncement that we did, we talked about a $400 million impact, plus or minus $150 million for the China trade change. And then as we work through it, that impact ended up being less, around $280 million. And it's just estimating the transactional elements at the end of the quarter. It was an initial element -- estimate, so we did a little bit better from that perspective.
The other thing that really happened was execution in the end of the quarter was almost flawless from a logistics perspective. We got more supply chain parts in at the end of the quarter. And so over $200 million of good news from an execution and delivery perspective, finishing product and completions in the field. So it was really those 2 things. It was little bit better than our initial estimate, and execution was excellent in the last couple of weeks of the quarter.
And then on '23 -- the WFE question for '23, we think that it's preliminary. It's too early to give an estimate of '23. So what we're trying to share is what we're seeing in our order patterns and in our business for Q1 and Q2. We talked about -- in the script, how in Q1 -- or in our bookings for Q4, they were really solid. We did see pushouts. We did see weakness in the memory business, but our backlog has grown to a record level of backlog.
So when we think about our Q1 and Q2, we're still supply constrained. We still have a number of different equipment lines that we have significant backlog. We're trying to catch up the customer orders. And so the signals to us really are that we have to work on supply chain, work on improving our output and work on catching up with our customers. So beyond that, we're just not able to make a call yet on WFE for '23.",335
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2022",2022-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3594.0,2713385.0,101812646.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,8,"Yes. C. J., this is Gary. As Brice said, the -- we can certainly give a perspective on our business. We're not going to guide on overall WFE for '23. But we're in a very strong position. If you look at the kind of profile of the business, it's more weighted towards foundry/logic versus memory. And we have some very strong products where we have significant backlog, and we're still working to close the supply-demand gaps in those areas.
So from Applied's standpoint, as you know, it's all about the race for power and performance for all of our customers, and we're really well positioned with leading products and those big inflections. And again, our #1 focus is on closing the supply chain gaps.",124

So you gave the numbers, $2.5 billion, and hoping to bring that down to like $1.5 billion. But I gathered a big element of that was getting licenses.
Where do you expect those licenses to be gotten? Is that only to the multinational? Do you guys expect licenses to be given to some of the Chinese folks? I mean, how -- what -- how could that happen? What is the mechanism by which you come in at the unmitigated number versus the -- come in at the mitigated number versus the unmitigated number?",106

Yes, and it's important probably to say that this unmitigated versus mitigated, it has everything to do with the impact to the China shipments and Chinese customers. In other words, it's not referring to whether we can ship a product we are making for those customers to non-China customers.
So the unmitigated, the way we calculated this is we looked at the orders that we have for the affected customers, and that's what you see as the total, $2.5 billion. In order to mitigate that...",88

And so the way we looked at that, there are some customers that we're trying to clarify that we can apply for licenses for or we can get authorizations for once they establish that their technology is within the guidelines.
So we have a process to do that. And on the other side, we expect some customers may decide to change their plan or change their technology, so it does not go above the threshold that's affected by the rules at this point.
So it's really those 2 elements that we'll be able to clarify that some customers were able to ship with or ship to or some customers changing their plans on the technology side that would allow them to qualify for shipments.",125

I thought, Brice, you said somewhere that you provided some look for Q2. I don't think I caught that. And then several of your memory customers that said that their spending could be down over 50% next year. Recently, Micron said it could be down even more than that.
Have you noticed almost a 50% cancellation of orders from them? Because I'm just trying to reconcile your commentary that sounds outside of China, of course, more benign and more supportive versus just the very horrific guidance that your memory customers are providing.
I understand you're less exposed to memory versus foundry/logic, but still, it's a reasonable size exposure. So I'm curious, has that 50% cut in CapEx translated to any reduction in your backlog or any change in your thinking about memory for next year?",140

Thanks, Vivek. So we're not giving a guide for Q2. We are highlighting the record backlog and the fact that we're constrained and the fact that in several equipment lines, we're behind on customer orders. So we're going to try to increase output. And I'd say that comment is true for both Q1 and Q2. So that's as much shaping as we're providing for Q2.
On the memory side, just to kind of click back and think about the overall demand environment, we positioned last quarter that we had a significant amount of more demand than we have the ability to supply for '23. What did happen during the course of this quarter is there is a significant amount of pushouts and reductions in that demand. Now you can see the end result. 
We still had solid bookings in Q4. We still -- we created a record backlog that's now disclosed. So I would say that some of those pushouts and some of those reductions were definitely in the memory space. And I wouldn't -- I'm not going to characterize what percentage it was, but I would say that that's the most affected area in the business in terms of pushouts and reductions for '23.",206

If I look at where we're at today, those are some of the areas that -- where we have significant backlog. MDP and implant in FY '23 are very, very strong for us. Those are areas where we have significant demand from customers. And ICAPS is similar in that to the -- all of the rest of our business.
This is always a race for all of these customers relative to power, performance and cost. And ICAPS is really materials enabled. We have a really strong team there. We have a great pipeline of products. I will guarantee you every year will not be up. That's for sure.

It seems like the consensus for WFE this year is somewhere in the $65 billion to $75 billion range. And I'm not asking you to give a guidance or an outlook for next year. But I'm wondering in the scenario where that is proven to be too cautious of an outlook for next year, based on the conversations that you have with your customers, would you say that, that would be because lead times are long and customers just -- they don't want to cancel orders or there's new secular drivers, like bigger chips or advanced packaging or trailing-node, like some of the things you've talked about or just competition at the leading-edge is driving people to invest more, enabled by subsidies?

So all of our customers in any of these different markets, the technology is moving very, very quickly. So they're all racing against each other for power, performance cost, their relative competitive position. So certainly, as you mentioned in the leading-edge foundry/logic, there's a tremendous amount of focus there, high-performance computing in a number of those different markets.
And again, for Applied, what we've talked about is real strength in enabling new structures that are critical to competitive positions for our customers. Gate-all-around is an incremental $1 billion for Applied for 100,000 wafer starts more than what we're currently capturing with FinFET. We're on path to gain 5 points of share in the transition from FinFET to gate-all-around.
Wiring is probably the #1 focus, and I don't know that everyone really understands how important that inflection is for our customers. That's an area where we have tremendous strength. We're enabling a 50% reduction in wiring resistance with integrated platforms that combine many technologies together. So that's another one where, Applied is really well positioned.
Packaging has grown for Applied to nearly $1 billion, and we have over 50% share in the broad -- in our served market. And we have, by far, the broadest position in advanced packaging, and we're still in the early innings of that inflection. But again, that's all part of this technology race for all of our customers.
ICAPS. I mentioned that earlier on the call. Those are also markets where I think it's surprising to people, including you've seen some of our peers talking about ICAPS growth over a longer period of time. There are technology inflections there. And that's, as I mentioned earlier, metal deposition, implant, those are areas where we're very, very -- in very strong enabling positions with our customers.
I think the other thing for Applied, beyond all of these different areas, high-speed DRAM with logic-like structures, all of those big inflections, our PDC business grew, I think, it was 67% in FY '21. We're up around 35% in FY '22. That business is also outperforming, and we think that will continue to outperform as we go forward. So at least from an Applied standpoint, it's really all around those big inflections and how we're positioned for those major inflections. So I don't know if Brice, if you want to add anything?",397

Atif, I'll start. This is Brice. I think on the China side, when we look at that impact, the larger part of the business has been on the trailing nodes for us, and we expect that to still be a very strong business for Applied. And we see that in both the factory projects that we monitor and also in the different end markets where there's investments.
And then on the leading-edge, if it's a question of do we expect that demand to be taken away from WFE demand globally and permanently, we don't. It will either be satisfied in some way in China, either by multinationals or in some other way or it'll move to another geography.
So we don't believe that, that will be an impact. And just circling back around, I would just focus on over time, we expect the China market to be a strong grower, especially in the ICAPS mature node space.",158

Obviously, it's been a very steady grower for you guys and for the overall industry. Many of your leading-edge memory customers and logic and foundry customers, I believe, are in the process of cutting wafer starts potentially over the next couple of quarters.
So I guess the question is, when you cite services as one of the reasons why you'll outperform next year, is the baseline assumption that business continues to grow given the installed base growth and given how you transform the mix of that business? Or could it be down [indiscernible]?",109
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2022",2022-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3594.0,2713385.0,101812678.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,40,"Thanks, Toshi. Yes. A couple of drivers here. You'll see in our outlook for Q1 that we have a down quarter for AGS, which is unusual. And the reason is we've got a full quarter impact, approximately $100 million for the reduction of the China customers that we won't be able to serve for the rest of the year.
So that's definitely a headwind in Q1. But you hit the nail on the head with respect to the dynamics thereafter. Every time we ship a tool, it grows our installed base of equipment. We grew the installed base 8% last year. Beyond -- or after that, our ability to provide services and put those services on subscription agreements, we typically outgrow the installed base than we did last year.
So that is the driver for the reason the services business is sticky. We have more equipment to serve. The equipment becomes more intensive in terms of service needs. And over time, that grows the business. Now to your point, a portion of the business is transactional. We do see lower utilization this quarter and next quarter.
What we would point to -- what we have pointed to is, even in '19, where there was lower utilization, we still grew the services business. And besides the headwind of China that I pointed out, we expect that to be the dynamic this year and going forward.",234

I'll add a little bit more color. So we do expect services to be up in '23. The -- as Brice mentioned, transactional will be down based on capacity utilization. But our profile, with a significant amount of our service and spares business being agreements gives us stickiness going forward. And that is continuing to increase the comprehensive agreements up 16% last year.
The tenure of our agreements, the length of the agreements are up to 2.6 years, renewal rates at 93%. So we're -- and it was an interesting thing through the -- all of the chip shortage period of time, we were able to demonstrate value for customers with ramp services to accelerate chip output, managed part services so that people could increase tool availability and output, managed services for yield and optimizing productivity.
So all of that helped us position our service business in a higher value for our customers. And again, that's what gives us the ability to continue to grow into '23. And then the longer-term model, we've communicated is double-digit growth, and we still have high confidence we'll achieve that.",190

So looking back on fiscal '22, your semi systems operating margin declined about 200 basis points on strong revenue growth, obviously due to the inflationary cost pressures. But your AGS business sustained near-record operating margins at 30%. So I guess how has the team been able to sustain the record or near-record AGS operating profitability in this inflationary environment?
And more importantly, in a down year or potential down year next year, you guys talked last call, this call, on sustainability of AGS from a revenue perspective. How should we think about the sustainability of operating margins for AGS?",104

Harlan, it's -- thank you. So one thing I would call out is we did have lower gross margins and operating margins in Q4, and that's largely due to looking at the specific inventory we had for China customers that will have to either reposition or move somewhere else or scrap. But to your point on operating profit, one of the plans the business has there is to improve the amount of repair that we do for products that we bring back to customers.
And so that helps us lower the cost and cost of goods sold with customers. And that's one of the ways that we improve our gross margins and the ultimate profit of that business. The other is just increased efficiency. As we demonstrate more and more capability with the customers, and we provide more services with the same spending profile, then that helps us maintain the profitability. Those are the 2 key drivers.",158

So two things. And it depends on which time period you look at. But if we look forward, the gross margin impact is really that they're generally smaller customers. So the profitability of those customers for Applied is higher.
And when we talk about mitigation, as we go forward, it's going to be TBD as to who we sell that product to and what the profitability is. So at this point, we're expecting the impact that we described. And if you look at the current quarter, we did have specific inventory for customers that's unique. We are working to qualify some of that inventory, and we were successful to a degree, but we did have specific inventory that we had to take a demand reserve on.",127

So we're exiting this year at 15.5%, and you were saying that through 2030, you think WFE is going to grow faster than semiconductors. You've certainly been beating that drum now for a while that WFE intensity is going to keep going up.
And obviously, there are some underlying upward pressures. But China has obviously been ordering tools and building capacity well ahead of demand now, in part due to the fear of these bans. So if China becomes a little more of a lagging tier region, wouldn't that lower WFE intensity a bit and maybe argue that maybe it has to reset a bit?",113

So we do think intensity is gradually increasing and it's because of the reasons Gary described. A lot of the steps in the process are becoming more complex and require more equipment, and we see that.
And then when we think about China and ICAPS specifically, in the past, there's been a lot of reuse of existing fabs and existing process tools. And that allowed for a low intensity. And that's not been what's happening in the past few years and with recent additions.
We've talked about the number of factory projects that we see. So as capacity gets added, even in the ICAPS space, what you see is an intensity level that's more like what we were experiencing on the leading-edge just a few years ago. And that's also serving to raise the overall average of intensity. So we're pretty confident that intensity will continue to rise.",171

And during that time period, there were many factories and tools that came on the market, all of that stuff is gone. So that's what Brice was referring to relative to ICAPS capital intensities.
And then if you look at all of the -- I went through a list of key inflections -- technology inflections for customers and I gave some color around wiring and the number of steps that are increasing. That's what we're seeing really in all of the different segments of the business. So I think that capital intensity is probably the right ZIP code if we look through 2030.",130

And I also want to ask about -- I assume your served addressable market will continue to expand, but maybe help us understand how much would that grow.",98

Sidney, thanks for the question. So if you look at what our customers are talking about relative to their road maps, really, there are 5 big drivers of the technologies going forward, workload-specific architectures. There are new structures, new materials, new ways to shrink, new advanced packaging inflections for our customers. And so what we see, if you look at the advanced foundry/logic road map, you see a tremendous focus on new structures and new materials.
The transistor innovations around gate-all-around are essential relative to power and performance. Wiring, I talked a lot about wiring. Our largest business is metal deposition, and the wires are getting thinner and resistance goes up. So you're seeing more dollars moving in that direction.
Advanced packaging is an area where we see -- for sure, that's another big -- 1 of the big 5 drivers for the road maps for our customers. And that's still in the early innings around $1 billion business for us today, over 50% served market for the areas we participate. And so we see that one.
That's an area that will attract a tremendous amount of investment. And relative to competition between customers is very, very important. In memory, you certainly see material scaling in 3D NAND as customers are moving to more layers or other ways to include logic and memory together through different technology inflections. DRAM is moving to high speed. And so you have high-K metal gate and logic-like structures there.
So a lot of that investment is moving more towards materials-enabled technologies, and that's where Applied has really a tremendous strength. I don't know, Brice, if you want to add anything there?",278

And so you described there, I think, like 3 reasons why capital intensity -- I mean, 2 reasons why capital intensity is very high there, I mean, higher than in the past.
The first one is that there is no innovation going on, so like -- that drives capital intensity up. And then you mentioned the fact that there used to be like a secondhand market that was [ filling ] the trailing edge that is kind of going away.
And my question is there must be also a third element that justifies a very high capital intensity today, which is that we've been growing capacity very, very fast this year than last year.
And there is a significant chance that the capacity growth is at some point going to slow down or even to pause. And so I'd like to hear your thoughts about that and maybe your sense of how much it could impact in the shorter-term capital intensity.",185

Thanks for the question. So I will say that we're 100% certain that all of these markets will not be up every year. But what we do see, if you think about pick a number, in terms of edge computing devices by 2030, these technologies are becoming much, much more pervasive. They're really -- if you think about industrial automation or gas to smart electric vehicles, a number of different inflections, a lot of these ICAPS technologies are going to grow at a fair compound annual growth rate.
And I think that's what other people are seeing also. So how that -- what the shape of that looks like every single year, we're not going to forecast that. But we do think that, that business is going to see healthy growth. And that's why also we formed the ICAPS organization 3 years ago. We saw that, that market was going to be significant from a growth perspective and pulled together all of our different technologies.
So again, if I look across all of those segments within ICAPS, we think over the longer term, there will be significant compound annual growth rates. We have very, very strong positions in enabling some of those technology inflections in ICAPS, but we're not going to give a specific profile on a year-by-year basis.",223

Thanks, David. We're expecting it's going to take us more than 2 quarters. So depending on the line of equipment, I would say between 2 and 4 quarters is our internal estimate. And so -- that's what we're focused on. We are behind with the customers, and we're working on increasing output every week. Thanks for the question.",59

Clearly, there are questions about the market in the near term. But for our part, we had healthy Q4 orders, and we have record backlog that we described, and it's mostly in our leadership product areas that drive the big technology inflections. Job 1 for us is increasing our output to meet customer demand.
We're in a strong financial position to continue to develop our broad portfolio of technology and to drive the critical inflections and to support, eventually, a $1 trillion semiconductor market.
I hope we get to see many of you at the upcoming Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo conferences. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Mike, let's close it up.",122
