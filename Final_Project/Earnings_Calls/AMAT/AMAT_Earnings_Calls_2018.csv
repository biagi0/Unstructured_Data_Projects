251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2018",2018-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3291.0,1393130.0,55597106.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report another record quarter for Applied, with revenue up nearly 30% from the same period last year. 2018 already looks like another great year, and we expect each of our 3 major business segments to deliver strong double-digit growth. 
We have tremendous momentum across the company and we are confident this momentum is sustainable for 2 reasons. First, we see an expanding set of market drivers as more and more industries are disrupted by emerging technologies. From retail to entertainment, health care, manufacturing and transportation, the way companies create value and compete increasingly depends on their ability to capture, store and understand huge amounts of data. The overall market for electronics is increasing, and as those electronics get smarter, semiconductor and display content grows even faster. 
Second, Applied is in a great position to outpace our markets. We are turning our investments into a strong pipeline of differentiated products, and we are using our broad set of capabilities to bring highly enabling new technologies to market faster than ever before. 
In today's call, I'll talk about the major trends driving sustainable growth in our markets. I'll describe our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for our businesses. Then Dan will provide details about our financial execution and capital allocation, which reflects our increasing confidence in the sustainability of our markets. 
This is an incredibly exciting time in the electronics industry because we are at the start of a new era of growth. The Internet of Things, Big Data and artificial intelligence will transform the economy over the next decade. As a result, a broad spectrum of companies are making substantial investments in these technologies to position themselves for the future. These large, powerful trends are already driving a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors and displays. 
While these are only the early stages of AI and Big Data, there are already applications that have significant traction and are starting to scale. The first example is AI natural language processing, which is being integrated into more devices and driving silicon content at the edge and in the cloud. 
Voice assistants are fast becoming the hub for home automation. A typical voice assistant has around 30 chips and a total of 200 square millimeters of silicon. That's about twice the area of a smartphone application processor. Language processing is compute-intensive, and the leading companies are building dedicated data centers to support it. These AI workloads require new server architectures that have up to 8x more logic and 4x more memory content by area than traditional enterprise servers. 
Another important AI trend for 2018 is neural processing units in smartphones. This is a great example of AI at the edge, where machine learning is used to enable a phone's camera to identify and react to what it's seeing. 
The third example is self-driving cars. It's reported that $80 billion has already been invested as technology companies and traditional automakers race to get level 4 vehicles to market. We believe level 4 vehicles will have approximately 8x more silicon content than a standard car has today. 
These powerful emerging trends layer on top of traditional demand drivers, such as smartphones, data centers and storage, which continue to evolve and grow. We see leading cloud service providers announcing significant increases in their capital investments to expand data center capacity. 
To keep pace with the explosion of data generation, the storage market is growing rapidly and NAND is taking a larger share. Recent data suggests that NAND will grow from 18% to about 30% of the total data storage market in the next 3 years. And while smartphone unit growth is relatively flat, the value of the silicon content in smartphones grew more than 30% in 2017. 
All these demand drivers add up to a very positive outlook for Applied's served markets. In semiconductor, market fundamentals are strong, and we see disciplined investments in capacity and technology across a broadening customer base. Based on the timing of customer projects, we expect DRAM and logic spending to be higher in 2018, while the overall mix between foundry logic and memory investments will be similar to 2017. 
We see a steady ramp of spending in China, which is positive for Applied because of our strong and growing market share and high service penetration at both multinational and domestic manufacturers. 
At the end of last year, we expected total wafer fab equipment spending in 2017 and 2018 combined would be more than $90 billion. As we look further ahead, we believe combined spending in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. While it's too early to comment on timing of that spending, we believe the overall trend line is clear. 
In display, there are 2 equally large market inflections driving capital investments: the introduction of Gen 10.5 substrates for TV manufacturing and organic LED displays. In mobile, the transition to OLED displays is compelling. This is because rigid OLED offers significant performance, power and cost advantages over LCD, and flexible OLED will enable new form factors, such as curved and eventually foldable screens. As a result, our positive outlook for 2018 and beyond remains unchanged. Display is a unique growth driver for Applied, and we expect to increase our revenue by more than 30% in 2018 on top of nearly 60% growth last year. 
At Applied, our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we have aligned our investments and our organization around this vision. It is increasingly clear that the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio is an important source of differentiation because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place. We are in a unique position to help customers accelerate their time to market, which is tremendously valuable to them. 
Against this backdrop, I'll now provide updates for each of our business segments. In calendar 2017, we grew our semiconductor process equipment business more than 40% and our inspection and metrology business more than 10%. 
We expect to grow faster than these markets in 2018 and beyond with 3 major growth drivers. First, in areas where we're traditionally strong, we are extending our leadership. Our leadership products create the materials that determine the power, efficiency and performance of devices. To drive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing and AI, customers are increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures. This is translating to significant growth in areas like PVD, where we grew revenues about $800 million in 2017. 
Second, we're focused on capturing more share in markets where we have room to grow, specifically patterning, inspection and metrology. In patterning, we are providing materials-enabled solutions to customers' 3 most significant scaling challenges: resolution, the 2-dimensional geometric shrinking of a device's features; 3D scaling, ways to increase transistor or memory cell density; and increasingly important, placement, which is the vertical alignment between the layers of a device. By focusing on these key areas, we are on track to generate over $1 billion of patterning revenue in 2018. And regardless of the EUV adoption, we expect our patterning opportunity to grow considerably over the next several years.
Management of placement errors is also a driver for accelerated adoption of our e-beam inspection technologies. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection and metrology market, and we're on track to grow significantly faster than the market in 2018. 
Third, we are finding new ways to combine our innovative technologies in materials deposition, materials removal, materials modification and materials analysis. Based on these capabilities, the pull from our customers for earlier and deeper collaborations is stronger than ever, and we're working with them to develop new solutions that accelerate their technology road maps and expand Applied's market opportunities. 
In service, on a year-on-year basis, we have grown revenues every quarter since the end of 2013. And we're confident we can continue to grow at least 15% per year. This sustainable growth is driven by: a growing installed base; an increasing number of tools under long-term service agreements; and advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. With record performance in the first quarter, 2018 is off to a great start. And we're confident we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses. We see sustainable strength in our markets as new demand drivers, including IoT, Big Data and AI, layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. Applied is uniquely positioned to outperform our markets as we enable customers to accelerate their device road maps using our broad portfolio of products and capabilities. 
Now Dan will give his perspective on our financial execution and outlook as well as provide additional color on our capital allocation.",1492
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2018",2018-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3291.0,1393130.0,55597107.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. I'd like to begin by sharing some of my observations about the environment Gary described and discuss how we plan to allocate the company's capital as a result. 
The semiconductor industry is fueling a new data economy and today, we're already seeing record semiconductor industry revenue of over $400 billion. We're excited about the Internet of things and artificial intelligence, and we believe this next era of computing will be built out over the next decade or more. 
Of course, nobody can guarantee that the growth will follow a straight line, but the future we envision is nondiscretionary to the world's largest industries, and semiconductor process technology and systems are at the foundation. All of the leading indicators of our equipment business are positive, and Gary shared that we see strength in 2018 and 2019. 
I believe WFE spending is going to remain significantly higher and less cyclical than it was during the PC era, which many people still identify with. 
Consider these facts: 300-millimeter technology arrived in the year 2000 and gave customers 2.3x the number of chips for every wafer. While semiconductor revenue grew, equipment spending actually declined between 2000 and 2013 as WFE intensity dropped from a peak of 17% to a low of 9% over that same time period. 
But from 2013 to 2017, while semiconductor sales grew, wafer fab equipment grew even faster, and WFE intensity ticked higher to 12%. With technology getting more complex, I think it's hard to imagine WFE intensity drifting much lower. 
So consider what happens if the semiconductor industry grows from today's levels at a modest 5% pace as multiple forecasts predict. Then if WFE intensity stays flat at 12%, WFE investments of $50 billion or more should not be considered unusual in the near term, and spending could potentially reach $75 billion by the middle of the next decade. 
We'll leave forecasting to others. The point I want to make is that demand is much broader today than during the PC era. WFE intensity has stabilized, and the industry is likely to be a lot more attractive in the years ahead. So the future looks bright, especially for Applied Materials because we have a growing semi business, a growing services business and a unique growth opportunity in display. I believe Applied Materials will become larger and more profitable and generate significantly more free cash flow than we do today. 
Against this backdrop, here is how we plan to deploy the company's capital going forward. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in the growth of the business with an emphasis on organic growth. We will continue to invest with discipline. This means every dollar of R&D is tied to an attractive margin target, and we will continue to look every quarter for opportunities to shift money from lower-return areas to high-return areas before increasing R&D. We will also stay laser-focused on maintaining G&A efficiency. 
Our second priority is to maintain a robust and flexible balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. 
Our third priority is to return excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, since 2000, Applied has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. And today, we're announcing a change in the dividend policy. We've said that our markets are bigger and less volatile, which gives us the opportunity to pay higher dividends. Applied's Board of Directors has approved a 100% increase in the quarterly cash dividend and declared the first $0.20 quarterly dividend will be payable in June. We'll review our distribution practices on a regular basis and evaluate further dividend increases as we continue to grow the business. 
At the same time, we strongly believe in the future growth and value creation of the company. Accordingly, the board has also increased our buyback authorization by $6 billion. Combined with more than $2.8 billion remaining from the previous authorization, we have a significant opportunity to increase shareholder value through buybacks. We plan to be opportunistic, repurchasing more shares when we believe they are significantly undervalued. 
Next, I'll discuss the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, which is beneficial to Applied because it gives us greater flexibility in how we deploy future profits to serve our customers, grow the company and return capital to our shareholders. 
With freer access to profits generated offshore, we now have greater flexibility to invest within the U.S., where we do much of our advanced technology development and manufacturing. This year, we plan to add new engineering jobs in the U.S. and invest in new labs and office space to support our growth objectives. 
In Q1, the new tax legislation resulted in a onetime repatriation tax of about $1 billion. As you may know, the tax amount is payable over 8 years and the payments are significantly back-end weighted. Because of this onetime repatriation tax, Applied's GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 88.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 6.3% for Q1, and we're using a 6.5% tax rate in our planning for the rest of fiscal 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 12%. This increase reflects a minimum tax on foreign income that becomes effective next year. 
Now I'll comment on our financial execution in Q1. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.06 or $1.02 when excluding a $0.04 tax benefit. On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 1.3 points, reduced OpEx as a percent of sales by 2.3 points and grew operating margin by 3.6 points. 
Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and services. In semi equipment, we grew revenue by 32% year-on-year and delivered the highest operating margin in over 7 years. I'm particularly impressed with the growth of our services business. AGS grew revenue by 30% year-on-year, which was above our expectation, mainly due to higher-than-expected spare parts demand. AGS is also delivered record operating margin. 
In display, revenue and operating margin were both lower sequentially, following a record Q4, which we anticipated due to lumpiness of the business. We expect display revenue and operating margin to trend higher in the balance of the year. 
Now I'll share our business outlook for Q2. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.55 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 26% year-over-year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue and services revenue to both increase by about 23% year-over-year. And our display revenue should increase by about 48% year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be approximately flat sequentially. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $755 million, plus or minus $10 million. At the midpoint, OpEx would be approximately 17% of revenue, down 1.4 points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.14, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 44% year-over-year. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.",1191

Thanks, Atif. Just overall, again, in '18, we're still seeing 30% -- greater than 30% growth. And 2019 and beyond also look very strong. If we look at '18, mobile versus TV, your question, it's about 50-50 mix. In TV, we see increased adoption of larger screen. We're tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. And also, a great example here is on 65-inch TVs. If you produce them with Gen 10.5, you have 8 65-inch TVs, only 3 with Gen 8.5. So that's driving the TV business. OLED is the other half of our business in '18, and we still see very strong opportunity in OLED. Previously, we had one customer that was more than 50% of the business. Now greater than 50% of the business is coming from multiple customers. We talked about 10 customers in OLED. And the transition to OLED displays is really compelling. Rigid OLED gives you better performance, faster refresh rates, power, cost advantages over LCD. Flexible OLED gives you new form factors, such as curved displays and eventually foldable screens. So again, we're on track for greater than 30% growth in 2018 and on track with our longer-term model.",195

From a capital allocation standpoint, the company's got a great history. Since 2000, the company has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow back to shareholders. As part of this announcement, we're changing the mix a bit. We're going to increase our dividend by 100%. We've also announced a $6 billion share repurchase, when combined with the $2.8 billion that was outstanding from the prior authorization, gives us an opportunity to opportunistically be in the market to drive even more value for shareholders.

It is foundational to the companies' competitiveness. It's difficult to unpack those macro trends and slice them by WFE to see what part of WFE specifically report -- supports each trend. What we see is a noticeably larger end market. We see strength across all device types, whether it's logic foundry, whether it's memory. And within logic foundry, we see strength in both end markets. Within memory, we see strength in both NAND and DRAM. So we're really encouraged by the breadth of the strength we're seeing, and we think it bodes well for the market.

And this goes back to your previous answer, but if I used net income as a proxy for free cash flow, this calendar year, you guys are going to be generating about $4 billion in free cash flow. So the dividend increase you guys announced today is going to consume about 20% of that free cash flow. I guess, the question is, is the team committed over a multiyear period [ to its ] 90% free cash flow return, which would imply, at least for this year, about $3.2 billion in repurchase activity? And the reason why I ask this is that many semi companies and some of your peers are articulating capital return as a percent of free cash flow. So I guess the question is, 90% of free cash flow, is that how we should think about the capital return commitment from the team on a go-forward basis?",160

Let me see if I can add a little more color on this to try to be helpful. I would look at the 90% historical number as a mindset of this management team, as a mindset of Applied Materials, to be committed to getting cash back in the hands of shareholders. We're going to remain committed to that going forward. I don't think what you will see from ours is a formulaic approach to. From a dividend standpoint, we made a big move on the dividend. We are going to continue to look at the performance of the business and the way we grow the business and review that policy on a periodic basis and look to grow our dividend as we grow the business. We're going to complement that the way we have historically, by being -- aggressive repurchases of our shares when we feel intrinsic value is not fully reflected in the trading price of our stock. And we're going to continue to do that. So rather than be formulaic, I think we're going to look to be opportunistic with the repurchase, committed to the dividend, committed to reviewing that policy over time as we grow the business.

So how should we think about potential upside from there going forward?",70
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2018",2018-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3291.0,1393130.0,55597123.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,19,"Thanks, Toshiya. So the company's got a really good track record over the last 4 years. The last 4 years, we've improved gross margin by 5 points. We've also articulated a model that says we're going to capture about 70 basis points of material cost of sales savings each year as we drive the business forward. That model still holds. But that's assuming a constant mix. You rightfully point out that we're going to have composition of our business, the mix composition of our business that's going to create a bit of a headwind and mask some of that fundamental progress. So to see a quarter where we see strong sequential growth in display and have us hold the gross margin flat, I think is a reflection of all the hard work that's going on behind the scenes to continue to drive the profitability of the company. What I would say is, is our long-term model, we'd like to articulate a long-term model once a year during our Analyst Day and resist the temptation to update it along the way. What I would say is, is that we're going to be aggressive about looking for opportunities to do better than what we've advertised in our long-term model. And where we see opportunities, we will pursue it aggressively and make sure we're delivering as much value as possible for shareholders. Given the mix of businesses and the growth profile going forward, we'd like to stay consistent with our 47% gross margin out into the 2020 time frame. And if we have an update, we'll review it in the fall at our Analyst Day.",272

And how much is memory versus foundry logic? And is there a level where you start to feel like you start to worry about supply growth being too high? Or just how are you guys are thinking about these levels because they keep kind of ratcheting higher?",90
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2018",2018-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3291.0,1393130.0,55597126.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,22,"Thanks, Joe. So from -- implicit in the question is a framing that says we're ratcheting our estimates higher. What I would say is, is we're extending the range of our forecast out into 2019 time frame. And we feel really good about our end markets. What we're encouraged by is driven by 3 primary reasons. Macro trends, diversification of our demand drivers is the first; second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that's all device types; and the third, customers are very, very healthy right now. So just double-clicking on each of those 3 elements. We've got macro trends shaping how we live our lives right now. We've been thinking about it for a while, I think probably back in the 2016 time frame at our Analyst Day. Artificial intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, these are playing out. We view these trends are real. They're making an impact. Demand for silicon is going up. Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling each of these trends. Content in data centers is going up, content in edge devices is going up, and we're -- again, we're seeing strength across all device types. So the macro trends are incredibly favorable. As we look at capital intensity, capital intensity is up across the board. In 7 -- in foundry, 7-nanometer is up 100% over 28-nanometer. Memory, both NAND and DRAM, is up between 40% and 60% over that same time period. Foundry is 3x more capital-intensive than the memory market. And we used to have wafer size transitions where you would get 2.3x the number of chips per wafer, for instance, when you go from 200- to 300-millimeter. The last transition was at -- in the year 2000. WFE intensity went from 17% in that year to a low of 9% in 2013, when all of the efficiency gains of that transition were absorbed. And from 2013 to today, we've seen it trend up from that 9% to 12%. And we don't have another wafer size transition on the horizon, so we feel really good about the capital intensity that underpins our markets. And I guess, the third thing, customers are healthy. They're investing a lot of money to drive this growth into the semiconductor industry, but they're also making a lot of money. Their WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA is down. In 2012 to 2018, the 3 largest memory providers and the 3 largest foundry logic providers are all down 60% WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA. So we're really encouraged by what we see. Macros -- macro is good, markets are good and customers are profitable. We think it's a really healthy market, and we're encouraged by it.",456

A lot of it is due to the industry transition to 3D NAND and your ability to introduce some of the new products for that product. At the same time, we're seeing now the industry transition on the logic side to 10- and 7-nanometers. Can you discuss some of the opportunities there? And maybe some of the share gain potential you have as that segment of the market makes a pretty sizable transition?",99
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2018",2018-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3291.0,1393130.0,55597129.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,25,"Sure, Patrick. Let me first start kind of big picture and then I'll cover the question on the -- that you asked. So in '17, we grew process equipment more than 40%. PDC grew about 10%. Now if you look back over the last 3 years, 2014 to 2017, process equipment grew much faster than the PDC market. And we see that playing out in '18 and probably in future years also. But again, process equipment, very, very strong growth. And as you said, very strong balance for us. It used to be that if it was a good foundry year, Applied would do well and not as well on the memory years. We've increased our share of memory about 7% over the last few years of total spending. So in '17, we had very balanced share in all the different segments, device segments, around 20% or more in all of those different segments. And then what we're looking for, 2018, is strong double-digit growth in our leadership businesses, in our growth businesses and also in PDC. PDC, we have new capabilities, new products that will increase our growth a fair amount above what we accomplished in 2017. In foundry, there really are 2 big drivers. And one of those drivers is in the trailing geometries. There was question earlier about AI and what's driving AI. Well, you really have data generation, many, many smart devices, data storage, and then you have the high-performance computing to process the information. So if you look at the trailing geometries, China is increasing investment in 2018 a fair amount, both with domestic and global companies. We have a great position in China, that's one of our highest share positions in semiconductor and display. And we expect that we'll outgrow the market in China in 2018. Patterning is a great opportunity for us. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning over the last few years. If we look forward, patterning in 2020 will be about a $5 billion TAM. We anticipate that we can add another $1 billion approximately in revenue over the next 4 years in patterning. And then if you look at scaling challenges. Scaling, you have different drivers. One is resolution, 2-dimensional shrinking of features. There, multi-patterning is growing. 80% of layers are multi-patterning, those are growing, and that's a great opportunity for Applied Materials. 3D scaling certainly happened in 2D to 3D NAND, but also see that in logic. The contact over active gate is one example where you see that, and that's also materials-enabled scaling for customers. And certainly, you see that in high-performance computing and advanced foundry and logic. And then another big industry challenge where we're in a great position, one of the biggest challenges for our customers is pattern placement, the alignment of one layer to the next, edge placement errors. And there was a conference in early January, 2 of the top technologists from leading companies talked about edge placement errors being one of the biggest industry challenges. And what they said was that materials is the key driver for solutions to pattern placement. And if you look at our position with all of the selective technologies we have and materials technologies we have, we're in a very strong position to grow, especially in foundry, as they move to these -- foundry and logic, as they move to these new technologies. So again, overall '17, we grew over 40% in process equipment. We see strong double-digit growth in all of our segments: leadership, growth, PDC. And the other thing I would say that we're seeing tremendous pull from customers is accelerating their road map. If they can bring those high-performance computing or AI chips to market faster, that's worth a tremendous amount of money. And our ability to create, modify, remove and analyze materials is really unique. So we're seeing deeper engagements with customers than we've ever seen in the past, and I would say I've never been optimistic about our markets and also our positions in those markets.",676

But [ based on the new play ], we haven't seen a lot of products coming out of there or any design come out that. What gives you confidence that, that investment will come, maybe later in this year or 2019, '20 time frame?",67

Thanks for the question. So we have pretty significant visibility in China. We have the highest share. We also sell the manufacturing automation systems. So we have a lot of leading indicators relative to all the projects that are happening in China. And as I said earlier, we have the largest share, and our share is growing in China, both in semiconductor and in display. And what we see in 2018 is a market that's going to grow. We're more optimistic, I would say, in terms of the growth in China. It's pretty balanced between global and domestic companies. And again, we're working very closely with all of those different companies. Domestic China is higher in foundry and logic than it is in memory. And one of the things that we talked about was data generation, smarter devices, the increasing sensor technologies. That's an area where China has capability. And certainly, the demand for those trailing geometries is now 40% of the foundry market. And we're seeing very strong growth there in China. For the global companies, they are more weighted towards memory versus foundry and logic. Another thing that Dan talked about in the prepared remarks was our service growth. I think something like 30% year-over-year in service. China is also a market where our penetration in service is very high, helping global and local of companies ramp new fabs in new locations. And so we had some onetime parts increases in our quarter that increased the rate of growth in service above the model that we gave. We think we may be a few points higher than that model, but that certainly contributed to an extraordinary quarter relative to service growth. So anyway, we have very, very good visibility in China. The investments there are strategic investments, and we believe that that's going to remain available market and especially good for Applied Materials.",316

I just want to build on very quickly the point Gary was making about our services business. I think the way we'd profile this year from a service perspective will be different than we've seen historically, because of the dynamic Gary talked about. I think you'll see a seasonally stronger first half and different profile into the back half of the year as a couple of these fabs facilitated by international customers are brought online in China. I think the way to think about the back half of the year, because you've got visibility now on Q1 and Q2, think about the back half of the year, is take our long-term compound growth rate in our services business of 15%. And as you look at full year 2018 revenue over full year 2017 revenue, we're likely to be about 3 points above our long-term compound growth rate. I think that gives you a good framing on how to think about the services business throughout the course of the year so you can dial-in your models.",176

Thanks, Craig. I'll go ahead and jump in and take this. I think it's too early to tell how spending profile across that 2-year sequence. I think it's important to just take a step back and look at what's really driving our view on a multiyear basis. Macro trends are real. Capital intensity is up. And we're seeing modest and disciplined growth into China. Again, we think these macro trends shaping people's lives, we're in the early innings. Gary referenced $80 billion of investments in autonomous vehicles. By 2020, 8 OEMs are going to have level 4 vehicles on the road. By 2022, it's 12 OEMs. We're in the early stages of SSD penetration of hard disk drives. And when we correlate it bottoms-up with dialogue we have with customers, all indicators look good the best we can see, and fundamentals continue to look good into 2019.

Personally, I can think of a better time to be in the semiconductor industry. We talked a lot about multiple growth drivers that are important trends shaping our lives. These trends are going to drive tremendous productivity and the investments are nondiscretionary for some of the largest, most competitive industries on the planet. It is fundamentally about staying competitive. Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends. And at the center of it, it all begins with what we do at Applied. 
When we bring all of this together, Applied's future is incredibly bright. Our breadth and depth is just an asset for the company. We're likely to be sustainably bigger, more profitable and we're going to generate more cash than in the past. 
And as we think about putting that cash to use, we talked about 3 important ways. Number one, we're going to invest in new products. This is going to lead the way and drive the organic growth profile we've seen over the last few years. We will invest to drive organic growth. We will pay higher dividends and we're going to be buying back more shares to drive even more shareholder value going forward. 
Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you. We're going to be at the Goldman conference tomorrow. And then next week, we'll be on the road in New York, Boston or Toronto. 
And as always, thanks for joining us, and we really appreciate the support. So Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.",271

Applied's performance in the second fiscal quarter was another all-time record for the company, with revenue up 29% from the same period last year. I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees around the world for these outstanding results. 
Across the company, we have tremendous momentum. Applied has broad exposure to major technology trends and is playing a larger, more valuable role in the electronics ecosystem. All 3 of our major business segments, semiconductor, display and service, remain on track to deliver strong double-digit growth in fiscal 2018. 
In today's call, I'll provide our perspective on how the major trends driving our markets are evolving. I'll outline our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into sustainable growth for Applied. Then Dan will provide more details about our financial performance and outlook. 
During this past quarter, there have been some puts and takes in our customers' near-term investment plans. Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models, and in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning. 
We view the current investment levels as rational and disciplined, particularly in the memory market. We therefore believe a healthy balance of supply and demand will be maintained.
 
Smartphones remain a key long-term driver of both technology and capacity. In many ways, smartphones are the ultimate edge device. And as handset makers add more functions and features to their products, we see the content per box continuing to grow. 
For example, recent forecasts from our customers indicate that average yearly growth in mobility content over the next 3 years will be around 35% for NAND and 20% for DRAM. 
In contrast to the weakness in smartphone unit sales we've seen in the first part of this year, there is evidence that emerging drivers of industry growth are picking up pace. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence will disrupt and transform virtually every industry and area of the economy over the next decade. 
While we're only at the very beginning of the buildout of the AI big data era, we are already starting to see the positive impact on our markets. In just the past 6 months, cloud service providers have increased their capital investments significantly. Looking at the financial reports from the top 7 cloud service providers, we see their CapEx up around 40% this year versus previous expectations of about 30%. 
Also, data center real estate investments made by those companies in 2017 were up more than 250% compared to 2016, which we view as a positive leading indicator of growth. Data centers are already becoming a much larger consumer of silicon. For example, the market for server DRAM is currently growing about 75% faster than mobile DRAM, which means it could become the largest segment of the DRAM market in the next 3 to 5 years. 
In addition, the architecture war for AI leadership is heating up, with a steady stream of new high-performance computing hardware coming to market. 
At both the server and chip level, we see a major shift from general-purpose computing to new hardware architectures that are customized for specific computing tasks or workloads. This significant technology inflection is fueling new investments in hardware design and new silicon devices, which in turn, are driving significant innovation throughout the ecosystem. 
I'll now translate these end market trends into an outlook for Applied's served markets. As I mentioned, we are seeing extremely disciplined investment by our memory customers, which we believe bodes well for healthy market dynamics. In line with our previous forecast, NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year. While we've reduced our expectations for NAND investments in 2018, we still see spending being similar to last year's high levels. 
Our outlook for DRAM investments has strengthened as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM used in data centers. We expect this year's combined investments by foundry and logic customers to be similar to 2017, and we anticipate that spending will be split relatively evenly between leading edge and trailing geometries to serve growing IoT and automotive applications.
 
We also continue to see a steady ramp of spending in China by both multinational and domestic manufacturers, in line with our prior assumptions. 
Taking all of these factors into account, we maintain our view that combined wafer fab equipment investments in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. 
In display, investments in large substrate Gen 10.5 TV capacity remained strong. Adoption of OLED screens in mobile and the ramp of manufacturing capacity are slower than previously expected, primarily due to weakness in high-end smartphone sales. 
We view OLED as a compelling technology, and the leading handset makers are committed to making the transition over time. Compared to LCD, OLED offers significant performance in power advantages, as well as lower cost in high-volume production. In addition, next-generation flexible OLED will enable new form factors, such as curved and, ultimately, foldable screens. 
Applied Materials' vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we have aligned our investments, organization and operating systems to realize this vision. In many ways, it is the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio that sets us apart. We have the broadest exposure to industry trends, and our business is well balanced across a variety of markets and market segments. 
In addition, as the industry road maps become increasingly challenging, materials solutions are more critical to deliver the needed improvements in power, performance, area and cost for next-generation devices. Our ability to address these complex challenges with innovative approaches to materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is becoming increasingly valuable. 
We also have unique technologies, like e-beam, to measure, understand and inspect new materials and structures. We're using our breadth to help customers accelerate their road maps. Shortening the time it takes to bring new devices to market is incredibly valuable, resulting in strong customer pull for materials solutions that go beyond traditional unit process tools. We're excited about our pipeline, and we'll share more insights into these capabilities later this year. 
In semiconductor, the strength of our technology portfolio has enabled us to outperform the market for 6 consecutive years. Based on our expanding opportunities and the traction of our new products, we expect to grow faster than the market again this year. 
With our R&D priorities aligned to our customers' evolving requirements, it is clear that advancing the industry road map is going to require a combination of: new device architectures, including 3D structures and advanced packaging; new materials; and new ways to shrink chip geometries that address both resolution and placement. There is significant innovation taking place in all 3 of these areas, and that creates great opportunities for Applied. 
Even in shrink, our opportunity is growing regardless of the pace of EUV lithography adoption. The reasons for this include: self-aligned multi-patterning techniques; SADP and SAQP, which are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution road map; and new materials-enabled patterning approaches, which are being developed as the primary solution for placement errors. Placement errors, or the vertical alignment between the layers of a device, can have a significant impact on device performance and reliability. 
Beyond equipment, we continue to invest in new service products and organizational capabilities to create value for our customers. Our service business delivered all-time record performance this quarter, with revenues up 30% relative to the same period last year. Over the longer term, we're confident that we can sustain annual service growth of at least 15%, driven by a growing installed base, a larger portion of those tools under long-term service agreements, and new service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and optimize operating costs. 
In display, since 2012, we've grown revenues at an average rate of 25% per year. And in 2018, we remain on track to grow by more than 30%. Based on recent revisions to timing of customers' OLED plans, our early view of 2019 is that our revenue will be lower than this year, although still nicely up from 2017. 
Overall, we maintain a positive outlook for the business as the unique long-term growth driver for Applied. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. While we've seen some recent changes in customers' near-term investment plans, our markets remain strong and healthy, with long-term demand drivers firmly in place. We maintain our view that wafer fab equipment spending for 2018 and 2019 combined could be $100 billion. 
Applied is outperforming our served market and in fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver strong double-digit growth in semi, display and services. As we look ahead, we see emerging technology trends that play to Applied's breadth. And we're excited about our expanding role of bringing new devices to market. 
Now Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.",1496
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3568.0,1472129.0,58436677.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In Q2, Applied set new performance records across a variety of operating and financial metrics. Our manufacturing and operations' teams shipped a record number of 300-millimeter systems while hitting key goals for quality and on-time delivery. Company revenue was an all-time high, up 29% year-over-year. Our semi equipment and services businesses both set revenue records, and we exceeded our outlook in display. 
We maintained strong gross margins, even as our service and display businesses outgrew semi. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 40% year-over-year to $1.38 billion, a new record. And we continue to become more efficient. We reduced our non-GAAP OpEx to sales ratio to 16.6%, the lowest in our history. And we did this by growing, not cutting. In fact, we're investing more in R&D than at any time in our history to support our customers with new materials and innovative solutions. This makes Applied a uniquely vulnerable partner in driving the road map for continued high-performance, low-power and low cost. We will continue to invest with discipline and be laser focused on improving our execution and financial results. 
I believe Applied's strong performance is also attributable to better industry dynamics. We see growing evidence that our markets are larger and less variable. We expect strong semiconductor equipment spending in 2018 and 2019, despite weakness in the high-end segment of the smartphone market, which is still the single biggest driver of semiconductor revenue. In the past, weakness within the largest end product category might have caused a significant correction, particularly in memory. But Applied's results and outlook remained strong. 
This outcome reinforces our belief in 3 positive factors: One, there are more demand drivers than ever before. Today, the PC market...
[Audio Gap]
is growing. Smartphones comes with a wide range of price points to suit more consumers around the world, and the new data economy is just beginning to take shape. Gary mentioned the strength in data center...
[Audio Gap]
leading indicator for us. I personally believe the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are business critical, not consumer discretionary. Second, capital intensity is higher. And third, our customers are healthy and adding capacity in a disciplined manner to meet demand where it is needed the most. 
In fact, while high-end smartphone units were weaker than expected, lower NAND pricing is creating additional demand for solid state drives. In a world where data grows exponentially, it will take many years for our customers to convert the storage market from magnetic technology to semiconductors. 
In this environment, Applied's breadth is a unique advantage. In semiconductor systems, Gary described how we are combining our technologies to help customers in new ways. You'll see more evidence of this in the months ahead. Applied is strong across memory, foundry and logic, and we're growing in memory, where our leadership products are being used to improve performance and reduce power consumption. 
Technologies like high-k/metal gate were pioneered in the logic market and are now being adopted in DRAM. Many of our new multi-patterning wins are also in DRAM. 
Today, we are also growing our semi business beyond the opportunity set of the most advanced logic and memory nodes. Our 200-millimeter systems and our [ trailing ] node 300-millimeter systems serve many hundreds of end customers in diverse industries, such as automotive and industrial. 
Our 200-millimeter systems revenue should be up over 20% this year. In fact, we are now building brand-new systems to keep up with the demand for the billions of sensors in other low-cost devices needed in the Internet of Things, advanced automotive applications and Industry 4.0. These systems' shipments are also helping us diversify in service, which gives us growth, consistent revenue and excellent cash flow. 
And Applied has a unique opportunity in display. As Gary discussed, while the transition to OLED smartphones will take some additional time, our overall display business is diverse and remains very strong. As a company, we've never had such a broad set of growth drivers, and we have more in the pipeline. As a result, our fiscal year revenue could be up by more than 20% in 2018, and our non-GAAP EPS could be up over 40%. We're well on track to our goal of achieving over $5 in non-GAAP EPS by 2020. 
In short, we have strong conviction in our markets, our strategy, our technology pipeline and our opportunity to deliver growth over the long run, even when equity markets are volatile in the short run. 
Consistent with our conviction, we used $2.5 billion during the quarter to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock or about 4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period. Over the past 4 quarters, our buybacks were equivalent to 7% of the shares outstanding. 
At the same time, we've maintained a very strong balance sheet. We plan to increase our CapEx by about $400 million this year. The majority of the increase will be used to expand our R&D capabilities and manufacturing capacity. 
Now I'll comment on our financial execution in Q2. We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.22 or $1.19 minus the benefit of a lower tax rate and share count. 
On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 40 basis points, increased operating margin by 240 basis points and grew EPS by 54%. 
Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and services. We grew semi equipment revenue by 25% year-over-year. Services revenue was up 30% and above our expectation, driven by strong spare parts demand, along with new long-term service agreements and renewals. 
In display, we grew revenue by 53% year-over-year and grew non-GAAP operating margin by 620 basis points year-over-year. We expect display revenue to be higher in our second half, thanks to our balanced exposure to inflections in both the TV and mobile markets. 
Now I'll share our business outlook for Q3 as compared to the same period last year. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.53 billion, the midpoint would be up by about 18% year-over-year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue to grow about 7%. Our services revenue should increase by about 23%. Our display revenue should grow by about 75%. Our non-GAAP gross margin should be around 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $770 million, plus or minus $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.17, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 36%. 
Finally, I'll add some additional color to help you with your models for the full fiscal year, in which overall company revenue could be up around 22%. The following 4 metrics are likely to be approximately flat sequentially from Q3 to Q4: services revenue; display revenue; non-GAAP gross margin; and non-GAAP OpEx. And our Semiconductor systems revenue is likely to be up sequentially in Q4. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.",1180

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3568.0,1472129.0,58436684.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,10,"Thank you. So let me give some color on display overall. Display is a really good adjacent market for Applied. We average 25% growth, annual growth between 2012 and 2017, and we're still on track to greater than 30% revenue growth in 2018. Based on the customer plans, our view of 2019 is for revenue to be down around 15% or 20%. When we look at mobile and TV, in '18, we see investment balanced between mobile and TV; '19, more weighted towards TV. And in TV, the adoption of larger screens is driving the market. If you look at a Gen 10.5 factory versus a Gen 8.5 factory, you can produce 8 65-inch televisions versus 3 65-inch televisions. So there's really compelling value proposition there. We're still tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. There's a long lead time for these factories, and customers are still on track with these investments. In OLED, it is slower than we previously expected. We're still tracking 23 fabs. That timing has extended out from around 2021 to 2023. But the transition to OLED display is still compelling, and leading handset makers are still committed to make the transition. If you look at rigid OLED, you have better performance, better form factor, lower costs, entitlement in high-volume manufacturing, and the ability to go to flexible OLED for curved and, eventually, foldable screens. So we've had great performance in growth in display over the last few years. With future technology inflection as our pipeline of new capabilities, we continue to see display as a really good growth opportunity for Applied.",264

And I think maybe you could elaborate on that, and tell us what happened in the first half of the -- in the first quarter of the year. So demand in smartphones came in weaker than expected. We are in a weak smartphone environment, that's fairly new. So my question is, is this new discipline, does that mean that your clients have been able to adapt their plans very rapidly, and they've adapted plans already? Although that actually means that the units' growth of smartphone as a driver for the industry as a whole is now so small and lost into other drivers, like content increase and other markets like data center? And this is not actually -- that's not a moving that really affects investment plans in today's world.",150
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 17, 2018",2018-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3568.0,1472129.0,58436687.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,13,"Thanks for the question. So if we take a look at the memory market as an illustration of the point around discipline, we take a look at the demand. End market demand is strong, the macro drivers, we keep talking about artificial intelligence, data economy, are real, they're playing out and it's driving demand for silicon. We see that demand in the memory market. Customers are incredibly healthy. They're make -- they're investing a lot, but they're also making a lot. And in fact, WFE as a percent of EBITDA is down 50% from 2012 to today. And the environment is characterized by demand-led investments. The market is showing incredible discipline. In DRAM, 2017, supply bit growth was about 20%. Demand bit growth in 2017 was slightly more than that. In 2018, we expect supply and demand in the DRAM market to be balanced at about 20% growth each. In NAND, it's a similar story. In 2017, supply bit growth was about 30% to 35%. And 2017's demand bit growth was about 35% to 40%. In 2018, again, we see a balanced market from a supply-demand perspective, both at about 40%. When we look at what's happening in China, we're seeing modest and disciplined growth in China. China is emerging as a spender. Their strategic intent is clear, and the financial resources they have are clear. And based on our dialogue, we think the expectations with those customers are realistic. They're being pragmatic. Capacity additions to date are modest. And when we take all of this into account, we have confidence in this region in the long run. So across multiple markets, multiple geographies, we're seeing a very disciplined environment play out. And as we take a step back from that environment, 2017 was a great year in WFE. 2018 will be up over 2017. As Gary said, could be $100 billion between '18 and '19, so we're seeing strength across all device types, customers are healthy and they're acting in a disciplined manner.",334

So you see a balanced supply-demand outlook for DRAM. I think industry capacity entering this year was about 1.1 million wafer starts per month. But as you guys know, the DRAM suppliers are losing effective capacity, like every time they do a technology migration, I think, something to the tune of like 15% capacity loss. And then bits per wafer is also going down every time they do technology migration. So given what you're seeing, what do you think we end the year, as it relates to total DRAM capacity?",95

If we go back to 2016, it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month. And probably a handful of years before that, it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month. In 2017, because of exactly the dynamic you talked about, which is we're getting less bit growth out of shrinks, and the shrinks are happening at a less frequent interval, we saw more capacity adds in the DRAM market. So it rounded to 1.2 million wafer starts per month exiting 2017. I think it's too early to call where we end up in 2018, but we definitely see customers struggling to drive bit growth from shrinks alone, factory output when you shrink, because the process is more complex, goes down, and greenfield adds are being just added to keep the supply demand in balance, driving about a 20% bit supply growth, in line with bit demand growth. So too early to call it, but it still looks like a healthy market acting with discipline.",168

I know that, that's not guidance, and you could just as easily probably have raised it to $105 billion or something like that.

It's too early to tell today exactly how 2018 profiles, first half, second half, full year, and how 2019 profiles. But we've got a lot of conviction and confidence heading into 2019. There's a number of reasons at the core of it. We're talking about the macro trends, they're real, they're having a real impact. Demand for silicon is up. Second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that's all device types. Markets are balanced, we're seeing strength across all 4 device types. We take a step back, NAND has got a lot of publicity of late. When we end 2018, we're going to see something very similar in the NAND market to 2017, which was an all-time high. Taking a step back from the near-term noise, this is an incredibly strong market. Customers, again, for customers continue to be healthy, they're profitable, they're behaving in a disciplined manner. And again, we're seeing the right kind of signals out of China that indicate long-term stability, health and being a meaningful driver of growth going forward. So too early to call exactly how it profiles, but we've got a lot of strength and conviction about how the outlook and fundamentals look into 2019.",264

So 2018's going to be a great year for Applied in China. We have a very strong position in semi, service, display. And we anticipate that we're going to grow faster than the market there. '18 is pretty balanced between domestic and global companies from a revenue perspective. Domestic China is higher on foundry logic. Global is higher on memory. But overall, we're going to have a great year there in 2018. As Dan said, we believe the investments are rational and will continue. And this is, long term, a great growth opportunity for Applied.",108

If I look at the trends for the last several years, '14, '15 WFE combined was $70 billion; '16, '17 was $90 billion. '18, '19, you were saying $100 billion. Are we -- what do you think, like going forward 2021, should we expect a continued growth in WFE as well, and maybe like '18 to '19 could be down but '20, '21 should be up from that.",86

If we go back to 2000, when 300-millimeter wafers were introduced, the industry peaked at a capital intensity or WFE intensity of about 17% of overall industry revenues. And as you worked 300-millimeter systems into the mix, it drove a whole host of efficiencies that wasn't more -- just more output per factory, it's the way the factories were run, factory automation systems. There was a whole host of efficiencies that were driven into the industry. And then in about maybe 2011, I think it was, the industry bottomed at about 7% of WFE intensity and it's been on the -- 13%, it's been -- 2013, and it's been on the rise ever since then. But if we take a look at it today, 2017, it was about 12%. I think there's arguments to say that it could go higher, based on a lot of the complexity we see across the device types and capital intensity increasing. But if you just keep it at 12% and you think about where the overall semiconductor industry has the potential to grow to, even modest growth rates to 2025 mean that it could be a $650 billion, $700 billion, $750 billion industry. And if you apply your 12% ratio to that aggregate industry revenue, you get to WFE numbers that are significantly north of where we are today. So we believe in the long-term trends that we're seeing. We believe that semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends. We believe that the industry is getting more complex, and hence, more capital-intensive. And we think that we've got more opportunities in front of us than we have in the rearview mirror. So we feel good about where this has the potential to go.",294

I don't think we're seeing any fundamental changes in the business. We think that this is a great business for us. We feel good about where it's headed. It's a form of less volatile revenue growth, it's a more stable driver of cash flow over time. And the management team is operating this business in a very disciplined and focused way. We've seen growth above our long-term advertised growth rate of compounded 15% per year between now and 2020. At the Analyst Day, we'll revise that long-term forecast. But the team is executing well, and growth is really a function of 3 things in this business. Our installed base, we've got the largest installed base in the industry. Complexity is going up, service opportunity on a 300-millimeter tool is 4x that of a 200-millimeter tool, so the opportunity continues to grow over time as we continue to grow and ramp our semiconductor equipment business. And then the team's done a great job of driving service agreements with our customers. This is about the performance, performance of the machine, output, yield, capabilities. It drives better outcomes for our customers, better outcomes for us. And that partnership is reflected in the numbers that we're driving. So nothing fundamentally has changed. We've seen high utilizations probably driving higher parts uptake than we've seen maybe historically at lower levels of utilization throughout the industry, but it's just a disciplined focus management team driving hard at producing good results.",246

And I agree, this stuff doesn't line up perfectly. Different companies will profile differently. When we take a step back, 2017 was a great year for WFE, $48 billion. In 2018, it's going to be up over '17. We are going to show strong double-digit growth in each of our respective businesses. First half in '18 is strong, and with inventory rebalance that we're seeing from smartphones, we're going to see a sequential dip into Q3. But from our guidance into Q4, you can see that it recovers nicely into Q4. Fundamentals, we've talked about it on the call. Fundamentals into 2019 look good for us. 2018 and 2019 as a combined 2-year period are going to be over $100 billion. It's going to be a good year. And so we like the fundamentals and we like where the business is going, but I don't think there's too much to read into any one quarter over this period of performance.",161

So DRAM, as I said earlier, is really going to grow a significant amount for us in 2018. And we could, if you look at 2013 versus '18, have revenue growth around 5x in terms of our DRAM revenue, so really a significant growth. And as I mentioned before on the call, in the past, we really had strength in one segment, which was foundry, that was over 20%. All the other segments were 15% or lower. We've increased our share of DRAM, a huge amount. And one thing that's happening from a device standpoint, they want faster input/output to the chip, and a periphery area, you're starting to see more logic-like steps. And as you said, Patrick, that benefits all of our products that we normally sell into logic, the epi PVD implant, thermal, CMP, all of those areas are now seeing demand in DRAM, and especially as there's greenfield activity taking place. That puts us in a great position relative to our overall share of the DRAM spending. We're also making gains in patterning in DRAM, new wins where we never had position really strong gains with Sym3. So those are the areas where we're seeing the fastest growth.",203

So what changed in the trailing actually that's driving this growth or being -- become a bigger piece? And are customer -- customer historically buy old tools or buy older designed tool. Are customer, like adopting the latest and greatest hardware in the trailing actually at 200 millimeter now?",113

So the changing buying patterns we've seen in customers has really been unfolding over the better part of a decade. If you would go back a decade ago, you would have seen 90% of the WFE in the foundry space on the leading edge, 10% on the trailing edge. Over time, that's evolved to 80-20, 60-40. And this year, we see it evolving to 50-50. And I think at the core of that is that more diversified spending is proliferation of edge devices as part of the Internet of Things, it requires a different our performance envelope and you see our estimates call for 28-nanometer peak capacity. And initially we called peak capacity at 28-nanometers, 330,000 wafer starts a month. Then it was 400,000 then it was 450,000 and now it's 500,000 wafer starts a month. So you can see those peak capacities beginning to expand as edge devices proliferate, and you need sensors and intelligence -- onboard intelligence in those devices. And so we think it's really healthy to see this industry diversify geographically from a technology node perspective. We think it's healthy from a long-term industry perspective as well.",193

Thanks, Sidney. So as you know, from the prepared comments in the Q&A, certainly $40 billion WFE is not our view. But of course, we plan for a wide variety of scenarios. So if we walk through a scenario, say that's $40 billion WFE, let's say our business is diverse, services is more stable, it's growing well. And from Gary's comment, display will be down into 2019. So -- and the 24% market share, for lack of a better number, so 24% share in our equipment business, display down, services growing, you get revenue somewhere around $16 billion. And let's say we keep OpEx in that difficult environment, we keep OpEx the same as this year, which is probably a conservative assumption, but let's peg it to this year, operating profit based on that revenue flow through is something around 26.5%. And so 2019 EPS, in that scenario, is nicely higher than where we were in 2017. So while we model a lot of scenarios, it's not our current view, but that's what a downside scenario could potentially look like.",181

Yes, China is definitely a very strong region for us. If we look our share in semi, display, service, it's one of the strongest regions. And as I said earlier, '18 is going to see significant growth for Applied. We do see continued increasing investment in China, as we move forward. We don't have any specific forecast on what that will look like, but we have been seeing increasing revenue from China and growth there over the last few years. We anticipate that to go forward. Now we don't expect to see a hockey stick. If you look at the technology needed to participate in the leading edge, there's still some gaps there. But one of the things that we're also seeing is that the trailing geometries are growing, Dan just talked about that, relative to demand. And certainly, that's an area where China's making a lot of investment. So again, we see increased revenue there, increased demand going forward and overall, a great position for Applied.",171

I think the inventory increase is a function of 2 things. We've got a growing business and we think that business is going to continue to grow going forward.

So you can see the actions we've taken. We've got a view, our markets are strong. Our position within those respective markets is probably better today than it's ever been. Company is executing well and we're generating a lot of cash. We've got a long-term track record of returning that cash to shareholders, and that's going to -- that will continue. In June, we pay our first $0.20 dividend. We've repurchased 2.5 billion shares in the quarter, like you point out. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic in the market. While I won't commit $2.5 billion every quarter, we're going to continue to be opportunistic, when we don't feel like the trading price of our stock reflects the intrinsic value of the company, we'll be in the market over time, to return that cash to shareholders. And I think that general framing, that mindset, that outlook, just reflects the strong confidence we have, confidence in our industry, in the business, in our execution. And we're going to continue to look at dividend levels periodically over time. And as we grow our business, continue to maintain a strong track record of returning cash to shareholders. But opportunistic approach going forward like we've always done.",207

So maybe couple of quick thoughts that we can wrap up with. I think I want to reiterate. Q2 is a record quarter. 2018 is going to be another record year for this company. Company's executing well. We're driving top line growth, we're driving margin accretion. We're driving strong cash flow and we're driving more resources into R&D to fuel our future growth. Breadth. Breadth is a major positive that sets us apart, in semis we're hitting new records. We're strong, and strong across all device types. We've got a growing pipeline. These new products, they're going to deliver high-performance and low power to the market, and we're going to see some of those new products here in the very near future. And we're growing beyond semi. While display investments are shifting out in time, it's being offset by tremendous growth in our services business. The team has just done a fantastic job executing against that opportunity. And I guess, to Romit's earlier question, this is how we're offsetting that weakness in display and still well on track to earning over $5 a share in 2020. We've got strong conviction, strong conviction in our markets, in the pipeline, in the execution. And backing it up with strong capital allocation, $2.6 billion in Q2 alone. And I guess, before we go, I just look forward to seeing many of you at the following upcoming events. Gary and I are headed to Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, first time for Applied; at the new AI conference for investors arranged by New Street Research; and at the Cowen -- upcoming Cowen and BofA Merrill Lynch conferences.

I'm pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to the same period last year and the second highest in the company's history. Fiscal 2018 remains on track to be another record-setting year for Applied Materials, and we expect each of our major businesses to deliver strong double-digit growth. 
In today's call, I'll start by providing our perspective on the market environment and our business performance. Then, I'll lay out our views on the industry's future growth drivers and describe how we're evolving our strategy to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
In aggregate, we see ongoing strength in our markets. Customers are making rational investments in new capacity, resulting in well-balanced supply/demand dynamics. At the same time, they are aggressively pursuing their development road maps with healthy spending on next-generation technologies. 
Demand for wafer fab equipment is on track to be an all-time record in 2018, and our view of 2019 remains positive. Our thesis that spending in 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion remains firmly intact. The details within our 2018 forecast are consistent with the view we shared during our last call, with the exception of a recent downward revision to our foundry outlook.
As foundry customers optimize existing capacity, they have trimmed their capital spending plans for the year. They are still pushing forward with leading-edge development, prioritizing current investments towards long lead time equipment, which is a positive leading indicator for 2019. NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year, with bit supply growing slightly faster. As a result, we see spending levels flat to modestly down from last year's record levels. 
DRAM investments are strong, up approximately 50% year-over-year as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM for data centers. Capital investments by the leading cloud service providers continues to strengthen, up about 85% year-to-date compared to 2017. And in line with our prior view, we also expect logic investments to be higher this year. 
Stepping back and looking at the broader context. 2018 shows how the industry has fundamentally changed over the past 5 years. More diverse demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise markets, combined with very disciplined investment, has reduced cyclicality. We're not seeing the large fluctuations in wafer fab equipment spending that we did in the past. 
Over the same time period, we've also driven significant changes within Applied that have resulted in a larger, less volatile and more resilient business. In semiconductor, we have gained 7 points of market share in memory since 2013, while maintaining our traditionally strong position in logic foundry. 
As a result, we are now very well balanced across market segments. We've built a strong portfolio of products that address major technology inflections. For example, by developing tools for next-generation multi-patterning, we have grown our patterning business in DRAM, logic and foundry from about $100 million in 2013 to more than $1 billion this year. We expect our patterning opportunity to grow by another $1 billion as EUV and new materials-enabled patterning steps are adopted over the next 5 years. 
In display, we have scaled the business from about $600 million in 2012 to approximately $2.5 billion this year. In both TV and mobile, customers are investing in new technologies, and that plays directly to Applied's strengths. We expect display to remain a powerful growth driver for the company over the long term. 
In service, we have grown revenue at a 15% compound annual growth rate since 2014. As we look ahead, we're confident that we can sustain at least that pace of growth, driven by: our growing installed base; customers placing a larger portion of tools under long-term service agreements; and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and optimize operating costs. 
When we look at the company as a whole, about 40% of our revenue today comes from sources other than new semiconductor equipment sales. Combined, our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses will generate more than $7 billion of revenue this year. This breadth and diversity gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong performance under a variety of market conditions and provide a great platform for future growth. 
I strongly believe that the most exciting days for the industry and Applied are ahead of us. Over the next decade, AI and big data will transform almost every sector of the economy and be a major growth driver for electronics and semiconductors. AI is already driving a significant increase in hardware research and investment from a broad range of companies because it requires new types of computing at the edge and in the cloud, lower-cost, lower-power chips and abundant storage. 
In these early innings of AI, the industry is focused on addressing 2 major technology inflections: first, the development of new computing architectures customized for specific training or inference workloads; and second, overcoming the deceleration of Moore's Law scaling. 
This is driving new types of innovation across the ecosystem. We believe that future improvements in chip performance, power, area and cost needed to enable the AI era will be driven by a combination of 5 factors: new chip architectures; new structures within the chip, including 3D; new materials; new ways to shrink chip geometries, including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning; and new ways to connect chips together using advanced packaging techniques. All 5 of these approaches will require major advances in materials engineering and create huge opportunities for Applied. 
The AI big data era is a catalyst for Applied to play a bigger and broader role than ever before. Our first priority is to be the most valuable partner for our customers. The introduction of more novel materials, combined with new structures to improve power, performance and cost, means that integration challenges in a chip manufacturing process are increasingly complex. 
Our broad portfolio of technology and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is tremendously valuable. As a result, we are seeing customers engaging Applied in earlier and deeper collaborations to develop unique solutions focused on device performance and yield. 
One example of how we're doing this is integrated materials solutions, where we can combine multiple processes together, typically within a single system. We launched our first integrated materials system in June, but this is just the start. We have a very robust pipeline of integrated products, several of which we expect to come to market in 2019. 
We're also expanding our engagements within the AI ecosystem and finding new ways to create value with our technology. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with ARM to develop a neuromorphic switch that can enable new approaches to AI computing. This program is part of DARPA's Electronics Resurgence Initiative to develop new computing materials, designs and architectures. 
In July, we hosted the industry's first AI design forum, with over 700 attendees spanning system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. The common message from participants was that the ecosystem needs to work together in new ways to bring AI technologies to market faster and at lower cost. Applied has highly differentiated technologies and capabilities to accelerate new materials and systems like our Maydan technology center that enables rapid testing of new concepts and designs. 
To further accelerate materials innovation and our ability to connect across the ecosystem, we're expanding capacity and capabilities. In addition, we're applying AI and big data methods within our own research and development teams. We're partnering with leading AI companies in making infrastructure investments to significantly increase learning rates.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Industry fundamentals remain strong, with customers making disciplined investments in capacity and new technologies. Applied's performance remains strong. 2018 will be another record year for all of our major businesses, and our outlook for 2019 is positive. And we see a very bright future ahead. We're expanding engagements with current and new customers to position the company to play a larger and more valuable role in the AI big data era.
Now Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.",1374
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2018",2018-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3589.0,1545530.0,61036802.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings that were both within 2% of the all-time record we set last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we generated strong revenue growth and increased non-GAAP EPS by 40% even as our memory customers made capacity adjustments during the period. 
We continue to see the wafer fab equipment market and Applied Materials being sustainably larger and less cyclical today than in the past. And as Gary outlined, our outlook for 2019 and the longer term remains very positive. 
Given the adjustments in memory markets along with recent foundry CapEx reductions, I want to offer you a little help this quarter with how we see demand profiling from 2018 into 2019. My philosophy is to tell you what I see today based on our market analysis and customer engagements. I can't guarantee what happens in the economy, in policy circles or in our markets, but I'm happy to be transparent with you and let you make your own judgments about the external factors. 
Our fiscal Q4 business outlook calls for semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year, with non-GAAP earnings to increase by about 3% year-over-year at the midpoint to $0.96. From what I can see today, semiconductor systems revenue will be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q1. Non-GAAP earnings will be slightly higher sequentially in Q1 as well, even when you include a $0.05 headwind from an increase in our tax rate that takes effect in fiscal 2019. Our current outlook into Q2 and the balance of fiscal 2019 is for continued growth.
Returning to the bigger picture Gary described. You may notice how resilient the industry and the company have become, particularly given the supply and demand adjustments now taking place in memory. Some of us remember the steep cyclicality of the past, but here's the news. We expect trough non-GAAP quarterly earnings of $0.96 in Q4. To put this into perspective, $0.96 also happens to be the average of our full year earnings in the 6 years from 2010 through 2015. We can now generate the same level of earnings in a single quarter. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of Applied's breadth and growth. 
In semi, while our memory systems revenue declined by 19% sequentially in Q3, our overall systems business was down by half that amount. This demonstrates the benefits of our balanced revenue share across device types. 
Applied's display business has grown nearly $2 billion as compared to 2012, and the best indication of Applied's resilience is our services business. This quarter, AGS posted its 19th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. In fact, Applied has the industry's largest installed base of more than 40,000 systems, and we're shipping over 2,000 new 300-millimeter systems this year alone. This year's record shipments will further expand our services opportunity next year. In fact, due to the increasing trust our customers are placing in our services products, we are now generating about half of our services revenue from long-term agreements. 
I'm sometimes asked to quantify the total proportion of our semi-related business that comes from servicing the installed base. The answer is 32%. That's AGS excluding display services plus 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbishments, which are reported as part of our semiconductor systems group segment. So Applied generates more installed base revenue than any other company in our industry.
Now I'll summarize our third quarter results. We generated operating income of $1.3 billion, which was up 22% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.20, which was $0.03 above the midpoint, benefiting from higher revenue as well as lower tax rate and share count. 
Turning to the segments. Our semiconductor systems group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. Our services revenue was up 21% year-over-year, which was slightly lower than the midpoint of our Q3 expectations but well above our long-term growth target. AGS posted another all-time record in both revenue and operating income. Our display group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint and also set new records in both revenue and operating income. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Gary talked about the many initiatives we're driving to accelerate innovation. We invested $133 million in capital improvements that were primarily aimed at expanding our capabilities in both R&D and manufacturing to support our customers. 
This quarter, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders. We paid out the first $0.20 dividend, and we used $1.25 billion to repurchase 25 million shares of our stock. Over the last 12 months alone, we've repurchased 92 million shares or 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. And we still have about $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization.
Now I'll share our business outlook for Q4. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion. Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year. This forecast includes the impact of recent foundry CapEx reductions. Our services revenue should increase by about 15% year-over-year. And our display revenue should grow by about 2% year-over-year. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin should be around 45.4%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $765 million, plus or minus $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.92 to $1.
Now that you have our financial expectations for the full 2018 fiscal year and our positive view of 2019, I'd like to give you an interim update on our 2020 financial model in the context of the new opportunities Gary has been describing. 
Q3 was a very busy quarter for us, and I was delighted to see more than 160 of you at our Investor Breakfast at SEMICON West. At the AI Design Forum, Gary shared the stage with NVIDIA, IBM and many of the world's top AI experts and startups. Two weeks later, Gary joined NVIDIA, Intel and others at the DARPA ERI Summit, showing how we can use materials engineering to accelerate AI even as Moore's Law slows. DARPA awarded millions of dollars to Applied, ARM and our research partners to explore new material for neuromorphic computing. These are early indications of the work we are now doing to drive growth for our company and our customers. 
So based on the current view of our markets, our evolving strategy and our financial performance, we are confident that we will exceed our goal of earning $5.08 per share in our 2020 fiscal year. Specifically, we expect semi systems revenue to be more than $11.6 billion in fiscal 2020. We believe $50 billion is the new normal for this industry and that WFE will keep pace with the revenue growth of the industry. We also expect services plus display revenue of more than $8 billion. Within the mix, we see services revenue being above our prior expectation, fully offsetting display revenue, which we expect to be up in 2020 but still below our original target. 
We continue to expect gross margin of 47% and operating margin of 29.6%. Our non-GAAP tax rate should be slightly higher than the prior expectation of 10% due to the new tax rules. 
Additionally, our share count is already below 1 billion versus the original goal of 1.024 billion. And we'll continue to return excess cash to our investors.
Now I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.",1235

Given the announcements in the last month, we're now seeing some movements in foundry capital spending. That's reflected in the guidance we just provided for fiscal Q4. All other assumptions from last quarter still hold true. To give you more color on what we're seeing in foundry, we continue to see growth in trailing node geometries. The split between leading edge and trailing node geometries historically was 80-20. Then it became 60-40. Today, it's more like 50-50. And specifically in 2018, we see trailing node spend up and leading edge node spend down. And on the leading edge, we're seeing a prioritization towards spend to very long lead time items, which we believe is a good indicator of our business going into 2019 and beyond. In 2019, we expect both leading and trailing node geometries spend to be healthy. When we look at 2018 and 2019, just to provide the broader context, 2017 was an all-time record. 2018 is likely to be the new record, being up over '17. And we're seeing strength across all device types. Gary in his prepared comments said 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion. I think it's too early to make a point estimate on either year. But based on customer conversations we're having, 2019 will be above $50 billion and still healthy across all device types. And so we're really seeing a strong end market and how things profile into 2019.",241

The average size of those 32 fabs is about 72,000 wafer starts per month, and it represents about 200 billion of potential floor space for WFE equipment. So in terms of ability to deploy capacity in a fairly rapid fashion, I think the infrastructure and the build is out there. I think it's just a matter of letting the demand-led environment lead our customers' investment profile to maintain rational supply/demand dynamics and strong pricing in their markets.",104

So our display forecast is really unchanged, similar to what we communicated previously. As you said, '18 is going to be around $2.5 billion, up more than 30% from the previous year and up from $600 million in 2012. So tremendous growth overall in display. And we still see 2019 down in the 15% range and 2020 to be higher than 2018. In terms of mix, 2018, 2019 is more weighted towards TV. And one thing I'd remind everybody, for large-screen TVs, if you compare Gen 10.5 to Gen 8.5, you get 8 TVs versus 3. So our view on the TV market is similar to what we previously communicated. And overall, again, we see 2020 up over 2018, continue to see display as a great growth driver for the company.

So if I understood you correctly, Dan, what you're saying is that in memory, what you saw 3 months ago and that led you to tell us you could reasonably expect like sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 in semiconductor system, that outlook didn't change, which means that the low point in memory was Q3 and things should be improving from there based on your visibility today. And then, the new thing is only logic and the pushback, the pull-out you mentioned about logic. And then, on the back of that, my question would be, how much confidence do you have in the fact that this Q4 number is also baking in low points in logic, which means that we would have gone through, in just a couple of quarters, a pullback in memory and a pullback in logic, and with therefore limited risk of a further negative surprise down the line?",172

A couple of comments. On the memory side, everything that is out in the market today from an information standpoint, it was reflected in our guide, and that's playing out as we thought. So there's no incremental news and information. And the delta between what we thought -- how we thought Q4 was going to profile 3 months ago versus what we're guiding to today is a foundry-driven dynamic. So you used the word logic. We differentiate between logic and foundry. And so I just want to be clear that our view is coming out of the foundry market, and it was versus our expectations on how Q4 was going to profile. So that is the big delta between what we thought 3 months ago. And as we roll the clock forward, the spending in foundry today is being driven by very long lead time items, which we see as a lead indicator for our business, where the lead times are much shorter as capacity comes online to meet customer demand. So I think the setup around 2019 for us is a result of that, and the foundry market looks good.",193

Gary, earlier you mentioned some comments on the NAND market, specifically sort of what you're seeing in terms of the demand growth of roughly 40% and supply growth a little bit more than that. I was wondering if you could give some more color on how you see the NAND WFE profile going to the back end this year and maybe into 2019 just based on some of those comments. And I guess the implication would be there might be some pricing pressure in the NAND market if those dynamics continue to play out. And if so, would you expect NAND WFE to see some slowdown towards the back end of the year because of pricing? Or do you think investments in upgrades to the 96 layer or above, if that will continue, and hence, continue to keep NAND WFE strong?",150

We signaled a quarter ago that we were going to see some back-half weakness. I think that's playing out as we expected. In Gary's prepared comments, he talked about the NAND market being down year-over-year versus 2017. We see that playing out. And as we look at the health of the market, if we take a step back and just look at the macro drivers driving semiconductor demand today, those macro drivers are intact and playing out as expected. Things like artificial intelligence and the data economy are going to drive a structurally larger semiconductor industry as the demand for those devices to fuel those trends increases over time. As we take a look at customer profitability, it's better today than it's ever been, and they're investing a lot of money. But as a percentage of their profitability, it's down substantially since 2012. In the memory market over that time period, CapEx as a percentage of EBITDA is down 40%. And the customers are doing a better job of modulating supply and making demand-led investments. There will always be adjustments from a supply-demand standpoint to keep those markets in balance. And I think that our customers have done a good job to strike the right balance in the environment that we're in. And as we look forward into 2019, I'll come back to an earlier comment on one of the earlier questions, we see a healthy dynamic across all 4 device types into 2019.",259

A little bit different than your U.S. peers is they're a little bit more emphatic about growth into their December quarter, your January quarter. And I'm just kind of curious. Is that a function of sort of your over -- being over-indexed to foundry or not as indexed to 5-nanometer as on the process equipment side, i.e., if you were to look at your domestic peers and kind of compare the apples-to-apples businesses, would you be more confident that your January semi equipment business would be up sequentially?",104

The first thing I would say is it's hard for me to know exactly what the assumptions were in each of the competitors' and peers' forecasts. So it's hard to make a direct comparison of what we see differently than others. What I would say is, is our guide reflects everything we see. Our footprint is broader than our peers. We're exposed to more of those end markets and device types. And the guidance we have reflects our view of the world and the conversations we're having with our customers. From a foundry-specific standpoint, we emphasize the fact that spending on the leading edge today is prioritizing some very long lead time items for capacity that will come online in the next year, 18 months, which is a nice setup for shorter lead time tools, which creates a nice opportunity for us going into 2019. So it's hard to be very specific on a comparative basis of how we're profiling differently than others. All we can try to do is be transparent with what we see developing in the market and how our conversations with customers are profiling.",205

If I look at my semi coverage universe, right, some of the big complex SoC guys, Broadcom, AMD, Xilinx, Qualcomm, so on, the 7-nanometer tape-out ramp looks actually quite significant. That's going to start to ramp kind of beginning of next year. So if you could just help us understand the rationale for your views on what you think in terms of why the push-outs of investment here in the second half of this year. And maybe just also address the breadth of the foundry push-out. Is it primarily one customer or is it multiple customers?",115

As we take a look at the foundry segment, what we can reflect in our guide is what gets communicated from our customer base. And the customers have done a very good job in the foundry space managing a supply statement commensurate with where they see demand coming from. As you know, tape-outs come and capacity gets put in place. And so there's a pretty close synchronization in that market. As the business materializes, capacity gets deployed to meet that demand statement. So we feel pretty good that what's in the market today from a capacity standpoint is able to absorb the demand that's coming into the foundry space. The second part of your question, over the past month, we've been reading about public comments on adjustment in the foundry spending reflects conversations we have with the customer base. You're now seeing that reflected in our guidance going forward. The adjustment we're seeing is primarily from what you've been reading about but not exclusively one customer.",168

I mean, you made the comment, Gary, in your prepared remarks that the business is seeing less fluctuations, but you, 3 months ago, said that July was going to be the bottom and October would grow. And now you're guiding October revenues down about 10%. So how is it that the business is more aligned and less cyclical than what we've seen previously? And then I guess, as a second part to that, DRAM spending, I understand, is strong, but all indications are that DRAM pricing's going to be down in Q4. So what gives you confidence that this isn't the next -- DRAM is not the next shoe to drop?",118

When we contemplated our July guidance and how October was going to profile, it was conditioned on a set of conversations and a set of knowledge that was in the market. Subsequent to that, there was an adjustment in spend profiles in the foundry space. Some new information became available, and our guidance reflects all of the information that's out there today. When I take a step back and we talk about resilience and we talk about less cyclicality, let's talk about the overall markets and then specifically apply it to Applied Materials. 2017 in the WFE space was an all-time record year. 2018 is going to be up over '17, with strength across all device types in an environment where we're talking about reprofiling of both memory and foundry spend. And so I think that's a pretty strong statement from an end-market standpoint that the industry is evolving in ways that I think will accrue benefits to us going forward. When we take a step back and look at Applied specifically, in an environment characterized by those same pressures, reprofiling, memory and foundry spend, we talked about EPS in my prepared comments, a single quarter is now larger than what this company used to do in a full year just a short time ago. And I think that's a pretty strong statement that our business is more resilient and less cyclical than we've seen in the past. So we feel pretty good about that context and those statements. And I'm sorry, Romit, what was the second part of your question?",263

Your DRAM spending has been strong, but it looks like in Q4, DRAM prices could be down. And given that we saw earlier in the year weakness in NAND, that sort of preclude a decline in NAND spending. I guess, I'm just [indiscernible] [ find out where ] [indiscernible]?",55

What we're giving a perspective on today is what we're seeing in the market. The supply/demand balance has been reasonably in check from a DRAM standpoint. It's led to pricing stability. It's something the customers monitor very granularly, and they've been very disciplined from an investment standpoint making demand-led investments. Taking a step back, macro trends still impact, but I think the long-term demand drivers around silicon, DRAM and logic, foundry, all device types are still there. And so if there are short-term disruptions, I don't think it takes -- it changes our long-term view of how these markets evolve. And so we view the markets still as healthy.",128

So even if I assume like 51 billion this year, which it sounds like it's probably going to be at least that, if not higher, other guys are saying 52 or 53, it still looks like based upon your guidance for the fiscal Q1 that you're still going to lose a little bit of WFE share this year after losing a little bit last year as well. Now maybe that 51 number is too high or something. But even if I look at the 2020 model, your comments on that, you said SSG is going to still be about 11 6 or higher, which is in line with the old model, but the old model was at 45 billion WFE. And now it seems like you're saying that 50 billion is sort of the new normal. So it seems like the share assumption has come down a bit. So I'm wondering what to read into all that.",167

I think if you go back to the previous 6 years, the share was up or flat, mostly up in all of the previous 6 years. So if you take an overall look at the company over the last few years, one of the big things that we've driven is a much better balance across all device types. So if you go back to 2013, we had only greater than 20% share in foundry, less than 15% share in NAND, DRAM and logic. Since 2013, we've grown the memory revenue 5x and 7% share growth and almost 2x growth in revenue and logic. So again, tremendous balance across all of the device types versus really just being more foundry-focused. Then what I would say going forward that -- and certainly, Dan reiterated that we would exceed the model for 2020. And if I look at the company and how we're positioned, we're in a great position for next technology nodes. A very strong pipeline of new products across many markets and compelling integrated material solutions. And we talked about some of that over the last 2 months. In the new products, in material solutions, we'll introduce some significant new capabilities in the next 12 months and beyond. And also, if you look from a macro perspective, I was a speaker at the AI Design Forum and the DARPA conferences, and some of the themes that came out of that were around AI, big data being a major opportunity at the same time Moore's Law is challenged. So at those conferences, and you see many people talking about the future being about materials, new structures, 3D driving future innovation, enabling AI, big data, power, performance, area and cost, future logic memory, patterning, packaging. And at one of those conferences, I gave examples of new capabilities including a 3 orders of magnitude improvement leakage current that provides lower power performance. And there's, again, a very large value in time-to-market. So when you think about going from materials to systems, there's tremendous value in accelerating that whole process, going from materials to single process steps, to integrated materials, to structures, to devices, to packages, to systems. And I really deeply feel Applied's never been in a better position to use our breadth to enable these new capabilities. So bottom line, from a position standpoint, we've never been in a better position. We have a very strong pipeline of new products, integrated materials solutions and Applied really is at the foundation of accelerating these AI, big data industry inflections.",436

Yes, our current forecast for China is in line with our prior assumptions. 2018 is going to be a great year for Applied. We'll grow faster than the market. And based on our mitigation plans, we don't see any meaningful impact from tariffs that have been imposed, that I know people are wondering about. So overall, strong position in China. Regarding the geopolitical situation, certainly, we believe in fair trade and that a successful resolution of the current situation is important to the overall ecosystem. And we believe that's the likely ultimate outcome. Relative to Applied, we will continue to monitor the impact of any future developments to Applied, supply chain, customers and take any actions that are needed to mitigate impact to Applied and our customers. Relative to technology positions, I think nothing has really changed versus what we thought before. China will continue to incrementally invest. This year, the domestic business is more heavily weighted to foundry logic than memory. Similar to 2017, it was more foundry logic. 2019, we see more weighted more towards foundry logic. But China will definitely continue to incrementally invest. We don't see any hockey stick relative to future investment, and we still believe it's going to take a long time for their technology to mature to get anywhere close to the leading edge. But again, incrementally, we still see China as a very positive market for Applied.",241

So yes, I think it was 2000 -- maybe it was 2013, we talked about the 2D -- the 3D NAND inflection and the business moving from litho-intensive to etch and deposition-intensive. And as I talked about earlier, we've grown our memory revenue from 2013 about 5x. We've increased share 7%. We're optimistic that the scaling is going to continue for 3D NAND. The -- and we have some really tremendously enabling capabilities. The etch business for us is continuing to grow. Our conductor etch share is in a leadership position.

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,49,"Sorry, my line got dropped in the middle but sorry if this was asked. But on the prepared remarks, you guys talk about patterning. You guys are growing your patterning business and potentially adding $1 billion over the next 5 years. And when we talk to investors, some of them are worried that UV might actually reduce the patterning TAM. So if it's possible, can you guys provide maybe some examples of why you think your patterning business can grow? Is it driven by share gain, new processes, new architecture, et cetera?",92

So we have a number of really strong products in the patterning market -- oh I'm sorry, I wasn't on I guess. So the -- yes, we have a number of a strong products in the patterning market, the Sym3, Selectra, the CMP business is also growing as more patterning steps are adopted. We have new deposition capabilities. So our overall market, as you talked about, grew $1 billion over the last few years. We have a lot of confidence and line of sight to additional $1 billion over the next few years. So if you look at the market overall, about 50% is memory. Certainly, our share there is growing a significant amount. You have trailing geometries, about 25%. 25% is leading foundry and logic. And we see in the foundry logic significant traction if we look at our share of patterning in 5-nanometers. And our overall TAM in 5 versus 7 goes up something like 25%. Our positional share in 5 will also go up and especially in patterning. So as multi-patterning gets further adopted and EUV steps are adopted, all of that is incrementally positive for Applied. EUV steps are replacing positions that Applied really isn't present today. So both of those areas, the growth in EUV, the growth in multi-patterning, are positive for Applied. And the other thing I would say relative to patterning, there are really 2 major areas of focus. One is shrinking features, but the other one is placing features in the right position. And if you look from an overall industry perspective, this pattern placement or alignment is a big challenge for customers. So we have a very good position as some of these new processes are adopted. And certainly, we have a good line of sight to the future technology nodes. So for Applied, EUV is positive, our positions are positive and we have good line of sight to that additional growth.",325

To me, it comes down to 3 things. First, our markets and, in particular, our company. What we continue to see going forward, our business is going to be sustainably larger. It's more diverse, less volatile, less cyclical than it's been in the past. 
A couple of proof points we look at. In my intro, I talked about how we can now do the same level of earnings in a single quarter that we used to do in a full year a short while ago. Something else to think about. Even with the adjustments in spend that our customers have made this year, the lowest quarter of EPS in 2018 will be higher than any quarter in 2017, which was an all-time record for the company. 
Second, 2019, we see continued strength. The more we talk to both customers and others in the tech ecosystem, the more we believe we're on the beginning of a powerful new wave. Applied Materials is on the critical path. Those trends depend on what Applied does best. 
Third, 2020 financial model, on track to exceed the targets we have out there. What I'd also say is behind the scenes, we're building a pipeline, strong pipeline of new products, new innovations, new opportunities that set us up extremely well in the years beyond. As Gary said, we've never been better positioned as a company than we are today. 
Lastly, the Citigroup conference is coming up in a few weeks. I look forward to seeing many of you there. And just let us know if you have any questions. We want to be helpful. We're here to help. Just let us know.

In our fourth fiscal quarter, Applied Materials posted solid results in line with our guidance. Despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year, each of our major businesses delivered double-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees around the world, and I would like to thank them for all their contributions over the past year.
While we expect market headwinds to continue in the near term, we're not seeing the large fluctuations that characterized the semiconductor and display equipment industries in the past. At the same time, we are demonstrating that we have built a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams that can execute well in a range of market conditions. Looking further ahead, we are confident that longer-term growth drivers in both semiconductor and display remain firmly in place and will continue to create great opportunities for Applied.
During the call today, I'll start with our perspective on near-term market dynamics then I'll summarize Applied's performance and priorities and finish by talking about the future growth drivers reshaping our industry and describing the company's strategy and investments to address the evolving needs of our customers and the substantial opportunities ahead.
Over the past several years, I've shared my perspective that the wafer fab equipment industry has fundamentally changed. Today, it is structurally larger and less volatile than it was in the past. These changes are due to increasingly diverse market drivers spanning consumer, enterprise and industrial applications.
In recent months, however, we've seen several factors negatively impacting industry spending. These include elevated macroeconomic risks, global trade tensions and, specific to our industry, a pullback in memory investments. Recent commentary by memory makers has painted a consistent picture. Overall demand in the server, PC and mobile markets is weaker than it was earlier in the year, and memory prices are softening in the near term. Our customers tell us they expect demand to pick up and pricing to stabilize in the second half of 2019.
I believe the pullback in memory spending we're going through today is different from the down cycles of the past. There are several reasons for this. Supply and demand are relatively well balanced. Customers' investments in capacity are rational and disciplined, and the overall economics of the memory industry remain healthy.
In foundry and logic, overall spending levels are strong as customers optimize capacity at the current nodes while concurrently pushing forward the leading edge. After a long time in development, the first EUV tools are expected to enter volume production in 2019. To support the initial adoption of EUV, we are seeing additional investments in these long lead time systems in 2018 and 2019 creating share headwinds for Applied during this period. In aggregate, even with the current challenges I've just described, overall wafer fab equipment spending remains at consistently high levels. We still believe that 2018 and 2019 combined spending will be around $100 billion. Relative to our prior view, we now see '18 as slightly higher than '19.
While we are cognizant of macroeconomic and global trade factors, our long-term perspective on major technology trends is unchanged. Fundamental growth drivers are firmly in place as more industries are becoming increasingly dependent on technology, data, and specifically, silicon to define their futures.
One of the things that distinguishes Applied from our peers is our broad technology base and the diversity of our products. This provides us with a platform for future growth and the flexibility to deliver solid financial performance in a variety of market conditions. Although our first fiscal quarter will be down sequentially and year-on-year, we will deliver performance that is approximately equivalent to our average quarterly run rate in 2017 when spending patterns were much more favorable for Applied. This is because we've been building out our product portfolio to better address major technology inflections.
For example, we significantly improved our position in memory, adding nearly 10 points of market share in the past 5 years. At the same time, we've scaled our service business at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the past 4 years with plenty of headroom for further expansion. Additionally, we've grown our display business at more than 25% compound annual growth over the past 6 years. While our display growth trajectory may not be linear and, as we previously stated, revenues could be down around 20% in 2019, I feel very good about our future opportunities. 
Across the company, we're taking a long-term perspective, and we continue to prioritize our spending towards R&D to enable major technology inflections for our customers and drive our long-term growth strategy. I strongly believe that over the next decade, AI and big data will transform almost every sector of the economy, and that the foundation of those changes are electronics and semiconductors. Enabling this AI, big data future will require new types of computing at the edge and in the cloud, lower-cost, lower-power chips and abundant storage.
As classic Moore's Law scaling slows down, the semiconductor industry's traditional playbook is not providing the necessary improvements in power, performance, area and cost. As a result, a new playbook is needed, which includes the development of entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new exotic materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways. All 5 of these areas require major advances in materials engineering and create a wealth of opportunity for Applied. As a result, we are evolving our strategy and making investments to position the company to play a larger and more valuable role in the AI, big data era. 
We are creating new and unique capabilities for the industry and developing entirely new types of products. Earlier today, we announced plans for our new materials engineering technology accelerator, or META Center, which is expected to open in 2019 in New York. The META Center will extend the capabilities of our Maydan Technology Center in Silicon Valley to address the ecosystem's growing need to accelerate innovation from materials to systems. This expansion of our R&D infrastructure will allow us to work with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community in new ways. It's designed to support new types of collaboration from early prototyping to rapid transfer of new technologies from lab to fab.
We're already seeing strong pull for earlier and deeper customer engagements, especially for new integrated material solutions where we can combine multiple processes together often within a single system. We are bringing together our broad portfolio of technologies and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification to address our customers' increasingly complex integration challenges. I'm excited about the value we can create at current, future and trailing nodes.
Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. While the industry is navigating near-term headwinds, spending remains robust. We believe this demonstrates that wafer fab equipment is structurally larger and less cyclical than in the past. Although the current spending patterns within wafer fab equipment do not play to Applied's strengths, we are still delivering strong financial performance, thanks to the breadth of our product portfolio. We remain focused on positioning the company for the long term, expanding our role in the AI, big data era and winning the major technology inflections ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dan.",1255
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2018",2018-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3297.0,1614084.0,63607805.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. I'd also like to thank the teams for delivering record revenue and operating profit in fiscal 2018. Today, I'll share my perspective on our industry outlook then summarize our Q4 financial results, provide our Q1 business outlook and discuss the growth investments we're making in upstate New York.
As Gary said, overall industry demand is weaker today than in the first half of 2018, and we expect our first quarter results to be lower sequentially. Our guidance includes the impact of a recent export restriction. Without this, we would have guided our semiconductor revenue to be higher sequentially. While we're not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle, we are optimistic that we're not going to see the same kind of volatility we saw in the past as an industry or as a company. 
Our semi equipment guidance for Q1 implies annualized WFE in the mid-$40 billion range. It's important to note that this is about $10 billion higher than in all of the years prior to the current cycle. And it reinforces our positive industry thesis, which is based on 3 core beliefs. First, we see a large market for PCs and mobile devices plus the emergence of a big wave of new demand drivers related to AI and big data. Second, we believe that after a long downtrend, capital equipment intensity has stabilized. And third, our customers are more profitable and taking proactive steps to keep supply and demand in balance.
We believe the industry is more attractive and the company is more attractive. Over the past 6 years, Applied has built a bigger, more diverse, more resilient business. In fact, in both 2017 and 2018, we delivered more than twice the operating profit of any other year in the past decade.
Looking forward to 2019, our customers point to an improving demand outlook in the second half of the year. Even if the shape of the recovery off of our Q1 guidance is shallower and more gradual, we believe we will generate higher earnings this fiscal year than in 2017. Our improved profitability enables us to continue making disciplined investments in our future growth opportunities while simultaneously delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders.
Now I'll summarize our Q4 results. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP gross margin that was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. We held non-GAAP OpEx below the midpoint and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.97, just above the midpoint.
Turning to the segments. Semiconductor systems revenue declined by about 5% year-over-year and was slightly below our expectation. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 29.6%. Our global services business revenue grew by 18% year-over-year to $977 million, and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 29.7%. Our display group delivered $702 million in revenue, which was slightly above our target. Non-GAAP operating margin remained high at 29.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Operating cash flow improved to 27% or nearly $1.1 billion. We returned $946 million to shareholders, including $751 million in buybacks. We ended the period with $5.6 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $4.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We enter fiscal 2019 with a strong backlog of over $6 billion. 
Next, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue to be between $3.56 billion and $3.86 billion. Within the outlook, we expect silicon systems revenue to be down by about 21% year-over-year. Services revenue should be up by about 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 of 2018 was exceptionally strong for our services business with revenue up 30% over Q1 2017. Our display revenue should be up by about 10% year-over-year. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.75 to $0.83 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 12%. As a reminder, this is up by nearly 6 points when compared to last year's rate.
Now I'll close by discussing the investments we're making in New York. Earlier today, Applied and the state announced plans to create one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. The META Center will pioneer the materials, process technologies and architectures our customers will need to overcome the industry scaling challenges. Applied is committed to investing $600 million over the first 7 years of the agreement, including both cash and in-kind contributions. Our planned investments will not raise the operating expense targets in our longer-term financial model. New York state will invest $250 million to purchase and install tools and equipment. State funding of the META Center is subject to a variety of approvals, and we expect to secure public funding by the end of this calendar year. We intend to ramp up our activities in calendar 2019 and target pilot production in the second half of the year. The META Center will dramatically expand our capacity to collaborate with our customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor power, performance and cost.

So you talked about EUV as a likely headwind into '19 but also investments you're making in terms of technological inflection. So curious, can you kind of walk through the timing where we could see a resumption of share gains on the WFE side. And also, as you think about mix in 2019, does that allow you to perhaps at least grow in line? Would love to hear your thoughts, I guess, both '19 as well as inflections beyond that.",91

Let me give you some color on market share, and I think it's useful to think about 3 time frames: what we've done, what we see today and where we're going. When I joined Applied in 2012, we substantially shifted investment towards big inflections. As a result, in the 6 years through 2017, we held or increased share for 6 consecutive years. I think we were up 5 years and flat 1. And also, we increased share in memory where we had a big focus. So we increased our total share of memory spending by about 10 points. So in the near term, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, 2018, we're gaining or holding share in the vast majority of our businesses, but we also see rapid growth in EUV and also in other markets where we don't compete. So as a result, we do expect our share to decline in 2018. After many years of development, we expect to see the first EUV tools used in production beginning in 2019. Those tools have very long lead times. And to support the initial adoption, we expect high spending in 2018 and 2019, creating a mix headwind for our overall WFE share. Of course, those long lead time shipments also are positive indicator for our future business. And another thing -- you talked, C.J., about mix. Another important near-term factor to think about is 3D NAND spending. Once that recovers, the mix will become a lot more favorable for us. And then over -- the last thing is over the longer term -- over the last couple of months, I've spent time with many customers and still believe that the industry needs a new playbook beyond 2D scaling, and I deeply believe that Applied is in the best position to enable this new playbook. I heard this from all of the customers I met over the last couple of months. And we've all seen classic Moore's Law scaling slowing. All the customers in the industry want more ways to drive PPAC, power, performance, area and cost. So as we've communicated before, we're driving a new playbook that includes 5 different techniques that I've been talking about, including developing entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new materials, new ways to shrink including EUV and self-aligned patterning and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways. All 5 of those areas require major advances in materials engineering and create great growth opportunities for Applied. As a result of that, we're creating new and unique capabilities for the industry, investing in the META Center to accelerate materials to systems where there's tremendous value and developing entirely new types of products to move the needle for our customers and for Applied.",472

We hear LG and Samsung ramping and converting capacity on Gen 8 OLED TVs with some weakness on the flexible Gen 6 lines. Also, you guys launched a couple of new products at OLED World Summit were e-beam, CD metrology and e-beam failure. So just your thoughts on display market next year.",77

So happy to give you color on our display business. As we've said before, we've grown display a tremendous amount over the last 6 years at about 25% compound annual growth rate. For 2019, we've talked about the business declining in the range of 15% to 20%. And given the elevated risk, I believe we're likely to be at the low end of that range. So then if you go into the different segments, in the TV segment, I continue to expect our customers will transition to Gen 10.5 technology because it's strategically important for them to deliver lower cost for large-screen TVs. And as we've previously communicated, with Gen 10.5 panels, you can produce 8 65-inch TVs, and you only get 3 on a Gen 8.5 panel. So for large-screen TVs, it is strategically compelling to move to those larger panel sizes. And recent discussions with customers, we don't see any change in customers' plans. In the smartphone area, demand is going to be flat year-over-year. But we continue to see OLED as the best technology for the future for a number of different reasons, and we believe that OLED will recover as more suppliers are able to produce at a higher yield. So overall, we see a lot of good opportunities to continue to drive our display business despite 2019 for the first time in, I think, 7 years seeing a decline in the business.",242

So I'm trying to reconcile what you just described, and that makes sort of sense. So EUV is ramping. You're mechanically losing share in that context, but you're expecting to regain share when you bring materials technologies that will go along with EUV lithography. But at the same time, in the last few weeks, I heard like TSMC, I mean, reiterating that say that's for longer, so like the large foundry player that they don't expect CapEx to grow significantly.

We strongly believe that the industry needs a new playbook and that all of those 5 techniques I talked about earlier are absolutely crucial to deliver power, performance, area and cost needed for this big data, AI era. Now silicon and electronics are going to be at the foundation of all of those major industry transformations, changing in a profound way all the aspects of our life. We still definitely believe that. And if you look at where we need to go with 1,000 times improvement of performance per watt, you can look certainly at what we've said in the past. You can look at what other people are saying also that talk about those 5 areas of focus. And I deeply believe we're in a better position longer term than we've ever been. Now certainly, there's a headwind in '18 and '19. After a long time, you have the initial adoption of long lead time EUV tools. They'll go into production for the first time in 2019. That's going to certainly provide a headwind for us in the near term. But longer term, I definitely believe the industry is not going to get where we need to go with doing what we've done in the past. I think it's also very clear with Moore's Law -- classic Moore's Law slowing down that you have to drive this new playbook. And there's tremendous value in going from materials to systems at a much faster rate. And again, everything I heard in meetings with customers over the last couple of months totally reiterates that that's the right strategy. And so that's my thought.",301

And then a quick housekeeping for Dan. What's the impact from export control on Fujian? Was it about $100 million for you guys?",74

Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing around the WFE market and then come to the profitability -- the implications that, that has for the profitability of the company. So in the prepared comments, we talked about 2018 and 2019 combined being around $100 billion. I would say, given the elevated risk profile of the environment we find ourselves in, that's -- our expectations around '19 have probably softened in the last 3 months. We now see '19 below 2018. If I were to -- and I think it's premature to be point specific on either '18, '19 or the device types. But again, to just share a little bit of what we're thinking to help shape a view of the market, 2019 feels more like 2017 than it does 2018. And if I look at where we sit today in 2018 WFE, all-time high in terms of aggregate spend and strength across each of the 4 device types. And as I profile off of that view into '19, we would expect memory to be down and foundry, logic to be up. And then if I were to rank order the 4 device types as we look into '19 given everything we see today, foundry would be the strongest, then followed by logic, then followed by DRAM, then followed by NAND. In terms of profitability, I think the best way to think about our business is less about end market profiling the 4 device types and more about the mix amongst our businesses. The more of our leadership businesses and equipment that we sell, you'll see that be a favorable segment mix -- or a favorable product mix within the segment. The less leadership business -- or the less leadership products we sell will certainly be a headwind from a margin perspective. So I'd look at it more as a product mix influence as opposed to end markets.",325

And then the other part of the question was around this recent action that was directed by a particular Chinese customer. From what we see today, this feels like business as usual for the other customers in the region. And in regarding the geopolitical situation, we certainly believe in fair trade, and we think it's important for the overall ecosystem to have a constructive relationship between the U.S. and China. We can't speculate on any other actions that could take place. And of course, we continuously monitor the situation, and we're going to respond appropriately. And then Dan, do you want to give color on the magnitude of the impact?",111

So as we think about our guide into Q1 and we think about the export action that was taken against the one specific customer, we -- a quarter ago, we're expecting our semi business to be flat to up sequentially. We guided down a bit. In the absence of this export restriction, we would have been up sequentially in our semi systems business into Q1. And I would say that our revenue with that one customer in Q1 is a meaningful number. So the EPS guidance we provided into Q1 reflects a significant reduction in semiconductor revenue along with an unfavorable mix within the product portfolio. And I think that gives you a sense of the impact of that action on the one customer. I don't think we want to be more specific since it is a direct read-through on one customer, but I think that's enough to give you a sense of what the impact to our company was in our fiscal Q1.",166

I'm wondering, was that relative to the overall Applied revenue stream, the silicon business? Was that a sequential comment or a year-over-year comment? I guess, specifically, with the silicon business, Dan, being down over 20% year-over-year, I believe, relative to your Jan guidance, do you think that, that will represent a year-over-year bottom that we can start to build off of? Or how should we think about that?",94

Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing in the market, and hopefully, it helps provide some context and color that gets at the essence of what you're asking about. I would say based on our customer conversations -- and the guidance we gave about not calling the bottom is specifically related to our semi business because I think that's where the biggest question in the market is today. Based on the customer conversations we're having, we think that first half 2019 would likely be higher than second half 2018. But we also think given the elevated risk profile -- or the elevated risk environment we find ourselves in, geopolitical, trade, handsets, industrials being on the weaker side, that's certainly offset by decent markets in PC, comm infrastructure, cloud CapEx, but as a package creates an elevated risk profile, we think it's prudent to create an expectation around a shallow, gradual, U-shaped recovery of the semi business into 2019. And so for a variety of reasons, I don't think we want to put a stake in the ground and call it a definitive bottom, but we like what we see and are trying to be prudent in expectation setting.",205

I think last quarter, you guys said that 2019 China domestic was looking more kind of heavily weighted towards foundry. Has your view changed in light of some of -- has your viewed changed in light of this activity with some of the other memory suppliers that are looking to potentially ramp both NAND and DRAM capabilities maybe starting second half of next year?",108

Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes, as I said earlier, we don't really see any change in the activities with the other customers in the region. Of course, we're going to continuously monitor that and respond to anything that we need to respond to. But one thing that may be helpful is I give you color on our China business, how it's composed. So our display, we have a large display business in China, and a little less than half of our revenue is semi systems. Roughly half of that is multinational. The other half is domestic. And for domestic, we're fairly balanced between foundry, logic and memory. And when we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, consistent with what we've said before, we didn't see a hockey stick in terms of growth in the domestic market. And we continue to see modest growth in the semi market going forward. So I would say, at least today, we don't see any change in behavior with our customers. And that's basically the profile of the different parts of our business, which is pretty consistent with what we've said before.",189

So services had a pretty strong year in fiscal '18. It looks like it was up about 25% year-on-year, and you're guiding it down sequentially a bit for January, if I interpreted your comments correctly.

I think the best way to think about services growth, certainly, the installed base is an influencer, but it's not a direct read-through. So I don't think that business will directly track the following year what our systems business does the prior year. But there is a growth vector around the installed base. There is a growth vector around the increasing complexity that the industry is facing and the challenges our customers are increasingly asking for help with to drive yields. And the third is the strategy we have around comprehensive service agreements to get a bit more predictability in the business versus the transactional nature. And so it's a multi-vector approach and strategy to growing the business. You point out that the company has done a great job executing that strategy. 2018 was a strong year, and our goal will be to grow that -- continue to grow that business at a 15% CAGR on a go-forward basis. So it's a business we feel good about, but I don't think you can make a direct read-through based on systems in any 1 year.",189

Because when I look over the last 5 years of growth in the semi cap equipment industry, it kind of coincided with the growth of high-end smartphones. But as they are slowing down, when can the enterprise and data center be big enough to offset those declines? And do you think it is possible that WFE kind of stays flattish for the next 2 to 3 years because of this dynamic?",94
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2018",2018-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3297.0,1614084.0,63607834.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,32,"Yes. Thanks, Vivek. As we take a step back from what drives WFE, if we were to go back a decade in our industry, a vast majority of WFE was narrowly focused in and around the PC platform. Since then, we've diversified into mobility compute handsets. We've got a leg in the data center. You can see big data cloud service providers beginning to influence that. IoT is playing an increasingly large portion of semiconductor consumption as are things like autonomous driving and Industry 4.0. It's really hard to disaggregate those long-term technology trends that are increasingly depending on silicon and consuming silicon to a direct read-through on WFE. That chain is extremely hard to disaggregate and attribute one to the other. The second thing I would say is units and handsets clearly are slowing down. Content gains are still happening, and so we do see favorable trends in that industry. What I like is the broadening of the end market demand drivers that support our industry. And so as you take a look at how 2017 profiled '18 and now a quick look into '19, you can see that our industry is structurally larger. Even though the adjustments or headwinds in any given period or quarter are coming from different areas, you can see that, that diversification is serving the industry well in terms of moderating a bit of the volatility the industry has seen historically. I would say as we roll the clock forward and we take a point of view on what we think aggregate semiconductor demand is going to be in this world, this is an industry that's $450 billion-ish today. It's going to be $600 billion, $700 billion, $800 billion at some point in the future manufacturing capacity to produce the wafers and chips that support an industry that's sized at those levels. It's going to be a very favorable trend for our industry. So if we were to be sitting here in 2025 talking about a $50 billion WFE, I would be extremely disappointed about that given what we know today.",347

Thanks, Tim. So what we said about our capital allocation strategy is we're going to focus our excess cash on growing the company, maintaining a strong and healthy balance sheet and then returning excess cash to shareholders. I think what you see is us executing against that strategy. If you narrow the time frame to any given quarter, the share repurchase may or may not be above where we trade on any given day. If we take a look at what the company has done over a long period of time, in the last 2 decades, we've given back close to 90% of our free cash flow back to shareholders. Our shares peaked at 1.7 billion shares outstanding. Today, it's under 1 billion. This is something the company has done for a very long time, not a new policy. And if you look at our 3-year track record, the company has given back about $8 billion, and we've repurchased almost 20% of the company at an average price of $37.

Thanks for the question Toshiya. We -- actually, in 2018, we're gaining or holding share in the vast majority of our businesses where we compete today. There are markets that we don't compete, and we have initiatives in those areas that -- where we have very strong pull from customers. And we're optimistic that over time that, that will provide a significant increase in business for us. And then the other thing I would say, probably the biggest factor longer term is this new playbook I mentioned with the 5 different drivers. That is really playing to the strengths -- uniquely to the strengths of Applied Materials with the breadth of our products, all the different materials creation, materials removal, materials modification and also the ability to combine all of these different technologies together in a single platform where you manage these interfaces. That is a really, really, really valuable capability. I met with all of our large customers in the last 2, 3 months. Many times, people running R&D, some of the feedback I was getting was just tremendous. People saying things that they didn't think were possible relative to power, performance, area and cost. So those things will not play out in 2018 and not so much in 2019. But really, that is the big driver for the industry. This new playbook going forward is extremely important, and Applied is in a very unique position to enable those capabilities. So that's why we're investing. That's why we announce the META Center. And the goal is really to drive materials to systems many times faster than we're at today. We think there's tremendous value there.

So I guess, I understand capital intensity is increasing, but it didn't seem like it was inflecting that much in any one year. So how is DRAM despite -- even with pushouts having such a robust year?

As Gary talked, since he came into the company or when he came into the company, we had one end market that was over 20% from a market share standpoint. All others were 15% or below. And the company has done a very good job diversifying across those device types to where we're almost agnostic across the device types from a market share standpoint. And DRAM has been one of the beneficiaries. The company's worked really hard with customers to deliver innovation when their road maps require it and it's allowed us to increase our market share with those customers. We're increasingly seeing in the periphery transistors logic-like processes being adopted to drive I/O speeds on the devices. And that accrues benefits to us as well in some of our higher market share businesses. And so the set up around DRAM going forward is a good one for us. It's been good over the last several years. And as you pointed out, we've done a good job driving market share there, and we like that setup going forward as well. So we like the progress we're making in DRAM.",219

You can use those -- some of those drivers can make a big difference, move the needle on current devices and also on trailing geometries, even planar transistors. So that's -- and we're seeing strong pull from customers across the board for some of those major drivers. At the AI Design Forum in July and at the Electronics Resurgence Initiative, the DARPA conference in July, one of the examples we gave was 1,000x improvement in leakage current. Again, many of these new technologies that we're driving can be used in trailing geometries and even current geometries. So we don't need to wait for the adoption of 3-nanometer. Certainly, some of those technologies will be targeted for leading technology nodes, but some of them can be used today.",146

You guided gross margin at 44.6%, and that's quite a bit lower than your fiscal '20 model of 47%. Understand that's less about end market and more about product mix between leadership and growth products, but can you explain what situation will lead you to see higher growth for your leadership products versus growth? And I would assume first half of '19, you'll see growth business a little slower because of memory spending. I mean, the display revenue's already at lower level. Just trying to think about what's the path for you to get to the fiscal '20 margin target from here, how much is driven by mix versus volume.",122

Thanks, Sidney. Let me try to unpack that and walk through this systematically. If there's anything I leave out, please follow up. What I would say about gross margins, we've done a good job over the last handful of years. We've increased the gross margin by about 500 basis points. Q4 gross margin, in line with our guidance. And as you know, actual gross margins in any given quarter are going to be a function of several factors. There's a revenue level, segment, product mix, customer mix, factory activity, all of those will vary quarter-to-quarter. We're seeing Q1 as part of our guide sequentially lower from a revenue standpoint. AGS continues to be a growing part of the mix. And we talked about an ERP transition throughout 2018 to risk mitigate customer deliveries. At a point of the cycle where the supply chain was very tight, we kept an elevated level of inventory to make sure our customer needs were covered. We're going to be bringing that factory activity level down over the next 3, 4 quarters to bring that inventory more in line with the natural progression. And so clearly, there's a number of factors at play. And I guess, the thing that I would point to the most is aggregate revenue level and then how that revenue profiles across our various products and amongst our segments are going to be the largest influencer to gross margin. Company has done a good job driving those margins historically. I wouldn't look too much in any one given quarter, and we're going to continue to work hard and make progress and continue to drive gross margins off of these levels.",280

Thanks, Mike. I guess, I want to close with a couple of thoughts first. We all know that we're in a challenging environment. I think the company has delivered strong results in 2018, but we're definitely not satisfied. We know we still have a lot of work to do, and we're going to work aggressively to achieve the goals we set for the company. 
I guess, the second thing is, is if we fast-forward to a year from now, when we look back at our Q1 results, they may prove to be the low point of the year, but we're not ready to call Q1 the bottom until we've collected multiple proof points across a variety of our businesses. I think if you look at sort of the company's and the way we've engaged in the past, many of you that follow our journey, you know our style is to be transparent. Our goal, our intent is to help you see what we see. As tough as the environment feels right now, the industry is substantially higher than it was even compared to prior peaks. We're confident that our long-term thesis around the industry, the long-term technology trends are going to be favorable, and they're firmly in place. We also believe we've built a more resilient business, a company that is more profitable. It allows us to invest and uniquely be well positioned to drive the industry inflections that we already see on the horizon. I guess, lastly, finally, I look forward to seeing many of you at the Credit Suisse conference in a couple of weeks. Thanks very much.",271
