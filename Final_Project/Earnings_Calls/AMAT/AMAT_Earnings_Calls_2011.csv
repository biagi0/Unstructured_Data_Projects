251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3082.0,106483.0,7248779.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Splinter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials started our 2011 fiscal year with a very solid first quarter. We posted revenue of $2.7 billion, generated $659 million of non-GAAP operating income and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target. Orders were approximately $3 billion, backlog is building, and our outlook for the year as a whole is improving.
For Applied, 2010 was a year of share gains and increasing profitability. We have carried this momentum into 2011. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our innovation engine. Last year, Applied ranked eighth in the U.S. and 33rd in the world for international PCT patent filings. I'd like to recognize our technologists and engineers for this noteworthy achievement.
Let me now turn to the economic outlook. 2010 was a strong recovery year across the board, and 2011 is shaping up to be even better for our Semiconductor Service and Solar businesses. Since the start of the year, we have seen increasing optimism about the macro environment, although this is tempered with realism about risk factors, including inflation, political instability and unemployment. Strong demand for consumer electronics is being generated by innovative new products, and this is driving our Semiconductor and Display customers to invest in capacity and new technology.
The market for smartphones grew 55% in 2010, and similar growth is forecast for 2011. We've seen the promise of the tablet market being realized, with 11 million units sold in the last three months of the year. There is an exciting lineup of new tablets ready for launch, and we expect sales to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million units this year. 
The solar market exceeded our expectations in 2010, with over six gigawatts of PV modules installed in the last calendar quarter, bringing the total for the year to 17 gigawatts. We believe this robust growth will continue in 2011, and we anticipate panel installations to be in the range of 21 to 25 gigawatts. Germany and Italy are projected to make up over half of the market this year, while California and China are becoming increasingly significant.
I'll now provide an update for each of our segments. In Semiconductor, smartphones and tablets are driving demand for mobile chipsets and solid-state storage, which translates to strong investments by our foundry, Logic and NAND customers. We maintain our view that PC growth will determine overall timing of the DRAM investment, and this remains the biggest swing factor in our WFE forecast. We believe DRAM prices have now bottomed out, and this is a positive sign for an eventual increase in spending. 
Following recent announcements by our largest customers, we now see WFE spending for calendar 2011 in the range of $34 billion to $36 billion, an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010 and well above our previous view. We also see capital intensity increasing, particularly in foundry. As the foundries transition to advanced processes at 40 and 28 nanometers, their capital intensity will reach the highest level in 10 years. 
Over the past two quarters, there has been a significant shift in the spending mix. Foundry and Logic are increasing as a percentage of overall WFE, with foundry projected to be close to 40% of the total spending in 2011.
NAND investment will approach its previous high, while DRAM spending is expected to drop to less than 15% of WFE, its lowest level in over a decade. We believe we gained about two points of 300-millimeter WFE share in 2010, and we anticipate gaining at least another point of share in 2011 despite a mix that is slightly unfavorable to Applied. 
Our gains in PDC are being fueled by customers' renewed investments in radical inspection, combined with net positional wins with our UVision Brightfield inspection tools at Logic and foundry customers. In etch, the adoption of our new Centris platform for double patterning and hardmask applications should help to offset an unfavorable mix effect and enable us to maintain market share following nearly four points of gain in 2010.
In summary, our growth and profitability in SSG is being fueled by innovative products and strong customer relationships. We have a rich product pipeline and have planned to launch over 12 new products in 2011. We see momentum building as the year progresses. And based on the timing of customer investment plans, we expect our revenue to be second half loaded. 
In Services, our market is growing, with wafer starts projected to increase in the range of 5% to 7% this year. AGS' growth was driven, primarily by our parts and services business, combined with strong demand for 200-millimeter tools. However, profitability was impacted by performance in our 200-millimeter equipment business. We have made a number of changes to our operations and organization. These are already having a positive impact, and we expect to see improvements in AGS' financial performance as the year progresses.
In Display, while TV growth remains strong, with over 70 million units shipped in the final quarter of 2010, we expect CapEx for this segment to be down by approximately 30% in 2011, dropping to around $9 billion. However, this traditional downturn in LCD investment cycle is being partially offset by strong investment in new technologies as customers add capacity for touch panels and high-performance LCD and OLED displays used in tablets and smartphones. Applied has excellent share in both of these markets. And this year, we expect to generate more than $250 million of revenue from products that serve these new applications. 
In Solar, as the industry scales, crystalline silicon module prices continue to fall, reaching spot prices as low as $1.50 per watt in calendar Q4. Our top customers remain profitable, are running their factories at full utilization and are increasing capacity. We are now projecting Crystalline Silicon CapEx for 2011 in the range of $7 billion to $9 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year.  We expect 90% of this new capacity to be added in China and Taiwan.
In the first quarter, our Solar business set new records for profitability. Baccini and PWS each shipped over 200 systems, more than the total number of units shipped in the first three quarters of 2010. Recently, our PWS group passed an important milestone by shipping their 2,000th wire saw. Crystalline Silicon bookings are at a record level, indicating another strong quarter of growth in Q2. Our visibility through the second half of the year is strengthening but is still limited.
In summary, Applied began 2011 with a strong first quarter and growing momentum across the company. 2011 is shaping up to be an excellent year for all of our businesses.  And based on our current view of the market, we expect to exceed $11 billion of revenue for the first time in our company's history. Our strategy is working effectively, resulting in share gains in our core businesses, growth in new businesses and greater efficiency and profitability.
 
Now let me hand the call over to George for further comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1188
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3082.0,106483.0,7248780.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. During our first quarter of 2011, Applied delivered earnings and net sales above the high end of our target ranges, led by our SSG and EES segments. Compared to our results from one year ago, net sales were up 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew more than 170%. This performance highlights the financial leverage in our business models and underpins the strong year-over-year earnings performance improvement we expect to see in 2011.
Now I will review our results versus the prior quarter. Orders were down slightly, with significant growth in Solar, partially offsetting reductions in our other businesses. Backlog increased to $3.5 billion, a 9% increase. Net sales declined 7% to $2.7 billion, as record Crystalline Silicon sales partially offset the expected drop in thin film solar and display sales. 
Non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was up slightly from last quarter, as improved EES margins more than offset lower margins in our other segments. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $486 million were better than our target range. This quarter included some onetime savings. And absent these items, expenses would have been at about the midpoint of our target range. 
Next quarter, we expect OpEx will fall within the range of $510 million to $530 million, with the increases targeted for field support of Semiconductor customers and to address market share opportunities. These customers are investing aggressively to ramp technology and capacity and expect us to increase our support. This theme is expected to continue throughout the year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.36. GAAP earnings per share were $0.38 and included the benefit of an adjustment to our restructuring reserves and the R&D tax credit. Our tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% and included a two-point reduction to reflect the R&D tax credit adjustment. We expect our effective rate for 2011 will be in the range of 27% to 28%, about a five-point reduction from our rate in 2010. This improvement is primarily due to the implementation of our Singapore operations hub and Asia-based supply chain.
Operating cash flow was $425 million or 16% of sales. We returned $243 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 11 million shares for $150 million and the payment of dividends of $93 million. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $4.1 billion, up over $200 million from last quarter. 
I'll now comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders were down 4% as DRAM bookings dropped nearly 40%, partially offset by higher foundry and flash demand. Three customers accounted for over 60% of SSG bookings this quarter, up from about 35% over the past two quarters. 
Net sales were up a modest 1%, and margins declined by less than two points due to mix and the impact of a settlement. As a result of customers' increased capital spending announcements, we expect net sales of SSG will begin to ramp in our fiscal third quarter.
AGS orders declined 13%, primarily due to lower demand for refurbished equipment. Net sales increased in line with higher wafer starts and some improvements in 200-millimeter equipment deliveries. Operating margins declined due to the continuing challenges in our 200-millimeter supply chain and the higher proportion of that business in AGS net sales. We expect to absorb the bulk of the remaining low-margin backlog in this quarter and see a return to more typical margins in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Display orders decreased 19% on lower demand for LCD equipment. Net sales were down 48%, reflecting the expected cyclical decline. Display operating margins were lower in line with the falloff in sales and the mix effect of sales into the OLED and touch screen markets. We expect our first and second fiscal quarters to represent the bottom of the cycle for the LCD market and that we will see a recovery in the second half of the year.
In the EES segment, orders increased to a record $668 million, with new highs in the Baccini and PWS Solar businesses. Net sales declined less than expected to $476 million. Sales of crystalline solar equipment grew almost 30%, partially offsetting the large SunFab sign-off that occurred in the prior quarter. 
Operating margin for the quarter of 30% reflected a favorable adjustment of $28 million related to the EES restructuring last year. The non-GAAP segment operating margin exceeded 25%. Margin performance in EES is well ahead of our model and reflects operating leverage on higher volumes, a concentration of Baccini sales and the benefits of our restructuring. 
Next, let me talk about our expectations for the second quarter. We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in line with the first quarter. AGS net sales are expected to grow about 3%, reflecting higher wafer starts. In Display, we believe net sales will be flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect EES net sales to be up at least 10% on strong demand from China, with a heavier mix of sales to wafering customers.
Overall, we expect the company's second quarter net sales to be flat to up 5%, with shipment timing in Semiconductor and Solar as the biggest swing factors. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.34 and $0.38 per share. 
Looking ahead, we see momentum building for our strongest year ever and now expect fiscal year non-GAAP earnings per share to exceed $1.50 at the $11 billion revenue level based on the market sizing Mike described. This would represent a 70% increase in our non-GAAP earnings per share on a 15% increase in revenue. We will provide more details about our full year financial outlook at our Investor and Analyst Meeting on March 23 from New York City.

Well, there's a number of things. If we just start with demand, if we look at Q4, we saw over 6 gigawatts of capacity, of module capacity being installed in the field in Q4. When you look at that on a run rate basis, that requires about 25 gigawatts of yearly capacity. We think, operationally, today, there is about 28 gigawatts that are really in effective production. So that means all the factories are full. That's why our major customers are seeing factories full, and that's why they're aggressively adding capacity. Still and now when you think about end demand for 2011, we think it's going to be very strong. As I said, we think Germany and Italy will lead the way,  but there are just many other countries getting into the mix, not only in Europe but now throughout the rest of the world. Still, our visibility into the second half, while it's improving and I would say strengthening, it's still hard to see in this market the second half of the year. We have to see continued demand growth to justify the capacity. But today, there is not enough silicon, not enough wafering capacity to meet the demand that we expect to occur this year.",208

The move of activities out of our Singapore operations hub is a long-term commitment to, number one, first and foremost, meeting our customers' needs with the shortest possible cycle times. We have a largely Asia-based customer base now, and so there's a lot of reason to continue that. The spending is really more a function of opportunities. We wanted to build on our market share momentum in the semiconductor area. But also just the sheer volume of activity that we're seeing picking up with our customers,  they're looking for us to help them. A lot of this activity is at the very leading edge. And so it's something that we need to do, and we think we'll have a very good return.",129

I mean, you've done a fantastic job in the operational enhancement. Which innings are we in that? And how do we think about it going forward?

But the fact of the matter is we feel very good about where our cost structure is today and that the types of things that we're flexing are the things that you want to flex in response to opportunities, but we still have a very strong variable cost structure. And so we know that if we need to, we have the ability to flex the other way as well. In terms of kind of our what inning we're in, we have a continuous improvement mentality. So we don't believe in innings. We kind of -- you got to keep looking for opportunities to be more efficient and effective. And so I would say though, just to use your analogy, we're in the early innings still in our Singapore operations hub. So there's -- I think over the next five years, we'll see the full benefit of that, but our mentality about continuous improvement is intact.",171

Worst case, maybe one point. And quite frankly, I think what you're seeing is we came off of a very, very strong Q4. If you look over the last several quarters, this Q1 '11 would actually be the second strongest quarter they've had in multiple quarters in terms of operating margin. So I think we had a little bit of a mix issue compared to Q4, a little bit of impact of the settlement, but the business model's intact.",103

I know you gained two points last year, and you're thinking it could be one point this year. I know you said mix is having that impact.

We've been surprised how far down the DRAM orders and revenue have dropped and how fast they've dropped. We knew that DRAM wasn't going to spend as much, but it's running at a pretty low level right now. I don't want to make too big of a deal about that, but we're pretty confident about our share gain. With foundry spending, we're going to gain in PVD and CMP. And people at 28 nanometers now have to buy a new radical inspection equipment, and we've positioned our tools there very, very nicely. So I think those areas are going to provide the biggest pop on share gain in SSG.",115

Now there's almost like there's the new segment here with touch panels, with OLED and the high-performance LCD displays for tablets and smartphones. And what we're seeing this year is about a $500 million overall investment for that. We'll get -- our products will get more than half of that, actually probably more than 60% of that spending. We think that spending is going to continue and increase into next year as both volume goes up and more companies adopt these high-performance displays.

Why don't I take a shot at that. Our view is we're clearly seeing very strong bookings for the Solar business right now. We expect orders to pick up for our Semiconductor customers throughout the year. In Display, we're still at the cyclical bottom, so we ought to see some improvement there as well. And I would expect AGS to be a little bit more ratable going forward. So I think those elements would drive you to have on order outlook that's in line with a stronger second half.

And whether it comes back in the second half of the year or the beginning of 2012, it makes me have more confidence in the length of this cycle. When you look at what memory is as a percent of WFE right now, it's around 30%. Back in '07, at the previous peak, it was 70%. So there's a lot of, now, and spending was roughly at the same levels, overall. So I think there's a lot of room to move in the memory area, but of course, we got to see a strong PC growth to warrant that. But I'm encouraged, because I expected prices to kind of -- DRAM prices to hit bottom around June, to hit bottom in January, starting to strengthen already.

What we're seeing, for instance, in this quarter, while it was a flat, there was a lot going on. And if you look at the kinds of things that we're -- the potential mix effects as we get a recovery in Display, that helps lift our overall gross margins. But as we get a higher mix of Solar, it has lower gross margins than kind of our average margin as a company, even though, as you've seen, the operating performance was just outstanding this quarter. So a very strong Solar is a good story, but it will bring down our average gross margin a little bit. We don't see any fundamental change to the gross margin structure of our Semiconductor business. And AGS, which has struggled in the first couple of quarters of this year will improve in the second half. So I expect, overall, the second half will be a stronger gross margin period for the company. But any time you have a large load of Solar, that will dilute it a little bit.

So if we take a step back, last year, we believe our edge share was up about four points. A lot of that was in memory, where silicon edge in particular is increasingly favorable for us with varied word lines and debt lines. That's really a quite positive aspect for us. We've been gaining share in both NAND and foundry. Recently, we talked about our new platform, but are really trying to focus in on patterning and edging hardmask and helping with the double patterning definition. These things, this year, since I think is -- you know that we have some headwind this year with the foundry spending higher, DRAM spending lower, and we don't have that share at Intel. We believe that the gains that we're going to make will allow us to hold flat share in '11. So as memory spending comes back, we think it will be very positive for us. And inside of that, our intrinsic application share is growing.",165

I think that what's happening right now as I look at trying to develop the 28- and the 22-nanometer technologies, the capital per wafer start is going up quite dramatically. I think it will be very close to the Logic capital per wafer start at those nodes. In the past, foundries have had a pretty very significant advantage on capital per wafer start. We see that going away as the high-k/metal gate approaches, and the processes just get a lot more complex. So we're certainly seeing that this year and capital spending per dollar of revenue, and we think that's going to continue in the advanced nodes.",109

I'm pleased to report that for the first half of our fiscal year, Applied delivered record revenue and earnings. Our second fiscal quarter was one of the strongest financial performances in our history. 
We posted revenue of $2.9 billion and operating margin of 24%. Our earnings were at the high end of our target range, and we generated $704 million in operating cash flow. Our Solar business had an exceptionally strong quarter. With net sales of $637 million, EES [Energy and Environmental Solutions] set new records for revenue and profitability. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution, results and progress towards our strategic goals.
Shortly after the close of the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire Varian Semiconductor for a net price of $4.3 billion. We believe this represents our best and largest acquisition opportunity in the semiconductor equipment space. Varian adds a critical component, enabling us to provide customers with a full product portfolio for transistor fabrication and material modification. 
Keeping Moore's law in track has become a multifaceted challenge requiring new materials, new chip architectures and new approaches to transistor formation. By combining the strengths of Applied and Varian, our teams will work hand-in-hand with customers to accelerate the industry's technology road map. We are excited about the opportunities this will deliver for our customers, shareholders and employees.
Let me spend a few moments on the state of the economy and outlook for our markets. In recent months, we have seen a combination of events that are affecting the short-term economic outlook. Rising inflation in emerging markets and reduced consumer confidence have created an environment that necessitates caution. Unrest in the Middle East has resulted in uncertainty about energy prices and fuel cost. In addition, the economic impact of the tragic events in Japan is still not fully understood. 
These cumulative headwinds have recently led some of our Semiconductor and Display customers to push out near-term orders. Although we are mindful of these economic factors, we believe that the fundamental drivers within the electronics sector remains strong. Our customers have a firm foundation for a multiyear investment cycle based on the growing role of emerging market consumers, a global appetite for high-performance mobile products and the infrastructure build-out to support these trends.
Let me now provide an update for each of our segments. In Semiconductors, PC unit shipments in the first quarter were weaker than seasonal expectations, down 10% sequentially. Although we believe DRAM prices bottomed out in the fourth calendar quarter, prices remain soft. DRAM capital investment remains low and limited to technology conversions.
Tablet sales for the past 3 months were around 6 million units, due to supply constraints for the leading product and flow adoption for new entrants. As a result, our orders from a number of DRAM and foundry customers were weaker than expected. 
We still view 2011 as a strong year for WFE [wafer fabrication equipment] investment, and expect spending in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion. Capacity expansions are moving forward. And most importantly, the longer-term outlook for WFE remains strong. Industry fundamentals remain solid, with the top spenders reaffirming or increasing their capital investments. The leaders in logic and foundry are accelerating their plans for the 28- and 22-nanometer nodes, and increasing their investments in leading-edge technology.
In addition, low-power, feature-rich mobile devices are driving an increase in process complexity and capital intensity. This trend is good for Applied, with the complexity being added in areas where we are particularly strong. As foundries move from 45 to 22 nanometers for advanced logic devices, the number of process steps addressable by Applied tools increases by more than 30%.
Our product momentum in SSG [Silicon Systems Group] remains strong. We launched 4 new products in Q2, and overall, we are on track to gain at least one more point of 300-millimeter WFE share this year. Our Process Diagnostics and Control group booked record orders this quarter. We're seeing broad adoption of our Aera mask inspection tool for in-fab use, with repeat orders at DRAM and NAND customers as well as improved traction in foundry. In the advanced transistor area, we are seeing new epitaxy and CMP steps being added, combined with growth in PVD and CVD gate formation steps.
In Services, we are seeing a minor reduction in semiconductor utilization rates, combined with wafer starts that are relatively flat, as capacity installed over the past 6 months is being absorbed. AGS [Applied Global Services] delivered a strong Q2, increasing their revenue by 8% quarter-on-quarter, led by growth in Semiconductor Services. AGS profitability is recovering as a result of improvements in our 200-millimeter equipment performance.
In Display, TV shipments in the first calendar quarter increased 14% year-on-year, reaching 46 million units. This growth is below the level needed to increase capacity investments, and consequently, we are seeing some customers delay the build-out of their new factories. 
Plans remain in place for all leading Display customers to build factories in China over the next 2 years. However, we are seeing equipment orders being pushed out of the fourth fiscal quarter to the first half of 2012. These delays in large-area TFT investments are being largely offset by demand for small- and medium-area panels for tablets and smartphones. 
Investments in touch panel and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs is increasing. We now expect to generate over $300 million of revenue from these new applications in fiscal 2011. We are strengthening our market share position and our product portfolio in these areas. 
This quarter, we released a new high-productivity PVD system for touch panels and a new Gen 5.5 CVD system for low-temperature polysilicon applications. 
In Solar, panel demand for the first quarter was sluggish following 8 gigawatts of installation in the fourth quarter. Suspension and review of the feed-in tariff in Italy, which is currently the world's second-largest market for PV, resulted in uncertainty in inventory buildup in Europe. While resolution of the Italian feed-in tariff is a positive for the industry, the related delays lowers our full year forecast for installation to a range of 18 to 22 gigawatts. 
For EES, this was an outstanding quarter, with both PWS [Precision Wafering Systems] and Baccini setting new records for revenue and profitability. Our wafering and cell customers are adding capacity as we see the leaders scale their factories for peak demand. We shipped over 6 gigawatts of nameplate -- of screen print capacity in the quarter, primarily to customers in China, as competition for higher efficiency at lower cost intensifies. PWS is gaining market share, secured by several large orders from key customers, underlining the B5's position as the industry's benchmark wire saw. 
Orders and backlog remain healthy, and although we expect to see lower shipments in Q3, it will be another strong quarter for EES. We are monitoring capacity digestion, and we'll manage our supply chain accordingly.
In summary, Q2 represented another very strong quarter for Applied Materials. Our strategic plans to gain share in our core businesses and grow our new businesses while driving greater efficiency and profitability remain firmly on track. In spite of near-term challenges in the macro environment, we believe 2011 will be an excellent year across all of our businesses. 
Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for more comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1235
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, May 24, 2011",2011-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3674.0,131419.0,8660210.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. We exceeded our target for net sales in the second quarter and delivered earnings per share at the high end of the range. 
During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 14% to $0.08 per share and generated operating cash flow of more than $700 million. These results demonstrate the positive impact of our operations and comp initiatives over the past few years, the strength of our products in the marketplace and the relatively strong market conditions experienced in the quarter, even as some customers began to adjust their spending plans in light of the economic challenges Mike discussed.
I'll now compare our results to last quarter. Orders rose 7% to $3.2 billion, led by growth in Display and Silicon. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.1. Our backlog increased 10% to $3.9 billion. We're seeing some modest aging, but we expect about 80% of the backlog to turn in the second half of our fiscal year. Net sales increased 7% to $2.9 billion, with higher-than-expected sales in all segments except our Silicon Systems Group. 
Non-GAAP gross margin of 41.9% was nearly one point lower, driven primarily by the higher mix of EES net sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $513 million and would have been $528 million excluding a nonrecurring benefit. We expect our third quarter OpEx to again be about $530 million, with a range of plus or minus $10 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was in line with our full year expectations at 27.9%. 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $704 million, or 25% of sales. Cash flow benefited from higher revenue levels, strong working capital management and the front-end loaded payment structures for our Solar shipments. We returned $211 million to stockholders, repurchasing 8 million shares for $118 million and paying dividends of $93 million. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, up $480 million. 
We intend to fund the Varian acquisition with cash on hand in addition to short and long-term debt. The market for debt issuance remains attractive, and we may put long-term financing in place before the acquisition closes. We estimate the quarterly interest expense of funding the acquisition before the close to be about $0.01 per share, and this potential impact is included in our third quarter guidance. After the close, our near-term balance sheet focus will be to reduce short-term debt.
On the regulatory front, the Varian transaction will require reviews in the U.S., as well as China, Taiwan, Israel, Germany and Korea. Most of the jurisdictions have an initial review or waiting period of approximately 30 days. The transaction must also be approved by Varian stockholders.
Now I'll cover our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders grew 7%, led by our logic and flash customers. Foundry orders declined but still represented almost 50% of the order book. SSG net sales were 3% lower, driven by pushouts in foundry and a decline in logic that were partially offset by increased sales to DRAM and flash customers. 
We now believe the second half will be softer than we expected at the Investor & Analyst meeting in March, with SSG net sales likely to be approximately flat with the first half. SSG operating margins declined, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses related to research and development around advanced transistors and from higher field resources. 
AGS orders grew 9%, led by higher demand for 200-millimeter equipment. Net sales increased more than expected, rising 8%. 200-millimeter equipment deliveries and costs improved, driving the segment non-GAAP operating margin higher by approximately 4 points to 19%. However, the GAAP operating margin was flat sequentially due to a write-off related to an asset sale. 
During the quarter, AGS agreed to divest its parts cleaning business, which had quarterly net sales of about $15 million. The pending sale triggered a $24 million impairment charge for intangible assets, which is excluded from non-GAAP performance. AGS is making good progress toward the plan to achieve operating model performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Display orders increased 80%, with over 70% of the total orders coming from new applications in touch panels, OLED and advanced mobile displays. Net sales were 7% higher, with over half of the sales occurring in China. Operating margins in the quarter increased slightly on the higher revenue. We believe the LCD TV display cycle bottomed in the first half of our fiscal year, and we expect our sales to strengthen during the second half.
In EES, orders declined by 8% from the record levels seen in the first quarter. The slow pace of module installation in the first half of the year have led customers to examine the need for further capacity additions. And we are seeing softening demand as our customers adjust their spending plans. EES net sales were above expectations, rising 34% to a record $637 million. The non-GAAP operating margin was again very strong at 26%, reflecting the benefit of higher sales. China represented 76% of our solar equipment sales. 
For the first six months of our fiscal year, EES operating profits were up by about $500 million year-over-year. This increase reflects the benefits of the restructuring actions we took in the third quarter of last year, as well as strong customer demand for our Baccini screen printing systems and our PWS wire saws.
Next, let me talk about our business outlook. In general, our forecast for the second half of the year has moderated from our previous view of an increase in revenue led by semiconductor equipment demand. 
We still expect to achieve record levels of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share for our fiscal year. However, our earlier forecast of achieving more than $11 billion in revenue and $1.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share will require our fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than our projections for the third quarter. Achieving this outcome will depend on our customers seeing evidence of strengthening consumer demand over the next few months.
I'll now share our outlook for the third quarter. In the Silicon Systems Group, we expect net sales to be flat to down 7%, reflecting a pullback in foundry spending. In AGS, we expect revenue to be in the range of flat to down 5%. In Display, we believe net sales will be up by more than 25%. In EES, we expect net sales to be down by 15% to 25% as customers digest the capacity additions of the past several quarters. We expect our overall net sales to be down in the range of 3% to 10%, or about $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. 
We expect our third quarter non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.31 and $0.37 per share. As a reminder, this range includes about $0.01 per share in potential interest expense related to financing the Varian acquisition before the close.

I guess on the foundry side, do you think the issue is more that the foundries are seeing weakening demand, or that they've already added a lot of capacity and they have a lot more coming? Or kind of, what do you think the breakdown is between those 2 dynamics that's causing them to soften up the orders a little bit?",68

Thanks for the question. I think the primary look is they're adding capacity at the leading edge, and the leading edge is fully subscribed. And it's fully subscribed at every one of the leading foundries. So I don't think there's a lot of play here, and that's where they're going to continue to focus their capacity growth. I think when you look at it, the dynamics of what's happened in the last few months, that a lot of the growth is focused on smart phones, which really demand 40 nanometers and beyond, 32-nanometer capability, to be able to satisfy the processing speed. Those things are going to be up something on the order close to 70% this year, I think even stronger than last year. So I think that's a big focus right now, along with tablets as a new category driving capacity. The new tablets require a lot bigger die, and again, driving towards the more advanced nodes. I think if there is a surprise for the foundry guys, it's that the subscription on 65 is lower than they would've thought. And that's where the pushouts in capacity adds are.",193

We're very excited about the Varian acquisition, Jim. You can see how the strategies line up between the 2 companies. The products are very complementary.

And I can tell you our models assume that we're still a cyclical business. And so there is an appreciation for the fact that you can't predict the cycles, but you can get a sense for valuation over time. And you really look at other ways that we can add value together. We've talked about the obvious areas, like synergies. But really, helping them take their foray into some of the markets where we're more experienced, like Solar and Display, can create  value. And also, we think there's a lot of crossover then you start getting implant engineers together with some of our thermal engineers, and that some interesting things can come out of that. I think, also in the etch side, there's going to be some interesting products that come out of it.

George, I'm just trying to bridge the gap between the bookings that you have in April and the revenue that you're guiding in July. It would suggest that there was at least a couple of hundred million dollars worth of pushouts in the Silicon business, or it would suggest that the bookings in July in the Silicon business will be down about 30% versus what they were in April. So I'm wondering if those numbers are right, number one. And then, number two, I had a question on margins in SSG. If you can help quantify, maybe, what some of the impact is from the Samsung settlement. Is that costing you a couple of hundred basis points worth of margins in that business?",127

But if you look at our backlog, you're still going to see 80% of that turn between this quarter and next quarter, and about 50% of it during this quarter. Also in the SSG side, as you know, we've been in a very high turns environment for the past 4 or 5 quarters. A little less so in this quarter. So some of the longer lead time customers are adding to the order book, so it doesn't necessarily turn in the first quarter, first quarter out. So those are factors. In terms of margins on SSG, I think clearly, the Samsung agreement has an impact. As we've said, relative to the overall model, we think over time, the downside case is that it takes a point off of the operating model. It's a little more front-end loaded when we first get started. But really, I think what you're seeing is more investment in TR&D opportunities that's impacting us in the near term.",188

I think that's -- I mean, I think that is a reasonable scenario for the second half of the year. We haven't put a forecast out for Q4, but that's certainly one of the outcomes that we could see as a reasonable outcome. But part of it's going to be you're going to have to see kind of a reversal of what we've seen for the last quarter, which is some of these consumer devices where we've had remarkably high growth rates quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year actually had negative growth in the last quarter. I think that's one of the things that really affected some of the foundry customers to pull back, as they weren't able to get through a lot of inventory. As you say, there are some signs that, that is going to be less of a factor going forward, but we've got to see the consumer demand side pick back up.",154

We're kind of seeing bit growth in the 40% to 50% range, which really isn't enough to drive significant capacity. I do think that there can be difficulty in some of the smaller DRAM companies to get financing and have money available. But certainly, the big 3 DRAM companies have cash available and could invest in capacity if they need it. We do expect to see more investment in the second half in DRAM, but still very small on relative terms, comparing back to any of the recent peaks of wafer fab equipment spending. DRAM is less than 1/3 of where it was in those times. So I think this is more really about bit growth. In flash, I think it's more timing. I think in particular, the soft tablet growth in Q1 allowed some of the NAND guys to push out. But again, we expect them to come back in the second half and grow their investment. We also still expect NAND investment to be larger than DRAM this year. That view hasn't changed.",200

There a lot of things going on in the solar industry with share shifting and feed-in tariff reduction and then those who can really reach the cost necessary. You can see today that prices, cell prices, are coming down, spot prices are at $1, around $1. Poly prices are coming down quite dramatically to be able to fit into the envelope that these new feed-in tariffs are indicating. So at the same time, we're seeing the leading edge guys continue to invest in capacity because they want to be ahead on capacity, especially in a market where material costs are coming down, so that they don't have to have cells in inventory which are depreciating in value at a relatively fast pace. So in front of the feed-in tariff changes, we always see a pretty big surge in installations and deployment. And I don't think this year is going to be any different than that in the third quarter and then near the end of the year. So I think what we're seeing for capacity, kind of effective capacity going into 2012 is something around 40 gigawatts in the customer base. That's ahead of where we think installations will be, but that's true this year, too. And we are seeing pretty much record capacity expenditures in the solar field today.",233

Let me add a little color or add to that question here. Our view is that it just takes about one customer, with the amount of concentration that we have, that comes back, and just like the pushouts have been pretty concentrated, you could easily see 9% with an increase in foundry. You could see it -- NAND flash is certainly softer than we had anticipated in the second half of the year. There's a lot of reasons for that, but those reasons could also reverse themselves, the customers could have more confidence and we could see that in our fourth quarter. Those 2 alone could take us well above up 10% in the fourth quarter. But also, again, as Mike said, we're operating at a very low level of DRAM. And if customers start to see some firming in that kind of 3 strong quarters of down price for DRAM, you start to see a reversal in that, and people start to get a little more confident, you could see DRAM come back a little bit early. But I would say foundry and flash are probably the first place.",194

So I think the second half of the year is going to be much stronger. I think first and foremost, we're still seeing strong demand for touch panels and OLED. In fact, it's stronger than we had seen even last time. It's the large panel fabs, many of which are going to be built in China, that have been pushed out. So we may start to see orders for those in our fourth quarter, but maybe in the early part of '12. But in general, overall, we think spending will be up by a healthy amount in the second half.",117

Well, first of all, this is a new technique to make transistors. And I kind of alluded to it a bit in the prepared remarks. But we think that this technique, over a period of time, will be adopted, or a similar technique will be adopted to make high-performance transistors by all the logic makers. It just depends when they are able to put it into production. But it clearly lowers power and improves performance. So for us, I think one of the areas, of course, as we've moved to high-k/metal gate, PVD and CMP have been big beneficiaries. As we move into the next generations, we're going to see more epi steps, significantly more epi steps in the channel, as well as in the source/drain. And then plasma doping, because of the shape of these transistors, plasma doping, this is a structure that lends itself well to plasma doping. And we think that this will be one of those trends that really allows plasma doping to get into high-volume.",171

So right now, it looks healthy, but we always have the same concern that you have, which is you've got to watch this very closely and make sure that you balance everything from the way you look at your inventory to everything as you see this kind of behavior.

We think that emerging markets really are the key to growth in PCs, especially, in particular China, where we think that PC growth can be dramatic. And we need to see notebook growth return in a significant way. Right now, our estimates on PC growth for the year are between 6% and 10%. Earlier, we thought it would be more, greater than 10%, but after first quarter, we kind of tempered our view. I can certainly speak about Applied Materials moving to Windows 7. We're making the transition, and I have made the transition, and think that now is the right time for many corporations to do that. There's really a change in the way you can do computing across the company that Windows 7 enables. So it seems like the right time. I don't have good data on how the penetration is going.

We think that would drive bit growth above 50% and necessitate pretty significant investment.

A lot of is technology as well as capacity requirements of these customers. So the backlog is not over-weighted. You do have, obviously, a large logic presence there.

The first one is, is there a win-win window for both the suppliers and the customers, a space where they can get their cost reduction and we can still have a reasonable market that's going to grow over a period of time? The next one is the customers that are going to convert need to decide to convert on one node. One of the things -- and really aim the development at one node in technology. In the 300-millimeter, there was an initial fab at 250 nanometers. The real conversion didn't happen until -- really start in earnest until 130 nanometers. And then maybe the final thing I'd say is they really have to aim at a specific timing that we're going to really try to be able to stick through 2 despite cycles. Other thing that had happened in 300-millimeter is the transition got delayed several times because of the industry cycles. So those 3 things are topics that we're having serious discussions with the key players that are interested in 450.",195

Applied Materials delivered solid third quarter results in an increasingly challenging business environment. We posted revenue of $2.8 billion and an operating margin of 24.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. 
Over the past 3 months, we've taken a number of important steps towards completing the Varian acquisition. On August 11, Varian shareholders voted to approve the merger, and to date, we have received regulatory clearance from Israel, Germany and Taiwan. We're still awaiting approvals from the U.S. and China. We're committed to closing the transaction, which we now expect to occur in October. We are excited about the opportunities that we will deliver to our customers, shareholders and employees by combining the strengths of these 2 companies. 
Q3 was another excellent quarter for our solar business, and EES is on track to deliver close to $2 billion of revenue for the year. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by all of our businesses during a period of uncertainty in the global economy.
In recent weeks, fears about the state of leading economies and slowing growth in Asia have highlighted the fragility of the global recovery. Uncertainties about demand are causing a number of our customers to reassess their investment plans and push out orders. Although we firmly believe that the fundamental growth drivers within our markets remain strong, today, we are seeing a weaker near-term outlook across all of our businesses. 
Based on our view of the next 2 quarters, we have taken action to ensure our spending remains aligned with our business environment. We are proactively managing our operating expenses and adjusting variable spending. We will continue to invest in new products that are critical to our customers and for our long-term growth of our company. 
Let me now provide an update for each of our segments. In semiconductor, back-to-school PC sales have been disappointing, further contributing to weak PC shipments for the year-to-date of around 230 million units. Consequently, we do not expect DRAM investments to increase from the low levels seen in the first half. We believe that technology conversions will be sufficient to support the 40% to 50% DRAM bit growth now projected for 2011. 
Smartphone growth for the past 3 months has been strong, and tablet sales for the second calendar quarter were consistent with our full year estimate of around 65 million units. However, strength in these areas was not adequate to offset slowing demand for PCs and weakness in consumer electronics, causing foundries to delay their investment timing. We've seen demand from our foundry customers soften significantly in the past 6 weeks as low utilization at the trailing nodes leads them to reuse capacity at advanced nodes. 
As a result, we now believe 2011 wafer fab equipment spending will be in the range of $29 billion to $32 billion, roughly $1 billion lower than the estimate we provided at SEMICON West. Looking further ahead, our outlook remains healthy. The adoption of high-performance mobile products is just starting, and the next generation of multi-core processors used in these devices will have significantly larger die sizes, driving both increased capacity and the adoption of advanced nodes. Although we currently see at least 2 quarters of softness in wafer fab equipment, the fact that many clean room shelves are in place means a turnaround could happen quickly once consumer demand signals strengthen.
SSG launched 8 new transistor and interconnect products this quarter, while achieving a number of positional wins and double patterning Etch, copper CMP and Brightfield inspection. However, as a result of the weakness in DRAM and foundry spending, we now believe our 300-millimeter wafer fab equipment share in 2011 will remain roughly flat compared to 2010.
In service, we saw a decline in semiconductor utilization rates, combined with a minor reduction in wafer starts in the second calendar quarter, consistent with softening in demand and inventory accumulation. We do not expect wafer starts to increase significantly in calendar Q3. Against this backdrop, this was another strong quarter for AGS.  Revenue was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter after taking into account the divestiture of our chamber cleans business. We have a good progress towards model performance, enabled by improvements in our 200-millimeter equipment business.
In display, TV shipments for the first half of 2011 were weaker than expected, particularly in U.S. and Europe, and we now expect year-over-year TV growth to be around 10%. As expected, the LCD capital equipment market saw a severe downturn in 2011. We are seeing virtually all investments and new TV-related capacity pushing out into 2012, including the leading customers' plans to build factories in China. 
In contrast, supply for mobile display technologies remains tight. We continue to see robust demand for our products in this area, which represented 50% of our display revenue and 80% of orders in the third quarter.
In solar, panel demand is now accelerating, following a slow start to the year. We maintain our view that installations will be in the 19- to 22-gigawatt range for the year, with roughly 2/3 of these installations in the second half. Germany represents over 35% of this demand, and the postponement of their midyear subsidy reductions means that installers continue to generate healthy returns. 
Earlier this month, China announced its national feed-in tariff, which will provide a meaningful upside to the market starting in 2012. While China is the global leader in cell and module production, last year, it represented less than 3% of worldwide panel demand. The feed-in tariff, combined with local incentives, could result in China taking a leadership role in solar installations with modular spot prices moving to the $1.20 per watt range, the economics for PV are becoming increasingly compelling, re-enforcing our bullish view on the growth of this market over the next few years.
Although the rate of factory capacity expansions has slowed compared to the first half of the year, our leading customers are investing in upgrades that enable them to extend their efficiency and cost differentiation. This is translating to strong demand for our Baccini double printing product, which enables customer to convert existing lines to next-generation technology. 
Our wire saw business has also having an outstanding year. We expect to gain over 5 points of share in the wafering market.
In summary, Q3 represented a strong quarter for the company in an increasing challenging market environment. We are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to generate long-term shareholder value and attractive returns by focusing on organic and inorganic growth in high-return areas. As we adapt to our plans to the realities of our cyclical environment, we will carefully manage our spending and capital structure.
Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1137

Applied delivered revenue and earnings at the upper end of our guidance range. We generated $600 million in operating cash flow on strong performance, and issued $1.75 billion in long-term debt to support the Varian acquisition. Our cumulative net sales and earnings per share over the past 4 quarters have been the strongest in the company's history. 
Orders in the quarter declined by 25% to $2.4 billion, reflecting softening demand across our businesses. Our book-to-bill ratio dipped below 1 for the first time in 7 quarters. Our backlog decreased 16% to $3.2 billion, including negative adjustments of $248 million, primarily from financial de-bookings. These adjustments are made when the expected delivery for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window.
Net sales declined 3% to $2.8 billion with higher-than-expected revenue in display and EES, leading us to the higher end of our target range. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.8%, up 90 basis points led by margin recovery in AGS. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $510 million. This includes an adjustment in our variable compensation and certain other accruals. Absent these items, our non-GAAP OpEx for the quarter would have been just under our $530 million target. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP OpEx to be approximately $510 million. This represents about a $20 million decrease from our current quarterly run rate.
In the near term, our primary focus in OpEx is to tighten discretionary spending across the company while preserving our customer-facing programs and critical investments. In managing our cost of goods, we have a highly variable manufacturing structure and reflects our temporary workforce and overtime capacity in response to the rapid dropoff in demand. We plan to use selective factory shutdowns in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we'll schedule more broad-based shutdowns in our first fiscal quarter of 2012.
We have managed our full-time headcount additions carefully through the cyclical ramp and believe we are in very good shape going into the slowdown. We expect to limit our hiring for the time being to critical positions and recent graduates. 
Our effective tax rate was 28.8%. We expect our fourth quarter and full year rate to be approximately 28%. We generated operating cash flow of about $600 million through strong working capital management and collections efficiency with day sales outstanding at 59 days, very close to our best historical performance. Consistent with our practice of returning capital to our stockholders, we paid dividends of $105 million and purchased 2 million shares for $25 million.
During the quarter, we took a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet and secure funding for the pending acquisition of Varian. In addition to the $1.75 billion long-term debt financing, we arranged a $1.5 billion commercial paper program to provide a source of low-cost flexible borrowing as business conditions necessitate. We believe these financings will contribute to a lowering of our long-term cost of capital over time. 
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, up $2.2 billion from the second quarter, including the debt proceeds. The elevated level of cash is reflective of our all-cash offer for Varian. We regularly review our capital structure, relative to our capital allocation principles of ensuring a strong investment-grade balance sheet that allows us to fund disciplined investments in the growth of our business while supporting dividend growth, in line with business performance, and use of share repurchase as the preferred means of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Next I will cover our operating segment results as compared to our second quarter. Silicon Systems Group orders declined 28%, primarily due to push-outs by foundry customers. SSG net sales were 4% lower, consistent with our expectations. The non-GAAP operating margin was 32.5%, declining 1.5% on lower revenue. 
Performance relative to model continues to be impacted by margin pressure, and increased OpEx spending for customer-related programs across our product groups. We have initiatives underway to mitigate some of these effects. However, we expect that reaching model performance will remain a challenge in the near term, as we increase 450-millimeter spending.
Applied Global Services orders and revenue were relatively flat. AGS operating margins returned to more normalized levels in the quarter, driven by the improvement initiatives in our 200-millimeter equipment business, along with an increase in service sales from the recovery activities in Japan. 
In display, orders declined 14% with more than 80% of the new orders coming from demand for equipment, serving touch panel and advanced display applications. These orders reflect our strong position in these markets. Display net sales were up 41%. And the non-GAAP operating margin grew more than 6 points on the increase in revenue.
In EES, orders declined 48%. Our solar business is now seeing the investment slowdown we anticipated as customers digest the record capacity additions of the past 5 quarters. Net sales declined 12% to $563 million, which was better than our expectations, while non-GAAP operating margin fell 3 points, reflecting both revenue and mix effects.
China was, once again, Applied's largest country in terms of overall net sales with 27% of the total, led by solar and touch panel equipment sales. 
Now let me talk about our business outlook for the remainder of the year. We are on track for 2011 to be the company's best year ever in both revenue and earnings per share. For the fourth quarter, we expect SSG net sales to be down 20% to 35%, reflecting lower foundry and NAND spending, along with continued spending in DRAM. In AGS, we expect revenue to be in the range of down 5% to 10%. We believe spares' run rates will be somewhat lower in the quarter as customers manage their operating costs in line with lower fab utilization levels. We also expect lower spending in 200-millimeter equipment.
In display, we believe net sales will be flat with continuing strength in touch panel demand. In EES, we expect net sales to be down by more than 30%, reflecting the pullback in orders we saw in our third quarter. We expect our overall net sales to be down in the range of 15% to 30%. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.24. Our targets are wider than usual and reflect the volatility both at a macroeconomic and industry level.

So I think PC growth is at the heart of the weakness in DRAM pricing and oversupply during this period and we would have to see PCs get back to more normal double-digit growth than we've -- than we're seeing at the current time. Obviously, prices have been weak. Global DRAM still seems to be quite strong, consistent with the smartphones' and handsets' expansion. So in our frame of reference, DRAM is really weak because of PCs, and until that recovers, we kind of expect the -- a small investment. Technology investments is at a low level. It didn't recover in the second half as we had expected. If you recall earlier in the year, we had projected that DRAM capital spending would come back in the second half of the year. It hasn't come back. It stayed well below $5 billion for the year, which is as low a level as I can remember.",169

We're still -- we still think about the current environment as being pretty healthy, and if we're going to model this particular downturn after one that we've seen in the past, it would likely be the '05. We saw 2 quarters down, and then saw some recovery. We think fundamentally that the products in the marketplace, the innovations that have happened, people really want them. And we're seeing consumer softness today, largely because of the macroeconomics. So if we could get those back on track, I think we could see a recovery in a few quarters. In solar, we're already seeing a recovery in end demand. So the key here, I think, is just how impactful this China feed-in tariff is going to be. Prices have come down. They're at the very low level. You already hear the sell prices add $1 a watt, below $1 a watt, module prices. Spot prices, $1.20, maybe the average is closer to $1.40. But these prices have gotten very low, making the investment pieces quite good. So if the China feed-in tariff really comes in and creates a couple of gigawatts, 2 or 3 gigawatts of demand next year. I think we see a turnaround in capital additions, especially by the major Chinese solar manufacturers.",236

Well, one thing for sure. No one is slowing down on technology. We started 28-nanometer. What we're seeing is that because of the underutilization, primarily at 65 nanometers, they are able to reuse an awful lot of equipment for increasing capacity at 28 nanometers. So that's the first thing that I would comment about that conversation. The second thing is we're hearing very robust discussions around 14 -- 20 and 14 nanometers even today and really talking about the capabilities that we're going to need to deliver and deliver the R&D units this year and to production in subsequent years. And so no slowdown on the focus on advanced technologies, C.J. They're very critically focused on what to do next and how to keep the treadmill going.",128

We would say maybe cumulative capacity would be close to that range. But one of the things that's happening right now in the solar market is if you can't reach a certain efficiency, you don't sell your panels. So it essentially takes off line some of the older capacity, so you have to get back to looking at what the overall effective crystalline silicon capacity is. And we're kind of thinking it's more like a 35-or-so gigawatts. And I would also add, you have to think about in the second half of the year, essentially 2/3 of the installations are going to happen, so they have to have capacity plus inventory enough to handle those installations, deliver on those installations.",135

If you recall, back in 2008, it was really memory dropping off from over -- almost 70% of wafer fab equipment spending down to 20. We're not seeing that kind of situation here. And I don't think we will see that kind of a situation because the end markets have products that people really want. The beginning of mobility, real mobile computing is just happening. But to your question about what are we looking for to see that we're really starting to come out of this, we're looking for stronger consumer demand for PCs, consumer electronics, particularly TVs, that have been very slow this year and pushing out our orders and demand for capacity there. So it needs to be strong enough also. That demand come-back has to be strong enough to diminish the inventory that's been built in this weak back-to-school period. Now, of course, I think our customers have been very good at lowering utilization, managing their inventory. So I don't think that inventory is as big as it's gotten in past times either, which helps us think that this slowdown can be temporary. But then, the final thing is it really is going to be dependent on something not in our control and that's the global economy and whether we're going to get a little movement away from the volatility that we've seen in the last few weeks and get some stabilization there.",247

And just a follow-up would be could you share any color on how you are trying to manage through this kind of a downturn in almost all of your segments? Is the goal really to just stay profitable in all the segments? Or you mentioned about some share gains in the solar segment. I just want to see if maybe Applied is trying to be aggressive to gain share during this downturn?,74

We're staying very focused on our products and our customers. This is the key to moving through this, stay very close to the customers, make sure that our products are adding value in a significant way to those customers. We believe we had some very significant positional wins during the last quarter. I try to itemize a few of those in the semiconductor area. In the solar area, we really think that the key right now is to really focus on developments in areas that are going to add efficiency to existing lines. Those are things that customers are going to buy whether there's upturn or a downturn. So things like our double printing solution, which adds efficiency. We're working on a number of other areas that will add improved efficiency or improved productivity for our customers. And that theme goes in display as well, where I think you know we've been trying to expand our product line in the PVD. But even more significantly in this time period, we've been able to create products for touch panels, for advanced displays because the consumer and the customers are moving to these very advanced displays. So we've been focused on low temperature polysilicon and metal oxide transistors on OLED TV applications. And these are areas where we can gain -- where both our SAM can expand and we can gain share.",231

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,44,"First question relates to solar. Mike, you mentioned on your prepared remarks that you start to see customer purchasing more equipment for driving increasing efficiency. I was wondering if you can quantify how much of your sales comes from those -- you can almost like quantify a semi-term technology buy versus capacity build? And if all your customers just focused on driving efficiency, what do you think those sales can -- will get to?",74

So it's a little bit of a complex answer, but in what we've seen so far from our double printing business since we introduced this product, that's produced over $200 million in revenue and is ramping every quarter. So that's been starting to get quite significant. Other products, I think, we've talked about a selective emitter product and we have other ones I'm not going to talk about at this time until we get significant traction with the customers. But the specific efficiency depends on whether you're using multi-crystalline or single crystal and the techniques often vary there as well. But I would just say that every quarter, we're seeing the peak notch-up of like 0.1 or 0.2 and the distribution of sellable products there.",126

And technically, in the past 20, 30 years, when DRAM prices collapsed, then, the elasticity kicks in and box loading goes up. And what I hear from your customers and your customers' customers is that they're reallocating their budget to other areas like display. So we're not seeing any increased box loading.

I think the first thing is we have to see PC growth. The second thing is box loading still isn't at 4 gigawatts. We know that it's not at 4 gigawatts a box or -- gigabits, box [ph] of bits. But it's not at 4 gigabits per box at this time, and it certainly can get there. And as the new advanced processors come online in the next year or so, can get beyond that. But yes, the money is going in other places on the footprint to the PC. The other factor is -- that's going to drive DRAM growth is mobile DRAM as smartphones continue to grow in double-digit ranges over the next few years, while they're not going to have multiple -- are not going to have 4 gigabits in a smartphone, but there'll be -- the numbers will start get very, very large and push bit growth.",152

We'll -- I would expect if we see another soft quarter as we expect, it'll come down further in the -- in our first fiscal quarter. As I said, we're being very careful on the OpEx spending, particularly in the R&D area not to pull back the throttle, given the number of opportunities that we're working right now, and it's particularly a critical time for positioning. So we'll probably -- you'll see us be a little more careful on that. Now, we're going into this slowdown in a much better shape than we've been historically. We took a lot of actions in '08 and '09. We also have been very careful with our regular full-time headcount, so we've created more variability in our market in our manufacturing and other areas of the company. If you look at our RFTs today, we're about flat with where we were in Q3 '09. So that helps us going into this, but -- so we think we're in a good position going into it.

I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials ended our fiscal year with solid fourth quarter results despite a challenging environment for all of our businesses. 2011 has been the most successful year in Applied Materials' history, and we set records for revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Our semiconductor business delivered a strong performance despite a significant drop-off in wafer fab equipment spending in the second half of the year. Our services group exceeded their previous peak revenue, driven by growth in our spares and services business, combined with robust demand for 200-millimeter equipment. EES generated $2 billion of revenue and operating profit of over 20%, while in display, we established leadership positions in the emerging touch panel and high-resolution mobile display markets. I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their achievements in 2011.
Shortly after the close of our fiscal year, we completed our acquisition of Varian Semiconductor. The Varian acquisition extends Applied's portfolio, with best-in-class ion implantation technology, a market that represents an annual opportunity approaching $1.5 billion. The combination of Applied and Varian creates the industry leader in transistor technologies. This will allow us to significantly enhance the value we provide to customers, as we partner with them to develop the next generation of transistors that are at the heart of faster, more power-efficient chips. We're delighted to be welcoming Varian's talented team to the Applied Materials family.
2011 was a tale of 2 markets. We saw first half strength begin to falter during the summer months as economic headwinds grew. Although we believe the prospects for a sustained economic expansion are improving, and we see ratable growth and demand for semiconductors, flat panel displays and solar, near-term capital equipment spending environment remains challenging. We expect the semiconductor equipment market will begin to improve in early 2012 and strengthen through the second half of the year, as manufacturing capacity is absorbed and customers transition to next-generation technology in the volume production. 
We believe we will see a clear increase in SSG orders in our first fiscal quarter. Demand for mobile products is growing at a healthy rate. We expect tablets and smartphones to lead end-of-year holiday sales and reach our full year projections of about 65 million and 470 million units, respectively. As these devices fuel consumption of solid-state storage, we believe NAND investment will continue to grow, representing as much as 25% of total WFE in 2012.
Mobile devices are also driving demand for application processors, translating to high foundry utilization at the leading nodes. We expect foundry investment to, once again, constitute the largest component of WFE next year. While 2011 continues to be a strong year for logic investment, DRAM bid growth is in the 40% to 50% range, and DRAM suppliers can meet demand by focusing on technology node strengths. Consequently, we expect DRAM investment to remain at its current low levels in 2012. We estimate that 2011 WFE spending will end up in the $30 billion to $33 billion range, and as we look to 2012, we see capital equipment spending being down between 10% and 20%.
Over the past year, there have been significant puts and takes for new fabs and fab expansion projects, and these have impacted our expectations for our share gains, the largest of which was our estimation that DRAM spending would improve in the second half. We believe that we have increased our share in inspection, transistor products, DVD, CVD and electro-chemical deposition. However, we now see 2011 as a down year for etch and CMP, primarily due to spending mix. 
Overall, this has been a strong positioning year for SSG. We launched 15 new products, refreshing and extending our portfolio, while increasing our investment in 450-millimeter, in line with the industry's roadmap. In the quarter, we achieved a number of critical positional wins at 3x and 2x nodes in logic and foundry, specifically in the high-k metal gate and patterning etch applications. We also saw significant volume orders from foundry customers for new applications in defect review, inspection and Epi. 
In service, semiconductor utilization rates and total wafer starts fell for the third consecutive quarter. We expect current levels to remain relatively unchanged in calendar Q4. In addition, we are seeing a significant reduction in demand for 200-millimeter equipment, as these customers become increasingly cautious and shift some capacity to 300-millimeter. However, against this backdrop, AGS achieved record revenues in 2011. We demonstrated sustained progress towards model performance and increased our service penetration in Asia by nearly 30%. 
In display, we maintain our view that LCD TV growth will be around 10% in calendar 2011, which is not sufficient to drive new capacity additions. Customers are delaying their investments, including their plans to build new factories in China. Although we believe we have reached the bottom of the LCD capital equipment cycle, signaled by the extremely low level of orders for our display products, the rate of recovery will depend on an uptick in TV sales, both in the developed and emerging markets. 
Over the past year we have seen strong demand for mobile display technologies, with our product lines serving these areas comprising 1/3 of our 2011 Display revenue. However, we currently see softness in these markets as the initial buildout of manufacturing capacity is absorbed.
In solar, we now see panel installations for the year ending up in the 22- to 24-gigawatt range, up approximately 25% year-on-year. Our outlook for the end market is healthy, and we expect panel demand to grow 10% to 30% in 2012. We see continued strength in Germany and Italy, with a significant growth in the Chinese, U.S. and Japanese markets. With module spot prices approaching $1 per watt, competition between the panel-makers is intensifying. As prices fall, module efficiency becomes incrementally more important, accelerating the adoption of advanced technology. 
2011 was an outstanding year for EES. During the period of rapid expansion and capacity, we fully capitalized on our strong product portfolio by increasing our market share and delivering strong operating performance. I'd like to acknowledge our solar team who rose to the challenge of meeting a ramp that far exceeded our expectations.  However, as the industry absorbs the large amounts of capacity shipped, we are seeing a steep decline in orders and revenue. While our top-tier customers will add modestly to their capacity next year, we see the majority of our business in 2012 being generated by products that enable customers to upgrade their lines to increase module efficiency or reduce costs. 
In summary, our performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for Applied Materials. Although we enter our new fiscal year in capacity-driven downturn, we look forward to 2012 with optimism. The macroeconomic environment will ultimately determine how quickly capital equipment spending recovers. However, we believe we have passed the bottom of the order cycle for the company overall. With our market-leading technology, broad product portfolio, the addition of the Varian technologies and our talented global team, Applied is well positioned to grow faster than our markets in the year ahead. While keeping our spending aligned with the business environment, we will continue to invest aggressively in the technologies and products that we believe are critical enablers for our customers and for the long-term growth of our company.
Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?",1249
251230.0,"Applied Materials Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2011",2011-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3918.0,193248.0,11686819.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I would also like to thank Applied's employees for their part in making fiscal 2011 our most successful year in company history. We delivered $10.5 billion in net sales, GAAP earnings per share of $1.45, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 and $2.4 billion in operating cash flow.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied delivered both revenue and non-GAAP earnings slightly above the midpoint of our outlook and generated nearly $700 million in operating cash flow, which included a nonrecurring tax refund of $276 million. Our orders in the fourth quarter decreased by 33% sequentially to $1.6 billion due to lower bookings in all of our businesses, including a steep drop in EES and Display.
Our backlog decreased by 26% to $2.4 billion, including negative adjustments of $271 million, driven largely by the pullback in solar and display spending. Financial debookings were $178 million, and cancellations were $74 million. As a reminder, financial debookings are made when the expected delivery date for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Net sales declined by 22% to $2.2 billion, with lower-than-expected revenue in display and EES, slightly offset by higher-than-expected revenue in AGS.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.5%, down 3.3 points sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue and related factory absorption costs. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million. Excluding onetime items, they would have been approximately $500 million, just below our expectation of $510 million. We expect our non-GAAP OpEx for the current quarter to be $560 million plus or minus $10 million. This forecast includes approximately $60 million for Varian OpEx and is otherwise flat with our fourth quarter run rate.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%. Our GAAP rate was a benefit of 32.7%, reflecting the tax refund I previously discussed. This benefit resulted in an increase in GAAP earnings of $0.13 per share, but was excluded from non-GAAP earnings per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the year was 28%. In 2012, we expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%.
On November 10, we finalized the Varian transaction. The final price, net of cash and investments, was approximately $4.2 billion. We expect the merger to be accretive in fiscal year 2012 on a cash basis excluding acquisition cost and accretive on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2014. We expect to achieve annual synergy savings of greater than $50 million to $60 million.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $7.2 billion, up $366 million from the previous quarter. If the Varian acquisition had closed during the quarter, cash and investments would have been approximately $3 billion. Our strong cash flows over the past 4 quarters enabled the company to fund the acquisition without the addition of short-term debt and enabled us to resume our share repurchases sooner than expected during the period of low stock prices. We used $175 million in Q4 to repurchase 16 million shares at an average price of $11.04. And in a year in which we made the largest acquisition in company history, we were able to increase share repurchases by 34% and dividends per share by 14%, while preserving our investment-grade credit rating. 
We will continue our strong focus on capital allocation in the year ahead. Our capital allocation priorities are to make organic and inorganic investments that provide attractive long-term returns. We are also committed to increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and to utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash after investment and debt service. We are mindful that economic volatility provides attractive buying windows, and we expect to again be the market buying shares during this quarter.
Next, I will cover our operating segment results as compared to our third quarter. Silicon Systems Group orders declined 25% to $925 million, driven primarily by reduced memory demand. SSG net sales were 24% lower at $1.1 billion, consistent with our expectations. The non-GAAP operating margin was 26.6% and declined approximately 6 points on lower revenue. Performance relative to our model was impacted by inventory adjustments, factory costs under absorption and increased investments for customer-related programs across SSG's product groups, including 450-millimeter.
In Applied Global Services, orders were down 8% to $565 million. Net sales were up 4% to $629 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.7%. The AGS results included $71 million in net sales for 2 thin-film solar projects. 
In display, orders declined 91% to $20 million, reflecting a steep downturn in capacity additions. Net sales were down 23% to $171 million, which was below our expectations of flat net sales. The non-GAAP operating margin of 19.3% reflected the low product volume and a revenue mix heavily weighted toward touch panel. 
In EES, orders declined 73% to $86 million, as our customers absorb capacity additions. Net sales declined 44% to $315 million, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 7.3%, reflecting lower revenue and inventory adjustments and product mix effects. 
Next, I'll turn to our outlook, which includes the impact of Varian's performance in the relevant segments. Given the volatility in the macroeconomy, we are not making a specific forecast for 2012 net sales. However, I will provide some observations based on the visibility we have today. While our semiconductor-related businesses will benefit from the addition of Varian revenue, the forecast range for WFE spending is still very wide, and it is too soon to know whether SSG and AGS will be higher year-over-year. 
Display net sales are expected to be down 10% to 20% in 2012, as the downturn in LCD and touch panel equipment is expected to continue through the first half of the year. As consumer TV demand improves, we would expect a strong pickup later in the year.
EES net sales are expected to be down at least 50% following the large buildout of capacity in 2011. In general, we expect the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2012 to be impacted by the recent declines in Display and EES. However, we expect strengthening in our semiconductor business following a bottom in Q1.
Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We expect SSG net sales, including Varian, to be up 5% to 20%. In AGS, we expect revenue to be down 10% to 20%, reflecting the absence of the fourth quarter thin film revenue, lower 200-millimeter sales and fab utilization rates, partially offset by the addition of Varian services revenues. 
In display and EES, we believe net sales will be down 40% to 60% as a result of the steep order decline we saw in fiscal Q4. We expect both segments to operate at close to breakeven run rates during the first half of fiscal 2012.
We have taken substantial actions to lower our manufacturing overhead and reduced other spending where possible to maximize the performance of these businesses during the downturn. We expect our overall net sales in the first quarter to be down in the range of 5% to 15%. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.16 per share, in line with the bottom of the cycle. Overall, we are continuing to use wider-than-usual ranges to reflect the macroeconomic volatility.

Again, we think we've bottomed out in SSG in Q4, so we expect a bounce in orders in Q1. And that also, obviously, reflects the addition of the Varian orders. Display, it's going to -- it's the law of small numbers. They're -- they bottomed out in Q4 as well at $20 million north. So we'll see a -- percentage-wise a big bounce but at the start of an increase in orders in the display area. I think EES, it could go either positive or negative. It really just depends. It's coming off a pretty low order level in Q4. So -- and then AGS would -- is going to be, I would say, down slightly in orders, but that's really more a function of the utilization rates we're seeing right now. We think that'll start to come back as semi spending increases.",144

And as my follow-up, I was hoping I guess you could talk about 2 fronts. First, given kind of the distress you're seeing in display and EES, whether you're making any plans that you can talk about in terms of cost reductions. And then on the Varian synergy side, I know Bob and Gary ran a pretty tight ship there, so I'm curious where you're finding that $10 million to $15 million cost savings per quarter.",77

Certainly, in display, we're used to cycles, and so we've taken the normal actions there. We've taken very strong actions also in both of the businesses within EES, the solar businesses. We're continuing, though -- as you know, there's a lot going on in all of these businesses, and so we we'll continue with our program spending to make sure that we continue to drive the technology there. In terms of the synergies for Varian, I would agree with you, it's a very well-run business. And -- but we're confident that we'll get more than the $50 million to $60 million annually that we expect out of that. And I would say 2/3 or 3/4 will come out of OpEx. And part of that is just overlap between the operations. And then, obviously, on the cost of goods side we have a global supply chain where we think we can take some costs down.",174

Yes, I'll take -- Yes, I can take them. Sure. In terms of restructuring, I think we're -- we have and are continuing to take actions with these -- with our solar businesses to get their supply chain aligned with our global supply chain to make the manufacturing process more and more efficient. They are actually very lean organizations operationally. And so I think what you're going to see is it's going to be -- we're looking at a very strong and rapid falloff. You had a -- over 45% drop in orders in Q3 followed by over 70% in Q4. So it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust to how rapid that is, but we'll -- we accelerated the manufacturing actions.

So if you look at Varian's run rate coming into this quarter, so the 3 months leading up, the revenue would have been around, let's say, $240 million, $250 million. We're going to -- we're assuming in our Q1 numbers that you have about $200 million in revenue overall, not because it really is down period-over-period, but there's some rev rec adjustments that we'll take a look at to align with our rev rec policies.

The big thing that's driving NAND demand right now is still tablets and smartphones. We think it's still pretty strong end of the year for both of those product lines, and that's what has customers interested in moving a little capacity forward. The application processors on the tablets are getting bigger. That's really the big move in foundries, as well as the sheer numbers growing.",87

And then in terms of -- on the solar side, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on what the industry CapEx for solar would be in calendar 2012? And when you come out of this solar downturn, whenever that is going to be, do you think the industry is going to be vastly different given the fact that half the place might be out of business?",70

Obviously, we've known that there's been capacity excess in solar for some time and -- but customers have continued to put on quite a substantial amount of capacity, spent over $10 billion this year. We think 2012 will drop something in half to the best of our knowledge at this point. So if you just start at the solar cell and module suppliers, as you know, many of them are not making money at this time after a very successful start to 2011. I do think that there will be some consolidation in that part of the market, maybe some significant consolidation. How it happens, I think we'll probably see a number of companies go out of business. We've already seen 7 in the U.S. go out, but I think this is going to be a worldwide phenomena. The stronger companies that have access to cash will survive. But the end market through this whole period is going to grow and we think grow substantially because the costs are getting to the point where prices can achieve the $1 a watt -- or module goal we've been striving for, for quite some time. Still a long way from $1 a watt installed, but we're getting a lot closer to parity with other kinds of electricity generation. We'll see that happen, I think, within 5 years for sure. So we do think that there'll be some restructuring in the industry. I think we like our position. We're concentrating on technology and how to help customers lower their costs, improve their efficiency performance, and we're going to continue to drive a roadmap like that going forward. And we think if we do that, so we'll continue to have a successful solar business.",291

The question is: How sustainable that is? Because my guess is that your overall utilization in the foundries is pretty low. What you're getting is probably 28-nanometer. And if you can give us some idea what your expectation of how much 28-nanometer capacity is needed.",59

That's our initial premises. So we think that foundry spending overall is going to be down at pretty much that rate. As the largest part of wafer fab equipment spending, they'll kind of be at the average down. NAND will be up overall year-on-year, and then DRAM flat because it's already so small. And we see logic being down a little bit more than the average. So we're not expecting -- while we're seeing an uptick from a lower level on foundry spending, we're not expecting in our plans that foundry spending would be up year-over-year. Now I do agree that most of the spending that we're seeing right now is on 32, 28, 20 kind of nanometer technologies. That's good for us. We like that, like to continued treadmill. We think that's very, very positive. Utilization at those nodes is quite high. And as the economy strengthens, I do think we'll see fill-in on the older nodes. So I'm not expecting, at least at this point, foundries to make a massive move to reconfigure their older lines to the most modern technologies. So I think they're going to stay focused on 28 nanometers. I think most of their spending across the board is going to be in that range. And I think because of the significant increase in capital required to deliver these technologies, I don't think we're seeing overinvestment at this point. And I see it still strengthening through -- that -- these investments strengthening through the year.",273

Just a follow-up on the EES on the breakeven point. So, George, if you can give us some idea, with reference to the October quarter, you had $315 million in revenue and $17 million in operating income. How do you go down from there to running $175 million kind of run rate breakeven? is that -- where are you getting the cost out? Are you going to have a restructuring in terms of headcount reduction? If you can walk through how are you taking those expenses out from the last quarter to this quarter, that would be helpful.",102

I think a couple of things. One, you're going to see the factory absorption improve. It doesn't improve instantly. As you know, it takes time to bring that down, but that will improve substantially. Also, in the quarter, the operating margin was impacted by some of the -- some inventory reserves that were taken. So that kind of in essence understated the performance at that level. So you have a little more headroom to get to the $175 million. Then the question will be what's the mix of the business that we have overall, whether it's going to be $150 million -- or excuse me, $175 million or $200 million a quarter for breakeven.",115

We're clearly working with our customers. A number of customers are looking at these. They've been primarily focused at smaller display varieties for cellphones and the like. A couple of customers have some strong strategies to move that up to the TV scale. We're working closely with them and do have some revenue from that. A movement OLED would be very, very positive for Applied Materials. There are more layers, more very critical layers, which we benefit from, as well as potentially achieving gains with our PVD -- our PiVot PVD system. But I think these are still in the early days of testing, whether this technology really can be cost-effective in the TV market and offer enough differentiation to attract buyers. So we'll see, but I would say right now one of the reasons we're still quite focused on our OpEx spending in display is because, not only are customers investing in OLED, they're also investing in the new kind of metal oxide transistor, which we're also working closely with them to improve the performance of their TVs.

And at the time, certainly, 450-millimeter was pretty known that you'd have to invest in that.

Tim, we are well below the model and Samsung is -- the Samsung settlement is a factor. It was also a quarter where we had a big dropoff in revenue, so factory absorption is another factor in that. Also, there are inventory adjustments that were taken in the quarter, which had an impact. I think overall, as we said, our spending levels that we see going forward are higher than we thought at the time we put the model out in March.

We, as we said, estimate it will be up 10% to 30%. Again, as you know, most of the overall demand is driven by government incentives, and in many countries, there are limits to how much governments are willing to spend on or allocate to these markets. We think the biggest growth is going to be in China and in the U.S. and Japan in this next year. China's feed-in tariff that they announced in July is already stimulating a lot of demand in China. We think that's going to probably double where it is this year. But the real tough question to answer is when does capacity get in line with that demand? And if you look at what we think applicable capacity is today, it's between 30 and 40 gigawatts. We think on the high end, next year, demand gets to 30 gigawatts of deployment. So in a market that's very seasonal where you have to have excess capacity to meet demand in certain quarters, if those 2 things would happen in the next 12 months, the alignment on capacity and demand wouldn't be too bad. So if you put those things together, you kind of have your answer.",224

I mean if you look at the level of production that both of these -- both of our solar divisions were operating under just 1.5 quarter ago, and so the rapid ramp-down getting the manufacturing organizations sized to where they are today and starting to take down the cost structure has -- there's been a tremendous amount of action on the part of our employees and our managers. So -- but it is a rapid and big dropoff that we have to absorb.",98

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,63,"My questions relate to the kind of backlog adjustment. Can you tell us what -- which division did that adjustment came from? And also, if you look at the display -- sorry, if you look at the EES side, there's still $0.5 billion worth in your backlog. How much confidence do you have in those backlog will eventually materialize into revenue?",61

The financial debookings were -- about 2/3 or more were EES and display and really just reflected the steep dropoff that we saw. Obviously, you've seen a drop in orders in SSG and AGS as well, so there's been some minor adjustments there, mostly again, financial debookings. Cancellations were only $74 million of the total overall. So -- and then in terms of the -- what was the other question -- was on the inventory and how we feel about the EES inventory. As you may recall from previous discussions, we don't book anything for these businesses until we get a deposit. So we have deposit in LCs covering much of our backlog in our inventory, and while we would expect there to be a lot of discussion with customers, our economic protection is quite good. And remember, a good portion of our inventory, for instance, is deferred inventory in EES where we already have it fully secured.",159

That's helpful. And then last question I have is on the AGS side. I remember if we go back to your analyst event, you guys have a pretty robust target for your AGS business going into 2012. I think part of it is recovery on the 200-millimeter which may not materialize. But I was wondering do how you guys feel about that? Do you think that your AGS revenue can still grow in the coming year?",77

We're quite confident we can grow our AGS revenue over the next few years. We're very happy with the ability to deliver solutions to customers in Asia. This has been a focus of ours for some time. We grew that part of our business by almost 30% last year, which I think is a great accomplishment for the AGS team. Next year, we think 200-millimeter will be down actually. 200-millimeter had quite a good year in 2011. But applications for power devices, for MEMS, for analog, these kind of applications are going to continue on 200-millimeter, and I think we'll see another cycle in 200-millimeter that we'll do quite well in.",113

If I look at Varian's OpEx before -- in the June quarter, the last reported quarter, it was about $72 million, and I think you said it adds about $60 million to the OpEx. I was wondering if that takes out some of the savings that you expect. And if I look at your OpEx from a couple of quarters ago to now, your core OpEx is sort of flat, although revenues are down about 30% from your peak to January. So can you talk a little bit about the 2 things?",96

Yes. In terms of the -- any reduction with Varian -- and, again, I don't have those numbers in front of me to validate them or not. The $60 million is really carrying forward their current spending plans. So it was consistent with what they were planning on doing over that time period. There may have been some compensation accruals or other things in their $70 million. But we'll update you over time as we pull synergies out of the combined operation. Overall -- what was the...",88

And what you're seeing, we're actually down further than that in what I would consider to be G&A-type OpEx as we're trying to preserve spending in these critical programs during this bottoming period. So we think at $500 million plus or minus $10 million plus then the $60 million for Varian, that's actually the right kind of positioning for our spending, given the fact that we do expect to start to bounce off the bottom, and we don't want to compromise our ability to compete in these critical opportunities with customers just because we have a weak quarter.",135

And then on the SSG front, you mentioned that CapEx you think would be down 10% to 20%. I was wondering if you have a sense of what type of linearity do you expect between first half and second half. And if I take a look at your October SSG orders and if I add maybe like $180 million or so for Varian on average for next year, for me to get to this midpoint of the CapEx guidance, the CapEx outlook that you think you'll get, I need orders to go up at least 40% to 50% in SSG from the October levels. I know you said that orders look to be going up in January, but looking at the pipeline, do you see the pipeline looking like it could approach anything closer to that type of growth off the trough?",143

The only place where I'd maybe take a little bit of exception with your math is just the fact that the backlog factors into our outlook in the math.

I think you -- there's only 4, so we can -- it's pretty easy to name them. But I think we see -- we will see, with strength in the economy, some upside in NAND flash, especially if consumers start coming back more strongly in emerging markets. But I don't think that's so much a wildcard as an incremental increase. I think where there can be a wildcard is if DRAM would come back much, much more strongly since it's at such a low level today. We're expecting substantially less than $5 billion investment next year. And if we look back in history, in 2010, DRAM was about $9 billion of investment, and in years previous to that, much higher even than that. So if we were -- if there's a wildcard here, strong DRAM bounce back would probably be it. Foundry and NAND flash we would think would be more incremental and ratable back to maybe where we are in 2011.",163

That's helpful. And maybe just kind of a bigger picture question in terms of the memory market and their eventual move to vertical device structures, in terms of your market share positioning and applications, or I guess your process segment, where do you see the biggest gains potentially for Applied Materials as the memory market moves to those type of device structures, whether it's CMP, etch? What process segments do you see the biggest gains?",76

Well, it depends exactly what kind of memory types get implemented, but if we look both at 2 that people are talking an awful lot today, vertical NAND and then MRAM in certain configurations, these 2 are ones that we've been working on, we're working with customers on. In the vertical NAND, I would say we have some enabling technology that we think will help customers actually implement this in a few years. Epi, of course, is one of those advanced styles of Epi. But we have other unannounced products that also could be very enabling for customers there that we're working with them on. Those would be the 2 biggest ones. I think we'll see incremental capabilities in some of our oxide and high-k kind of products in those applications. In the MRAM, it's a little bit different. That's -- this will be very much a PVD story or an ALD story as you try to put down the multiple layers and then etch them. So our teams are working very hard together because the combination of these exotic materials are being able to etch them appropriately, I think is a winning combination.",195

But obviously, if -- we'll just have to see whether or not it's enough to offset whatever -- that's assuming a certain level of wafer fab equipment. What we said -- excuse me, we said it would be up that much in the first quarter. But what we believe for the full year is it's possible to be up even in the face of a down year because of the addition of Varian. But we're not -- we don't have a specific guidance yet because, quite frankly, the range is just so broad on the full year that trying to do that would be -- it's just too early in the year.",133
