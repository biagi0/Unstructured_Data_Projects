Applied Materials executed well in our first fiscal quarter, delivering results towards the high end of our guidance range. We also grew our backlog for the ninth consecutive quarter. Going forward, we expect backlog to start declining as we move through 2023. 
Overall, we are making good progress closing our supply versus demand gap. However, very recently, one of our major suppliers encountered a disruption that will impact our second quarter shipments. Brice will provide more details about this when he shares our guidance. 
In my prepared remarks, I will cover 3 main topics: our current outlook for 2023; our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and how Applied is positioned to grow faster than our markets overall; and finally, a brief overview of the investments we are making to productively scale the company and accelerate our customers' road maps. 
Let me begin with our near-term perspective on the market. In this environment of mixed macroeconomic signals, our customers are facing a variety of demand dynamics. Consumer-driven markets, including PCs and smartphones are clearly weaker while inflection-driven markets remain more resilient, especially high-performance computing and AI, automotive, industrial automation and clean energy. 
In terms of wafer fab equipment investments, 2023 will be a down year for memory spending as customers rebalance inventories and defer capacity additions in both NAND and DRAM. We expect DRAM to pick up ahead of NAND, potentially beginning to recover later this calendar year. We now see leading-edge foundry logic spending being slightly down year-on-year. While near-term demand headwinds are causing customers to trim capacity additions, they remain firmly committed to strategic investments in advanced nodes to win the battle for next-generation technology leadership. 
Our view of ICAPS, chips for IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor applications is incrementally more positive than it was last quarter, and we now see spending being up year-on-year. Leading ICAPS companies are investing in both technology and capacity to serve growing demand across a wide range of verticals. In addition, there is strong government support around the world to build resilient, regionalized ICAPS supply. 
Based on what we're seeing in our business and hearing from our customers, we believe Applied Materials is well positioned to outperform the market in 2023. The resilience in our business is driven by several contributing factors. First, our balanced market exposure, which allows us to perform well in a variety of spending mix environments. Second, our position with technology leaders who remain focused on investing in their long-term strategies. We have strong positions at all the key technology inflections in advanced foundry logic, ICAPS, DRAM and advanced packaging. 
Third, our record backlog of which a significant percentage is made up of our most differentiated products, including metal deposition that is uniquely enabling for critical next-generation wiring resistance improvements. And finally, our services business, which is on track to grow in 2023, even after the impact of current U.S. export control regulations. More than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements have an average tenure of 2.6 years and a high renewal rate of more than 90%. 
While we are cognizant of near-term volatility in our markets and ready to respond to both upside or downside, our long-term outlook remains highly positive. Semiconductors are the foundation of the digital economy, making them more strategically and economically important than ever before. Around the world, governments are incentivizing the industry to build regional manufacturing capacity and accelerate investments in strategic next-generation technologies. The semiconductor industry remains on track to grow from approximately $600 billion in 2022 to $1 trillion or more by the end of this decade. 
Technology complexity of chips is increasing significantly as traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area cost and time to market. In addition, as 2D Moore's Law decelerates, we are seeing average die sizes in advanced foundry logic grow. This drives the need for additional wafer capacity while also accelerating the transition to chiplets and heterogeneous designs. 
Beyond advanced packaging, major technology inflections in transistor, wiring and patterning are also enabled by new materials and materials engineering. These inflections increase the size of Applied's available market. As we have been investing in these inflections for multiple years, we are now well positioned to capture a larger share of our available market. We have a deep pipeline of solutions to enable new wiring innovations, gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, heterogeneous integration and hybrid bonding. Our broad portfolio of products enables us to offer customers traditional unit process equipment, all the way to integrated material solutions or IMS that combine multiple process technologies with onboard metrology and advanced data analytics in a single platform. 
We are very confident about the growth trajectory of the industry and Applied's outperformance within that environment. To support this growth, we are making strategic investments in new manufacturing, logistics and R&D infrastructure. The scale, speed and location of these investments will be dependent on receiving government support, some of which we have already secured. 
Beyond simply expanding capacity, we see these infrastructure investments as a catalyst to change the way we collaborate with customers, suppliers and research partners. For example, in the coming months, we expect to break ground on our next-generation R&D center in Silicon Valley. We believe this new high velocity platform will increase innovation and commercialization speed while reducing the overall cost of bringing new manufacturing technologies to market. As the industry and Applied Materials scale, we need to do so productively and efficiently. This is a major strategic theme for us, and across the company, we are focused on driving up productivity and implementing new ways to work that are better and faster. 
Before I hand the call over to Brice, let me summarize. While the economy in semiconductor industry are facing challenges in 2023, we remain confident that Applied is well positioned to outperform our markets this year. Our resilience is underpinned by our large backlog of differentiated products, growing service business and strong positions with leading customers at key technology inflections. Our longer-term outlook remains highly positive as secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets by enabling the PPACt road map with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. In line with this view, we are making strategic investments in R&D and infrastructure while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization. Now Brice, it's over to you.",1091
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2023",2023-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3505.0,2740668.0,102738047.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. I'd like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping us deliver strong revenue in a dynamic environment. On today's call, I'll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2. 
Before going into the near term, I'd like to discuss the broader context for the industry and the company. Over the past few cycles, the semiconductor industry has become significantly larger and more diverse. Applied's revenue and earnings have grown and become more resilient over this period. In semiconductor systems, more than half our revenue comes from leadership businesses where our market segment share is near or well above 50%. The growth of our services business has added another dimension of stability. These factors strengthen our confidence in our ability to invest, generate high returns and return capital to shareholders. Our business model is very efficient and generates attractive returns. In fact, from fiscal 2013 through 2022, we have grown Applied's free cash flow at a compound annual rate of 30%, and increased our return on invested capital to over 35%. 
We have 3 capital allocation priorities. The first is funding future growth and returns. And the second is maintaining a strong balance sheet so we can fund R&D through market cycles. Accordingly, even though the semiconductor market is weaker this year, we are investing to scale the company to support our customers in what we believe will be a $1 trillion semiconductor market. We are increasing our manufacturing and logistics capacity and we are making significant investments in our R&D infrastructure to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers and industry partners to help solve their highest-value problems. 
Our third capital allocation priority is returning excess cash to shareholders. We have committed to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow and actual returns for the past 10 years have been 106%. We have repurchased 40% of shares outstanding at the beginning of this period. As the business has become larger and more diverse, we've also increased the dividend. We've increased our quarterly dividend per share at a 14% CAGR over the past 17 years. In fact, operating income from our services business alone more than covers a growing dividend. 
Finally, I want our investors to know that we are increasingly focused on improving our productivity. We increased our full-time employee base by around 20% last year, and have restricted hiring to critical positions and slowed our spending growth. R&D is our largest expense, and we are making portfolio decisions to ensure we generate the highest possible returns from our investments. We also see opportunities to make our manufacturing more predictable and efficient and have formed new teams to drive our operational goals. 
Moving now to our Q1 financials. We delivered net sales of nearly $6.74 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. These results were in the upper end of our guidance range and nearly identical to last quarter's record results. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 46.8%, primarily driven by improved manufacturing and logistics costs, along with pricing adjustments. Non-GAAP OpEx was nearly $1.17 billion, with about 2/3 of the sequential increase from R&D. 
Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $5.16 billion. Strength in ICAPS more than offset reductions in memory and advanced foundry logic. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 37.3%. AGS revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year in Q1 to approximately $1.37 billion. AGS absorbed a full quarter of revenue impact from U.S. trade regulations and performed better than the midpoint of our expectations. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. In display, revenue declined to $167 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 4.8%. 
Turning to our cash flows. We generated $2.27 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is 34% of revenue. We returned $470 million to shareholders, including $220 million in dividends and $250 million in buybacks. 
Now I'll share our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue to be nearly $6.4 billion, plus or minus $400 million or up over 2% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.84, plus or minus $0.18. This guidance includes a negative estimated adjustment of $250 million related to a cybersecurity event that was recently announced by one of our suppliers. Based on our current assessment of the situation, we expect to recover all of this revenue and the majority of it in Q3.
We expect Semi Systems revenue to be about $4.84 billion, which is up over 8% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.34 billion, which is down around 3% year-over-year, including the negative impact of recent U.S. trade regulations. Display revenue should be around $160 million. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.5%, which is lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher near-term supply chain logistics costs. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5% and a weighted average share count of 850 million. 
I'll close my remarks today by saying thank you to our long-term investors for your support. We are investing for the future with confidence. Our products and services are being directed to a semiconductor industry that is growing in size and strategic importance to the global economy. Our business model is highly efficient with low capital intensity and a high return on invested capital, driven primarily by R&D spending deployed in close collaboration with our customers. Our business has become less volatile and more resilient as semiconductor demand has broadened to more markets. Equipment capital intensity has recovered and our services business has grown larger and more subscription based. In fact, over the past 5 fiscal years, we've increased non-GAAP net income by 87%, generated $18.7 billion in free cash flow and returned 118% of free cash flow to investors. 
Looking forward, we believe the growing complexity of the semiconductor road map and our ability to deliver the innovations required by our customers will enable us to grow faster than the industry. We plan to expand our global R&D and manufacturing infrastructure, including the plans Gary previewed. Finally, we will focus on increasing our productivity and maintaining our efficient spending model. Now Mike, let's please begin the Q&A.",1044

To what degree do you think dollar-wise that will kind of contribute to you here in calendar '23? And as part of that, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of first half versus second half, whether on a fiscal or calendar year basis, kind of silicon trends as that backlog unwinds?",69
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2023",2023-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3505.0,2740668.0,102738051.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,7,"Okay. Great. And thanks for the question. So on our backlog, just step back, we did see a lot of activity with movement in orders during the quarter. As we've described before, we go through our orders each quarter, work with the customers to update them. And there was a lot of movement. We do see the weakness in the market that everybody else sees in the leading edge logic and in memory. But as Gary pointed out, we did have strong bookings in the quarter and our backlog actually grew. 
We think that more than half of that backlog will be executed this year. And as Gary also pointed out, we expect that we'll begin to work that down toward a more normal level as we start to improve supply chain and be able to shift the demand that we're still shipping from last year, really, we're still working in some of our business units to cover the demand that we had last year. So it has been a little bit of a buffer, the strong backlog against the weakness in the market for us, and we think it's going to take the rest of the year, probably 1 to 4 quarters, depending on the business unit, we're thinking about to work through to normalize the lead times and recover the backlog that we need to ship against.",229

And C.J., we're not giving the guidance for the second half, but we'll just say that as I highlighted, more than half of that backlog is in the year, so it's definitely helping the year. It is buffering us Q1, Q2. And it does give us confidence that we had strong bookings in the quarter. And we'll probably talk more about this, but we'll highlight that the ICAPS markets are very strong. In fact, demand has been accelerating in those markets.",82

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2023",2023-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3505.0,2740668.0,102738055.0,Question,Stacy Rasgon,,Analysts,11,"I actually wanted to dig a little bit into that strong ICAPS demand. Is it coming from -- I mean, is it focused in areas like China where at this point after the restrictions they're going to be forced to take a much harder look at their efforts in trailing node versus a leading node. And I guess as an add-on to that, are you concerned at all about the strength in ICAPS. Is there any concern about overbuild, I guess, as we go through the year, as that gets build out?",92
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2023",2023-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3505.0,2740668.0,102738056.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,12,"Stacy thanks for the question. First of all, it's broad-based. I guess, would be my first answer on the ICAPS. We had significant growth last year that we highlighted when we did our year-end call, and it's actually accelerating into this year. So I'll come back to whether that's a concern or not. China is the largest region and the largest single country driving ICAPS. So it is a focus area.  We're actually not concerned that it's going to be affected by trade regulations. 
So that's not on the radar screen at this point. As we think about ICAPS and we think about that broad-based strength, you're probably aware or certainly aware that many of the companies that we know are leading ICAPS manufacturers have announced that they're adding capacity and the capital intensity for those companies is increasing. And I think it just is a reflection of there's little used factories and used equipment available in the market. 
And so as companies need to add capacity to serve this market, they're having to make the new investments. We do think it's sustainable. We do think it's being driven by, in some cases, are being supported in some cases by government incentives. But we're not concerned that companies will put capital in place that they don't plan to use. We don't think the incentives are enough to have somebody install equipment and not use it just in the hopes of using it. So we're also fairly confident in the underlying demand, things like electrification, electric vehicles, sustainable power. All these types of markets, we think, are sustainable. So we just -- we're seeing an acceleration in that area for our business, and we think it will continue.",287

So that really depressed capital intensity for a number of years. And of course, that's not happening now. So capital intensity is up, and our position there is very good.",59

Or you think there is a lot more memory weakness that you could see in the second half? Because is just that when I look at your outlook, right, it seems to be very different than what we have seen from your other U.S. peers who are down 20%, 30% sequentially in their calendar Q1. And I don't know if it's just the ICAPS strength that explains that delta on just puzzled as to what explains that outperformance? Is it ICAPS, or is it something else? Or have you not yet seen the trough of memory weakness and that is still to come that maybe they saw it earlier, and you could see more of it in the back half.",135

We're fairly confident that we're current with our memory customers on their orders. We've definitely seen -- as I highlighted in our booking activity, we definitely have seen significant cancellations and pushouts from memory customers. We think we're current. Mathematically, you're exactly right. The acceleration in ICAPS has more than offset the weakness we're seeing there and any slowdown we saw in leading-edge logic. So that's true. And then we've looked at the leading indicators on the memory side. We're still seeing pricing declines. We're still seeing inventory increases. So we don't think it's turning yet, at least from our perspective, but we're confident we're current with the customers, Vivek.",115

I notice you did not quantify WFE for this year, and I understand you're probably better at than the industry because of the ICAPS strength. But it seems like the range is anywhere from 70 to 75 and some people talk about $80 billion in WFE this year. But just hypothetically speaking, if WFE is down 20 or so more percent since you're going to outperform, is it fair to assume your revenue growth to be down more like low to mid-teens? And kind of how to think about the earnings power in that scenario given that you're trying to be disciplined on OpEx?",111

So yes, we didn't provide a WFE because we're really just trying to focus on sharing what we're seeing, all the signals that we're getting in the market because were a little bit abstracted from it. As you pointed out, we've got the strength and acceleration in ICAPS that may make us a little bit different. We're also still shipping orders we had from '22. So for us, we're catching up to demand, especially in some of the key differentiated business units that existed before the year. So it's not a perfect match, and it's difficult for us to estimate.
Switching to OpEx. As we talked about in our last call, because we were supply constrained, our OpEx growth, that was our plan was a little bit ahead of our revenue growth. So we have implemented headcount targets. We've moved to strategic hiring only, and we do have initiatives focused on improving our productivity on spending. So we're conscious of that. Of course, it's a balancing act, Krish, through this year because we think the industry is growing. We're confident in the direction we need to continue investing in R&D. So that's our primary goal is to deliver those programs to customers. We have flexibility if the environment deteriorates for us, then we'll make more appropriate changes to spending. But right now, we're comfortable with the trajectory.",230

Thanks, Atif. I think that we've characterized foundry logic as 2/3 of the business last year. Memory is a little slower this year, so that mix is changing a little bit. And we characterized our lagging edge or the ICAPS portion does about 50-50 with leading edge. So that's the way we characterize it. And that's all thinking of it from a TAM perspective. What we are seeing at the company level is that the ICAPS market is accelerating and growing at a very high rate for the company this year.

So ICAPS relative to market share is similar for us with leading foundry logic. So we've grown share in ICAPS a significant amount over the last few years. It's also accretive to our overall gross margins. Four years ago, I think we've talked about this, we formed the ICAPS IoT, communication, auto power, sensors, organization because we could see these markets we're going to grow it at a significant pace.
So we pulled together a really strong team. We have the broadest exposure. If you look at all of the technologies, whether it's in -- again, any of those different segments within ICAPS, we have significant strength. So again, that's something that we saw several years ago and made investments. So we have many ICAPS specific products. Implant is one area if we look at. There's many areas where we have strength and broad exposure in ICAPS. But in that particular area, we've introduced 10 new products focused on ICAPS in the last 5 years. 
That is the largest segment of our implant business. And just in that one area, again, we've been very supply constrained. We expect that we can double our ICAPS revenue in '23 versus '22. So again, just really across the board we have very, very strong positions. And pulling that organization together 4 years ago, really put us in a good position for what we're seeing today.",242

Gary, you just mentioned that you expect your ICAPS revenue to double in '23 versus '22. Was that overall ICAPS? Or was that just implant? That's my clarification question. And then my question Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your DRAM business potentially recovering by the end of the year, which to me is a little surprising, just given how weak the trends are in that marketplace today and the inventory situation. Can you kind of share what informs that view in DRAM? And what are your thoughts on NAND as well?",103

Let me cover the first question is on the doubling of ICAPS, that's specifically implant in '23 versus '22.

And Brice, do you want to cover the DRAM NAND question?",58

We do expect that next year will improve on the memory perspective. I don't think, Toshiya, we're going to give an exact moment when the market will turn. I mentioned earlier, we kind of have 3 signals that we can look at internally. We can look at utilization for both NAND and DRAM. And we see utilization lower this quarter and all of our customers are forecasting utilization to be even lower next quarter. We've looked at the pricing of memory, and it looks like it's either declining or declining -- or slightly flattening. And then we've looked at inventories and it looks like inventories are still growing. So I don't think at this point that we can say, call the point in time where memory starts to grow. But we do expect next year that memory will improve and companies will begin to invest again. And it's just difficult to call that moment.",168

It seems like backlog is sort of skewing your numbers a bit higher than your peers, given how long your lead times began or got to during the upturn. So I'm wondering if you can give us maybe a few more breadcrumbs on the backlog. I think you said last quarter, SSG backlog was $12.7 billion. So I just want to be clear that the SSG backlog went up from that number. And if so, that's kind of like 2.5 quarters of backlog for SSG. And when I think of a normal, you always used to run more like a quarter-and-a-half worth of SSG backlog. So is it right to conclude after all that, that you maybe have a quarter's worth of excess backlog right now as it relates to SSG?",138

I think -- thanks, Tim, for the question. So color on it, I would say we did see weakness in leading logic and memory as we described. So a lot of the strength that we're seeing comes back to this acceleration on the ICAPS side. So from a mix perspective, I think that's where a lot of strength in the orders is coming from. And Gary highlighted the growth of implant. So certainly not the growth of total ICAPS is not 100%, but it is very meaningful to us for the year, obviously, enough in Q1 to offset weakness in memory and leading logic. 
So that gives you some of the perspective. Most of this is in the semi business. Some of it's in 200-millimeter, which comes in the AGS space. And what I would say is, yes, it does tie back to the long lead times in the areas of the business that are highly differentiated equipment, where we're still working off that backlog. And we think it will take us -- I guess what I would say is -- last quarter, we highlighted that a normal backlog would probably be in the $12 billion or $13 billion range. We expect to work back in that direction as supply improves, and we can start catching up to the demand we had from last year.",226

We do have strength in many of these key technology inflections. We talked in the Master Classes about inflections gate all around, wiring, memory with capacitor formation or new materials PDC strength. We had that Master Class in December. So that's another thing. When you look at the composition of the backlog, just again, wiring alone, we have 1 inflection that enables a 50% reduction in resistance. The dollar per wafer goes up about 3x from 7 to 3 nanometer. So those areas are also helping us in relative performance.",109

They're taking drastic actions to rein in supply, even going so far as to push out their technology migration road maps. Typically in downturns, we wouldn't see your customers pulling back on tech migrations, capacity add, yes, but not tech migration. So is the tech migration pullback in the associated higher capital intensity a big contributor the WFE pullback this year in memory?

Thanks for the question, Harlan. I'll start, and Gary will probably want to add something here. I don't think that the inventory situation in the current market is guiding their technology transition choices. I think that will be driven by the opportunity to take leadership positions and improve the cost of the bits and improve the product performance, et cetera. So what does happen is they may have more equipment that they can reuse into their road map depending on what demand is. So they'll make changes and lower their equipment buys based on that. So I think -- I'm not aware of companies for -- that are connecting the technology ramp decision with the current inventory situation and business situation.",122

What I would say is that we are -- we also believe that foundry logic will remain strong going forward. It was in this kind of 2/3, 1/3 mix between foundry, logic and memory. And -- especially with government incentives, you see a lot of government incentives certainly in the U.S., in Europe, Japan, a number of different areas, potentially in India. That could add a few billion dollars per year in additional investment.

But let me start with working down the backlog, Joe. Thanks for the question, Joe. So I guess the way we're thinking about it, it's hard to estimate the order flow coming in and estimate the exact backlog number. But we've got several business units that are still shipping against demand really that we received last year. And it has been supply constrained. It's  -- we're behind 1 to 4 quarters depending on the business unit that we think of. So we think as supply has improved, we'll begin to ship back against last year's orders and recover to a normal position. And the quickest business unit, we'll probably do that in the next quarter. Then we do have 1 or 2 business units that will take into next year to be able to recover that.

I'll start on that one, on the leading edge. So I think it's pretty straightforward. The largest leading-edge customers are running at lower utilization at this point. And so they're resizing their capital buys as they look at the utilization level that they are now. So we've seen pushouts or cancellations of some tools related to those customers. And I think it's pretty straightforward. They have lower utilization and they have the ability to reuse some of that equipment into their next ramp.

And again, for us, the positions there, we've covered that in a lot of the Master Classes, we expect our share of gate-all-around to rise versus FinFET, about 5 points. And we have the majority of the spending in that inflection. I've talked about those wiring inflections where the dollar per wafer goes up significantly from one technology node to the next. And again, we've covered those in the Master Classes. So our position at 3-nanometer is very strong. Our position gets stronger even in 2-nanometer as customers are driving improvements in power and performance. So our position there is very good.

Brian, thanks for the question. I do think it's fair. I didn't parse backlog in exactly the way that you described. But to your point, we're seeing significant strength accelerating demand from our ICAPS customers that's filling in blanks that we get on the memory or leading logic side. And so to the extent that, that our backlog represents the orders that we're shipping, I think it's fair to say that there's a significant amount of ICAPS strengths across that backlog. So I think that dynamic is fair. And just going back to those end markets, we do think it's sustainable. We don't think the strength is anything unusual or driven by any unusual activity. We don't think companies are putting in capacity that they won't use. This is just growth that, as Gary said, that we've seen coming for a while and it's starting to build out, and you might have seen some of the big larger companies in the ICAPS space talking about these investments.

We may not see the exact number either. But when we look -- when we think about the big customers in foundry logic, that everybody knows, they have had reductions in our capital plans. When we look at leading foundry logic, when we look at utilization, it is low at this period of time. So their customers, our customers' customers are working through inventories at this point in time. But when you start to turn the page, the leading logic is going to invest in the next nodes and put that capacity in place. They may have a little bit more equipment available for reuse but they're going to make those investments. And we expect that and we see that coming through. And so we'll -- when we get past this year, we'll expect to see strength in foundry logic again. Gary, do you want to add anything to that one.",163

Applied Materials delivered strong results in our second fiscal quarter with revenues in the high end of our guidance range. Across the business, our teams are executing well, successfully managing a dynamic near-term environment, making progress with our longer-term strategic initiatives and introducing enabling new products and solutions for our customers. 
Despite macro headwinds, our outlook remains favorable, and we expect to outperform our markets in 2023, thanks to our balanced market exposure, our strong position at key technology inflections, which is driving demand for our differentiated products, especially in metal deposition, CVD, etch, implant, thermal processing and e-beam and our growing service business, which is increasingly subscription-based. In my prepared remarks today, I'll cover our perspective on the market, both the near-term dynamics and our longer-term secular growth thesis, how Applied is positioned to outgrow the industry this year and over the longer term and finally, the investments we are making to create more value for our customers and productively scale the company. 
In 2023, challenging and evolving macro conditions are impacting the semiconductor industry, both negatively and positively. Demand that is directly driven by consumer electronics is clearly weak, while demand driven by inflections in technology and strategic regional supply chain investments remains robust. This contrast can be seen in our customers' investment levels. Weakness in PCs and smartphones is a key factor for memory customers who have significantly reduced their investments in 2023. Measured as a percentage of total wafer fab equipment, memory spending is tracking at its lowest level in more than a decade. In leading-edge foundry logic, we also have seen customers trimming their spending plans for the year. We see these changes as timing adjustments as these companies remain fully committed to their long-term road maps to win the race for technology leadership in this market. Push-outs in leading-edge investments are being offset by increased strength from customers who serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensors markets. 
Over the past quarter, we revised our 2023 ICAPS forecast upwards with demand being driven by 2 interconnected factors. First, ICAPS customers are delivering critically enabling technology for large global inflections that will play out over the next decade. These include clean energy, electric vehicles and industrial automation. These inflections are driving significant innovation. At Applied, we have released more than 20 major new ICAPS products since we formed our ICAPS group 4 years ago. 
Second, there is a clear trend towards regionalization of supply chains as countries seek to build resilient local capacity to support industry verticals that are central to their economies. We currently see around $400 billion of government incentives being deployed globally over the next 5 years, a significant portion of which will be directed towards ICAPS markets. While China currently leads in ICAPS spending, we see other countries increasing their investments at a higher rate. In fact, the fastest-growing regions for our ICAPS business in 2023 are the U.S., Europe and Japan. 
Looking beyond 2023, our long-term growth thesis for the industry remains unchanged. Semiconductors are the foundation of the digital economy, which is driving demand and puts the industry on a path to become a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade. At the same time, chip technology complexity is increasing significantly as traditional 2D scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area cost and time to market. Increasing complexity means that wafer fab equipment can grow at a higher rate than semiconductor revenues. And then within equipment spending, major technology inflections are increasingly enabled by materials engineering, expanding the available market for Applied Materials. 
I'll highlight a few examples of how major materials engineering inflections contribute to our growth. First, gate-all-around transistors are a great example of a new 3D device structure that is enabled by materials engineering in areas where Applied has leadership products, including epi and selective removal. In addition, we've developed differentiated conductor etch solutions specifically for gate-all-around applications. We expect shipments of our gate all-around products to begin ramping in 2024, as leading customers move into high-volume production. For Applied, this inflection creates an incremental opportunity of around $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts of capacity. And we expect to gain 5 points of transistor market share in the overall transition from FinFET to gate-all-around. 
Second, in wiring, we're seeing significant innovation in new materials, adoption of new low-resistance metals for contact and interconnect enabled us to grow our PVD revenues at 3x the rate of wafer fab equipment in 2022. High-speed data connectivity remains a key focus for all our customers, fueling further growth at future nodes. 
Third, Applied Technology is providing our customers with new tools to drive their scaling road map. Recently, we launched Sculpta, a breakthrough pattern-shaping technology, which provides a simpler, faster and more cost-effective alternative to EUV double patterning. It decreases customers' capital cost by about $250 million for each layer of adoption per 100,000 wafer starts. We are already shipping repeat systems and expect this business to grow to multiple hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue in the next several years. The final example is Advanced Packaging. While we are still in the early phases of industry adoption, this inflection is already a great growth area for us. Our packaging revenue has doubled in the past 3 years to over $1 billion. We have strong leadership positions in key enabling technologies, including through-silicon via, microbumping and hybrid bonding. We believe we can double revenues again in the next few years with further adoption of 3D multi-die packaging. 
The increasingly complex solutions our customers are deploying to move from one technology node to the next are also a key growth driver for our service business. Customers are seeing value in our solutions to support their R&D, rapidly transfer and ramp new technologies and drive device performance, yield, output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. Our service business is on track to grow in 2023, even with lower utilization rates in certain nodes and after absorbing the impact of U.S. Export Control Rules. More than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. 
These agreements are growing at a faster rate than the installed base and have a high renewal rate of more than 90%. Given our confidence in the trajectory of the industry and Applied Materials, we are taking actions and making associated investments to support our growth, accelerate our customers' road maps and drive productivity and efficiency as the industry scales. On May 22, we will formally announce a major strategic investment in a new high-velocity innovation platform focused on next-generation equipment and process technologies.  As innovation in the industry is increasingly driven by new materials, structures and devices, our goal is to change the way we collaborate with customers, universities, suppliers and other partners to bring new manufacturing technologies to market faster and optimize the overall economic returns. 
We look forward to sharing more details next week. Before I hand over to Brice, let me quickly summarize. While 2023 is a challenging year for the economy and areas of the semiconductor market, Applied's business performance remains resilient, thanks to our broad exposure to secular trends, strong product positions at key technology inflections and our growing service business. Our longer-term outlook is very positive as semiconductors become a larger and more strategically important market globally, and industry trends create outsized opportunities for Applied. To position ourselves for the opportunities ahead, we are making strategic investments in R&D and infrastructure, while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization. Now Brice, it's over to you.",1280
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, May 18, 2023",2023-05-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3694.0,2813008.0,104809315.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. On today's call, I'll summarize our Q2 results, provide our guidance for Q3 and discuss the investment we're making in our R&D infrastructure. Before covering the near term, I'd like to remind you of 4 key points. First, the semiconductor industry is on track for secular growth with expectations of a $1 trillion market by 2030; second, materials engineering is increasingly critical to our customers' roadmaps; third, Applied's broad and differentiated portfolio, market diversity and growing services business make us more resilient today than in the past and set us up to outperform our markets; and fourth, we have an efficient business model that generates strong profitability and free cash flow, which enables us to invest in growth and provide attractive shareholder returns. 
In fact, in March, we [indiscernible] our confidence in the long-term growth of the semiconductor market and in our ability to deliver the new materials and manufacturing innovations required to drive the industry. The Board of Directors approved a 23% dividend per share increase, which is the largest increase in 5 years and supplemented our share buyback program with a new $10 billion repurchase authorization. We believe our free cash flow can continue to grow and support increasing the dividend at an accelerated rate over the next several years, which would double our previous dividend per share. 
As our services business grows along with our installed base of equipment, it alone produces more than enough operating profit to pay the company's dividend. 
Moving now to Q2 business highlights. Our team did a great job navigating supply and schedule challenges during the quarter, enabling us to grow revenue and earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. We mitigated most of the supplier cybersecurity situation we described last quarter, and this helped us deliver higher-than-expected revenue in both semi systems and AGS. Most of our businesses caught up to demand and our lead times and inventory levels declined. Growth in our ICAPS business helped to offset year-over-year declines in memory as it did in Q1. And our services business generated record revenue, growing year-over-year and offsetting headwinds created by the trade rules announced last October. 
Now I'll summarize our Q2 financial results. Company revenue in Q2 was $6.63 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $2, up 8% year-over-year. These results were in the upper end of our guidance range and only slightly below last quarter's near-record results. Non-GAAP gross margin was flat sequentially at 46.8%, remaining resilient as we offset headwinds related to trade restrictions, inflation, supply chain and logistics. Non-GAAP OpEx rose slightly quarter-over-quarter to $1.17 billion. 
Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $4.98 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6%. AGS revenue grew 3% year-over-year to nearly $1.43 billion. In fact, this was AGS' 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Segment non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially to 29%. In display, revenue was approximately flat sequentially at $168 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially to 12.5%. Turning to cash flows. We generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is nearly 35% of revenue. We produced over $2 billion in free cash flow, which is nearly 31% of revenue, which demonstrates the efficiency of our business model. Shareholder returns in the quarter were over $1 billion, including $219 million in dividends and $800 million in share buybacks. Now I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect company revenue to be $6.15 billion, plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.74 plus or minus $0.18. 
Within this guidance, we expect semi systems revenue to be around $4.5 billion, which is down nearly 5% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.43 billion, which is up 1% year-over-year Display revenue should be around $170 million. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be about 46.3%. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat sequentially at $1.17 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%. 
Finally, I'll comment on the new innovation platform Gary discussed in his remarks. We're planning to make a multibillion dollar investment in new infrastructure over the next several years, to significantly expand our capacity to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers as we develop next-generation materials, process technologies and equipment. We'll provide more details about the amount and timing next week. What I'd like you to note today is that the investment is consistent with our company's existing long-term strategic plans. Also, the scale will depend on our ability to secure government support. While we expect our capital expenditures to be higher over the next several years, there is no change to our longer-term financial model and our strong commitment to shareholder returns. 
In summary, Applied Materials is executing well and demonstrating the advantages of our broad and diverse portfolio, markets and customer base. This year demonstrates how our business has become less volatile and more resilient. We are growing year-over-year in semiconductor systems and services and generating healthy profitability. We are in a great position to invest for technology leadership and growth, generate strong free cash flow and increase shareholder returns. Mike, please begin the Q&A.",865

C.J., thanks for the question. We've looked into this ourselves quite in-depth. We're very bullish and the customers are bullish about the end markets that are driving the investments that are being made in China. So specifically, we've looked at the equipment that we're selling. We've looked to see that it's being installed. We've looked to see that it's actually being ramped. And that's what we do see in China. So people have asked us about, is there preordering or stocking of equipment? We don't see that. 
You're right that it's mostly ICAPS, and it's mostly focused on the end markets that we all know that are growing, the power markets, the video processors, the sensors and power -- those types of end markets. We also think about the government incentives in China. So a lot of -- there is a long tail of investors in China. They are being incentivized but they are ramping and installing the equipment, and we don't see any unused areas. Anything to add there, Gary?",172

Thanks, Stacy. It is the largest country in the ICAPS space, but I think there are 3 other countries that are growing faster, and it's not because it's a law of small numbers. They're pretty significant. So if you think of North America, China, Europe, people will recognize a lot of the investments that are being made in the mature technologies in those spaces. 
So China is not the fastest grower, but they're the largest country. And when we look across the world and we look at all those investments, there are government stimulus programs that help encourage the customers to make those investments, but we believe there's real demand behind that. When we look at utilization in the ICAPS space, we see utilization to be in a healthy range. So this looks like an ongoing trend. When we think forward, we had -- if we look back to '22, we had 40-plus percent growth rate in ICAPS. It's only accelerated this year. And our view from all the accounts is that it won't grow at the same rate. It won't accelerate at the same rate, but that demand is stable.

What's your backlog in semi systems? And where does it get to exiting the year? And then a number of your peers have suggested that the second half of the calendar year, so essentially your Q4 and Q1 could be better than the first half. Is that similar to the trends Applied is seeing? Or what would create that difference between you and your peer group?",73

Thanks, Vivek. First of all, backlog, we still have an elevated backlog. What we've tried to talk about last quarter and this quarter is the dynamics under that. We have caught up in most of the business groups to the underserved demand that we had from the prior year. So that's a good thing. Our lead times are returning to more normal. Having said that, the backlog is still elevated. We think that's because many customers are placing orders over a longer period of time. They're planning longer in the future than they have in the past. 
So we -- when you see our backlog published at the end of the year, it will probably still be at an elevated level. On the second half, we're not guiding the second half, but the story for Applied has been that the ICAPS business has grown so much this year that it's offset weakness in the memory market and any slowness that we've seen in the leading logic market, and we expect that dynamic to continue. You can see in the next quarter that we don't have growth in the next quarter. But overall, we expect that dynamic that we've seen for the business to continue in future quarters. So we can't call that second half or even '24 yet because the large markets of memory and leading logic are pretty exposed to macros and pretty exposed to consumer end markets. We'll just have to see how that looks for Q4 and for next year.",254

One is for Gary. When you look at all these leading-edge spending and all the regionalization, it seems like, is it all tied to really CHIPS Act Funding or other factors in play like the permitting orders might be that's causing some relative delay in those leading-edge investments? And Brice, did you say anything about some of the China export control recovery that some of your peers have spoken about in the back half?",83

On the leading edge, there is an intense competition for leadership, so all of those companies are trying to drive their road maps as fast as they can on power performance and cost. So we certainly see that continuing to play out over the next few years. What I would say also is that the perspective that we have right now is that 3-nanometer is going to be a big node, where there's a lot of tape-outs and customer demand. So we think that's going to be pretty robust. 
For Applied, we're in a really good position as our customers move to 3-nanometer. The number of steps for us go up to more than 20% in that transition from 5- to 3-nanometer. Again, you have this really significant competition in that leading edge that -- again, we continue to see that that's going to be sustainable going forward. And then relative to government incentives, there's also a lot of competition there. So you see every region where we do business today, a significant amount of incentives that are being supplied really for leading-edge and for ICAPS. But I think that -- so that's definitely true, that will be an adder for our systems and service business over the next few years. But I think the bigger factor in the leading-edge is just there is pretty significant demand and you have significant competition for leadership. And I'll let Brice answer the next question.",248

My question is the share gain, is that because the TAM is growing or are the dollars coming out from other areas like lithography? And does that statement include contribution from [indiscernible]?",56
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, May 18, 2023",2023-05-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3694.0,2813008.0,104809334.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,22,"Yes. Thanks for the question. So I would say gate-all-around, there's both higher process complexity of existing steps plus addition of new steps -- if I -- and we've said that's again a $1 billion opportunity for Applied, and we're really in a great position because the steps that are growing, the increased complexity is in areas where we have very, very strong products and technology. And again, we're deeply engaged with every single one of those companies. So in any of those areas for deposition, selective removal, we have very good visibility relative to overall competitive positions and not just in the first generation of gate-all-around but subsequent generations. 
And so again, I think we still see the same thing relative to the size of the market, and the share gains really are relative to FinFET. So what customers were spending for the -- we're spending as a percentage of total transistor from FinFET to gate-all-around, that's where the 5 points of share comes from. 
And then relative to the road maps going forward, what I would say is that we definitely see an increasing relative contribution in materials engineering. So if you look at certainly the transistor innovation, wiring resistance is one of the biggest issues in the whole industry. That's an area that's growing very fast. I talked about the [indiscernible] growth earlier. So again, that wiring is a really great opportunity for us. Backside power distribution will be coming. There you can get up to 30% area savings without changing the feature size and also improvements in power and performance. In the future, you'll see people stacking nanosheets for another transistor technology in future nodes. So again, more and more of those dollars are moving to materials engineering as we go forward.",296

Yes. Thanks, Mark. I would say 2 things. One, as customers are going forward, I mentioned this on the previous question. Materials engineering, I think if you look at the percentage of spending going forward, just really tremendous, -- everybody knows that 2D Moore's Law scaling is challenged. And so the innovations in transistor, innovations in wiring, innovations in memory technologies, all of those areas -- and I mentioned the increase in the number of steps and the increase in complexity from one technology node to the next, we're in a really great position, again, relative to what's going to drive our customers' road maps in the future.
And there's tremendous innovations that will bring [indiscernible] Sculpta was one example of another way that you can achieve area scaling at a much, much lower cost with this directional etch technology -- so -- and there's many material modification steps, double-digit numbers going from one technology node to the next that are growing, those are areas where we have extremely high share. And we're innovating to drive performance and power and cost for customers. So that would be one area, I would say. 
The other one that I'm pretty excited about longer term is packaging and all the innovation is going to happen going from system-on-chip to system-in-package. And I think that's going to be a tremendous inflection. That's about a $1 billion business for us today. I mentioned earlier that we could see that doubling in the next few years. I think that -- and there's -- we have a very strong position in the served markets that we have today. We have pretty high share. And there are other areas we're focused on. We mentioned hybrid bonding as one, but there are others that we're focused on that will create really big opportunities. So that would be the other area, I think that, that whole movement to chiplets and heterogeneous integration.",323

I know you're pretty close and you're going back and forth with CEOs and CTOs. -- but just curious on the timing there.

I'll just say a couple of things, and Gary can add on that. So on the memory side, we do think it's at sort of historical lows. We've thought about our long-term balance of memory and logic over time. We do think the market from an equipment perspective should be about 1/3 memory and 2/3 logic over time. That 2/3 would be split between relatively evenly between ICAPS and leading-edge. So on the memory, we do think it's at a low. However, in the quarter, we monitor pricing, we monitor utilization, we monitor inventories. Those are still moving in the wrong direction in this past quarter. So it hasn't quite turned yet, but we do think with the ICAPS business growing and with an outlook, long-term outlook strong for leading-edge, we do think memory will have to turn around. It's hard to call the exact moment but we expect that to happen. And then Korea, I think it's just good shipments in the quarter. I don't think it portends anything unique from a trend perspective. We see -- we do still see weakness in the market.",189

I don't really have too much to add. Again, we do see long-term foundry logic. We've mentioned this before, 2/3, 1/3, certainly continuing strength in the race for leadership in the leading-edge and sustainable strength in ICAPS going forward. We don't think it comes back to that 2/3, 1/3 soon. But longer term, that's kind of where we think that's going to end up.",65

I don't think so. We still saw in this quarter, we still saw weakness in NAND, and we saw weakness [indiscernible] push-outs on the leading-edge, and that's partly why you see our guide for the next quarter, a little bit bumpy, taking into account some of those push-outs. So I think customers are still reacting to the current environment and checking the road maps and trying to optimize those road maps. And for us, just to sort of reiterate, over the course of this year, the ICAPS business has been so strong that it overcame most of that noise. The growth of ICAPS overcame most of that noise. Plus we had several business units that we're still catching up on back orders. The first part, the ICAPS strength, we expect to continue as the year goes on, as we've said, and be an important component of demand going forward, and the business units that were behind have mostly caught up with the exception of implant, which we are still working to catch up. .",177

Great. The second part of the question first. So we definitely think it will be a continuing trend. So we raised our expectations of demand in China during the quarter, and we raised our expectations over time from China during the quarter. 
And as I may have said in the first question, when we track fab projects in China, there's quite a number. The overall list for the globe is approximately 100 now, and there's a significant amount in China. So when it's mostly in the ICAPS space -- and when we think about the end markets, I guess the perspective I have is that they are localizing as much of the supply to these ICAPS end markets as they can. And so they are building local supply for if you think of sensors, power chips, analog chips, microcontrollers, we believe they're building out those capabilities internally, and I think there's been confirmation recently that some of the imports of those components to China have declined even though demand is growing. So our perspective is the capacity that's being put in place in China, it isn't extraordinary at this point. If you think of China trying to build a local ecosystem of capacity that matches their demand function, if you will, over time, they're not there yet. So these investments make sense if that's the goal, and we know they have government incentives to accomplish that.",237

And so when you look at yield as another factor, that's -- when we look at the overall market, it's roughly in line with what we see relative to our assumptions of the growth rates in those different segments.

The capital intensity, since it's mostly ICAPS, what we see in ICAPS is the capital intensity is sort of like [indiscernible] 5 or 8 years ago. So that whole discussion about there being a lack of reuse, especially in China, those are mostly greenfield sites. They are new equipment sets. So the capital intensity is fairly high. And we think that's consistent by the way with most of the ICAPS additions going on across the globe. And that's a major factor as to why overall intensity as we measure intense WFE intensity to semiconductors, it is going up over time as the fact that ICAPS is so much higher.",114

So AGS, if you look at the way that business breaks out, about 85% is spares and service. And a significant percentage, over 60% is long-term agreements, subscription types of agreements with a length of 2.6 years. We're still seeing very, very high renewal rates. So one thing that helps us in this type of market environment is a lot of that business is still based on those longer-term agreements. So that's helping giving us a level of stability in this type of a market. And then the other part of AGS, kind of mid-teens is the 200-millimeter business, that's really focused on ICAPS. And that business is very robust. So I would say that our business, again, relative to the agreements, pretty stable, continuing to grow, strong renewal rates, and then the 200-millimeter business is also very stable and growing in 2023.

So our outlook does assume that there'll be lower utilization in some of the factories. So we've accounted for that Sidney, but we do expect it to grow year-over-year.",74

Obviously, it's almost like a one-for-one offset to some of the industry weakness in memory and advanced logic foundry. But I guess can you talk maybe to linearity a bit? Because you have talked about how backlog did increase this quarter but still at pretty robust levels. Lead times have sort of normalized. And I think the expectation was that there'd be a little bit of a gearing towards the calendar first half in terms of that business. So I'm kind of curious how you see that still for calendar second half, and whether there's some of this China that's been discussed as part of maybe a wildcard relative to how you view that second half?",129

Thanks, Brian. Without getting specific about trends quarter-over-quarter, it has been gradually increasing. So if we look back to, I think, Q3 of last year, Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, I think we have an increased trend across each of those quarters. And so we're not going to guide the second half, but I don't think there's a front-loaded phenomenon in ICAPS.",62

We have very significant demand. We've launched around 10 new products in ICAPS over the last few years. So that business is going to continue to ramp through the year as we close that supply/demand gap. So that is a significant portion of ICAPS, an area where we have real strength with the customers, the demand there for the inflections is very strong. So again, that's another factor driving our ICAPS strength.",94

And then the question just with the ICAPS strength and relative weakness in advanced foundry logic. I think you've talked about ICAPS being about the half of foundry logic.

The growth has been significant, both last year and this year, as we talked about, and we think it's stable. And then the only thing we've really guided is long term, we think foundry logic is a little bit weak in this year. So we think that gets in more of a balance in the long term on the logic side of WFE. But -- so long term, we would say it's relatively equal. This year, ICAPS is the largest market.",85

I think it's -- for leading-edge factories, I saw somebody quoting around 70%. I think that's probably a good range right now for leading-edge. And the push-outs are really site-specific and project-specific. I don't think they sense or signal a change in direction of any of our customers in terms of their intent to build out new process technologies. And what's ahead for us that's most important is this transition to gate-all-around, and we think that will start in earnest as we get into 2024, and that's one of the big inflections that we think will drive value for Applied. So anyway, that's what I would say on the push-outs.",119

One, the 3-nanometer, we still -- everything that we see -- that's going to be an important technology node. And so certainly, next year, we think that's going to be a meaningful contribution to revenue for Applied. And then as Brice said, for gate-all-around, we'll see the initial ramping of that spending in a meaningful way also in 2024.",69

I know you mentioned $400 billion. How much do you expect that to add to global WFE if you look at '23 or second half '23 or '24?,36
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, May 18, 2023",2023-05-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3694.0,2813008.0,104809374.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,62,"That's the right number, global phenomenon, as you talked about. The way we think about it is it will add about 3% to 7% of WFE over the next 5 years. We don't think $400 billion will be incremental WFE. What we think it does is set the locations, our customers will be putting their assets in place. And because some of those locations will be new, you won't have quite the economies of scale as they might have in their larger facility areas, and that will drive a small amount of incremental equipment since there's a little bit less economies of scale. So we estimate that to be 3% to 7% over the next 5 years. And then in the very short term, we do see companies that are starting to accrue for some of the tax benefits that were included in that group. So I think the incentives are already starting to encourage investment.",157

And in that context, should I assume that like if I were to use FY '22, WFE was closer to $100 billion. And you guys did almost [indiscernible] in earnings. In looking forward,  can you hit those kind of revenue targets without having WFE well above 90 billion? And then for Gary, I understand the government incentives, so that is very good for the [indiscernible] industry. But in the longer term, don't you think that these subsidies could make the cycles actually more volatile? And perhaps I could reference what happened in the past few years, demand [indiscernible] and then we had some [indiscernible] want to understand how you think about the subsidies in the context of the shape of the cycles and volatilities?",141

We expect upsides in our display business as we go forward. So if you're looking to model those, I would look at modeling the continued growth in AGS and thinking about upsides in display on top of where we are today. And that should give you a perspective on if there's no growth in WFE where the model could get to over the next couple of years. And then, Gary, on subsidies.",102

I think that Brice talked about 3% to 7%, Mehdi, incremental spending over the next several years. Certainly, there's a tremendous amount of competition between different geographies. But customers, we think, will invest based on where they see the demand -- so the timing of those investments, I don't think they're going to be significantly different than the way they thought about it in the past. 
The one thing I would say that should be a benefit is that as these companies move into new regions and they're starting up new factories, the initial efficiency of those factories is going to be lower. For sure, as they're moving into the new locations, and that's also incremental help for our service business because they don't have all the trained personnel and all of the infrastructure in place in those new locations. So anyway, that's the way we think about it.",150

You talked about gains in the gate-all-around like 5 points. Do you need these kind of investments to get those market share gains?

Stacy, thanks for the question. So what I would say is that one of the most important factors for any company is the time to innovation, time to commercialization and innovation success rate. So we've been -- and as you know, it takes many, many years from concept to high-volume manufacturing. And that's somewhat of a serial process. And so working with some of our largest customers, we think there's opportunities to drive some of those steps in parallel and significantly accelerate time to innovation. So that's what we're going to be talking about next week. It's really exciting. Again, I definitely do think there's opportunities there. And I do believe that materials inflections, new structures, some of the things I've talked about, that's going to be a bigger and bigger percentage of gains. Some of our big customers talk about design technology co-optimization, becoming a much bigger part of their road map for energy-efficient computing -- so I think, Stacy, we'll cover more of this next week, but we have been working with our largest customers on some of these concepts.
And I definitely think there's ways to accelerate innovation. And as you know, if you think about how much money companies spend on each R&D dollars on each technology node, there's a tremendous opportunity for economic optimization, both on cost and then value creation. Anyway, we'll cover more of that next week. And then we will also cover this at the Semicon event that Mike talked about earlier.",251

Before we begin, I'd like to speak briefly about Israel. As many of you know, Applied Materials has had a significant presence in Israel for nearly 30 years. We were shocked by the terrorist attacks of October 7 and the outbreak of war with its a measurable suffering and loss. Our team in Israel is proving their resilience at this dangerous time and Applied Materials is committed to do our part to help our families stay safe until more peaceful conditions return.  
Now, turning to our results. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2023 with record earnings in our fourth quarter and record revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year as a whole. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team to deliver these outstanding results.
As this is our year-end call, I'll begin my prepared remarks by reviewing our performance and key accomplishments over the past 12 months. I'll then talk about our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied before concluding with our outlook and priorities for 2024.  
While semiconductor and wafer fabrication equipment spending were both down in 2023, Applied was able to demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio as well as the central role we play enabling major industry inflections. Our Semiconductor Systems business delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fiscal year and remains on track for growth in calendar 2023, which will be the fifth consecutive year that we've outperformed the wafer fab equipment market.
We believe we can sustain this outperformance over the coming years, thanks to the leadership positions we've established at the major technology inflections that will enable our customers' road maps.
In the past 12 months, many of our business units delivered new records and major milestones, including etch, where we passed 10,000 shipments of our Sym3 chamber. We also released new products and secured incremental production-tool-of-record positions in gate-all-around, backside power delivery, patterning, advanced DRAM and high-bandwidth memory and heterogeneous integration.  
At the same time, we strengthened our ICAPS business that serves IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor customers, with new products and application wins in etch, epitaxy, implant as well as metrology and inspection.  
In services, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2023, overcoming headwinds including lower fab utilization rates and trade restrictions. In this period, our total installed base increased 5%. In fact, our installed base of process chambers is now more than twice as big as our nearest competitor.  
In addition, there are more than 14,000 tools that are not chamber-based, including CMP, implant and metrology and inspection. We grew the number of tools under long-term subscription agreements, which now generate 63% of our total parts and service revenues. We also maintained the renewal rate of these subscriptions at 90%.  
In 2023, we continue to focus on our operations and supply chain, and we've made significant and sustainable improvements. Compared to this time last year, we are providing customers with better on-time delivery and shipment quality while normalizing our inventory levels. More importantly, our operations are ready to scale as the industry grows over the years to come. 
Across the company, we're in a great position to enable our customer success and profitably grow Applied Materials as this next era of industry expansion takes shape. Looking to the future, there are 4 key components of our growth thesis. First, we believe that semiconductors will outgrow GDP as the digital transformation of the global economy progresses. Second, we expect the market for wafer fab equipment to grow as fast or faster than the market for semiconductors. This is because the industry road map is becoming more complex and chipmakers need to deploy more technology to move from one node to the next. Third, we believe that Applied will outperform wafer fab equipment because the key technology inflections are enabled by materials science and materials engineering where Applied has the broadest, most connected and most enabling portfolio of solutions. And fourth, we believe we can grow our service business as fast or faster than our equipment business by providing customers with advanced service solutions that accelerate technology transfer from R&D to high-volume manufacturing and optimize device performance, yield and cost in their fabs.  
By identifying major industry inflections early and making strategic, multiyear investments in our product portfolio and capabilities, Applied Materials is best positioned to benefit from this exciting period of industry innovation and growth. We have, by far, the broadest portfolio of unit process technology to address our customers' high-value problems in transistor, interconnect, 3D memory, specialty devices and heterogeneous integration.  
We're able to combine these technologies in unique ways to create co-optimized and integrated solutions, and we are seeing strong pull from our customers to work on higher-value module and device integration problems. At no time in our history have we been closer to our customers. We have built a unique platform for collaborative innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. We will significantly expand this collaboration platform with EPIC, enabling Applied and our partners to innovate the way we innovate. 
And our advanced technology-enabled service offerings are seen by customers as increasingly valuable, especially during technology transfer and fab ramp. These advanced services also provide growing subscription revenue streams for Applied.  
Moving to our near-term outlook and priorities for the year ahead. While we are mindful of the complex macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we see demand for Applied's products remaining robust with some changes within the mix. In 2024, we expect demand from our leading-edge foundry-logic customers to be stronger year-on-year underpinned by higher PC, cloud and AI data center spending as well as the initial build-out of gate-all-around nodes.  
We see demand for our ICAPS business being lower, mainly due to softness in the industrial automation and automotive end markets. In DRAM, both pricing and utilization are improving for our customers and we see demand for Applied's products remaining strong. And we believe NAND spending will be up year-on-year, but still far below 2022, and less than 10% of wafer fab equipment spending overall. We expect NAND to remain a lower percentage of the wafer fab equipment mix moving forward.  
In terms of the global trade environment, the October 2023 export control rule changes in the U.S. were primarily focused on alignment with other countries. The rules are complex, and while we are working with the government to clarify certain details, we see no incremental material impact to Applied at this time. 
As I look ahead, I strongly believe that Applied Materials has the right capabilities, strategy and partnerships. In fiscal 2024, our major focus areas include; driving R&D programs to further differentiate our portfolio and extend our leadership as the key inflections that enable future industry growth; continuing to make operational and supply chain improvements to better serve customers, capture economies of scale and drive productivity across the enterprise; and ensuring that as we scale the company, we continue to reduce our environmental impact in line with Applied's collaborative Net Zero Playbook as announced earlier this year.  
Before I hand over to Brice, let me summarize. In fiscal 2023, Applied grew our semiconductor equipment and service businesses, even though our markets were down year-on-year. For calendar 2023, we're on track to outperform the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We believe this outperformance is sustainable, thanks to our strong positions at all the key industry inflections, the strength of our customer collaborations and growing demand for our advanced services.  
And we remain positive about our long-term growth opportunities where we expect semiconductors to grow faster than GDP, wafer fab equipment to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors, Applied to outperform the wafer fab equipment market and our service business to grow as fast or faster than equipment sales.  
Now I'll hand over to Brice.",1310
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3428.0,3061909.0,111338265.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. I'd like to start by thanking our teams for delivering record results this year and for making sustainable operational improvements in our inventory management, manufacturing linearity and on-time delivery performance. 
On today's call, I'll summarize our results for the fiscal year and Q4 as well as provide our guidance for Q1. 
Before going into the results, I'll share my perspective on our unique business model and how it creates attractive returns for our long-term shareholders. Applied creates value by directing nearly $3 billion of annualized R&D into one of the most important markets of the world, semiconductors. Because we have the broadest and deepest equipment portfolio and expertise, we are invited to work closely with our customers as a trusted partner to identify and holistically solve their most valuable technical challenges. 
Our R&D spending helps customers modify materials at atomic levels, and on an industrial scale to deliver better semiconductors and end products for strategic growth markets like artificial intelligence. Our unique relationships with our customers provide us with insights into end market and technology road map trends and allow us to focus our spending on projects that have a high probability of commercial adoption and strong financial returns. 
As a result of the R&D invested in our customers' success, we now have line of sight to market share leadership and growth across the key semiconductor manufacturing inflections, including gate-all-around, backside power, heterogeneous integration, high-bandwidth memory and 3D DRAM.  
The strategies we use to help solve challenges in leading-edge logic and memory are also being deployed in the ICAPS markets, where our growth in 2023 more than offset weakness in NAND and leading-edge logic. ICAPS is also a strategic growth market fueled by powerful trends like edge computing and renewable energy.  
Applied's focused and effective R&D investments have led to fantastic results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've grown revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30% and free cash flow at 33%. We've increased our quarterly dividend per share at a compound rate of more than 12% over this period. And earlier this year, we announced our belief that our free cash flow can support doubling our previous dividend per share over the next several years.
Looking ahead to the next 10 years, we expect semiconductors to grow faster than GDP. We expect the equipment market to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors due to increasing technical complexity. We expect Applied's equipment business to outgrow the market due to our strong portfolio of products and solutions that are squarely targeted at the highest value inflections. And we expect our services business to grow as fast or faster than our equipment business as we help our customers generate increasing value from the industry's largest installed base of more than 48,000 tools.  
Next, I'll summarize our fiscal year results. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased nearly 3% to a record $26.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 20 basis points to 46.8% as our value-based pricing and cost-improvement actions more than offset the impact of inflation. Non-GAAP OpEx increased 13% to $4.69 billion, with the majority of the increase in R&D. Non-GAAP operating profit declined 2% to $7.72 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 29.1%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 4.5% to $8.05 per share. 
We generated record operating cash flow of $8.7 billion and record free cash flow of $7.6 billion. Shareholder distributions were approximately $3.16 billion. We paid $975 million in cash dividends and used approximately $2.2 billion to repurchase 18 million shares at an average price below $123 per share. We remain committed to returning 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time and returned 87% over the past 3 years.  
Now I'll summarize our Q4 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales of $6.72 billion were slightly lower. Non-GAAP EPS rose 4% to a record $2.12. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 130 basis points to 47.3% and non-GAAP OpEx grew 8.8% to $1.19 billion, with around 2/3 of the increase in R&D.  
Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $4.88 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was flat at 36.9%. For the full year, Semi Systems grew revenue by 5% and outperformed the market, delivering record net sales overall and in foundry-logic as well as in implant, packaging, metal deposition and CVD. 
Applied Global Services revenue grew 4% year-over-year in Q4 to a record $1.47 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin grew 100 basis points to 29.3%. For the full year, AGS revenue increased 3%, demonstrating how the underlying growth drivers of the business more than compensated for the trade restrictions enacted in October of 2022, along with fab utilization rates that declined over the past year.
AGS growth is a function of 3 things: the number of tools in the installed base; the increase in service intensity as process complexity increases; and the number of subscription agreements, which increased revenue per tool. In 2023, we increased the installed base by 5%. And we increased the percentage of tools under service agreement by 3 percentage points to 16,600. An important catalyst for AGS is that we are adding entirely new kinds of subscription agreements, including sensor and AI-based solutions in areas like tool matching for fab ramp acceleration. 
In Q4, we signed a unique environmental services agreement under which a large number of process tools and subfab resources are connected to applied eco-efficiency hardware and software products, all delivered as a service that helps our customers reduce electricity consumption and carbon emissions. In addition, we recently signed our largest global comprehensive service agreement ever.  
Finally, AGS continues to produce more than enough operating profit to pay the company's dividend.  
Moving now to Display. Q4 revenue increased to $298 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin increased to 22.5%. We continue to expect the display cycle and Applied's Display business to improve modestly in 2024. And we look forward to our opportunity to drive OLED technology into the laptop and tablet markets in 2025.  
Turning to cash flows in Q4. We generated nearly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.25 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $968 million to shareholders, including $268 million in dividends and $700 million in buybacks. We repurchased 5 million shares at an average price of $138.54.  
Next, I'll discuss our business in China. As Gary indicated, we do not expect an incremental material impact from the recently updated trade rules. Our business in China grew as expected in Q4, largely due to an increase in trailing-edge DRAM shipments that contributed close to $500 million in revenue. In Q4, our overall revenue in China was 44% of company sales. For the full year, revenue in China was 27% of sales, with Semi Systems sales in China composing 20% and AGS and Display sales in China, the remaining 7%.  
We believe equipment demand in China is likely to remain healthy for an extended period because China's domestic manufacturing capacity remains significantly below its share of worldwide semiconductor demand. In addition, while nameplate fab capacity is growing in China, effective capacity is likely to remain below industry averages for some time until product and process yields gradually improve.
Now I'll share our guidance for Q1. We expect our revenue to be $6.47 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue to be $4.7 billion with ongoing strength in trailing edge DRAM. We expect AGS revenue to be $1.46 billion, and Display revenue should be around $235 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.23 billion. we are modeling a tax rate of 13%.
Thank you. And now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.",1315

It also mentioned, though, that you have already disclosed on October -- in October '22 a potential subpoena.
I was just wondering. Can you tell us like what is going on here? What have you actually disclosed around potential legal issues related to your shipments in China around the export controls at this point?

It was 44% of our sales mix. In Q1, we expect it to be elevated again. We'll continue to ship DRAM products at a high level in Q1. And when we think about the mix for China for the rest of '24, we're not ready to give a guide yet, but most of this business is ICAPS business. And it's been very strong growth for '22 and '23 for us.
For '24, we expect it to be a strong -- still strong. It may not be as strong as it was in '23, but China is the largest component to that. So again, we're not ready to guide that, but in our Q1 guide, you'll still see an elevated mix for China.",142

So perhaps you could talk to the non-China part of the ICAPS business. It sounds like that's where you're seeing a little bit of incremental weakness, again, in line with some of your customers.
And then I guess along with that, with what you just said is China coming back to the historic averages, is that a function of just other business growing as opposed to China going down?",82
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3428.0,3061909.0,111338278.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,16,"Okay. Thanks, Chris. On the second part, I think the reason China comes back to its normal averages, around 30%, it's just because the elevated DRAM shipments will normalize after Q1. So we had high DRAM in Q4. We expect that in Q1, and that should slow down after that and it will be mostly ICAPS business again.
And then thinking of ICAPS in general, what I would say again is we had significant growth in '22; significant, even higher growth in '23. So when we think long term, we're expecting mid- to high single digits of growth for ICAPS across several years. 
And to your point, looking right now this year, Q1 is actually a strong guide for ICAPS. But we do see lower utilization. We have seen some pushouts from different customers as they re-time some of their fab projects. And we did see the lower utilization in Q4.
So we do think that Q -- or '24 will be a strong year for ICAPS, it may not be as strong as '23. But again, it's much higher than it was in '22 because of the growth cycle that it's gone through.",194

You gave really good color by application in your prepared remarks, leading-edge, foundry and logic and NAND up. DRAM, it sounded like you're thinking flattish and ICAPS may be down a little bit. Curious if you can perhaps quantify how you're thinking about these different applications and perhaps the overall WFE market into next year? 
And more importantly, you highlighted how you guys have outperformed the market for 5 consecutive years. Is it fair to assume that '24 could be the sixth consecutive year given what you see in your backlog today?",100
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3428.0,3061909.0,111338281.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,19,"Toshiya, I would say that relative to Applied's performance, I'm very optimistic. In leading foundry-logic, we're really well positioned for the major inflections that our customers will be ramping gate-all-around and backside power delivery. Gate-all-around, we'll see some revenue in '24, but that's going to be ramping more significantly in the future years. And backside power, we'll see some revenue also in '24, but also a significant ramp in the coming years. 
And each one of those inflections is a $1 billion incremental opportunity for Applied, and we can capture more. We're on track to capture more than 50% of the overall spend for those major inflections. So really good position in foundry-logic. For Applied overall, as we said in the prepared remarks, we think that business will be healthy in '24.
DRAM is another case where we're really well positioned for the major inflections. We've gained 10 points of overall DRAM share in the last 10 years. And again, going forward, we feel like we're well positioned. We have design wins for those future inflections in DRAM, and we see opportunities to continue to drive share there.
In packaging, that business is $1 billion for us today. And we're in a very good position for all of the different architecture inflections in packaging. And there, again, we have an opportunity to gain over 50% share in packaging inflections as that goes forward.
So all of those areas that we talked about, the leading-edge foundry-logic, DRAM, packaging, all of those areas are very strong for us. And as we said, ICAPS will be weaker in '24, but those opportunities, those markets will offset some of the weakness in ICAPS.  
And Brice, I don't know if you want to add anything on the overall market?",294

Yes, thank you. So for gross margins, first, I would say to investors, we're still committed to what we had modeled, although we delayed it for a year. So we're modeling 48% to 48.5%. That's what we're committed as an interim goal to raising our margins.  
As you highlighted, in Q4, we had 47.3%. It was buoyed by the 44% mix of China. If you strip that away, it's probably 100 basis points worth of uplift. Last quarter, we highlighted that our underlying gross margin today, if not benefited or impacted by something specific in the market, is probably 46.6% or 46.7%. And we do expect to make gradual improvements toward that goal in 2025 as we move forward. That will be primarily continued progress in value pricing as we work to offset high inflation impacts across all of our expenses and then cost reductions.",149

Great to see the subscription attach continuing to rise. Utilizations are still depressed across your customer base, but have they stabilized, especially across advanced, foundry-logic and memory? 
And then just as a quick one, operating margins in AGS are still about 200 basis points below the 30%, 31% that you drove for 6 consecutive quarters through fiscal Q3 of last year. Are inflationary pressures still the biggest factor? Or is it mix related? Is your 200-millimeter ICAPS shipments to continue to remain strong? And any line of sight on getting back into that sort of low 30% range on AGS?",111

Thanks for the question. First question on stabilized utilization rates. I think in general, I would say no because we did see lower utilization rates in ICAPS, as I just highlighted, in Q4. And so there is some digestion there in ICAPS at this point.
Otherwise, as I look across the rest of the segments, if you think about the memory components and you think about leading logic, I would say that's been fairly stable.
On the operating margin side for AGS, and thanks for highlighting the business, because we did grow this year despite the setback at removing some of the China tools from our ability to service going forward. That's really what set us back from a margin perspective and shrank the business in the year and removed some of the smaller customer better margin products that we had.  
But going forward, we will be improving margins in that business, and we're committed to that low double-digit growth rate for our services business. And again, just the components of that will be a growing installed base, a more intense tool need for services and spares and information services and then the ability to have the win-win with subscription agreements with our customers for those services.",209

Gary, I think in the past, you talked about ICAPS being about 1/2 of your business. And given the slowdown you're expecting, a couple of things. I guess you talked about China slowing down a bit in the short term. How do you see the non-China ICAPS business over the next 12 months? And where do you see ICAPS versus the other business mix, I guess, exiting, let's say, fiscal '24?",78
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3428.0,3061909.0,111338291.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,29,"Srini, thanks for the question.. So ICAPS is 1/2 of the total foundry-logic business. So historically, that's -- it's been in that ZIP Code. So foundry-logic is about 1/3; ICAPS is about 1/3; memory is about 1/3, with the compute memory, DRAM being stronger than storage memory NAND, so that's the mix.  
And I would expect that, that mix will continue going forward. I mean in any point in time, you could have some small changes in the mix, but we see foundry-logic still remaining very strong going forward with that about 2/3 of our overall business split between the leading edge and ICAPS. 
So if you think about the big inflections, there's AI for high-performance computing, but there's a lot of growth in edge computing across many different industries. So when we look at the markets, we think that mix is going to be pretty much similar to what we've talked about before: 1/3 foundry-logic, leading; 1/3 ICAPS; 1/3 memory. 
And then did you have another question? Or Brice, did you want to add anything?",176

I'll just add on. Just, Srini, just a reminder for investors here. Our longer-term view is mid- to high single digits for ICAPS as well as the whole semi component. But mid- to high single digits and we do expect that to be consistent for China. We do expect that to be consistent for non-China. And we saw -- as we communicated in our prior quarter, we did see several geographies growing faster than China. So this is definitely a global market, not just a China market, and China isn't even 1/2 of the market as we communicated.
And then as far as the slowness goes or any lighter year, what I would say is our guide in Q1 includes an ICAPS that's very strong and continues to be very strong. So the way we're thinking about it is '22 was very strong, '23 was even stronger. We may take a breath here with a lower utilization, but we expect this market to continue to grow.",167

Everyone else's, first, they said 75 -- well, first, they said 70, then they said 75, and now they're saying 80, but it really can't be 80 because if you add up all 5 suppliers, it's more like flat year-over-year. So can you give a sense of what you think WFE will be this year? I mean I do agree even if it's 90 billion, you're going to still gain share this year. But -- so I guess the first part of the question is, what is the baseline this year for WFE? 
And then I want to find out what's the message on 2024? I hear the message about mix changing. But are you -- but are you committing to WFE being up next year? Or you're not willing to make that commitment yet?",149

So for '23, we've heard all of those numbers also, and we just feel it's best for us to report what we see from our seat. And for us, '23 was a growth year. We highlighted as we went through the last few quarters, how strong DRAM and ICAPS were and how having exposure to those 2 markets and a leadership position in those markets helped us offset weakness that were in some of the other markets, NAND and leading logic primarily. So definitely, everybody can do the math. They can see what our numbers will be with the guide and that should help with your calculation of what the overall market would be. 
And then for '24, we're not calling the total. Again, we're trying to characterize what we're seeing in each market. We do think DRAM will continue to be strong. We think NAND will come up off of a low position. We think leading logic will grow through the year, especially as gate-all-around begins to ship. And we think ICAPS, it's strong in Q1 still, but ICAPS may take a breath with lower utilization. So we'll have to see how that plays out. And then packaging was strong in '23, and we expect that to continue.",214

So on the first part, I think we're still hearing different estimates of what semiconductors might be in 2023 from a growth perspective. What we've been saying from an equipment perspective is the growth was very high. So we described that in '22 at 40% plus. And we've said it was faster in '23 from an equipment perspective.
So the actual semiconductor is obviously not growing that fast, but the equipment market, in preparing for the growth going forward, that's the approximate rate that we see. And then on the leading-logic side, and offsetting ICAPS, again, our Q1 guidance -- actually, ICAPS is very strong, continues to be strong in our Q1 from a sales perspective. We do see lower utilization. We have seen some pushouts. So we're expecting that it won't be as strong a year as it was in '23, although still very strong.
And where we'll see some offset is growing leading logic because leading logic has been lower the past few quarters. And we expect that to pick up through the year as new node investments, especially with gate-all-around, start to ship in earnest.",189

The other thing I would add is that, as I said earlier, we're really well positioned for the major inflections. If you look at foundry-logic, gate-all-around spending starts to ramp in '24. We've been gaining share in DRAM, and we're well positioned for those inflections.  
And as Brice said, packaging was strong at '23. We believe it will still be strong at '24, and we're positioned to capture more than 50% of the spend in all of those different packaging architectures as they ramp in '24. So again, all of those areas will continue to be strong for Applied in '24 and beyond.",104

You've talked about seeing some of these trends in ICAPS that have you thinking that there might be some deceleration. And you talked about China being good in DRAM and DRAM coming down. The China portion of ICAPS, should we be thinking about the utilization of those foundries to the extent that we've seen that? It was already low and they were spending a lot, the utilization's coming down. They still seem to be spending a lot. Do you see that as a lead indicator for your part of the business?",92

I think utilization in China and utilization for ICAPS in general did come down a little bit this cycle. That's definitely visible from a global perspective. When we think about what's happening in China, we have a broad customer base that are serving all of the different end markets. And so our perspective is -- our perspective is they are working on ramping their yields and coming up to mature product yields over time. So I think this is partly just a statement of where they are in the maturity curve of each of these product -- or projects. 
When we think about the market as a total, it's a long list of customers. It's a number of fab projects that are being installed across the country. We think about the total capacity that's being put in place and the goal of being self-sufficient from a chip production perspective, and they're a long way from that, but we think they're committed to that as a whole. They have incentives in place to do it. So we view that market will be a stable part of our portfolio going forward.",194

Also, as Brice said, if you look at the efficiency of the spending, it's going to be less, especially with those new customers for many years. So the wafer starts versus the output, the yields are going to be much less from a device standpoint. So again, that's going to impact the overall output. And we think, again, the gap there with their domestic demand will keep that market healthy for a number of years.",80

Joe, just to finish the -- my thoughts. Sorry, I missed one point. We do think the lower utilization, and we've seen some pushouts in the ICAPS business, this is a global statement. We do think that that's a signal that it will be slightly less than the roaring growth we've seen the last 2 years. And that's why we're saying it will be a strong year.

I want to double-click on the comments on your DRAM business. If I just look at your Semi Systems revenue for DRAM this year, it's tracking to grow 10% to 20% and even exceed the last peak year in '21. But the market is still down quite a bit. The question I have is how much of this outperformance comes from the market being maybe a lot better than we thought versus maybe share gains that you may have? Are you seeing anything structural that drives the capital intensity of that -- your business to be higher? 
 
And my last part of it is just to clarify. You talked about expecting demand for your DRAM products to remain strong, which are assuming roughly flat in '24. Is that also true for the DRAM market in terms of WFE spend?",140

Thanks for the question, Sidney. So we do think the DRAM business was strong this year, partially strong because of some of the shipments to China customers where the process they're running was recently clarified to be within the rules, within the allowed trade rules. So that's a partial explanation. 
But I think we -- when we think of that market, we think that it actually looks like a normal year, even without those China shipments, that the DRAM market was fairly strong from an equipment perspective. And that matches recent years where a lot of the spending is technology upgrades, not necessarily new capacity, and we expect that to continue over time.",114

Sidney, just talking with customers, certainly, the forecast from them, for compute memory, is stronger than storage memory. And if you look just at one example on an AI server, the DRAM content there is much higher than an industry standard server. So again, just I've spent a lot of time on the road this last 3 months and the customers are pretty optimistic about DRAM longer term and compute memory demand.",73

I know it's difficult to benchmark against these figures. But can you provide a reference point on how you see AI augmenting WFE spending this year, next year or even beyond? 
And just kind of maybe a two-parter, but just a clarification, but advanced foundry-logic spending, it's clearly dipped in calendar second half. But tying in your earlier comments, it sounds like you expect foundry-logic to improve off these lower levels in calendar first half of next year. Is that correct?",108
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3428.0,3061909.0,111338313.0,Answer,Brice Hill,,Executives,51,"Okay. Thanks, Brian. On the first part for AI, last cycle, we provided some data points that I think are the relevant data points. We believe about 5% of our WFE is supporting AI workloads. That's not just gen AI, but all AI workloads. And we did highlight that we expect that to grow at probably a 30% or higher CAGR going forward. And I think that's fair.
So whatever WFE number you're using, I think if you use 5% and use your 30% growth rate, that's what we think in our equations, and that would be true for leading logic and that would be true for HBM on the DRAM side.  
And then on the second question, it's really the advanced logic, we're expecting to accelerate in the second half of '24. In our first half guidance -- sorry, in our first quarter guidance, it will really be another quarter of strong ICAPS and strong DRAM. Note not -- it will be similar in strength from a leading logic and NAND to prior quarter. So you still have that dynamic in Q1. So it would really be second half that we see improving leading logic.",196

So really, I just want to understand your thinking behind where could the upside be? For example, I think your largest customer in Taiwan is expecting their capital intensity from the current 40-something percent level to go to what they think is a normalized level in the 30s. How do I reconcile your statement versus their statement?",105

Thanks, Charles. It's hard to -- we probably won't compare with anybody else's comments. But from our perspective, it has been growing. One of the reasons it's been growing is because ICAPS, that particular business, the mature product technologies, as we've described before, there used to be available used facilities and available used equipment and it's really no longer the case. The industry is growing. And without that, just new investments have to be made in wafer starts and capacity, and that's raised the overall intensity level. 
 
When we think to the other types of equipment processes, DRAM, NAND and leading logic, we expect those to be more intensive with more steps from an equipment perspective, requiring new capabilities and new technologies. And that's actually what our R&D is engaged in. So it's more than intuition that we expect that intensity to go up over time.",147

So I know you said ICAPS is down, foundry-logic or leading edge foundry-logic, strong, but you said it would sort of offset some of it.

Yes, we didn't make a call on that. You kind of heard probably the components. I know probably everybody wants us to make a call. But what we're saying is we have a very strong Q1 still in ICAPS. The dynamics in Q1, assuming things play out as we're forecasting, will be similar to Q4. You'll have a strong DRAM market, you'll have a strong ICAPS market. But we know that there have been some pushouts and there is lower utilization in ICAPS. So we're expecting that market to not be the same -- as strong as it was in '23.  
When we flip and look at leading logic, leading logic is weak in Q4, and it's weak in Q1 also, that same dynamic. And we know that new technologies will be ramping, including gate-all-around. So we're expecting that to help throughout the year. Whether that's bigger or smaller than, whatever happens with ICAPS, we can't tell yet, but we'll just have to let that play out.",170

On the first one, there's definitely mixed inventory situations and mixed reports on all the different ICAPS markets. Actually, where we would point as probably being the slowest at this point is industrial. 
What -- just to add a comment for you. On the auto side, I would say that it may be slower from a unit perspective, but because of the density of chips in EVs and even newer cars, we're not expecting much weakness in the auto market. So I guess that's the way I would think of that.",121

From a year-end and closing perspective, I really like the sustainable operational progress our teams have made. Our Semi Systems business grew in a down year, and our services business also had a record year, proving its resilience just like it did in 2019. 
The R&D investments we've been making in collaboration with our customers put us in a great position for the next wave of inflection spending. We now have a line of sight to market share of over 50% across gate all-around, backside power and advanced packaging. At the same time, we're increasing gross margins and generating strong free cash flow, and this sets us up for increasing shareholder distributions.
I hope I get to see many of you at the Wells Fargo Conference in Southern California. In the meantime, for those of you in the U.S., we hope you enjoy a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered results at the high end of our guidance range. Across the business, our teams are executing well. We are making incremental improvements in our operations as we productively scale the company, and we're driving our technology road map, introducing enabling new products and solutions for our customers. 
In my prepared remarks today, I will start with our big picture view of the IoT AI era and how this is driving growth and innovation across the industry. I'll then summarize Applied's strategy and how this is enabling us to outgrow the industry this year, while also positioning us for sustained outperformance over the longer term. And finally, I'll cover our near-term performance and outlook, including some recent business highlights. 
In the summer of 2018, at our AI Design Forum, Applied laid out a thesis explaining how we expected IoT and AI to drive a new wave of semiconductor growth and innovation. Five years later, IoT and AI inflections are having a profound impact across many sectors of the economy as well as within the semiconductor industry. We view IoT and AI computing as 2 sides of the same coin. 
At the edge, consumer devices, vehicles, buildings, factories, and infrastructure are all getting smarter and more capable. Our customers that serve these IoT communications, auto, power and sensors markets or ICAPS are growing and represent the largest portion of wafer fab equipment sales in 2023. Increasingly intelligent edge devices are fueling an explosion of data generation that can then be transmitted and combined to create very large data sets for training AI models. 
High-performance AI computing is primarily enabled by hardware innovations. As a result, AI is becoming the key driver of the leading-edge logic and DRAM road maps as well as heterogeneous integration which creates exciting new innovation opportunities for device designers. 
In summary, the first part of our thesis is that the combination of IoT and AI drives demand for significantly more chips as well as next-generation silicon technologies. 
The second part of our thesis relates to how those chips and new technology innovations will be supplied. In terms of technology, as the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling slowed down, the industry is moving to a new playbook to drive improvements in power, performance, area cost and time to market. The PPACt playbook has 5 elements: new system and device architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink, and heterogeneous integration. 
The transition to the new playbook is positive for Applied in 2 key ways. First, as the road map evolves it is increasingly enabled by advances in materials engineering where Applied has differentiated capabilities. Key examples of this include the move to gate-all-around transistors and backside power distribution in advanced logic. Second, the PPACt playbook is inherently more complex, and we can help customers manage this complexity by providing more comprehensive solutions which include integrated products and advanced services to accelerate R&D, technology transfer ramp as well as yield and cost and volume production. 
In parallel to the new PPACt playbook being implemented, we're also seeing regionalization of semiconductor supply chains as countries seek to build resilient local capacity to support industry verticals that are essential to their economies. As a result, hundreds of billions of dollars of government incentives will be deployed globally over the next 5 years. 
At Applied, we recognized these trends early and made important changes to our strategy, organization and investment profile. In the past 5 years, we created a dedicated organization to focus on the ICAPS market and released more than 20 new products for ICAPS applications. We also formed a team focused on co-optimized and integrated products to accelerate solutions for leading-edge logic and memory. This has resulted in much deeper strategic relationships with our customers, new, highly-differentiated products and increasing market share. 
We developed a very strong portfolio of products to enable multiple generations of DRAM technology that is fueling share gains in this market segment and contributing to our outperformance. And we established a clear leadership position in heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging. In fact, we just announced 5 new heterogeneous integration products at SEMICON West in July. 
This strategy and increased focus on IoT and AI-driven inflections has enabled us to deliver more value to customers and strong performance in 2023 even during a period of very low investment by memory makers. It also positions us for ongoing outperformance in 2024 and beyond. 
Let me highlight a few key areas. In DRAM, our revenues in the first half of 2023 were higher than our 2 closest process equipment peers combined. Our strength in DRAM is underpinned by multiple factors. We have gained significant share in DRAM patterning both for EUV-based and multi-patterning. We have developed unique co-optimized hardmask solutions, which are a key enabler for capacitor scaling. We have successfully ported key technologies developed for logic to DRAM, where they are used in the peripheral circuitry to significantly increase IO speed. And we are the largest supplier of advanced packaging solutions with leadership positions in microbump and through silicon via that enable multiple generations of high-bandwidth memory. 
As DRAM investments increase, we feel very positive about our opportunities, especially in high-performance DRAM for the data center. High-bandwidth memory is less than 5% of DRAM capacity today, but it is expected to grow at a 30% compound annual growth rate over the coming years. If you look at an HBM2 die compared to DDR5, it's about 25% larger because of additional IO routing in the area needed for the TSVs. On top of this, the extra processing steps needed for die stacking further increase our total available market by approximately 5%. 
Another key growth driver is our ICAPS business. We see ICAPS demand as sustainable as these customers are delivering enabling technology for large global inflections that will play out over the next decade. These include industrial automation, electric vehicles and vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems, solar and wind energy, where each megawatt generated requires $3,000 to $4,000 of power chips and the smart grid, which could drive $50 billion of annual silicon demand by the end of the decade. 
ICAPS investments are also expected to be underpinned by government support around the world and we expect these markets to be a significant beneficiary of regional incentives. The increasing complexity needed to enable the PPACt playbook, combined with the broadening of the industry's geographic footprint are both key growth drivers for our service business. 
AGS delivered record revenue this quarter and is on track to grow in 2023, even with this year's low fab utilization rates and after absorbing the impact of new U.S. trade rules. This year, more than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements are growing at a faster rate than the installed base and have a high renewal rate of more than 90%. 
With strong customer pull for our services and a robust pipeline of new capabilities, we believe we're on-track to achieve low double-digit AGS growth in the coming years. While I'm excited about the opportunities ahead, it's important to recognize that to deliver this future the industry must also overcome significant challenges relating to complexity, cost and our combined carbon footprint. 
At Applied, we believe the way to do this is through closer collaboration and higher velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technology for energy-efficient computing. 
In the past quarter, we announced 2 major initiatives: our EPIC platform in the United States and a collaborative engineering center in India. These investments will support even faster and better relationships with customers, universities, suppliers and government partners to accelerate time to innovation and time to commercialization while increasing our combined R&D productivity. In addition, we're also driving a collaborative approach to reduce carbon emissions as the industry grows. 
In July, we rolled out our collaborative Net Zero Playbook, and we announced 2 major new products that help customers with carbon reductions: our Vistara platform, which lowers platform energy consumption by up to 35% and increases throughput density by as much as 30% and EcoTwin, that enables customers to monitor, model and optimize chemical and energy consumption by tool and by recipe. 
Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Advanced chips are at the foundation of major global inflections and as the IoT AI era takes shape is driving a new wave of growth and innovation for the semiconductor industry. 
At Applied, we have focused our strategy and investments to deliver high-value technologies that enable key IoT and AI-driven inflections. We have strong leadership positions in ICAPS, leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM and heterogeneous integration using advanced packaging. This strategy is enabling us to consistently deliver strong results in 2023 despite lower overall wafer fab equipment spending and positions us for sustainable outperformance over the coming years. 
Now Brice, it's over to you.",1493
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2023",2023-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,3082418.0,111723161.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. On today's call, I'll discuss the business environment, summarize our Q3 results, provide our guidance for Q4 and frame the investments we're making in our R&D infrastructure. 
Before covering the near term, I'll remind you of our longer-term thesis. First, we believe the semiconductor industry is on track to grow faster than the overall economy over time and reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030. Second, Applied's leadership in materials engineering is increasingly critical to our customers' road maps. Third, Applied's broad portfolio of differentiated products, balanced market exposure and growing services business, make us less volatile today than in the past and more likely to grow faster than our markets. And fourth, our efficient business model generates strong profitability and free cash flow, which enables us to both invest in profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. 
Moving now to the Q3 business environment. We continue to see strength in ICAPS, which largely offset weakness in leading-edge foundry logic and NAND. ICAPS demand was broad-based, generating record revenue in 200-millimeter systems and record revenue in Europe. In fact, the United States, Japan and Europe are the fastest-growing ICAPS regions this year. Around the world, customers and governments are making long-term investments to ensure future supply of a wide range of semiconductors needed to support growing demand in key industries such as automotive, medical equipment and renewable energy to name a few. 
Turning to our operational performance in Q3. Our teams delivered strong results. We exceeded our revenue guidance across semiconductor systems, services and display. We improved our delivery performance in systems and services and made further progress reducing inventory. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both the second highest in our history. 
Now I'll summarize our Q3 financial results. Company revenue was nearly $6.43 billion, down 1% year-over-year and in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin was slightly above our guidance, and operating expenses were slightly below. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.90, down 2% year-over-year and near the high end of guidance. 
Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue of $4.68 billion was down 1% year-over-year. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.8%. Applied Global Services generated record revenue of over $1.46 billion and non-GAAP operating margin of 29.3%. This was AGS' 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. While 200-millimeter system sales contributed to the growth, the team also made strong progress driving the leading indicators of our subscription business. For example, tools under service agreement are up 5% year-over-year to over 16,000 systems and tools under comprehensive service agreement, which have the highest revenue per tool, are up 7% year-over-year, reaching 12,000 systems. 
In Display, revenue grew sequentially to $235 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 15.7%. Turning to cash flows. We generated $2.58 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is 40% of revenue. We produced over $2.3 billion in free cash flow, which is 36% of revenue. We distributed $707 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share buybacks. We paid $268 million in dividends, and the dividend per share was $0.32, reflecting the 23% increase announced in March. We used $439 million to repurchase nearly 3.4 million shares at an average price below $130. 
Now I'll share our guidance for Q4. We expect Q4 company revenue to be $6.51 billion, plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $2 plus or minus $0.18. Within the guidance, we expect semi systems revenue to be around $4.75 billion. We expect DRAM revenue to be up by around $500 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by trailing edge shipments. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.42 billion and display revenue should be around $290 million. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be about 47%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.17 billion. We continue to model a tax rate of 12.3%. 
Finally, as we said last quarter, we plan to make a multibillion-dollar investment in new R&D infrastructure over the next several years to significantly expand our capacity to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers as we develop next-generation materials, process technologies and equipment. The scale of the investment will depend on our ability to secure government support. The EPIC Center is expected to come online in fiscal 2026. And while we expect our capital expenditures to be higher over the next several years, there is no change to our strong commitment to shareholder returns. 
In summary, Applied Materials continues to execute well. We are making good progress against our internal goals and outperforming our markets. While wafer fab equipment spending is lower in calendar '23, our semi systems revenue in the first 3 calendar quarters is trending slightly up year-over-year, and our services business remains on track for year-over-year growth. We've aligned our business with the fastest-growing end markets and are winning key decisions across leading-edge foundry, logic, DRAM, ICAPS and advanced packaging. 
We are in a great position to invest for technology leadership and growth, generate strong free cash flow and increase shareholder returns.

So DRAM in the quarter was strong and you've got a lot of growth in the next quarter. You said it was mostly from trailing edge. Am I right in reading that is primarily the Chinese customer driving that? 
And maybe you could sort of talk a little bit about your strength in China that is from DRAM versus foundry. It almost sounds like the DRAM piece is stronger than the ICAPS space in China right now.",90

Thanks for your question. This is Brice. Yes, so we highlighted in Q4 that we'll see sequential growth in DRAM. It is related to confirming technologies that we can ship to customers in China. We've gotten lots of customers about that -- or questions about that during the quarter. So we wanted to make sure that people got that answer. So you'll see that growth in Q4. It probably won't be the only quarter where we'll have shipments along those lines, but we wanted to make that clear on the trend quarter-over-quarter. 
And one more thing that I'd add, we think that's something that's not well understood by the investors that while the memory market has been weak for our customers, the DRAM market actually has been fairly strong this year from an equipment perspective, and this is just a continuation of that profile for us. So we've got a good position in DRAM, and that is manifesting in Q4.",162

Maybe just let me add some color and then you can ask the follow-on question. So DRAM, we've added about 10 points of overall DRAM wafer fab equipment share in the last 10 years. So if you look at the big inflections in DRAM, the periphery moving to high-speed IO for high-bandwidth memory, we're taking logic technologies into DRAM. That's a really big driver for our share gains. Capacitor scaling is an area where we have strength, patterning share gains advanced packaging, especially high-bandwidth memory. So all of those areas are really big drivers for Applied and have contributed to this 10% overall WFE share gain in DRAM over the last 10 years. 
And then you have another question, Stacy?",121

You're talking about significant outperformance versus WFE here in calendar '23. And so a two-part question. So if you look out to the January quarter representing calendar year, are you suggesting that you guys should be kind of flat to down 4% kind of year? 
And then as you look to calendar '24, can you speak to, I guess, what kind of pent-up demand in terms of deferred revenues is helping this year that won't be replicated next year versus gains where you see leverage to the right end markets and/or new technologies that can drive relative outperformance?",106

Thanks, C.J. Maybe I'll start with the 2024 because I think you were embedding a question there on in '23, how much did we benefit from unserved orders in '22. We think that's about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. All of that was served in the first half of the year. So what you're seeing from us in '23, besides that $0.5 billion to $1 billion is largely tracking with the business that we see, the WFE business that we see during the year. So there shouldn't be an overhang. There shouldn't be a benefit from any previously booked business that we see now or going forward. 
And as far as sustainability, that's one question we get regularly. The second question that we get regularly is just about ICAPS and the sustainability from China. And while that's the most -- the largest country in ICAPS for China, it's not the fastest growing. That's sort of a -- that's a global trend and a global demand function. We see that as very sustainable. We think gate-all-around will start shipping in earnest in '24. We think our services business will grow in '24. We think that the display business will be a little bit better in '24, so those are kind of the bits that we've given for '24. Otherwise, we're not going to give a specific forecast yet for '24 or for the January quarter.",235

Maybe I'll add a little bit more color. On the leading-edge foundry logic, what we see is more of that spending moving to materials-enabled technologies, which is the sweet spot for Applied. So if you look at, again, the nodal spending, more is shifting to materials engineering, gate-all-around, we've talked about that's a $1 billion opportunity for us. Backside power, when that comes in, that really leverages all of our strength in interconnect. And that's probably the same ZIP code in terms of size of opportunity for Applied. 
ICAPS, we've talked a lot about formed the organization 4 years ago. We've introduced 20 major new products since we formed the organization. And we still have room to grow in ICAPS share. DRAM, I talked about I think people really maybe don't understand the strength we have there. I talked about those big inflections and gaining 10 points of overall DRAM WFE share over the last 10 years. 
Packaging, that's a $1 billion business for us now, and we see an opportunity to double that over the next few years. And as Brice said, services, we're going to be up in services in a relatively weak memory market in terms of utilization, and we're still on track for low double-digit growth. So again, those are some of the things that really will help us outperform over the longer term.",233

I'll answer the second part first. So we do think Applied will grow faster than whatever the WFE is for the market. And that's a good way to think of it because we think of -- we think and plan for long-term secular growth, and we think we'll grow faster. 
On the question of pull forward and specific to China, we've got many ways to test that equation. One of the things that we do is we look at the amount of local capacity relative to local consumption. We think that there's strategic direction in the country and strategic incentives in the country to make the investments that will at least equal local consumption. And we think those things are tracking together and can rationalize what they've put in place from that perspective. 
We also triangulate the overall capacity being purchased relative to semiconductor market itself. As you know, we test that with intensity, and we make sure that equation makes sense to us. 
And then from a micro perspective, we also look at the installation of our equipment. So we make sure when it lands in China, we understand that it's installed and then we track the utilization also at a macro level in the market. And we know that all that equipment is being installed and operated. And so we don't see signs of unneeded or unwanted or unused equipment pulling up from that perspective, and we think the buys are rational at this point.",252

You spoke about high bandwidth memory and how it's benefiting advanced packaging, which makes a kind of sense given the exposure to TSV, et cetera. But on the other side, it seems like hybrid bonding is slowing down and some of your hybrid bonding customers are looking at things like thermal compression bonders, can you give any color on that? 
And along the same path, Gary, you've spoken about gate-all-around being like $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month incremental opportunity and 5-point share gains for Applied. You're there in most of those core technologies like epi, vertical epi, ALD, selective devices, et cetera, are customers in gate-all-around making bundling decisions? Or are they still going with best-of-breed solution?",132
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2023",2023-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,3082418.0,111723180.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,22,"Well, thank you. Those are 2 big questions. Let me start off with high-bandwidth memory packaging. So that uses 2 critical packaging technologies through silicon via and micro bumping to enable stacked DRAM. And the great thing for Applied is that we have the broadest portfolio to enable all different types of packaging CMP, PVD, CVD, etch and plating. So this opportunity for us is meaningful. The TAM for HBM increases about the overall packaging by about 5%. We're the overall leader in packaging as we have talked about, it's a $1 billion business, and we're on track to double that over the next 3 to 5 years. So that's definitely a good opportunity. 
On the hybrid bonding, what I would say is that we absolutely see hybrid bonding as a great opportunity over time. It's not something that is going to generate significant revenue in the short term, but chiplets are something that every single company is focused on, and I do believe all of the things that we've discussed relative to growth rates there, we still believe that's on track. 
And then gate-all-around the other question that you asked, we still see that as about $1 billion opportunity for 100,000 wafer starts per month. And in FinFET, we had close to 50% share of that overall FinFET opportunity. We've indicated with the full adoption of gate-all-around, we have an opportunity to increase our share 5%. 
And I think one of the things that helps us a lot is that we're deeply engaged with every company in gate-all-around, even with their integration teams because we have so many of those critical enabling technologies. So all the things we talked about back to our Master Class when we size that around $1 billion is basically still on track. And relative to ramping gate-all-around, we believe that is towards the end of 2024. 
And well, the other thing is on the unit processes in IMS. There are some areas of that market where we're combining different technologies together under vacuum, which is something that's completely unique for Applied Materials. that has a big impact on electrical performance. But the main message is we have very, very deep engagements with all of those integration teams and gate-all-around is pretty much on track to what we had talked about previously.",387

So how big was ICAPS as a percentage of your business in the July quarter? Where do you see that going in the second half of the calendar year? 
And maybe more importantly, yourself and Gary talked about sustainability in the business. I think the rationale for China makes a ton of sense. How are you thinking about the U.S., Europe and Japan, where your customers, yes, they're strategic, but they also care about near-term profitability and returns with some of the end markets slowing, is there a fear that the non-China business within ICAPS could slow going forward?",111

Thanks, Toshiya. On the ICAPS, we haven't articulated exactly how big it is. What we've said is this year, it's our largest market. It grew very strongly last year. It's growing strongly again this year. And we've said, over the longer term, as you think about the business, it's probably 1/3 ICAPS, 1/3 leading logic and 1/3 memory and that's about as much. But you can get a feel for it. As we said all year, the ICAPS business growth has been strong enough to offset weakness in NAND and leading logic. So those -- that will let you probably get a ballpark. 
On the regionalization, we do think that regionalization leads to a little bit more spending globally for ICAPS. But we also look and see whether that's a sustainable trend from our perspective. We look at the underlying businesses and the growth rates of all the device types that are being invested whether it's China or whether it's the different markets across the world. And we rationalize that, and we think all of the investment that's being made is consistent with the growth rates of those underlying devices and markets. So 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% CAGRs for the different device types that fall into that, like computer vision, analog, power chips, those sorts of markets. And then on the last piece...",224

One thing I would say on the -- Toshiya, this is Gary. Relative to regionalization of the supply. One of the things that is extremely important is some of those ICAPS segments are tied to very large vertical markets in those different regions. So having a secure supply chain is something that is a big focus for every country. There are hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives there for supporting those different ICAPS markets. So that's another thing that certainly we're seeing. 
And the last thing I'd say is relative to opportunities, the -- not only is it systems, but as companies are moving into new locations. That's a really great opportunity for our service business because there is no service infrastructure set up for those companies moving into new regions. And that certainly will help us. We're on track for the low-double-digit growth in our service business, but the opportunity is supported by this regionalization.",158

We've seen it, but I would just remind you, the way people are doing equipment investments, it's a 2-, 3-, 4-year planning horizon.

It's about 10% to 12% of your systems business. I think it grew above 55%, 60% faster than your overall systems business last year. Gary, you talked about strong technology inflections and benefits across the wafer equipment portfolio, but I'm assuming this is also putting strong requirements for more and better process control. 
So with that, I mean, can you just give us an update on process control portfolio? And how is that segment performing relative to your overall systems business this year?",92

So PDC for us, there are really 2 major areas of focus. One is, as you've talked about, is growth within PDC but the other thing that is increasingly important is the synergy with PDC and our process equipment, both for unit equipment and integrated material solutions, accelerating R&D for some of these major inflections. 
So on the PDC growth, the business grew about 2x between 2020 and 2022, eBeam is one of the fastest-growing segments there. And we've maintained our leadership with around 50% overall share in eBeam. We have new products coming to market. We've talked about in our Master Class, the cold field emission with the highest resolution and fastest imaging. So that's helping that business growth. 
And then on the synergy, we had discussed the capacitor formation in DRAM, where we're bringing new materials, new etching solutions together with eBeam technology, again, to accelerate those inflections, nano sheets and gate-all-around. 
These technologies are incredibly complex and you can't fix what you can't see. And our eBeam imaging is world-class, ahead of anyone else. And so that synergy value is increasing. That will also help our growth in our market share overall, in our semiconductor product group, but in PDC. So again, we're really in a great position, strong pipeline of products coming in PDC and great synergies with overall Applied.",229

First of all, Brice, can you give us a sense of the $1.7 billion that's in July for China revenue, can you tell us how much of that is domestic, China chipmakers versus other multis that might have fabs in China, but they're not domestic Chinese chipmakers? 
And then part 2 of the question is, is how do you handicap the potential that this China DRAM is a pull-in? I mean we have Micron as the band in China. We have a China memory maker now taking $100 million more worth of your tools in October versus July, that's $2 billion to $2.5 billion worth of extra WFE that's just in that's just in that 1 quarter. So how do you handicap sort of how you run the production factory? Do you count on that being sustained? Do you think that it's possible that it could be a pull in, if you can just comment on that.",163

Thanks for the questions, Tim. So on the $1.7 billion for China, about 27% of our revenue. It's almost all -- it's not 100%, but it's almost all domestic Chinese customers, very little on the multinational at this point. And then -- and just a reminder, it does include a portion of our services business. It does include a portion of our display business in that number also. 
And then on the handicapping whether it's a pull-in for the traditional or legacy DRAM, I certainly don't get to pull-in. This is a technology that was viewed as not being part of the rules where technologies were restricted for China. So it's an existing technology. I think they'll put that equipment into operation as quickly as possible. And just in general, if we go up to 100,000 feet on this question, for equipment like that, that's being installed in China, our view is that it's not incremental if it weren't allowed to be shipped there, that it would be shipped somewhere else in the world for production. So we just view it as mainly location, and we triangulate the amount of equipment we're selling against the overall demand function. So we view it as location, not incremental.",207

I guess how do we think about that competition?",66

Thanks for the question, Joe. So I would say we're always focused on competition, even in noncritical process steps, and the main focus for us at Applied is to keep innovating in all areas of our portfolio and create deeper strategic relationships with the leaders in all device segments. 
In ICAPS, as we've talked about 4 years ago, we formed that group, and this has paid off with share gains, helped us build deep strategic relationships with all the leading customers. And I'd say that those strategic relationships begin with the integration teams, whether it's in the leading edge or an ICAPS is super important because those technologies are always moving very quickly and learning faster than others is really important. 
We've talked about in ICAPS since we formed this group we launched 20 major new ICAPS products. And I would tell you that we also have a strong pipeline of new innovations that will continue to strengthen our positions. 
The last thing I'd say in ICAPS is there are still -- again, we have the strongest strategic position, broadest portfolio, we're working with those integration teams on their next-generation technologies. But we also have room to grow in certain segments like etch and PDC. We have momentum in those segments, and that certainly is going to help us continue to gain share in the coming years.",228

I was surprised to see services at a record level given the utilization issues in memory. Can you talk about that?

Thanks, Joe. This is Brice. So yes, the services business, 16 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. It was a record this quarter. And yes, the puts and takes there are that the transactional spares and the transactional activities that sort of are associated with utilization are significantly lower in the quarter. And then what we see that's higher in the quarter that drove that growth was really the 200-millimeter equipment. So we talk about ICAPS growth and the strength of those markets. And the 200-millimeter equipment is really what's driving the significant upside in the services business for the quarter. 
And then on the second part of the question, incremental headwinds for memory. When we think about the memory market, there's been discussion of when will it be turning around and when will we see upside. The indicators that we follow: price, inventory and utilization, we still see trending in the negative direction or flat. So we haven't seen a turn at this point. But we wanted to be careful to point out that in the DRAM market, we have seen strength this year. And it's sort of a normal year from an equipment perspective on the DRAM side, even though the memory market itself has been weak.",209

I think the other thing to add is that part of our business is based on service agreements and that also helps us have a higher level of stability. We're over 60% on the service agreements. And again, that's keeping that part of the business much more stable, even though the memory utilization is down. And the other thing I would say is that there is a significant amount of complexity. If you think about all the inflections, whether it's in memory with DRAM or ICAPS or leading-edge foundry logic, about 1/3 of our revenue are these integrated material solutions with multiple technologies combined in a single platform under vacuum, those are increasing, those steps are increasing and the service opportunity for us is also increasing. 
So we've talked about the low double-digit growth in service. Once you come back to more normal levels of utilization, and we have a high confidence we're going to be able to achieve that.",165

Thanks, Timm. Well, our spending at this point is 18.1% of revenue, it's a little bit higher than our model, but we're very comfortable with our spending level. We put about 66% of our spending, 2/3 towards R&D. And we are fully focused on the road map. So when we think about the business, we think about the longer-term trajectory of the business. Our perspective is we're investing in a secular positive trend. We think about semiconductors growing high mid-single digits, so 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%. We think there'll be -- it's becoming more complex to build those semiconductors, which drives more equipment, so that's an additive function. 
We also think that Applied, looking forward, designing for the inflections with our customers, we'll gain share on top of that. So we think there's an additive function between the market growth of semis, the more -- the higher complexity of the equipment and then the increased intensity from materials engineering and Applied's participation. So all those things add up to a significant growth rate. And so what I would expect is the spending level you see today will focus on maintaining approximately that spending level as we identify the best R&D projects to work on as we go forward. 
And then I would also highlight that just for investors who are working on their models, we've held our spending flat for pretty much 3 quarters and we said we've been very conscientious and very focused on strategic hires only. As we move to Q1, so the first quarter of our fiscal next year, we'll see our normal pay raise cycle, and we'll see our normal raise of spending in that cycle. So I just wanted to highlight to people that that's what they'll see if they're modeling that function.",299

Wonder what's the impact that you might be seeing in terms of your revenue coming from that particular customer in 2024 and beyond. And any preliminary thoughts on the relative outperformance of WFE maybe in '24 by segment, meaning leading-edge, foundry logic, ICAPS, DRAM and NAND?",64

Thanks, Charles. All I can say about any particular customer, but especially leading-edge customers is that we're current on their forecast. So we understand at an account level what they're forecasting in the future. They've all started as we went through the supply chain crisis, we're getting better visibility into the road maps top to bottom. So we have that, we have a good perspective on that. 
In general, we haven't called a number for WFE in '24 -- for our business in '24. I just highlighted in the prior question that our view of the long-term growth of the market, sort of what guides our investments, et cetera. What we have said for next year is that we expect the ICAPS business to be stable. So that growth is durable, if you will. It's grown at a high level for the last 2 years, and we expect that business not to fall off, but be stable. We expect our display business to grow modestly, we expect our services business to grow at the low double digits as we've described. And I think that's the color that we've given so far for the market. That leaves out memory and leading logic and we just have to wait until we get closer to give a forecast.",216

Relative to longer term, as I mentioned earlier, we're in a great position. If you look at this incremental spending for the future technology nodes, a higher percentage of that incremental spending is going to materials-enabled technologies. And as I said, that's a sweet spot for Applied, gate-all-around, backside power, where you get power and performance benefits, but also you're going to get area savings with that inflection. So we have been growing our position from -- for each technology node. I think that gets even better going forward.",94

Thanks for the question. I think that we're not going to give a specific dollar amount. But what I would say is that, that inflection is just starting to ramp in the latter part of '24. So it's not going to be a significant driver in '24, but certainly going forward, our opportunity there is significant.",57

Thanks, Mike. Just one content note that I wanted to add. So we get a lot of questions about modeling gross margin, and I just want to highlight for the people that are doing their models. Our 47% guide for Q4, that's a little bit higher than what we would have expected with a rich mix in Q4. We're probably running underneath that at a normal mix around 46.6%, 46.7%, somewhere around that. So as people think about modeling their next year, we think we'll continue to make progress from 46.6% or 46.7% to on our way to 48% to 48.5% in '25. So if that helps from a modeling perspective, I just wanted to highlight that. 
From a closing comments perspective, we're executing well. We're outperforming our markets. The Semi Systems year-to-date revenue is trending up year-over-year. Our services business is on track for year-over-year growth. We're aligned -- we've aligned our businesses with the fastest growing end markets, and we're winning in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, ICAPS and heterogeneous integration. We're investing for technology leadership and growth. We're generating strong free cash flow and increasing shareholder returns. 
I hope to see many of you at the Jefferies Conference in Chicago, and Gary will be keynoting at the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco. 
Now Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.",225
