I'm pleased to report that earnings for our first fiscal quarter exceeded the top end of our guidance, reflecting outstanding execution across the company in a market environment that is strengthening. Based on our calendar year revenues, we believe we outperformed both the market and our direct peers in 2019. We entered 2020 with momentum, and the signals we see give us increased confidence that the years ahead will be very good for the industry and especially for Applied Materials. In today's call, I'll give you my perspective on how our markets are evolving and provide our near-term outlook. Then, I'll highlight the key components of our strategy to address the changing needs of our customers and drive sustainable, profitable growth for Applied Materials. 
Before I get started, I'll take a minute to address the implications of the coronavirus outbreak. To direct a comprehensive response across all the regions where we operate, we quickly activated our business continuity teams. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We're also doing everything we can to provide our customers the support they need to minimize disruption to their business. In addition, the Applied Materials Foundation is sending medical equipment into Wuhan, and we've created a humanitarian response fund for our employees in China and the communities where they live and work. 
In terms of the business, our current assessment is that the overall impact for fiscal 2020 will be minimal. However, with travel and logistics restrictions, we do expect changes in the timing of revenues during the year. We are actively managing the situation in collaboration with our customers and suppliers. 
While we're making the necessary adjustments to our near-term plans, we are not taking our eye off the powerful trends that are driving the semiconductor industry forward and creating a structurally larger and less volatile market. At the low point of this recent down cycle in customer spending, which occurred in the second calendar quarter of 2019, the combined quarterly revenues of the top 5 semi equipment companies were only 17% lower than at the cycle's peak. In contrast during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, peak-to-trough revenues for the same 5 companies combined dropped on average 44%. 
Another important metric we look at is equipment intensity or annual equipment spending as a percentage of annual semiconductor industry revenues. Between 1990 and 2014, this equipment intensity metric fluctuated between 17% and 6%. However, when we look at the most recent 5-year period, equipment intensity has been in a tight band of 10.5% to 12% with a mean of 11.5%. We believe this is a good estimate going forward and reflects the ever more complex technology challenges we're addressing and the increasing value we're delivering to the ecosystem. In addition to the higher growth and lower cyclicality we see in the market as a whole, Applied is demonstrating even lower volatility than our peers. The reasons for this include the breadth of our product portfolio and the balance we have across different device segments. Dan will provide more color on this topic in his section.
Moving to our near-term outlook. We see robust foundry/logic investment continuing. There is a strong commitment on the part of these customers to advance the leading edge as they get ready for demand related to the rollout of 5G. At the same time, we're also seeing healthy spending for specialty nodes to support growing demand from the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor market. 
Progression in the memory market is consistent with the view we've shared over the past several quarters. NAND appears to be in the early stages of recovery with prices rising and inventory levels down to 4 to 5 weeks. That's compared to 8 to 10 weeks this time last year. We also see a good setup for DRAM to recover. Encouraging signs include supplier and end market inventories that are starting to get back to normal levels, and prices appear to have bottomed. These leading indicators bode well for a pickup in investment by memory customers later in the year. 
Overall, we like the way the market is shaping up for 2020 and beyond. We believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double-digit growth this year and feel very good about our longer-term opportunities. 
In display, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We expect FY '20 revenues to be similar to FY '19 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle. We still believe that display is an attractive adjacent market for Applied that provides good long-term growth opportunities. The business remains solidly profitable even as we make the necessary investments to ensure that we have the right portfolio of products ready for when the market picks up. 
Stepping back and looking at this year in its broader context, it's important to note that the overall electronics industry is in a period of expansion and diversification. Major new growth drivers, including IoT, big data and artificial intelligence, are layered on top of traditional demand for smartphones and PCs. As I look ahead, I strongly believe that the future will not be like the past. The emerging workloads that will shape the next era of computing require domain-specific approaches, new system architectures and new types of semiconductor devices. I believe that we need a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing to deliver the power, performance and area cost improvements that will unlock the potential of AI and big data. 
At Applied, we've aligned our strategy and investments around this new playbook so that we can enable new system architectures, new devices and 3D structures the introduction of novel new materials, new advances in 2D geometric shrinks and new ways to connect chips together through advanced packaging. Applied has a unique portfolio of materials engineering capabilities and products to enable the new playbook. Getting these new technologies to market faster has never been more valuable, and this is a major emphasis across the company. For example, we're using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to improve learning rates, speed up the transfer of new technologies from Applied's labs to customers' factories, and reduce the time it takes to optimize device performance, yield, output and cost. In addition, we have more engagement with a broader ecosystem than ever before, focused on accelerating innovation all the way from materials to systems. 
Our strategy is yielding results for our customers and Applied. Calendar 2019 was a new record for our foundry/logic revenues, and the current leading edge node transition further grows our opportunity. For an equivalent number of wafer starts, our available market increases by more than 10%. We're also generating record revenue from specialty markets where customers build their technology upon trailing geometries. For these customers, the innovation road map is driven by materials innovation rather than geometric scaling. Strength in leading edge, combined with healthy investments in specialty nodes, means that several of our leadership businesses, including metal deposition and epi, are delivering record revenue. 
At the same time, we continue building momentum in areas of the market where we still have plenty of room to grow. In the quarter, we secured major application wins for critical edge steps at both foundry/logic and memory customers. Our process diagnostics and control business delivered record quarterly revenue driven by strong adoption of our new optical wafer inspection system and continued strength in our leading e-beam products. 
We're also making great progress in packaging. As the industry introduces increasingly sophisticated packaging approaches, our strategy has been to focus on addressing the most critical process steps. As a result, we've been steadily gaining market share. Our packaging business delivered record revenues in 2019 while winning well over 50% of our available market. 
Another important growth factor for the company is our service business. Equipment maintenance is an attractive recurring revenue stream for Applied. And in calendar 2019, we added more than 2,000 systems to our installed base. As I've talked about before, we are finding new ways to deliver value through data-enabled services that accelerate customers' fab ramps and optimize the device performance, yield, output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. As we do this, we're increasing the number of installed base systems covered by long-term maintenance agreements. In the past 12 months alone, we have grown the number of systems covered by these agreements by nearly 15%. 
Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. While we're adapting our near-term plans in response to the coronavirus outbreak, our outlook for 2020 remains very positive. We believe we can drive strong double-digit growth in our semiconductor business this year and significantly outperform the market. 
We also like the setup for 2021 and beyond. Our markets are better than ever with powerful new growth drivers still only in their early innings. Applied's opportunities have also never been better. We are uniquely positioned to enable the new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing while helping our customers accelerate innovation from materials to systems. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Dan.",1527
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676400.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Applied Materials returned to year-over-year growth in Q1, with revenue up 11% and non-GAAP EPS up 21% versus the same period last year. Revenue and gross margin exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. And earnings were above the high end of our range. Our revenue performance was driven by semiconductor systems, which was up 24% year-over-year. We generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and returned close to $400 million to shareholders. 
Our business outlook calls for continued strength in Q2 and our second half. Our relative performance is especially strong. We outgrew the overall semi equipment market in calendar 2019, and we significantly outperformed our closest peers. Applied has made strong investments across our portfolio in recent years. And today, we are a larger and more resilient company that performs well in a variety of market conditions. One of Applied's unique attributes is our broad portfolio, which is more diversified across end markets and more balanced among semiconductor device types, including memory, leading edge and specialty nodes in logic and packaging. Our portfolio makes us more stable relative to our past and relative to our peers, the closest of which were 50% to 100% more volatile in the recent cycle. Today, our traditional strength in foundry/logic is apparent as we set new quarterly records for overall foundry/logic revenue as well as in metal deposition and process control systems sales. Our investments in memory have given us a balanced share profile, and this will enable us to continue to generate strong returns when spending recovers later this year. 
A key pillar of our stability is our aftermarket business, which includes Applied Global Services and our 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs. Our aftermarket revenue is a product of 3 drivers: installed base growth, the higher service intensity of new nodes, and our data-enabled service agreements. Our service agreements provide a higher return on investment for our customers and subscription-like recurring revenue for Applied. In Q1, AGS generated record revenue of nearly $1 billion. Our overall aftermarket business also set a new record in Q1 and has grown in every year since 2013. 
Against this backdrop, we're pleased to be making further progress towards the acquisition of Kokusai Electric, which has an outstanding equipment business, a very large installed base and a highly talented management team. During the quarter, we received regulatory approvals from Japan and Korea. And we grew our cash position by over $350 million as we prepare for the transaction. As a reminder, upon close, we plan to prioritize our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we're using to help finance the transaction. We expect to limit buybacks until we've repaid the loan. 
Next, I'll comment on the near-term environment and provide our Q2 guidance. Since the middle of January, our business continuity team has been working around the clock, assessing the needs and capabilities of our employees, customers and suppliers. I'm impressed by the decisive action and compassion being demonstrated by our people across the globe. Our Q2 guidance ranges are wider than usual, and our revenue forecast reflects all of the risk factors we can see today. 
In Q2, we expect our overall revenue to be $4.34 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which would be up by about 23% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be $1.04 per share, plus or minus $0.06. The midpoint would be up nearly 50% year-over-year. Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be around $3.05 billion, up by around 40% year-over-year. Our services revenue should be about $955 million. And display revenue should be around $310 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 45.4%, which would be up nearly 2 points year-over-year. And non-GAAP OpEx should be around $820 million. 
Finally, I will give you some additional color on how our risk-adjusted Q2 guidance compares to strong underlying demand for our products and services. Absent the near-term risks, our revenue guidance would have been about $300 million higher at the midpoint or up about 30% year-over-year and AGS revenue would have exceeded $1 billion. While the situation remains fluid, we believe we can address the vast majority of our unmet Q2 demand in Q3 and Q4 and deliver strong growth for the year. 
In summary, we are seeing very strong demand for our products, solutions and services. We have a broad, diverse and balanced portfolio that is delivering strong relative performance and stability in a variety of market conditions. As Gary outlined, the semiconductor industry is enjoying a new wave of growth, and the equipment industry is growing along with our customers. For Applied's part, we're investing in new products and solutions that will accelerate the new playbook and position Applied Materials to deliver superior performance, stable growth and shareholder returns.

I would love to hear your thoughts around that.",63
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676404.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,7,"Thanks, C.J. As we look at gross margins, and I think it's important to look at the evolution of the business over time. We're a different business today. We're driving a significant amount of growth in foundry/logic, but we're also a more diversified business than we've been in the past. If you were to go back a handful of years, you would have seen us spike highly in the foundry business from a share perspective. And the other 3 device types were mid-teens. And today, we're a very balanced portfolio. And I think that served us really well in 2019, both from a revenue volatility standpoint significantly less than the peers in the industry. But also from a gross margin standpoint, the company has performed pretty well in the most recent downturn. As we go forward, foundry/logic is going to continue to be a strong market for the industry. The trend line on foundry/logic is up and to the right. Every quarter won't be a record, but we will see an upward trending market, less volatility and higher highs and higher lows. 
Embedded within that strength in foundry/logic is growth in specialty nodes and technologies as edge devices proliferate. This is a great business for us, a strong driver of cash flow, strong driver of operating margins. You're also seeing us in the broad set of markets, drive businesses like etch over time. We are making significant share gains into the NAND market into -- followed by DRAM and then foundry/logic. And the company is performing really, really well, growing that market share. And we're going to continue to do that going forward. And so you see an evolution and profile change of the business. You also see our services business growing structurally larger. It's a great source of stable revenues, cash flows and operating margin for the business. And so we're a broader, bigger, more resilient business and it's going to change the profile of the business over time. 
As you look at gross margin for the rest of this year, our semi systems business on a half-over-half progression looks fairly linear. And then you see a growing services business into the back half of the year and a growing display business into the back half of the year. And all 3 of those business look to -- look positioned to grow well into 2021. And so where we're guiding Q2, we expect to be around those levels for the rest of 2020 against this mix profile as we see into the back half of the year. Are we ever satisfied with gross margins as they exist today? No. Are we looking to continually optimize the performance of this company and drive as much value for our shareholders? Absolutely. And we're going to continue to drive as hard as possible at delivering that value. But I think it gives you a good sense of where gross margin is going to go for the rest of this year and some of the drivers of our business that deliver that result.",510

I think the best way I describe the profile and shape of the business in 2020, we're going to continue to see strength in foundry/logic throughout the year. And we're seeing early signs of memory recovery today. I think ultimately what happens in 2020 is really going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. We posted a really strong fiscal Q1. Our guiding to fiscal Q2 we see as very strong. And we see that strength continuing into the back part of the year. Again, we're going to be relatively balanced half-over-half in our systems business. And the ultimate shape of that systems business and strength in the back part of the calendar year is going to be a function of what we've been saying for a couple of quarters now, which is it's going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. But right now, we feel really good given what we see, fairly balanced half-over-half from a semi systems standpoint. And I think there's an opportunity to do better in our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as the memory recovery begins to accelerate.",199

If you look at the growth that we've seen over the last few years, it's up significantly. I think we're around $0.5 billion. The business was up over $2 billion, down a little bit this year, but still a very, very attractive market. And certainly our near-term guidance is impacted also because of the coronavirus. Some of our customers are in areas that are impacted. And so that reduced our guidance in terms of Q2. But as Dan said, we see the second half of the year being very positive. And we also -- if you think about visual experiences and the way they differentiate different mobile devices or all of the trillion connected devices that will be happening -- will be growing over the next several years, we see that, that market is going to continue to grow. So 2021, we certainly see the business being up a fair amount over what we see in 2020. The capital intensity is rising as new technologies are adopted. So we see a good opportunity in our core business. And certainly just like we do in semi, we're very focused on enabling customer road maps and enabling new structures, new materials for our customers. So we have those investments that we're also making in terms of display. We're making good progress on those -- on the pipeline of those new opportunities. We're not going to announce anything here on the call today, but we're still very optimistic overall about the business and also those new opportunities.",268

You'll obviously see us continue to drive discipline into our spend. I think you've seen that over time. Over the last handful of years, operating leverage has delivered some pretty significant reductions of OpEx as a percent of sales. And right now, R&D as a percent of OpEx is at an all-time high for the company. So I think the company is being very disciplined from a discretionary spend standpoint and investing right amount of money to capture the significant opportunities we see in front of us.

I think we're not emotional over the investments we're making. We make investments where we think we can have -- drive shareholder value. So that's basically the way we look at this. We have -- we do have a point of view. I think as a leader, you need to have a point of view and courage in terms of how you drive your business. We believe that this business is going to be fundamentally bigger based on AI, big data, IoT, layering on top of mobile, social media and PCs. So we see that business is going to be larger. And the new playbook that I talked about in the prepared remarks for AI and big data is absolutely essential as Moore's Law -- the classic Moore's Law is slowing. So we see tremendous opportunities. Applied is in the best position if you look at the 5 aspects of that new playbook, and we're going to make those investments. And as I said earlier, 2021 shapes up really well for us. Many different aspects come together, and we definitely see great growth opportunities going forward.

Thanks, John. This is Dan. I'll jump in and take that. So let's break it up into pieces. Let's first talk about WFE in 2020 and the growth rate over '19 and then I'll come back and talk a little bit about China and what we see in that market embedded in that overall growth rate. 
So we think 2020 is going to be a really strong year for the industry. We feel good about that. The ultimate question around growth rate is a function of what you use as a starting reference point for 2019. So I'm going to break this up piece by piece. Hopefully, I can shed some light and be helpful to clear up, I think, some of the confusion that exists in the market. So what's important is, is we establish a reference point for 2019. And then we talk about growth off of that. 
So we know the number for 2019 WFE. It's not mid-40s. I think one advantage we have is we've got a very broad portfolio, and we've got insight into all the different device types. And that gives us some unique insights in terms of market sizing. So let me share with you what we're seeing, and hopefully we can help out. 
2018 was 56 billion. That's according to Gartner. It's a good number. It's validated by a third party. So 2018 was 56 billion. Off of that number, we see 2019 as down 10% to 12%, and that's the baseline we're using for 2020 growth. We see 2020 as a market up 10%, 15% based on everything we see and likely at the high end of that range, given the conversations we're having with customers. 
So while it's too early to know 2020 with precision, 2019 is very clear as a baseline. So hopefully now the baseline for 2019 is clear. Off of that baseline, we're likely up 15%. We expect to significantly outgrow the market with our semi systems business, and it's not one device type. 
Coming to China embedded in that outlook. As we think about 2019 and where that ended, we see that market as about $6.5 billion, and we see growth off of that market of about $2 billion to $3 billion. Embedded within that if you take a look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, I would say 1/3 of it is 200-millimeter trailing node foundry/logic, 2/3 of it is 300-millimeter business. Of the 2/3 of its 300-millimeter business, it's roughly evenly split between trailing node foundry/logic and memory. And there's balance within the memory profile. And so I think that gives you a sense of what we're thinking for the China market. 
And if I were to take a step back and distill down what we're seeing, we see consistent, steady ecosystem building, investments in technology road maps with modest capacity additions. And even if we look at the $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental spend that we're seeing in China and -- domestic China, and we take a look at what it costs to build a new memory factory, $7 billion to $8 billion, or a new foundry/logic factory of $15 billion to $18 billion, even embedded within that $2 billion to $3 billion of growth, it's modest capacity additions. And part of that spend is 200-millimeter. Part of it is 300-millimeter with diversification across device types. Hopefully, that helps shed some light on both the overall WFE market, John, as well as what we're seeing in China.",588

And then quickly as my follow-up, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I think you said in the prepared comments that for the full fiscal year '20, you expect flat panel to be roughly flattish year-over-year, which would kind of imply a second half run rate of close to $1 billion, if not slightly over. I'm just kind of curious why you're confident about that. Is it mainly because the 300 million cushion you have in the April guidance for the coronavirus is mostly coming out of flat panel? Or am I thinking about the math right on that?",106

You are thinking about the math correctly. We've had a point of view now for a couple of quarters that revenue in 2020 in the display business is going to be similar to what we saw in 2019. Everything we see in the market today increases the confidence we have in terms of that outlook, so no change to the full year guidance. 
As we look at the risks we've assessed as part of the coronavirus, we think we're taking a -- well, first of all, we think risk is temporary, and we think there is no change to our full year outlook, fiscal year outlook as a result of that. And so we think we're being prudent in derisking our guide by about 300 million, and we see recovery of those revenues in Q3, Q4 as we unpack the 300 million across our reporting segments. We talked about services would have been our first billion-dollar quarter, but we've derisked it based on the virus. In terms of rank order of the 300 million, first, most impacted is our semi systems business, followed by our display business, followed by our service business. 
So if you put the pieces together without being point specific on any one of those, I think you get a sense of how much we've derisked our services business. Display will be incrementally more than that. And semi systems will be incrementally more than that. The sum of those 3 will equal 300 million. Our thesis around display being -- or I'm sorry, TVs being a recovery -- going through a digestion period in the market. You'll see recovery of the handset market. That framing of the profile of spend in display still holds. We see both markets looking good into 2021, and we think we return to nice growth profile in the back part of the year and into 2021.",322

Two-part question, number one is based on your guidance of roughly 3 billion semis and around this range, maybe plus or minus 200 million for the rest of fiscal '20, it looks like when I look at your last cyclical peak in April 2018, you guys did about 3 billion, and then the sales trailed off. I understand that the SSG now with semi systems, there's probably some shift in numbers, but overall, it's like you're consistent this $3 billion sales number for the rest of the fiscal year. I'm kind of curious from your vantage point, how much of this growth versus the prior peak number was the capital intensity going up versus AMAT's specific share gains? 
And then the second quick housekeeping question, on your color on China if I remember right, I think you said 200-millimeter is going to be 1/3 of your number, which is about $3 billion for China WFE. I'm kind of surprised it's that high, given the fact that last year if I remember right, China 200-millimeter was only 0.5 billion. Why is it jumping up so much this year?",200

Thanks, Krish. So taking the second question first, we've been talking about specialty nodes. We've been talking about trailing node geometries. We've been talking about billions of edge devices and intelligence on the edge and sensor technologies that are supporting the build-out of the Internet of Things. And we see trailing node geometries as one place that China can, in the near term, play a strong role in helping to build out their ecosystem in a disciplined way. And so it fits in with the framing that we've been talking about technology development, ecosystem development and disciplined investments to support that ecosystem from a capacity standpoint. And so it's very consistent from a framing standpoint.",116

The -- if you look at this market, IoT, communication, auto, power devices, sensors, it has a very, very high growth rate. And innovation is driven by materials innovation. So 2018 was the first year machines generated more data than people. In the next 5 years, the forecast are the machines will generate 10x more data than people. And when you go to CES, you see everything getting smarter. So this market is a big market. 
I think specifically to your question in China, your numbers are roughly correct. Our numbers are a little bit different, but roughly correct that there's a lot of growth in China in these areas and they can build those types of devices. And so if you look at a trillion connected devices at the edge by 2030, the explosion of data and really the transformation of many industries, health care, education, you see retail, transportation, all of these areas growing very fast. And the companies that are growing quickly from a market cap standpoint are companies that are data-centric companies. 
So again, I think that's really what we're seeing is this explosion of data, and this market is a very big market. Applied has a very strong position. We put together in the last year a team of great leaders across the company for 300-millimeter and smaller wafer sizes. I personally am meeting many of the CEOs and R&D leaders in this ecosystem. And we have really, really strong momentum. One example is one particular large customer where we won 2/3 of the available opportunities in a market that is very, very sticky over a long period of time. So I think you're correct in that maybe it's surprising that the market is growing like that, but we think this is really the early innings of these particular markets, IoT, communication, auto, power and sensors from a growth perspective. And it's -- Applied has a really great position inside that market.",344
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676426.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,29,"And Krish, coming back to the first part of your question where you talked about growth and how much of it is share gain versus capital intensity, I think it's important to take a step back and set a context around how the company has evolved over time. If we were to go back a handful of years, we were strong in foundry, over 20%, and around mid-teens in all 3 other device types. Today, we're balanced across all of the device types. So the company has made steady progress on that front over the last handful of years since Gary has took over the company.
Your specific question referenced a time period in 2018. We were high teens, a little over 19% from an overall WFE share standpoint that year. Today, now we're -- I'm sorry, 2019, we were a little over -- probably a little over 20% in 2019. So we feel really good about the progress we've made in significantly outperforming the peers and the market in 2019. So you definitely see some share accretion playing out in the current environment. 
The second thing I would say, our thesis around increasing capital intensity, you see it in the foundry/logic. You see it in NAND, you see it in DRAM. That thesis of increasing capital intensity over time is firmly intact. We know our customers are investing a lot of money in WFE. And so their profitability, WFE as a percent of their profitability, has come down since 2012. WFE as a percent of EBITDA in memory and foundry/logic is down 25% over the last half a dozen years. And so they're spending a lot, but they're making a lot of money. And so the health of our customers is as good as it's ever been. 
And then from a capital intensity standpoint, what we see is WFE as a percent of overall semiconductor industry revenue bottomed around 2013 at 9%. Of course, we're taking the one data point around the '08, '09 downturn of 6% off the table. 2013, it was about 9%. And Gary referenced in his prepared comments, we've been in a tight band centered around 11.5% for the last 5 years. So it's a clear indication this industry is experiencing increased capital intensity. The macro demand drivers driving the overall semiconductor industry are firmly intact. Semiconductors are going to go structurally larger as the data economy kicks in. And by implication, our industry and Applied Materials are growing structurally larger. So we think the opportunities in front of us has never looked -- has never looked as good as they do today, and we're really excited about what we see.",446

One way to combat the slowing of traditional Moore's law on the manufacturing front but still drive Moore's law, like performance improvements at the chip level, is through the use of these advanced package whether that's chiplet strategy, multichip die stacking. You guys have a pretty strong position in these markets. How is this segment expected to do this year? And roughly how big is your advanced packaging segment relative to the size of your overall semi business?",84

Thanks for the question, Harlan. So in -- you're right. We talked about this new playbook going beyond the classic 2D shrinking and Moore's Law. And packaging is 1 of those 5 drivers for the new playbook, and it really, really, really is very important. The -- one example is if you take GPU in a new package, and this is a product that was released over the last couple of years, you'll get 50% lower power and 3x increase in speed, 3x increase in speed just from the package. So definitely really important as part of the new playbook. 
From an Applied perspective, we had record revenues in packaging in 2019, and we have really strong momentum into 2020. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support the packaging road maps for our customers and as you talked about, heterogeneous integration approaches. In 2019, we won over 50% of the applications we competed for. And our -- we have this broad portfolio with CVD, PVD, CMP, plating and etch where we have highly differentiated new products. 
We have very deep engagements with leading customers, and there's a lot of focus on innovating with new packaging architectures. Applied has very deep engagement with -- really across the whole ecosystem. That -- those engagements are really driven by 2 things. One, we have the broadest portfolio of current and new products that haven't been announced yet, that are enabling from a packaging perspective. We also have the most advanced packaging lab where we can run entire end-to-end process and codevelop new packaging technology with leading customers and partners. 
So again, overall, very strong momentum with record business in '19. And I think this area, it's -- we haven't quantified it in terms of a dollar amount, but it's sizable. And I would say relative to growth opportunities as one of the elements of the new playbook, it's underappreciated, and the opportunities are bigger than what people would think relative to our growth potential here.",336

So I was wondering how much total revenues come from like deep EUV nodes where capacity is being added at the moment 7-nanometer foundry and 5-nanometer and 10-nanometer IGM? And how much is coming from the new EUV nodes ramping today?",45
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676438.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,41,"Yes. So thanks, Pierre. Let me take a stab at that and then see if Gary wants to add anything. 
So what I would say is we won't share internal forecast of how foundry/logic breaks out across nodes, but I think -- let me provide some color and context around the $1.9 billion. I think we would say that we're seeing strong adoption at 7 nanometers as they build out the node, strong adoption node over node as 5 nanometers gets deployed from a capacity standpoint and the logic equivalents of that. And while we talk about a more balanced market in foundry/logic, I think what you would see in the near-term environment that it's going to be significantly more weighted in the near term to these leading-edge technologies. And so we really like the way the business is performing node over node. In fact, as we look out into 3 nanometers, we really like the position and we think we can significantly enhance our relative position node over node. So we really like the way the business has performed on the leading edge. And what you see in the near-term environment, given the strong ramp around 5 to 7 nanometers is less balance in the market in the near term. But the long-term trend of diversification within foundry/logic is still intact.",222
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676439.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,42,"Yes, Pierre, the other thing I would add relative to the leading foundry/logic is that all of these customers are driving performance: power, area costs, PPAC improvements. And that's really all about new materials, new structures to drive power and performance. And so for Applied, as Dan said, really from a leading perspective, leading node perspective, it's really -- it is those EUV nodes like 5-nanometer where you see that adoption. But still, we're achieving record revenue. We have so many opportunities when we're driving these new structures, new materials, new architectures, all of those different areas. So we see record revenue there. 
We're also seeing growth not only in transistor, interconnect and patterning with some of our leading products, but we also have growth in areas where we have had lower share. In etch, we have many new critical etch steps that we've won, new soft line multipatterning wins and EUV patterning steps where we really didn't participate in the past. So we look at our etch business in foundry and logic, we are extremely optimistic about the growth that we're seeing as new nodes are adopted, even as EUV is also being adopted as one of the 5 drivers of power, performance, area and cost. 
The other thing I talked about is in process control, we have continued strength in e-beam. We also have strong adoption of a new inspection tool. And we had record revenues in that market this last quarter. 
So again, it's really about driving that new playbook along those 5 vectors, power and performance. Our leading products, we're seeing new steps being adopted. And in some areas, we have room to grow. The opportunities for us have never been better, and our position has never been better than today.",295

Thanks, Joe. I think the best way to describe it is the actions China is taking to contain the spread of the virus has led to travel restrictions and logistics of moving things around the country. We see those impacts as being temporary and it reprofiles revenue from Q2 to the back part of our fiscal year. And so in the early stages of the China workforce coming back after the Lunar New Year and after the imposed restrictions by the government, we're seeing some early signs that are encouraging of some return to normalcy. It's a fluid environment. It's too early to draw a conclusion from it. But we like some of the early indications that we see. We're going to continue to monitor the situation closely and update as necessary. 
Again, as we break out that $300 million, you rank order it: semi systems, display, services. It's about getting our people into the factories and being able to service the equipment. That certainly puts some restrictions on it. We know Wuhan is an important geography in our display business. Getting our systems into the factories in that region are impacted in the near term. And then semi systems, it's more of the same. And so we think that given everything we know, it's a prudent approach to the environment we see. We're going to continue to monitor it. There's an opportunity to do better in Q2. We think the customer demand is there. And we do think that we recover in Q3, Q4 and our full year fiscal year outlook remains intact.",265

Thanks, Vivek. So as we look at services, we talked about the framework of growth in that business in the prepared comments. It's size of the installed base. It's complexity of the leading node technologies. And it's the execution against the long-term service agreement opportunity we have. Those underlying growth drivers are absolutely intact. This is a business that's grown strong double digits over the last handful of years. 
Q1 was a record quarter for us and significantly above seasonal. Q2 would have been our first billion-dollar quarter. And so the team is doing a great job executing. 
We also know the slowdown in the near term is a function of the memory correction that we're seeing profiled throughout 2019. As industry utilizations come down, our transactional component of the business has reflected what's happening to industry-wide utilizations. The theme is still executing against the long-term service agreement opportunity and grew that business nicely in the mid-teens in 2019. 
What we like about the setup through the back half of the year and as we look into 2021, with the services business in particular, as the memory recovery begins to take hold and as we look at that building momentum throughout 2021, foundry/logic demand continues to be strong. Those are going to provide a nice tailwind for that business to grow into the back half of the year and into 2021. So underlying demand drivers intact, team is executing well, and we like the profile going forward.",248

We added 15% increase in the tools under service agreements. And those -- that subscription-type revenue is very sticky and also gives us a higher entitlement per tool. So that's been a big focus. It's been a tremendous change in the last few years, this significant growth. And it's really based on the value that we're providing our customers.",72

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4005.0,2010729.0,78676449.0,Question,Timothy Arcuri,,Analysts,52,"I guess I wanted to go through some numbers with you guys. So you're -- I think you said, Dan, 19.2% of WFE last year. So if I assume that the second half is flat versus the first half, that would put SSG sort of in the $11.5 million to like $12 billion range. So I don't think you would argue with either of those numbers since that's what you've guided. So if I use that, and then I assume that you don't gain or lose any share this year, that would imply like a $61 billion WFE number. You're sort of saying, well, it's probably going to be more like $57 million. So if I just average those 2 and take $59 million, and if I try to figure out how much revenue is required to support that much WFE, and I listen to what Gary said, which I totally agree with about WFE intensity that it usually peaks out at about 12%. So if you take 12%, that would imply that you need over $500 million worth of semiconductor revenue this year, which would be up like 25% year-over-year. So I definitely get that YMTC is some of the incremental WFE, and they don't have much revenue. But how can you build a path to have enough revenue to support this? I guess that's the question. It's just hard to see WFE growing off of this. It would -- like it's going to take a long time for revenue to kind of grow into these WFE levels.",259

Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the question. So a couple of things. We have in sight and what we think our semi systems business can do against the backdrop of the environment we see. And we're very confident in our ability to significantly outgrow the market. And then from a modeling standpoint, here's, I guess, how I would get at some of the assumptions. We think 2020 is going to be a really good year. We expect to outperform the market. 
One of the key variables in the model that you're putting together is what you assume for market share. And small changes in market share can make big differences in the model. So we see continued strength from foundry and logic in our business throughout the year. We've got signs of memory recovery. And as we've been saying for a couple of quarters, ultimately it depends on the magnitude and shape of the memory recovery later in the year. And if we see more momentum in that than we're currently planning for, then I do think that we have an opportunity to outperform in Q4 and into our fiscal Q1. 
And so net-net, we don't see this being an isolated pocket of performance. We're relatively balanced half over half, and we feel really good about how we're positioned and how we're performing this year.",224

So I would say I've never been more optimistic relative to the market. Again, you have new demand drivers that are layered on top of mobile, social media and PC. So the market is going to be bigger than we've seen in the past. And you can also see indications over the last few years, the market is structurally larger and less volatile. We have very good share spread across all of the different segments, the leading foundry/logic. We have momentum as customers are driving improvements in power, performance, area and cost. In the specialty nodes, we have very, very strong positions, whether it's in image sensors or any of the other markets like IoT, communication, auto and power devices. So we have strength there. We've grown a significant amount in DRAM and in NAND relative to market share. Dan talked about this earlier. We've grown several points over the last few years. So we have very strong balance. 
And what I would say is again, the path forward for the industry is really this new playbook around new architectures, new structures, new materials. New packet is also where we had record last year, and we have strength and new ways to strength. So we have the product pipeline. And then we have some very significant products in the pipeline that are targeted at multibillion-dollar types of opportunities. 
But the other thing I would say that's really important is the combinations of these different technologies with integrated material solutions, driving significant improvements in throughput, in drive current or power, the things really that are crucial for the edge and the cloud. We have unique capabilities to combine these technologies, some of them under vacuum so you're not damaging interfaces electrically. So that's another area. We have engagements across every single customer with integrated material solutions. We have very good momentum there besides the current products and we have -- and the products that we have in the pipeline. So again, from my perspective, I've never been more optimistic. I spend a huge amount of my personal time with the R&D leaders for the customers through this entire ecosystem. They're struggling to drive the performance, power improvements that are needed. And I think Applied is in the best position that we've ever been relative to our ability to drive our opportunities and growth going forward.",397

Looking out into the future, I really like the setup. I really like what I see: continued strong pull foundry/logic, improvement in memory. Both of those elements are going to drive and fuel growth in our services business over time. I like what I see in display increasing into the second half of 2020 and into 2021.

I'd like to start today's call by addressing the topic at the forefront of everyone's mind, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created unprecedented challenges around the world. My thoughts and best wishes go out to all of you and especially those whose families have been directly affected by the illness.
As the situation has evolved over the past several months, our actions at Applied Materials have been guided by 2 key principles: first, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers and partners; and second, focusing on driving initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term.  As always, our #1 priority is the health and well-being of our employees and their families. Our workforce remains highly productive. Many are working effectively from home and for those working on site, we've implemented strict safety protocols in close collaboration with our medical advisers, customers and suppliers.
In our factories, labs and logistics centers, we've changed physical layouts to allow for social distancing, introduced enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, implemented health screenings and mandated the use of personal protective equipment. All our employees and contingent workers have continued to receive full pay, and we've introduced additional incentives and benefits for employees supporting our critical operations.
While we've been working through certain supply chain constraints, we have remained laser-focused on the needs of our customers and doing what it takes to keep their factories running smoothly and their R&D programs on track.
Across the company, I see amazing examples of our manufacturing, logistics and field operations teams going above and beyond to keep our customers and the industry moving forward in a difficult set of circumstances. We're also defining new ways of working with customers that not only provide solutions today but will also create significant benefits over the long term.
Finally, in line with Applied's long-held values to make a positive contribution to the communities where we live and work, we've created a global charitable COVID fund. The purpose of this fund is to address immediate humanitarian needs and combat long-term effects on local communities and the nonprofit sector. We've also donated masks and equipment to medical facilities. And in addition, there have been numerous employee-driven initiatives across the company. It's inspiring to see these employees stepping forward to help, volunteering their time, skills and resources to demonstrate our shared passion to make a difference.
Now let me turn to the agenda for today's call. I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter performance and near-term outlook. Then I'll provide a longer-term perspective on our markets, and I'll finish with a summary of our strategy, highlighting some of our recent accomplishments. Later, Dan will give more color on our financial results, operational performance and business environment.
Starting with our near-term business outlook, demand from our semiconductor customers remain strong. In fiscal Q2, our financial performance was negatively affected by our ability to ship systems to customers as shelter-in-place and lockdown orders impacted some of our suppliers' operations, particularly in the Bay Area and Malaysia.  However, we're in a much better position today. Thanks to the flexibility in our global operations footprint, we've been able to make adjustments. And we continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they can meet our needs.
Our supply chain remains a critical area of focus as we enter our third quarter with record orders and a record backlog for our semiconductor and service businesses combined. In terms of the semiconductor industry environment, I will focus my comments on what we currently see in the market and what we're hearing from customers.
In foundry/logic, demand at the leading edge remains very healthy, with a strong commitment from these customers to build out their factories and push forward with their development road maps. However, we're seeing some pockets of weakness in specialty markets, mainly as a result of a pullback in the automotive and industrial sectors.
In memory, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to see a positive progression in the market with inventory levels approaching normal and improvements in pricing trends. As a result, we're seeing incremental strength in investment by memory customers as we move through the year.
Based on the visibility that we have today, underlying demand for semiconductor equipment is robust. And even when COVID-related effects are taken into account, we still believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double-digit growth for our fiscal year.
In display, we expect our FY '20 revenues to be close to FY '19 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle. Our display business remains solidly profitable even as we invest in next-generation products, ready for when the market picks up.
Looking further out, we're well aware of global economic concerns. While I'm not going to speculate on possible macro scenarios, I will share some of the key assumptions that we're using to guide our strategy, which are based on carefully monitoring market indicators and staying very close to our customers.  Clearly, consumer spending is a potential headwind for many sectors, including the electronics industry. At the same time, the global pandemic is acting as an accelerator for key technology inflections that were already underway.  
Working from home, learning from home and e-commerce are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. We expect companies to build stronger business continuity plans, which will include geographic redundancy and increased use of automation and IoT technologies. And the adoption of AI and big data remains nondiscretionary for many 
companies. As I've said before, these game-changing technologies will transform entire industries, and there will be big winners and losers through the transition.  My personal view is that we will see significant and permanent changes in the way companies operate and prioritize their investments. In fact, this is already happening in our business and the ways we are working with customers.
Over the past several years, we made significant investments in state-of-the-art digital infrastructure sensors in metrology, data science, machine learning and simulation. The combination of these technologies enables us to reduce product development cycles, speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab and optimize cost, output and yield for our customers in volume production.  
In the past few months, our field and R&D teams have been working with customers to further expand secure data sharing, to enhance remote support and accelerate the deployment of these powerful new tools. In our own labs, we also have many examples of R&D teams increasing utilization and productivity of lab assets by applying creative new strategies for remote operations. 
While near-term actions are being driven by necessity, the long-term benefits of working this way are compelling as they provide significant time to market and cost advantages for Applied and our customers. Our long-term perspective about AI and big data shaping the next decade is unchanged, and we see strong potential for certain elements of these inflections to scale faster than previously expected.
As I've said before, to enable these new computing systems and unlock the potential of AI technologies, major advances in the power, performance and area cost, or PPAC, of semiconductor devices are needed. Based on recent input from customers, we've updated our PPAC framework to PPACt, where T stands for time to market, acknowledging the enormous value of speed.  
Applied has by far the largest, broadest portfolio of technologies and products to accelerate the PPACt playbook, which spans creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing and connecting structures and devices. We're the only company with process and metrology under one roof, and we have highly differentiated silicon and packaging lab capabilities.  As a result, we have significant advantage in our ability to accelerate new PPACt innovations for the semiconductor ecosystem. The capabilities we have built and the multiyear investments we have made are yielding results. According to VLSI Research's recently published report, we outperformed the market in both semiconductor equipment and services last year.  Our performance in deposition technology was especially strong, with our PVD business gaining 7 points of share. We also have great momentum in metrology and inspection. Our process, diagnostics and control group delivered record revenue in the first half of the year. One of the key contributors to this record performance is our new optical inspection system that we will be officially launching later this year.;
Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. First, as we navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, we've rallied the company around 2 guiding principles: maintain the trust of employees, customers, suppliers and partners; and focus on driving actions that ensure Applied Materials emerges stronger over the long term.  Second, while we're mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, based on what we see and hear today, semiconductor equipment demand remains robust, and our supply chain is getting healthier.  Third, we remain fully committed to our strategy to accelerate the PPACt playbook and our pipeline of new innovative products and integrated processes has never been better.  
Now I will turn the call over to Dan.",1512
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78986982.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll summarize our second quarter results and activities, give you an update on the environment and share our current expectations for the second half of our fiscal year.
As a reminder, on March 23, we suspended our Q2 guidance because the global response to COVID-19 was creating significant challenges across our supply chain, manufacturing operations and logistics. Due to the extreme uncertainty, we also decided to borrow against our revolving credit facility. We promised to provide our investors with an update on this earnings webcast, and I'll do that in a moment.
This afternoon, we announced our Q2 results, which were below our original guidance, but solid, considering the extreme challenges our teams faced due to COVID. I'm proud of our employees for putting health and safety first and still doing everything possible to support our customers, both in keeping our factories running and by keeping our R&D programs moving.
Despite the incremental challenges we experienced in the last 6 weeks of our quarter, we delivered AGS and display revenue that was higher than our original expectations in February. Our semi systems revenue was below our original outlook, and that was entirely due to COVID-related supply constraints. And demand remains strong. And while the environment remains fluid, we exited the quarter with the second-highest company backlog in our history and record backlog for semi systems plus AGS combined.  
For the company as a whole, in Q2, on a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by 12%, increased non-GAAP operating profit by 23% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 27% to $0.89. During the quarter, we returned $392 million to shareholders in buybacks and dividends and announced a dividend increase of nearly 5%. We ended Q2 with nearly $7.4 billion on the balance sheet, including $1.5 billion in credit facility proceeds.
Now I'll share my assessment of the COVID environment, which includes several encouraging developments. Our industry has been designated critical infrastructure in many parts of the world. All of our suppliers have now been able to resume operations, and they are recovering to normal output.  We've been in very close communications with our customers, and their demand indications remain strong. We're mindful of the macroeconomic impacts of COVID, including job losses in the consumer and industrial sectors of the global economy. But governments have provided strong financial support to workers, businesses and the banking system.
As a result of our assessment of the environment, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility borrowings subsequent to the end of the quarter. We currently have approximately $5.9 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is an increase of about $200 million compared to our Q1 balance.  
We are continuing to prepare for the planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. During Q2, we received Taiwan's clearance for the transaction, and we have one final approval pending from China.  
Turning to the business outlook. While I see positive signs, there is still potential for COVID-related disruptions around the world. And we're not providing revenue and earnings guidance for Q3. I know there is concern about the risk of further economic impacts and changes in customer investment patterns but rather than speculate, I'll attempt to help our investors by providing visibility into what we are seeing across our operating segments.
In semiconductor systems, our Q2 revenue would have been nearly $650 million higher absent COVID-related constraints. We hope to recover this revenue in Q3 and Q4 as the supply chain improves.  In the second quarter, our semi systems orders were up significantly, and demand is broadening to more customers. Based on what we're hearing from our customers, we believe Q3 semi revenue could be up in the high single digits sequentially and higher again in Q4, resulting in strong double-digit growth for the fiscal year.
Our services business has proven highly resilient during the crisis, and we continue to generate a growing proportion of revenue from subscription-like long-term service agreements. 
AGS posted its first $1 billion quarter ever in Q2, with nearly 60% of revenue coming from service agreements. In Q3, we believe AGS revenue could be flat to slightly higher sequentially and higher again in Q4.  Within AGS, our semi parts and services business has grown to $3.2 billion or 24% of our company's semi-related revenue. VLSI Research has begun to size and compare the parts and service revenue of companies in the industry. Ours is the strongest among our peers, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our semi-related revenue.  
Our total semiconductor installed base business, which includes parts, services, 200-millimeter systems and 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs, has grown to become 38% of our semi-related revenue. This ratio is about 5 points higher than our peers.
As Gary indicated, we still expect our display revenue to be nearly the same this year as last. We believe revenue is likely to be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q3 and higher again in Q4.  
In short, if the demand indications from our customers hold and our supply chains continue to improve, then we should have second half-weighted revenue in each segment. Based on everything we see today, this would translate into sequential revenue growth and earnings growth in Q3 and then again in Q4.  
So in summary, while the situation remains fluid and macroeconomic impacts are still unknown, our customers remain committed to their technology road maps and are signaling growth for Applied. We will remain vigilant, stay close to our customers and be ready to respond quickly if the environment changes.  
Once again, I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their strong commitment to health and safety and their strong support of our customers, both in meeting today's demand at our factories and theirs and innovating in our R&D labs to enable the technology of the future.

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78986986.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,7,"Thanks, C.J. As we look into the year, we see the year profiling pretty similar from a proportion of spend standpoint that we talked about a quarter ago. We see strength in foundry/logic continuing throughout the year as our order book and customer base broadens, and we feel good about that.
As we profile to memory, we talked about seeing some incremental strength this year, both on DRAM and NAND. I think it's too early to call the magnitude of that, but we do see balance across the device types from a spend standpoint.  And I do think there is going to be similarities in terms of 2019 being an investment year, primarily focused on technology road maps. And we actually saw wafer starts per month last year, 2019, actually go down year-over-year in both DRAM and NAND.  
And as we look into this year, we don't really see strong capacity adds. We continue to see our customers driving their technology road maps. Because that is, in effect, their cost structure. It allows them to drive margins and cash flow when industries recover. So we see continued investments from a technology road map standpoint, but we see probably less wafer starts per month coming out of the system than we did the year before.  So it's sort of on the margin. We continue to stay close. We will watch it. And we'll continue to be open and transparent. In an environment that's defined by uncertainty, what we want to try to do is be as helpful as possible, share with investors the things we're seeing and hearing from our customers, and we'll let you know what we see each quarter as the situation evolves.",284

If I could sneak in a quick follow-up, Mike. On gross margins, can you speak to how you see the trajectory into the second half, considering what looks to be a positive mix from both silicon and AGS? And also, as it relates to supply chain because I think you took out $8 million of COVID-related expenses. Is that something that should sustain into the back half? How should we be thinking about that?",77

I'll take both. As we think about the actions the company took in the current environment, we made conscious decisions about how we were going to position ourselves from an operating and manufacturing standpoint, and decisions were made very early in the process. We implemented our business continuity team in the middle of January. And as part of contingency planning and mapping out potential points of risk, we made decisions to put in place surge capacity from a personnel standpoint, and that decision was made probably the first week of February.
So clearly, there's an impact to maintain cycle times and throughputs that are on par with where we were before COVID. That's a result of really strong teamwork and execution and planning, but it certainly has a headwind from a margin standpoint. And we're optimizing around serving our customers and taking care of the things that we can take care of so we can better withstand the things we can't control, which is what we saw from a supply chain disruption standpoint and the rate and pace of that recovery. So we feel good about that.  But certainly, it does create a headwind. And you see that profiling through some of the segments. And I'm happy to share more of that thinking, but it's definitely there.
From a gross margin standpoint, as we look into next quarter, what we signaled was a favorable segment mix. And in a normal environment, that would create improvement from a gross margin standpoint.  What I'd also say is what we experienced in our most recent quarter was 6 weeks of impact of a material supply chain disruption driven by a concurrent shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area and Malaysia. It affected a material part of our supply chain, but it was a 6-week impact.
Going into Q3, we've got a full 13-week impact as the supply chain becomes healthier, and that will sort of offset a bit of the favorable segment mix. So I think the best way to think about our gross margin as we look into Q3 from a planning assumption standpoint is to think about it flat. If we can do better, we certainly will. But we'll take it 1 quarter at a time and give investors our best view of what we see and the pluses and minuses as we manage the business to the best of our ability in this environment.",405

And as a follow-up, Dan, I'm curious what your take is on recent Department of Commerce's China equipment licensees for the future shipments?",64

I think I'll take both of those. So let me start with market share. And starting from an overall company perspective, one of the things that we've discussed before is that we have very good balance across all device segments, including leading and trailing logic, DRAM and NAND. This enables us to perform well really regardless of the device mix. It gives us ability to perform well in pretty much any environment. So if we look at overall, 2019 was a good year for us.
Your question, I think, is related to 2020. We look at 2020 as also a very good setup for us. As I said in the prepared remarks, we anticipate strong double-digit growth for Applied in 2020.  And what I would say is that in this new environment, I used to travel a significant amount. And I'm still on the phone very frequently with CEOs, R&D leaders, in fact, I had a call with one of the CEOs this morning. And one of the things that's a real advantage for Applied is the traction we have with customers to accelerate their PPACt road maps. And that really is both for memory and also for foundry and logic.
So performance in 2019, we gained about 2 points in the markets that we serve and 0.5 point overall WFE share. So if we look at the setup for 2020, we continue to see strong foundry/logic investments where we have leadership products, PVD, epi, strong traction in new etch applications. We see currently double-digit growth in our memory business, strong double-digit growth in memory, gaining traction with new capabilities that are key for scaling and strong growth in memory patterning applications.
So overall, again, we have balance across all of these different segments. I would say that our pipeline of our new products and our integrated material solutions has never been better relative to accelerating PPACt road maps for customers.  
Then the second question is around, I think, the export controls. So let me start with perspective of the overall geopolitical situation. And I've said before on this one, Applied believes in fair trade and intellectual property protection. The semi ecosystem and innovation road map rely on these principles.  So regarding the new regulations that were recently announced by the Department of Commerce, we're working very closely with the U.S. government, trade associations and our advisers to better define the requirements for the industry and to be able to comply with the new regulations. We have some very good people working on this. And based on our work to date, our current expectation is Applied is going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules come into effect at the end of June without significant disruptions to our business. If needed, we have significant flexibility in our global operations' footprint, and we're developing contingency plans that we could implement. But again, overall, we believe we're going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules become effective.",509

So as we think about China, let's talk about where we ended 2019 and use that as a jumping-off point to talk about what we see incrementally into 2020 as it relates to domestic China spend.
So if we look back into 2019, the market sizing was about $6.5 billion. And a quarter ago, we said our expectation for 2020 was an incremental 200 to 300 -- I'm sorry, $2 billion to $3 billion of domestic China spend. Our expectation in 2020 is still $2 billion to $3 billion but now given the customer news overnight, we're probably at the high end of that range.
And so a quarter ago, as we think about the decomposition of that incremental spend, we said about 1/3 200-millimeter trailing node foundry specialty logic spend, 2/3 of it was 300-millimeter. And as you decompose the 300-millimeter spend, it was roughly split 50-50 between foundry/logic and memory, with balance among device types in memory. And as you think about us at the higher end of the range now, think about incrementally more spend in 300-millimeter trailing node foundry/logic, and I think that gives you an evolution of that spend profile of how the now $2.5 billion to $3 billion is spent towards the high end of that incremental range. That's the best insight we have at this point based on everything we see in the market and what we're talking with our customers about.",246

Sure. Let me start with the PDC business overall, and then I'll answer the etch question. So our inspection measurement business is one of the segments where we have strongest momentum. We talked about the record last quarter we had and the first half of FY 2020, and this is far above our previous best half year for the business. We've got strong -- we will achieve strong double-digit growth overall in 2020 in semi, and this segment will be one of the highest growth businesses for us this year, the inspection and measurement business.
Relative to the new optical inspection system, we have tremendous momentum with that system. We'll launch it later this year. Very, very strong adoption in foundry and logic. I'd tell you the other thing that is positive relative to our PDC business is in e-beam. We have a strong leadership position. We have also some new capabilities there, the highest resolution imaging technology in the industry and very strong initial adoption with new capability there with leading customers. So again, we're off to a great start in 2020 in PDC. And I would say the best position that we've ever had relative to that business. 
Etch also, I think as you know, we've had tremendous growth in the conductor etch business, about 5x in terms of revenue growth between 2020 and 2018. And this is also where we have the -- probably the best product, most successful product ever in the history of Applied Materials, the Sym3. Relative to 2019, we gained about 0.5 point of overall etch share. And in 2020, we also anticipate strong double-digit growth in etch.
We have good momentum in memory, significant traction with all leading customers in foundry/logic, where we haven't had very high share, it's been very low in the past. We have really significant traction there. And in new product and packaging, that also has strong momentum. So overall, we anticipate strong growth in 2020, and we have good momentum with new capabilities and confidence that we're going to continue to grow etch share going forward.",350

You talked about it impacting the April quarter by like $650 million, and you said you'd be able to make that up in both the fiscal third and fourth quarter. But then you also said in an answer to a question that you'd have some gross margin headwinds in the fiscal third quarter because you'd have 13 weeks of sort of these supply issues. 
And so I guess my question is, is supply also impacting what you can ship in the fiscal third quarter? If so, by how much? And when do you think we get to a situation where you guys can actually meet the demand that's on your books?",132
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78986999.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,20,"Yes. Thanks, John. Let me try to unpack it a little bit for you and give you a sense of how we think about it. Hopefully, that gives you insight that addresses the question. And if I miss something, please let me know, and I'll definitely follow-up. 
So as we think about where the supply chain is and how the supply chain gets healthier over time, I think it's important to break it up into 3 components, and we'll deal with each of these 3 buckets in sequence. The first, our suppliers are back in business, raising their staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output. That's sort of a set of issues, bucket one. Bucket two, how quickly can they make up for lost volumes? And then the third bucket is the logistics channels and how they get healthier over time.
And so as we think about the time sequence and overlay of each of those 3 vectors, all of our suppliers are back in the game. They're working back to 100% staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output.  I think exiting our fiscal Q3, I think, a good portion, a disproportionate share of that will be behind us. That leaves then the second bucket, which is how quickly can you make up for lost volumes? I think that happens, given the robust environment we see, I think that happens over our fiscal Q4 and in our fiscal Q1. So exiting the calendar year, it should be a direct read-through on true end-market demand in terms of our business activity. Based on what we can see today, that looks like the trajectory.
The third bucket, the logistics, this is something that's going to be a longer-term issue to get back to normal. And the reason I say that is there's a correlation between the commercial airline industry and the logistics channels. What I mean is, if we're not shipping a full system, full systems, they'll go on special freighter aircraft. A lot of what we do short of a full system will ride in the belly of a commercial aircraft. We've had to pivot that to alternative freight and logistics channels. And the costs associated with that have risen and create a margin headwind. Given the correlation to the health of the commercial industry, I think this one is with us for the foreseeable future. And we're likely to have those increased freight and logistics costs stick with us until we can see the degrees of freedom in commercial aviation begin to get much healthier and more active versus the levels today. 
So if you hear my comments about that margin headwind being around for a while, I sort of disconnect that from the fundamental health of the supply chain. I think we're back -- our suppliers are back to pre-COVID levels of output exiting the current fiscal quarter. I think the balance of the calendar year, we make up for lost volumes. Hard to predict at this point when the commercial aviation channels begin to free up to something similar to what we saw pre-COVID. Hopefully, that sheds some light on how we're seeing things, John, and answers your question.",537

And then as my follow-up, Gary, there's been a lot of investor focus on the opportunities you might have in China and maybe some of the risks associated with that from just a geopolitical perspective. Over the weekend, we kind of got a different flavor of that with some arguments about perhaps more domestic manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors, not only here in the U.S., but there were some articles out of Japan. I guess I'd be curious, I know it's early. I'd love to get your thoughts on this potential drive for more sovereign manufacturing of leading-edge chips. And as you think about that opportunity, would this be sort of redundant capacity in your estimation? Or would it be growth capacity? Or how do you think that plays out over the coming years?",137

Thanks for the question, John. So this has been discussed for a while, but the focus certainly has been increasing with the current geopolitical situation. I can't, of course, share any details of any discussions I've had with anyone on the topic. But for sure, this is a good opportunity for the United States and also for Applied. And we'd be very supporting -- supportive of making the concept a success. 
If we look at when our customers go into different geographic regions, it does create a good opportunity for us. If we look at some of our major customers, I'm not going to talk about anyone in specific, but it creates a really great service opportunity for us as they move into a different geographic location where they don't have the same nucleus or critical mass of technical horsepower. So as we've had discussions with some of the customers that are thinking about moving into different geographic locations, support, of course, is one of the key aspects of their decision-making. And so again, I think it could be a really good opportunity for Applied Materials. And certainly, from a geopolitical standpoint, a good thing for the United States for this opportunity.",203

Just give me a second to pull up the model. Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say that's true. And here's why I go there. 
First, we talked about supply chain getting back to pre-COVID levels of output throughout our fiscal Q3. So that's an exit rate comment. And implicit in that exit rate comment is the fact that they're not able to supply true end-market demand throughout Q3. And we exit Q3, as Gary talked about in his prepared comments, with record backlog in our semi-related business, SSG plus AGS and actually record orders in Q2 as well. So demand continues to be strong. And the supply chain will get healthier exiting Q3 and then make up volumes from unmet demand to date through Q3 -- or I'm sorry, fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1.
So we think we exit the calendar year shipping to true end-market demand. So there's a bit of a bleed-over of this dynamic into the next fiscal year. And so I think given what we've seen from an order standpoint and what we're entering Q3 with from a backlog perspective, I still think we see strength in the back half of our year.
If we break that down by device type, what do we see? We see continued strength throughout the year in foundry/logic. We talked about a broadening of our order book in foundry/logic. We talked about multiple customers, multiple nodes. We talked about some softness as it relates to things like auto and industrial and consumer end markets, and that's more trailing node geometries. What we're seeing on the leading edge continues to be strong. 
As we think about memory, a quarter ago, we talked about the second half of the year being the swing factor, and that construct still holds. From a memory standpoint, calendar year Q4 is still beyond the horizon of visibility. And so we do think we're in a strong environment, and we think the company performed pretty well in the back half of the year even without the $650 million that the -- we were unable to meet in the most recent fiscal quarter.",356

That's really helpful, Dan. And then just as a follow-up, thanks for the color on your view on the commerce department ruling. I'm curious on the services side, how much of your revenue comes from China? And if you assume things go negative with the commerce department ruling for you or for the U.S. semi cap companies, what happens to the service revenue associated, especially on the foundry side, when you have existing tools out there?",78
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78987006.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,27,"Yes. So thanks, Krish. Let me just try to walk through a little bit of the construct. As we think about the business we do in China today, there, we do both semiconductor business and display business. So I'm going to walk you through a bit of a framework of how to think about it to get a sense of how much service business is done in China. So just bear with me as I walk you through this framework.
So we do both display and semiconductor business, as you know, in China. So if we take 2019, you had about 29% of our overall company revenue done in China. We've got a large display business, $1.6 billion, almost $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2019. The vast, vast majority of that business goes into China. So if you extract that from the overall China business, that gives you a pretty good look at the size of the semi systems and service business that's done in China.
If I then disaggregate it and take the service segment out of that revenue pool, and you think about kind of the corporate average service to semi systems, it's kind of a 70-30 split, give or take. And so I think that gives you a sense. When you extract the display revenues, you get a clean look through on the semi-related business in China. And then you think about it as a 70-30 split. Gives you a sense. But you also have to keep in mind that, that service business and systems business service both multinationals and the domestic industry.  And the rough order of magnitude of how the systems business splits up across those 2 dimensions, think of it maybe 65% domestic, 35% multinational. That gives you a rough framework of how to think about the decomposition of the China business. And hopefully, that helps give you a little insight into how to think about that business without being point specific because we don't disclose that level of detail.",336

Now it looks like that your large logic customer is also getting back on track to executing to a 2-, 2.5-year cadence on node migration after about a 3- or 4-year pause and probably a lot of views. So sounds like you have multiple large customers in foundry and logic moving at an aggressive cadence over the next few years. How are you guys thinking about the mix of WFE spend foundry/logic versus memory over the next few years?",110
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78987009.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,30,"Yes. Thanks, Harlan. So as we take a look at what happened in 2019 and then talk about what we see in 2020 -- but then I also want to project forward. So just kind of breaking it down a little bit. 
We talked about a quarter ago WFE being about $51 billion, $52 billion in 2019. We think we see the market pretty well. Subsequent to our earnings call a quarter ago, VLSI came out and sized 2019 at $51.5 billion. So right in the middle of how we were thinking about it. So we feel good about that view, and it's a good number around 2019.
We think about how you decompose that WFE number in 2019 by device type. And it's roughly 60% foundry, 40% memory, balanced across the 2 device types in memory. That gives you a rough order of the structure of the market in 2019.  And while I think it's premature today to size the market for a variety of reasons that we can go into, premature to size the market in 2020, we think the rough order of split by device type looks and feels similar to what we saw in 2019. So again, another year of 60% foundry/logic, 40% memory with balance between device types.
As we look forward, we talk about the new playbook. We talk about suite of innovation that this company is bringing to market, the ability to integrate those technologies, the ability to drive onboard sensors and metrologies to dial in process recipes faster. There's a clear enablement strategy by this company to drive our customers' power performance area, cost and time road maps. We think we're incredibly well positioned to do that against the backdrop of rising capital intensity over time. With time being a really important element of this, we play -- we have the opportunity to play a really valuable role with our customers and driving that time to market dimension across that new playbook. 
And that puts us in a really strong position competitively. And we think the dynamic of the position, the innovation, where the market's going in terms of time to market as well as rising capital intensity, we feel good about where the spend profile in foundry/logic is going over time. So while I can't be point specific going forward, I think I gave you some insight in terms of how we, as a company, are thinking about this trend off of where we sit today.",415

Extremely helpful. And then within your framework for the fiscal second half of the year from a revenue perspective, how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx for the remainder of the fiscal year from the Q2 levels?",40
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78987011.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,32,"So if we go back a quarter, we said for the last 3 quarters of our fiscal year, we would from a planning assumption standpoint, think about $820 million of OpEx per quarter. As you can see in the current environment, clearly, there're savings from a travel standpoint, but the company also did a good job from a discretionary spend perspective. And R&D as a percent of OpEx in the most recent quarter is almost 70%, 69.5%.  The company is doing a really good job controlling discretionary spend. And we were able to do better than that original guidance around $820 million. I think given where we sit today in an environment that's defined by a little bit higher operating expenses, I think a good planning assumption for us is to keep the $820 million as the right way to think about it.
This is a company that will always be disciplined around what we do and how we do it. There's no sacred cows and no entitlement to spend. We will be very disciplined around discretionary spend and make sure that we channel those resources towards fuel for future growth. But $820 million is the right assumption in the back part of our fiscal year. If there's an opportunity to do better, we certainly will.",216

It's nice to see that the value chain is going -- seems to be well engaged. And I was just trying to think through what would be the downside risk against your current view. So if you're thinking 2020 could be in line with 2019, that's in the context of still a lot of uncertainty being out there. And to me, the big uncertainty is in demand and the general macroeconomic environment. 
And so I was wondering in a world in which things do not recover in the second half and actually, the macro environment is very difficult, and in particular, consumer demand for smartphones, for PCs, for consumer electronics get badly hit, how do you think it's going to affect investment plans of your clients? And maybe another way to put it is in the revenues you see between now and the end of your fiscal year, how much do you think is driven by like the technology train, and it's going to happen, and it has to go through? And how much could be actually adjusted down if the industry has to scale down significantly on capacity, on manufacturing volumes?",219
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3859.0,2018835.0,78987014.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,35,"Okay, Pierre. Let me just try to -- there's a lot in there. Let me try to hit these.
So first, I want to just maybe address the framing of the question. When we said profile in 2020 similar to 2019, that was kind of a percent split across device types. I think it's too early to be point specific on the aggregate dollar amount of WFE spend. But what we want to do though is communicate in an attempt to be helpful, communicate about what we see and hear from our customers and what we're see and hear in our business and then extrapolate that towards a view on a market.
So what do we see in our business? We see Q1 of our fiscal year our semi-related businesses, SSG and AGS, up 18% year-over-year. Q2, we saw strong demand, but we're actually supply chain limited. Despite that, we were up 13% year-over-year in those 2 businesses. So the first half of our fiscal year, we're up about 16% year-over-year in our semi-related business. We enter Q3, record backlog in those 2 businesses. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from customers, we're planning for Q3 to be up sequentially. And then we're expecting it to be up again in Q4. And our view for the fiscal year is strong double-digit growth of our systems business.
Now as we think about WFE in the back half of the year, the best framing that I can give you, independent of what we see and hear from our customers because we feel good about our business, what we've see and hear -- I'm sorry, what we -- the best way to frame the back half of WFE, I think there's going to be 2 factors that influence WFE in the back half of the year. There's what the customers do, and then there's what the supply chain does as it gets healthier.
And we know and are aware of the economic, macroeconomic environment. We're aware of what's going on. We see pluses and minuses. Cloud, data center, PC, comm infrastructure are still showing signs of strength. It's offset by softness in things like auto, industrial, consumer, travel, leisure. So we do have that push and pull from a macro environment standpoint, and we see those pluses and minuses playing out in the market.  Too early for us to decide how that ultimately plays out. Then you have to overlay the comments we made on the supply chain. The combination of those 2 will influence the shape of WFE in the back half of the year. That said, we feel good about where we sit looking into our Q3 and our Q4.",451

I wonder just in terms of the way that you've characterized the coming quarter, you didn't give guidance, but then you gave fairly specific segment guidance. Can you just talk about the message we should be taking away from that? Is that just that there's the segment guidance, but there's uncertainty around it? And why not just guide with a wider range, if that's the case?",67

Thanks, Joe. I wouldn't read anything into it other than if we were to go back 3 months and think about our Q1 earnings call, what we knew at the time was we had a hot spot in China. The rest of the globe was fine. Based on what we saw, we derisked our guide by $300 million, and we talked about it being $150 million semi systems, $100 million in display and $50 million in AGS. And against that backdrop, we executed really well in display and AGS. We fell short in semi systems. And then you ask yourself, why we fell short? There was a concurrent shelter-in-place order issued for 6 weeks of our quarter that impacted a material part of the supply chain. That was unknowable at the time we guided a quarter ago.
And given the potential for other aspects of this COVID pandemic to spring up in unexpected places, we felt it was prudent to not guide but share, in an attempt to be helpful, share what we're seeing in the business. And we tried to strike the right balance between openness and transparency and trying to be helpful without putting a number out there that there's things that could potentially happen we have no control of. We can't execute our way out of a complete shutdown of our supply chain and nursing it back to health that impacted 6 weeks of our quarter. That was an unknowable event at the time we guided.  So it's nothing more than trying to strike the right balance between that transparency and prudent in an environment, recognizing the elevated macro risk of where we sit today around the world.",282

But most of them are conveying a fair amount of uncertainty as to the back half and talking about memory companies not being a leading indicator and seem to be getting ready for a variety of scenarios. So as you think about that spending pattern, is it -- is enough of it a technology spending that you feel like this is pretty solid kind of regardless of the memory pricing environment? Or is some of it, I guess -- just what's any vulnerability to conditions worsening in the second half?",123

I'm very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter, and earnings hit an annualized run rate of $5 per share for the first time.
For the fiscal year, we grew revenues 18%, and earnings 37% while making significant strategic investments in new technologies and products to address the industry's highest value problems and position the company for sustained long-term success. These results are all the more impressive considering the unprecedented disruptions we've navigated this year.
I really want to thank all our employees, suppliers and partners for their resilience and adaptability. Our teams have switched to new ways of working, delivered on our commitments to customers and investors and kept our technology and product development on track. While our actions to date are driven by a need to protect the health and safety of our employees while keeping our company strong, I'm very excited about the long-term benefits of working in new ways, especially remote support in R&D.
In today's call, I'll begin by sharing our current view of the market environment. Then as this is the end of our fiscal year, I'll highlight some of our major accomplishments in 2020 before describing the growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next several years.
I'll conclude by outlining our strategy and investments that will drive Applied's long-term profitable growth. As we adapt to the challenges created by COVID-19 and prepare for the post-pandemic era, we are seeing fundamental changes in many areas of our lives, and the world is depending on semiconductors more than ever. Investments in IT and communications infrastructure, combined with the accelerated digital transformation of companies and the economy as a whole are driving very robust semiconductor and wafer fab equipment demand.
In foundry/logic, we see leading-edge customers building out their fabs and aggressively driving advanced R&D. This gives us confidence that current investment levels are sustainable into 2021 and beyond. In addition, specialty markets underperformed in 2020 due to headwinds in industrial and automotive and therefore, represent an upside for 2021 as these sectors rebound.
In memory, spending is growing faster than foundry/logic this year as customers push forward with their technology road maps. We see NAND outgrowing DRAM in 2020 and then DRAM growing significantly faster than NAND in 2021.
Consistent with the perspective we shared on the August call, our outlook remains very positive. We are outperforming the market and we are demonstrating we can grow independent of the spending mix.
This quarter, semiconductor systems revenues were an all-time [indiscernible] the midpoint of our guidance will be up another 12% next quarter. For the fiscal year, semi systems revenue grew 26% with broad-based strength across products and device types. Our traditional leadership businesses that provide solutions for creating and modifying materials and structures are benefiting from innovations that enable leading-edge transistors and interconnects. For example, our metals deposition business, technology that is critical to interconnect performance grew revenues 42% in fiscal 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion.
In our businesses that focus on shaping and analyzing materials and structures, we have significant opportunities to grow our share, and we're demonstrating our strong momentum. In fiscal 2020, our etch business generated record revenues, growing nearly 30% year-on-year. We're gaining share in conductor etch as we win new applications in DRAM and foundry/logic. Our inspection business also delivered record performance as systems revenues increased 46% for the year. We have significant traction with leading-edge customers and are winning share in optical wafer inspection and e-beam with new products that are still in early stages of adoption.
As the benefits of traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling slowdown, leading companies are describing how the industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive performance, power, area cost and time to market of new devices. This PPACt playbook includes new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to shrink geometries and new packaging technology. Applied is uniquely positioned to accelerate this playbook. The breadth of our product portfolio is a key advantage because it allows us to combine technologies in innovative new ways.
For example, in patterning, where we generated nearly $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, we have been winning new applications across multiple customers with a new product that delivers a novel hard mask material combined with a co-optimized etch solution to open the hard mask. This is a great example of a new class of highly differentiated products we call Integrated Materials Solutions or IMS. We have numerous IMS engagements with our leading customers, and I'm very excited about the IMS products we'll be bringing to market in the next several years. 
Another area where we are creating value using our broad capabilities is advanced packaging that enables chips to be connected in new ways. Our packaging business is scaling, generating record revenues of $0.5 billion for the year, up over 20% from fiscal 2019. We're also expanding our ecosystem footprint through a combination of organic investments and partnerships.
Moving to service. AGS also delivered record revenues for the quarter and the year. The portion of AGS revenue generated from subscription-style business also grew to record levels. In fiscal 2020, we increased the number of tools covered by long-term service agreements by 13%. As a result, 60% of our service and spare parts business now comes from the stickier and more predictable recurring revenue streams. Our renewal rates for long-term agreements are also very high at more than 90%. This illustrates the value customers see in our advanced service products.
Rounding out our portfolio with display, we hit our 2020 revenue target in a challenging market. Our outlook for 2021 is similar to this year with no significant changes to the view we shared in our last call. However, we're starting to see some encouraging leading indicators of future growth that we'll be watching closely in 2021. These include increasing adoption of organic LED displays, OLED, for IT applications. Higher OLED adoption in the smartphone market with more than 70% of the 5G handsets launched to date equipped with OLED screens, and foldable OLED handsets approaching a price point that could spur volume adoption.
As I've said before, we're optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Applied in the display market as we focus on addressing the OLED inflection and expanding our available market.
Finally, as I look back on our accomplishments this year, I'm also very proud of our new 10-year road map for environmental and social responsibility that we announced over the summer. This road map lays out the detailed actions behind our vision to make possible a better future for everyone. We've taken a holistic approach to these plans that considers our operations, how we work with customers and suppliers and how our technology can be used to advance sustainability on a global scale. We call our framework 1x, 100x, 10,000x, and we've used it to rally the company around challenging new goals and commitments.
Before I conclude, I'll take a few minutes to describe the longer-term growth drivers we see for Applied. As I look ahead to the next decade, our opportunities have never been better. There are numerous trillion-dollar inflections that can be enabled by advances in materials engineering, from next-generation displays and AR/VR to electrification of transport and personalized health care. However, the 1 inflection that really stands out is AI. AI has the potential to change everything, and it will touch every major industry and area of the economy. AI also has major implications for the electronics and semiconductor ecosystem.
First, we're moving from an application-centric to a data-first world where almost all data will be generated and consumed by machines. This means that the industry's growth will no longer be limited by humans ability to create or consume data.
Second, the new computing approach is needed to make sense of the massive volumes of data available. We'll work best with workload-specific hardware built from customized and entirely new types of silicon. This diversification of designs and devices is great for the industry.
And third, training neural networks for AI computing is incredibly power intensive. So there's a huge imperative for the industry to drive improvements in the performance per watt of computing solutions. The advances in technology needed to unlock the potential of AI create tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials. We have aligned our strategy and investments around this vision for the future, and we're uniquely positioned to accelerate the industry's new PPACt playbook, to advance power, performance, area cost and time to market of next-generation semi devices.
Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. Despite the unprecedented challenges of 2020, Applied is delivering record performance. We're outperforming the market overall and have strong momentum in key growth areas like etch and inspection. The demand for semiconductors remains very strong, driven by IT infrastructure, digital transformation of businesses and an acceleration of longer-term technology trends, especially AI.
Our future opportunities have never been better. We've been investing in next-generation technologies that are critical for the AI ecosystem and laying the groundwork for Applied's future growth. Our strategy to accelerate the PPACt playbook is already yielding results for our customers and Applied. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the innovative new products and integrated solutions we will bring to market in 2021 and beyond.
Now I will turn the call over to Dan.",1574
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272652.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll add my perspective on our Q4 performance and full year results. I'll share some noteworthy developments in our installed base business, and I'll provide you with our backlog entering our next fiscal year, along with our business outlook for Q1.
Beginning with our Q4 performance. I'm pleased that our company delivered record revenue and earnings per share despite the ongoing challenges related to COVID. Our teams managed to significantly increase our system shipments and customer support. And we did it in a very disciplined manner that resulted in higher operating profits and free cash flow. We've now shipped all of the unmet backlog from earlier in the year, and our Q1 guidance gives you a direct look at the healthy demand trends we continue to see in our business.
In Q4, we delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance across all of the segments, including record revenue in semi systems and AGS. We grew revenue by 25% versus the same period last year, increased non-GAAP operating profit by 49% year-on-year and delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $1.25, which was up 56% year-over-year. We also increased operating cash flow to over $1.3 billion, up 59% year-over-year.
About 2 months into our quarter, the U.S. government imposed a licensing requirement related to one of our foundry customers in China. This requirement reduced our revenue in Q4 and our guidance for Q1. We've already applied for licenses where needed to comply with the new rules.
Turning to our full year results. I'm especially pleased with the growth of our semiconductor-related businesses. Semi Systems and AGS combined, grew by over 20% year-over-year. Our installed base business, which includes AGS plus 300-millimeter upgrades, grew by over 9% year-on-year and continues to represent close to 1/3 of Applied's revenue. This growing part of our company provides an annuity-like revenue stream that makes us more resilient across market cycles. 
Within AGS, we've seen positive developments in our long-term service agreements. Until recently, the vast majority of our agreements had 1-year terms. But in 2020, about 1/3 of the agreements we signed had terms of at least 3 years. We've increased these extended service agreements by a factor of 10 over the past 3 years.
This outstanding growth underscores the close working relationships we have with customers, who are using our data-enabled services over the life of a node to generate world-class yields output and costs. In fact, in 2020, we grew the installed base of our data-enabled tools by nearly 40%.
For the company as a whole in 2020, we delivered record revenue in both semi systems and AGS. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 110 basis points, invested 69% of non-GAAP OpEx in research and development, grew non-GAAP operating profit by 32% and increased EPS by 37%. We also generated $3.8 billion in operating cash flow, setting a new record and returned $1.44 billion to shareholders. We raised the dividend for the third year in a row, paid dividends of $787 million and allocated nearly $650 million to stock buybacks, repurchasing at an average price of $56.32. We increased cash on the balance sheet by nearly $2 billion as we prepared for the Kokusai Electric transaction.
In Q4, our stock buybacks were limited to $50 million as our legal department imposed a trading blackout out of an abundance of caution, in connection with our discussions with the Chinese regulatory agency that is reviewing the Kokusai Electric transaction. We continue to have constructive discussions and we're working to secure clearance for the transaction before the end of the calendar year.
Next, I'll share some color regarding the demand we see as we enter our new fiscal year. Applied's backlog reached nearly $6.7 billion in Q4, setting a new year-end record. The combined backlog of our semi-related businesses also set a year-end record, growing to nearly $5.5 billion. Our display backlog declined year-over-year. And as Gary discussed, we're tracking the leading indicators of the eventual recovery.
Now I'll share our Q1 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $4.95 billion, plus or minus $200 million, with the midpoint up about 19% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.26, plus or minus $0.06 or up nearly 30% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we project semiconductor systems revenue of around $3.45 billion, up nearly 23% year-over-year; AGS revenue of about $1.07 billion, up around 7% year-over-year; and display revenue of around $400 million, up about 20% year-on-year.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 45.3% and which is higher year-over-year and lower sequentially due to near-term changes in product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx to increase to $860 million, reflecting higher expenses from a 14-week quarter plus 1 month of annual merit increases, partially offset by holiday shutdown savings. Our Q1 guidance assumes a tax rate of around 12%, and a weighted average share count of around 925 million.
In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered record performance in Q4 and has strong momentum entering our new fiscal year. Our backlog is at record levels as our products and technology generate strong customer pull. Our installed base business is becoming larger and more resilient with growth in our data-enabled services and multiyear service agreements.

And that's far better than what we're seeing industry-wide. So I guess can you discuss what's driving that outperformance, including some discussion on your success with conductor etch? And how should we think about your share of wallet for DRAM, given that that's probably the fastest-growing subsegment in calendar '21?",81
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272656.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,7,"Yes. C.J., I'll take the question. As you pointed out, our DRAM business is showing significant signs of strength this year. We've built momentum throughout the year. And we expect to close the year very strong. As we think about the overall growth rate of the DRAM market in this year against the backdrop of an industry that's probably growing 10% to 15%, probably at the high end of that range for overall WFE. Our overall systems business is going to be up over 25% for the calendar year. Against that DRAM as a market is probably a couple of points higher than the overall industry. So based on the math you walked through, you can see that the company is significantly outperforming.
On last quarter's call, Gary talked about the momentum we're seeing from a conductor etch standpoint. So the team is performing really, really well there. And then as you think about things like high-K metal gate to get the I/O speeds on and off the DRAM device, we've been talking for a while about that inflection coming into the market and we're just really well positioned from a technology standpoint to drive our customers' road map and seeing strong adoption. So we feel really good about how we're performing against the backdrop of a good market, but clearly strong performance, and we're really encouraged by what we see going forward. And we would expect this strength to continue into next year as we continue to push our customers' road map and drive strong adoption of the technology.",260

This is Gary. For high speed, the periphery is moving to more like, as Dan said, more logic-like processes where that's in the sweet spot of where we have leadership with a number of different products. So that's part of a unique inflection that's really fueling our growth in DRAM. And I talked, I think, in the last earnings call about the growth that we've seen in our DRAM conductor etch, gaining about 30 points of share since 2016. And so with the key technology inflections for the high-speed memory and also the strength of the Sym3 and etch, really, that's fueling our growth, and we feel really good that we're going to continue to enable the future inflections and continue to grow -- outgrow the market in DRAM.",140

And as my follow-up, I guess perhaps, if you could focus on domestic China and overall China. I think the concern out there is that the types of numbers we're seeing is not sustainable, particularly given what's going on with SMIC. But curious if you could offer thoughts on the greater breadth of spending that we'll probably see in calendar '21? And then how we should think about multinationals layering in? And what impact that will have on overall CapEx coming out of China?",86
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272659.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,10,"Yes. Sure, C.J. Let me jump in on that and see if Gary wants to add anything at the end. From an overall market standpoint in calendar year 2020, we see meaningful spend by both the domestic customers as well as the multinational customers. And if I were to think about weighting of that spend, I would say it favors the domestic market over the multinationals, but both groups of customers are having meaningful spend. I think what you see is a broad base of investments. You're seeing investments across 200-millimeter geometries, 300-millimeter geometries. And within 300-millimeter geometries, you're seeing investments in NAND, DRAM, foundry/logic, so all device types. We think that continues into 2021. 
We probably won't see the growth rates that we did in 2020. It's going to be a strong year but you certainly won't see those growth rates. From a growth standpoint, I would expect multinationals to show more growth than the domestic customers but still strong spend in both categories. So we see it's a good market. We continue to see strength in China and expect to see that for the foreseeable future as they build their ecosystem in a slow, disciplined manner.",198

Just a follow-up on C.J.'s question on China, Dan. You talked about in your prepared comments that the ruling against SMIC did impact your fiscal fourth quarter, fiscal first quarter. I wonder if you can just confirm with us how much of an impact was it. And does SMIC now represent 0 within the forward-looking numbers? Or how are we thinking about kind of the impact there?",72
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272662.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,13,"Yes. Thanks, John. Here's what I can share with you. As you can imagine, we probably don't want to be too detailed on what any 1 customer is doing. But the licensing requirement that we talked about, it was put in place about 2/3 of the way through our fiscal fourth quarter. So we saw about 4 or 5 weeks exposure to that new requirement. As we said in the prepared comments, Q4 revenue and Q1 guidance would have been higher if those restrictions had not been in place. So we're complying with the new rules. We've already applied for licenses where we need them. Trade situation remains fluid. So we don't want to speculate about the future. But certainly, the revenue in Q4 and guide for Q1 would have been higher absent that requirement. 
As you know, we've been in China for a very long time. We've got a broad base of relationships, and it's across all device types and we would expect the China market to continue to be strong for us going forward. And again, we're working with the governments to get the licensing requirement satisfied.",189

And then maybe for my follow-up for Gary. Gary, a lot of the conversation around U.S.-China trade tensions that there had been concerns around restriction of shipping equipment into China. But there's clearly a second side of the story where a lot of countries now are looking at the strategic necessity for semiconductor capacity. You have things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S., you have TSMC announcing a foundry in Arizona earlier this year. EU officials have been talking about perhaps incentivizing more domestic production. Japan, the same. So I'm just kind of curious, given your vantage point in the industry, how important of a trend do you think this will be, this idea of regionalization of semi capacity? And what kind of potential growth driver could it be for your business?",136
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272664.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,15,"Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So first off, I would say that, really, the major focus for all our customers is to drive their road maps, deliver the lowest power, highest performance chips at the best cost And I deeply believe that the future road map is going to look very different than the past. I've talked before about classic Moore's Law and 2D scaling not being enough to enable the future AI infrastructure at the edge and in the cloud. So I do believe kind of aligned with your question that this is highly strategic for many countries in many regions. And I do -- we do see that certainly, we see some near-term trends with big customers moving to new regions in alignment with that trend. And I think that, that's going to continue. So it definitely creates an opportunity for Applied going forward. 
Certainly, as these customers are moving to new regions, the support in terms of accelerating their R&D, their ramp, transfer of technologies into these new regions, all of that creates a great service opportunity for us. And then even more important, as I said, I do believe the future is going to look different than the past. We're at an inflection point in the industry relative to how you drive the technology forward. One of our biggest customers 2 months ago talked about their road map beyond 2020 to double energy-efficient computing every 2 years. And if you go look at the slide 2 months ago, it exactly aligns what I've been talking about with the 5 elements of the playbook around new architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to shrink and new ways to connect chips together with advanced packaging. 
So exactly what we've been talking about. And Applied is in a really great position with innovative products and integrated solutions to enable that new PPACt playbook. So I think we've never been in a better position. And again, I do believe that the industry is at an inflection point, and the countries and the companies that are best aligned to this new playbook, and get their first they are going to win, it's very, very important for the whole AI infrastructure going forward.",373

I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about your business being up 46%. And I think it was your systems business was up 46% in fiscal 2020. You probably outperformed most of your peers, if not all your peers during that time frame. Where are you seeing the most traction in inspection? And how should we think about sustainability for that business into 2021? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",79
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272667.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,18,"Yes. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So absolutely, the inspection business is a real bright spot for the company. And as you mentioned, we grew the systems revenue by 46%. We have a new optical inspection system and new e-beam products that are seeing strong initial adoption with leading customers. And in both areas, we have a lot of room to grow, and we'll make an official launch fairly soon on some of these new capabilities. 
And the other thing I would say, certainly, the -- in this business, we have some really, really great leading technology. And the other aspect that's important for Applied is the connection in driving the PPACt road map, the analysis of all of these new innovations. When you think about wiring to lower resistance to improve the power or gate all around for high-performance transistors, having these unique imaging capabilities, and we have launched a product that has dramatically higher resolution than any product -- e-beam product that's on the market today, being able to see those data all around structures and understand how to drive the different films and shaping the structures and modifying the structures, all of that tied together is also tremendously synergistic with the rest of our business and driving the PPACt road map. 
So we're really in the early adoption of some of these new capabilities. I'm very confident that '21 and beyond, we're going to have really good results from our PDC business. But also, I'm really excited about the connectivity to the rest of Applied's business in accelerating the PPACt road map for customers.",267

And then, Dan, as my follow-up, just on gross margin. I know there are multiple sort of levers, both to the upside and the downside that could impact gross margins, and you guided to a slightly lower number for fiscal Q1. But when you think about gross margins longer term. I think at your most recent Analyst Day, you put up a 47% number, if I recall correctly. But is that still sort of the right target for you internally? Or is it higher or lower? How should we think about gross margins on a multiyear cadence?",98
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272669.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,20,"Yes, Toshiya. So from a gross margin standpoint, the company is performing really well. If you think about what Gary said in the prepared comments, in fiscal year '20, we're up 110 basis points year-over-year. Our fiscal Q4, we just reported, we're up 190 basis points year-over-year. And then like you pointed out, we see some different mix as we look into our fiscal Q1. It's down a little bit sequentially, but still up year-over-year. We think that's a little temporary and that mix is going to reverse itself as we look out into fiscal Q2. 
So we think the company is executing well in a difficult environment. When we think about the long-term gross margin, I think the best way to describe it would be 45% plus or minus 2 points, depending on where we are in the cycle. And if you look at the quarter, we just printed, 45.7. And then you factor in some of the headwinds we're experiencing in the current environment due to COVID and the pandemic, we would be at the upper end of that range we've referenced of 45 plus or minus 2 points. So I think that model, that framework around gross margin holds and the company is performing well to that. As the legacy impacts and the headwinds from the pandemic begin to wane, I think you would see the performance in the current environment, reflecting that framework around long-term gross margin.",241

And you talked about the outperformance in etch and inspection markets. Looking into next year, where you are most excited about, etch or inspection or different markets?",64
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272672.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,23,"Yes. So I would say if I look at what am I most excited about, it's what I talked about earlier that I really believe that the industry is at an important inflection point. And you can see this also many leading customers and companies in the ecosystem aligning around our view that classic Moore's Law and 2D scaling is not going to be able to enable the future AI infrastructure at the edge and in the cloud. And you see this playing out in terms of the marketplace from a competitive standpoint. The companies that deliver lower power, higher performance at the best cost faster than others, that's the fundamental driver of all of our customers in the ecosystem. So Applied is in a great position to outperform because we have many unique technologies and combination of products that are used to create, shape, modify, analyze and connect structures and devices.
So I think I talked on the last call about our performance in some of our deposition businesses. Last year, we gained 8 points of combined share in Epi, PVD, CVD amounting to about $5.2 billion. This year, we grew our metals deposition business 42% to $2.2 billion. So these leadership businesses are very key to enabling next-generation transistor and wiring, materials and structures and combined with other unique capabilities, I'm really optimistic about our opportunities as we go forward to drive the PPACt road map. 
And as you mentioned, etch, we're also performing very well in etch, significant growth in this last year. We've expanded beyond our strength in memory to foundry and logic, where we're winning steps. We're winning EUV steps as customers are moving to future technology nodes and really, really, really great performance there. It's -- that's really based on our new Sym3 platform, probably the best platform in the history of Applied Materials and there are real fundamental advantages. One is conductance. Conductance is where you remove the etch materials from the chamber, so you're not redepositing on the structures and causing yield and performance issues also particles that are deposited on the chamber. So that's just a fundamental advantage of that particular technology. 
Also, I'm on the phone often with R&D leaders last night with one of the -- our top logic customers and we are seeing yield benefits with the Sym3. They're seeing yield benefits with the Sym3 with new coatings that we've enabled on that platform that, again, is giving us better particle performance. So etch, again, very, very good momentum. And I talked already about inspection and we are in the early phases of adoption of some new products. I'm also very optimistic about that business as we go forward. But the really key thing that I'm most excited about is I do believe the industry is at an inflection point. The future is not classic Moore's Law 2D scaling. And you look at what I talked about relative to creating and modifying and analyzing, connecting all of the structures and devices. 
We're really in a unique position. So again, we are doing really well in different environments from a mix perspective. And I believe that we're at the foundation of enabling the technologies for this future AI infrastructure.",540

So as you know, we've gotten 5 of the 6 regulatory authorities to approve the transaction. We're constructively engaged with the remaining authority and we continue to be optimistic that we're going to receive clearance by the end of the calendar year. So we'll stay focused on that.
From a buyback standpoint, once we close the transaction, integrate the asset, I think we'll come back to the investment community and put forward a combined company model over the next several years to give investors a perspective of how the combined company will perform part of that communication, we'll talk about what our capital allocation strategy going forward is. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's what we've been doing now for quite time, which is very shareholder-friendly in terms of giving all excess cash back to shareholders and big buyers of our stock. Given what we see happening from an overall market standpoint, the structural growth we see and the execution of this company against that opportunity, we see our industry going structurally larger, higher highs, higher lows. And we think there's a real opportunity to put capital to work from a share repurchase standpoint. So we'll probably continue what we've been doing now for many years.

And then a longer-term question for Gary. Gary, on China, I'm not looking at it from a political angle but from a long-term business and philosophical standpoint, do you think it's good business practice for AMAT or other U.S. semi cap to ship to China? Because on one side, you're balancing the needs of your customers, but also on the flip side, it might enable local competition or reverse engineering or how do you protect your IP. So I'm kind of curious, how do you balance those 2 as China gets bigger?",94
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272679.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,30,"Yes. Thanks for the question. Local competition has been a factor for us for many, many years in many different regions. And I just keep coming back to the leading companies want to work with the most innovative technologies and products. And there's just no way to go forward with the technology road maps if you don't have the combinations of those different technologies. And as I've said before, I just deeply believe that the future doesn't look like the past. I don't believe that following the classic 2D Moore's Law playbook is the path forward for the industry or to enable this AI infrastructure. 
So there's going to be tremendous innovation. I mentioned earlier, one of the -- one of our leading customers 2 months ago, if you look at their architecture day, and they talked about the road forward beyond 2020 for energy-efficient computing to double every 2 years, and it was exactly aligned with the things that I've been talking about over the last 2 years with the new architectures, new structures, new materials, EUV enhancements and new ways to connect the chips together with 3D advanced packaging. So I just believe there's going to be tremendous innovation. All of this is going to be a moving target relative to the products. 
And the other thing is you have the opportunity to connect these products and technologies together in unique ways to manage the interfaces and the interfaces on these structures are becoming much more critical than they've ever been in the past. So we know -- we've talked about some innovations in the transistor where we can enable enormous improvements in leakage current or drive current, and it really comes from being able to combine these technologies together, not oxidized or damage those interfaces. Those are completely unique capabilities that you really -- having this portfolio is a tremendous advantage, a very unique advantage for Applied. 
So look, I think that the world will operate the best, certainly with fair and free trade and that these inflections that we're seeing today around AI, biggest inflections of our lifetimes will transform every industry, and Applied is right at the foundation of those inflections.",366

I guess, Gary, first, I know you think about capital intensity a lot. And I've seen your charts, and I totally agree with the 10.5% to 11% longer-term WFE intensity. And it seems like if you strip out some of the duplicative spending today, there's probably at least $3 billion to $4 billion in China that's not backed by revenue. So it seems like if you just strip that out, we're probably closer to like 12% right now. So I know when you think longer term, you do a lot of modeling about longer-term WFE. But when you kind of think about where WFE can go and you build out an underlying semiconductor revenue number. Is it fair to use like a 12% sort of a real or a core WFE intensity number? And then you can like layer on top of that spending that you think might happen because of the issues that John had mentioned before, but that's not real dollars that's backed by revenue. So the question is, is that 12% a good number?",180
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272682.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,33,"Tim, this is Dan. I'll jump in on this one. So I do think 12% is a good number to start with. Do I think there's an upward bias on that over time, given what we see from a technology road map standpoint? Yes, I think you can make that argument. But I think 12% is a good number to lock in on.
Just a couple more perspectives on it. We talk about when 300-millimeter came in around the 2000 time frame, we saw multiple concurrent investments in both wafer size technologies, and we saw probably 17%. So that's probably an all-time high. Now what you saw is the 300-millimeter wafer size technology came into the industry and all of the efficiency gains that came with it, as well as the consolidation of our customer base. We hit a low point in 2013 at about 9%, and it's been on a steady upward trajectory since then. And so we think the trend is a pretty good one. 
The other thing I would point you to, and maybe this is a little bit of a different way of thinking about the industry. If you take that low point of capital intensity and you combine 2012 and 2013 as a combined 2-year window and then compare it to the next 2-year combined window of '13 and '14, compare that to the next 2-year window of '14 and '15 and onwards, when you do that exercise out to 2021 and what you'll see is each successive 2-year windows with an upwardly sloping line. And so we think our industry has gone from no growth cyclical to growth with an upward sloping trend line, and we'll see higher highs and higher lows as that thesis plays out. And so we feel really good about where this industry is going in support of all the thematic trends that Gary has talked about for many quarters now.",321

Yes. Got it, Dan. And then I guess my second question is just on DRAM. I know, Gary, you sort of emphasized that DRAM is going to outgrow NAND on a percentage basis next year, which, I guess, sounds a little ominous for DRAM. But can you put that in the context of demand? It seems like DRAM WFE is certainly coming off of a much lower base this year. And on the supply side, we're in a far better point right now than we are in NAND. So can you sort of back those numbers into what that means for the supply-demand balance next year?",107
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272684.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,35,"Yes, sure, Tim. I'll jump in on that one again. And I think the best way to get at this and unpack it for the investment community is talk about what we see in 2020 and then use that as a jumping-off point to describe the contours around 2021. So starting with 2020, we continue to see the overall market up 10% to 15%. We're probably at the high end of that range. We talked about Applied Systems business against a market that's up 15%. Our systems business is going to be up 25% for the calendar year. 
By device type, we see foundry/logic greater than 55% in 2020, but it's growing below the market average. DRAM on the memory side of the house, DRAM, it's growing a little faster than the overall market. I think the real story in 2020 is NAND. NAND is growing 2x the overall market in 2020. And so I think that's maybe a little contrary to what the conventional thinking is around 2020. 2020 is a memory growth year, especially for NAND and against that backdrop of the memory growth year, Applied is outperforming very nicely. So we feel good about 2020. 
As we look into 2021, we expect another strong year for the industry and for Applied. And while we're not sharing a specific forecast around WFE, I think it's premature to be point specific at this time, we see foundry/logic is going to continue to be strong, and we see it as over 55% of total WFE again next year. But what you'll see in the memory side of the house is going to be a reversal from a growth standpoint. NAND, we expect to be flattish year-over-year, and DRAM set up to significantly outgrow the market. 
So this is a great setup for Applied, given the strong share gains we've been talking about now throughout 2020 in DRAM. It gives us confidence as we look into 2021 that the setup from an overall end market standpoint, strong foundry/logic, flattish NAND, strong DRAM, it's a good setup for Applied as we look into next year.",353

On your commentary on leading-edge systems driving much of the incremental revenue growth this year with lagging edge system shipments muted just given the weakness in auto, industrial and analog segments of the market. The recovery in these markets we're seeing now and into next year should be a tailwind for the business. And so what's your expectation on the mix of leading edge versus lagging edge over the next few years, just given the number of new 12-inch analog fabs and microcontroller content and analog content growth in all electronic applications? And what's your positioning in these segments of the market?",108
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3626.0,2140953.0,84272687.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,38,"Harlan, I'll jump in on that one. I think you pointed out rightfully, this is a little bit of a weaker market for the trailing-node geometries. A couple of quarters ago or even last quarter, we talked about auto and industrial markets showing some signs of weakness as a result of the pandemic. Since then, we've seen those end markets continuing to perform stronger. But I think it's going to follow the natural progression we would see in any one of our end markets off of low utilization levels. We see utilization rise once utilization gets to a certain level, then you'll see customers begin to layer in capacity. 
And so I would expect to see legs up in those markets, trailing-node geometries as we look into next year. Longer term, we think the trailing-node geometries as a result of communications infrastructure, industrial, auto, Internet of Things, there's a whole host of drivers that are taking that industry structurally larger over time and we would expect that trailing-node geometries segment to outgrow the overall market over a multiyear window. So we feel good about it. 
In the near term, while customers are pulling really hard multiple customers, multiple nodes on the leading edge, you've seen a rotation from a very balanced foundry/logic market between leading edge and trailing-node to probably more weighted to leading-edge technologies in the current environment. Over time, we would expect that to moderate a bit and get back to a more balanced profile than what we've seen maybe in 2020 or 2021. But we do think that those markets are set up to do well. And we're encouraged by that because any time you broaden the growth drivers of an industry, it just makes it structurally stronger, less cyclical, less volatile, and we think that, that's going to benefit this industry significantly.
From a positioning standpoint, we're well positioned competitively across that entire node profile. And so we're going to continue to deliver enabling technology to the market, and we'll continue to see strong pull from customers top to bottom across the node profiles.",348

I'm pleasantly surprised by the size of Applied's Advanced Packaging business, $500 million in revenues this year. How big is this market do you estimate?

So as I mentioned before, the packaging part of the ecosystem is one of the key drivers. There's the 5 drivers that I talked about before. And then you see this being also discussed by many leading companies, our customers, other companies in the ecosystem, fabless companies relative to the importance of packaging. I definitely think if you look at the power performance and costs going forward, packaging is really, really, really important. And we have a very strong position. We're #1 in advanced wafer-level packaging. 
And we're working with a number of different ecosystem partners. We talked about a partner with another company to deliver the first -- industry's first fully integrated solution for hybrid bonding, where you can connect 2 chips together in die form, and that enables shorter interconnect distance, 4x increase in I/O density. So there's a lot of innovation that's going to happen in that market. And we have very, very strong positions. If you look at just that 1 particular innovation, you need to optimize etch CMP deposition, wafer surface cleaning. We have metrology inspection, defect particle control that we can add to enable that inflection. 
And then we also have the center of excellence at Applied's advanced packaging technology center in Singapore. And we have some very large leading customers working with us on some of these new innovative architectures. So I'm really excited. Certainly, it's a meaningful part of our business today. But I think we're really at the early phase of the adoption of many of these new technologies, and we are #1 in advanced packaging, expanding with partnerships through the ecosystem. So I'm excited about it. I don't want to give a specific number right now. But I think it's going to become much more important than most people realize in the ecosystem.",304

Just not to take anything away from what you've achieved this year in the foundry/logic and DRAM segments but if I look at your NAND revenue, at least in fiscal '20, revenue was roughly flat year-on-year, where it sounds like the overall NAND WFE may be up close to 30%. So it looks like you've lost share this year. Wondering as you look forward, are there opportunities to stem that share loss in fiscal '21? Or does your outperformance really depend on continued strength in DRAM and foundry/logic?",95

Quinn, I think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion. When we talked about the WFE end market and we talked about NAND, that's a calendar year comment. And so if you look at the first 3 quarters of calendar year '20, you see our NAND business up significantly more than the flat you referenced. And at the midpoint of our guide, we won't talk about by device type, but I think you'll see the performance of that business roughly in line with the overall market. 
It's just the peculiarities of quarters when they happen to hit and the revenue expectations within those quarters. And so if you look at the quarterly profile for the trailing 12 months, you'll see that the 1 quarter out there from a historical standpoint was quite large showing performance this year. On a fiscal year basis, flattish. The first 3 quarters of 2020, you see a very different number. And when we're talking 3 months from now at next quarter's results, I think you'll see a business that's more roughly in line with the overall market. So we're very comfortable, confident with how we're positioned within that end market. And we're going to continue to drive our business and technology and look to do better over time.",214

If we go back in time, at one point, 30% of our revenue was generated from long-term service agreements, then we grew at the 40%, then 50%, now you see it at 60%. I think we've got the right strategy around this business. You see those long-term service agreements extending out in tenure, which provides even more stability. And we're going to look to drive that number north off of the 60% of revenues over time. We're going to look to continue to drive that number north.

This time last quarter, I started the call by outlining the steps we were taking inside Applied Materials to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our actions have been guided by 2 key principles. First, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers and partners; and second, focusing on strategic initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term.
Today, I'm pleased to report that both our manufacturing operations and R&D labs are running smoothly at pre-COVID levels of productivity. I'd like to acknowledge the exceptional contributions, resilience and creativity of our employees and suppliers who have rapidly adapted to new ways of working to deliver this quarter's outstanding results.
A few weeks ago at SEMICON West, I outlined Applied's vision for the next decade. I talked about the critical role semiconductors will play in shaping a better future for everyone, the advances in technology needed to unlock the potential of artificial intelligence and how materials engineering will enable the industry's new PPACt playbook -- to advance power, performance, area, cost and time to market.
I also announced Applied's new 10-year goals and road map for environmental sustainability, which is part of our commitment to grow our business responsibly and make possible a better future. Having covered our long-term perspective in detail at that event, today, I'm going to focus my comments on current market dynamics and provide additional insights into our product portfolio and business momentum.
Starting with the market environment, we remain mindful of global economic concerns and that consumer spending is a potential headwind for many sectors, including the electronics industry. With that said, demand for semiconductors has strengthened over recent months. As the world adapts to the challenges created by the pandemic, several major technology inflections are being accelerated. Work from home, home schooling and online retail are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. Many organizations are building stronger business continuity plans and increasing the use of automation and IoT technologies. And because AI has the potential to transform entire industries, its adoption remains nondiscretionary for many companies.
In wafer fab equipment, we expect overall foundry/logic spending to grow this year even with soft demand in specialty nodes that serve automotive and industrial markets. At the leading edge, we see a strong commitment from customers to build out their fabs and aggressively drive their R&D road maps. This gives us confidence these levels of spending are sustainable in 2021 and beyond.
As I've described before, with the slowing of traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling, there will be a transition from general purpose computing to customized solutions tailored for specific applications or workloads. Recent announcements by leading systems companies illustrate this inflection very well. Custom design silicon and diversification of architectures play to the strengths of the foundries and underpin their ongoing investments. In memory, we see investments for the year growing slightly faster than in foundry/logic as customers push forward with their technology road maps. We also see the growth rate in DRAM being very similar to NAND.
Against this backdrop of a strengthening demand, our Semiconductor Systems revenues are up 18% on a trailing 12-month basis, and at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance will be up 25% for our fiscal year.
Next, I'll explain what's driving our outperformance today and how, by focusing on our customers' highest value problems, we are positioned to grow faster than our markets over the next several years.
The process complexity required to produce leading-edge transistors and interconnects continues to grow and new innovations in materials and structures are fundamental to driving higher performance and lower power consumption. This plays directly to the strengths of Applied's traditional leadership areas, namely creating and modifying materials and structures. For example, our deposition businesses, CVD, PVD and epi, generated more than $5.2 billion of revenue in calendar 2019 and according to VLSI's data gained 8 points of market share.
In our growth businesses that focus on shaping and analyzing materials and structures, we have strong momentum. We are the fastest-growing company in etch, even though we don't currently serve the dielectric market segment. At the midpoint of our guidance, our etch revenues will be up nearly 30% this fiscal year. Since we introduced our Sym3 system in 2015, we have shipped more than 5,000 chambers and we recently introduced Sym3 Y, which is the most advanced etch system we've ever built. This system provides extremely high materials selectivity as well as precise depth and profile control needed to form the densely packed, high-aspect-ratio structures in next-generation 3D, NAND, DRAM and logic devices.
We're also the fastest-growing company in the metrology and inspection market. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue for our Process Diagnostics and Control business will be up more than 40% in fiscal 2020. We're winning share in optical wafer inspection and e-beam with new products that are in the early stages of adoption and have significant traction with leading customers.
Applied has by far the broadest product portfolio in the industry, spanning materials creation, modification, shaping, analysis and packaging. This allows us to see inflections early and develop more complete solutions for customers, from co-optimizing deposition and removal processes, all the way to our integrated materials solutions that combine multiple process and metrology technologies within a single system to address our customers' most complex challenges.
In addition, our business is very well balanced across device segments. In foundry, where we are traditionally very strong, we are seeing our available market grow node-over-node and we are positioned to outperform the market as these new technologies ramp in high-volume manufacturing.
In DRAM, our share is even higher than in foundry/logic. Over the past 5 years, we've gained 25 points of DRAM patterning share and still have significant potential to grow. We've recently won multiple process tool of record positions for future node transitions, including multi-patterning, hard-mask and hard-mask open applications. In addition, the industry's upcoming transition to high-speed DDR5 is enabled by advanced logic-like features, including high-k metal gate. This grows the available market in areas where Applied has clear technology leadership.
Another area where we're delivering more value to customers and have strong growth momentum is our aftermarket businesses. If we look at Applied Global Services plus 300-millimeter upgrades, revenues are up 21% compared to the same period in 2019. Within AGS, 60% of our service and spare parts business comes from predictable recurring revenue streams in the form of long-term service agreements. This year, the renewal rate for these long-term agreements is in excess of 90%, which is clear validation of the value customers see in our advanced service products.
In Display, our revenue outlook for fiscal 2020 is unchanged at $1.6 billion and we expect 2021 to be similar. However, we're seeing some encouraging signs in the high-end of the market, specifically, robust demand for 8K screens and the adoption of OLED in TVs. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Applied in the display market as we focus on addressing future technology inflections and expanding our available market.
Finally, I'll highlight how we're working differently inside the company as well as with our customers and suppliers. COVID-19 restrictions has stimulated many changes in the way companies in the industry are operating. For example, since March, we've provided thousands of digital support sessions using AR and video, held more than 900 training sessions with field support engineers using VR and live distance learning, and fully restored R&D lab productivity while bringing only a fraction of our engineering staff on-site.
I strongly believe that 'innovate anywhere' provides substantial long-term benefits by eliminating waste, saving time and money and reducing the industry's carbon footprint. Over the past several years, Applied has been making significant investments in state-of-the-art digital infrastructure, sensors and metrology, data science, machine learning and simulation. The combination of these technologies enables us to accelerate product development cycles, speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab and optimize cost, output and yield for our customers in high-volume production.
Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. First, thanks to the extraordinary hard work of our employees and suppliers, we are operating the company at pre-COVID levels of productivity while maintaining stringent protocols to keep our workplaces safe and healthy.
Second, while we're mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, semiconductor equipment demand is strengthening and the longer-term industry growth drivers remain firmly in place. Based on what we hear from our customers, we believe current spending levels will be sustained or even higher in 2021.
Third, our strategy to accelerate the PPACt playbook is yielding results for our customers and Applied. Today, we're outperforming the market overall and especially in key growth areas, including etch and inspection. Looking ahead, I am very excited about the innovative new products and integrated solutions we will bring to market this year and beyond.
Now I will turn the call over to Dan.",1493

Today, I'll summarize our Q3 results, give you more insights into the performance trends Gary outlined and share our business outlook for Q4.
I'm pleased that despite challenges related to COVID-19, our teams delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth across Semiconductor Systems, AGS and Display.
Our installed base business, which includes AGS plus 300-millimeter upgrades, grew by 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year and now represents about 1/3 of our company's total revenue. For the company as a whole, we grew revenue by 23% year-over-year and generated non-GAAP earnings of $1.06, up 43% year-on-year. We anticipate continued momentum in our fiscal Q4 and Q1.
During the third quarter, we shipped a significant proportion of the backlog that we couldn't satisfy in Q2 due to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. Our demand has remained strong, and our Q3 ending backlog was nearly unchanged from the prior quarter. The industry's supply chain performance continues to improve. And despite ongoing logistical challenges in Q3, we increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 40 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-on-year. We also delivered sequential operating margin gains in both Semiconductor Systems and AGS. Non-GAAP OpEx was in line with our targets, and we allocated 69% to research and development. We increased non-GAAP operating profit to $1.16 billion, up 41% year-over-year.
In May, we successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior notes at historically low rates and later redeemed $1.35 billion of maturities that were due in October 2020 and June 2021. These transactions extended our weighted average maturities by about 5 years and reduced the average coupon of our notes outstanding.
During the quarter, we returned $402 million to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. We remain strongly committed to our shareholder distribution program and to closing the Kokusai Electric transaction. We're having constructive discussions to close the final regulatory approval we need. We continue to expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to our non-GAAP financial results and we look forward to providing you with a new financial model soon after we close the proposed transaction.
Next, I'll expand on the performance trends Gary highlighted in his remarks. We've discussed our conviction in the attractiveness of our markets and the opportunity we have to generate strong returns by consistently investing for growth. The investments we've made in recent years are resulting in momentum that's already visible today and will accelerate as new nodes ramp over the next several years.
Let's examine how Applied's revenue is profiling in the first half of the calendar year, which is our fiscal Q2 plus fiscal Q3. Compared to the same period last year, our Semiconductor Systems revenue is up 23%. This compares very favorably with our closest peers.
In foundry, we're significantly outperforming in the market. We're winning critical new applications in advanced patterning and we're working closely with customers to develop next-generation transistors and interconnects using innovative approaches like our Integrated Materials Solutions. This is strengthening our leadership in foundry/logic and also giving us new application wins in memory, where we're outperforming in the market as well. In fact, we believe we'll be the #1 company in DRAM conductor etch this year, winning greater than 50% of the available market. We look forward to demonstrating more growth as DRAM spending improves and demonstrate Applied's unique ability to perform well in a variety of spending environments.
Based on discussions with our customers, we expect momentum to continue throughout the calendar year. Specifically, we believe our revenue in both foundry/logic and memory will be second half weighted, leading to another year of growth and outperformance for Applied. This strength in our systems business is fuel for growth in our installed base business, which is also on track to be up in the second half and into the future. As new systems go off warranty, we have opportunities to win subscription-like, long-term service agreements, which are a significant growth multiplier for our parts and service revenue.
Now I'll share our fiscal Q4 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $4.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint of the range would be up by around 23% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.17, plus or minus $0.06.
Within this outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems revenue to be approximately $3.025 billion, which would be up about 31% year-over-year. Applied Global Services revenue should be about $1.07 billion or up about 10% year-over-year and Display revenue should be about $475 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.7% or up nearly 2 points year-on-year and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $820 million.
In summary, Applied delivered double-digit revenue growth across all of our segments in Q3 with strong operating leverage. We're pleased to see how the investments we've made are translating to growth and relative outperformance, both in foundry/logic and also in memory, where we've made significant investments in recent years. The company is also positioned to weather cycles better than ever, with our installed base now driving 1/3 of our revenue and 60% of our parts and service business coming through subscriptions. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for driving our innovation, increasing our shipments and customer support, all while driving strong shareholder returns in a very challenging environment.

And just curious, firstly, how should we think about any room for upside just based on lower expenses related to reduced costs associated with COVID, logistics, et cetera. And then as you think about the portfolio that you've kind of discussed that you see in the next year or 2, can we get back to that peak 36.6% we saw in 2018 for silicon?",83

Thanks, C.J. On gross margin, the company has performed really well in the current environment. You talk about the year-over-year performance. If you take a look at our guide, we're going to be up almost 200 basis points into the fiscal Q4. So the company is performing really well. I would like to underscore the hard work that our operations and supply chain and logistics team are doing to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic environment we're in. They've done an absolutely superb job. And so the company is doing well on that front.
As we take a step back and think about the longer-term trajectory around gross margins, there's clearly a lot of activity going on inside of the company. This is something we spend a lot of time focused on. And we're hopeful that over time we've got an opportunity to raise those gross margins even off of these levels as we deliver the new innovation to market that Gary talked about in his prepared comments. Ultimately, I don't think we'll ever be satisfied no matter where the gross margins are. But clearly, the company is performing well in the current environment that we're in.
Then when we take a step back and look at our Semiconductor Systems operating margin, again, the company is performing well. I think what you'll see into the coming quarter, while we don't guide operating margin by segment, I think you'll see some strength on that front as well. And so I do think that we've got an opportunity over time to get back to that prior benchmark for the segment. So again, a lot of hard work and I think the company is doing well in a difficult environment.",289

And as a quick follow-up, it sounds like within your prepared remarks that your view on memory CapEx is actually better than perhaps where we were 3 months ago. And I think as we listen to Micron today and others in the storage arena, concern that perhaps things might be getting softer. So can you provide some color on how exactly you're seeing memory CapEx trends into the second half of the year and then through 2021?",79
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3666.0,2162211.0,84953221.0,Answer,Daniel Durn,,Executives,9,"Yes, sure, C.J. Let me paint a little bit of a bigger picture for you that puts what we're seeing in the memory market in context. And so if we look at WFE this year, our best estimate at this point, given everything we see from the market and our customers, we're going to be up about 10% to 15% year-over-year. That's off of a 2019 baseline. That's about $51.5 billion. We think it's a good number. It's a third party validated number by VLSI. And so we think we're up 10% to 15%.
And as you take a look at our prepared comments, we think that there's going to be strength in both memory and foundry/logic. We think both of those segments for us from a revenue standpoint are both going to be second half weighted throughout the year. And we think the proportion of spend within WFE is weighted towards foundry/logic. More than 55% of the spend is in foundry/logic. We think that strength continues into next year, both the overall market as well as our position against that opportunity. We see strength into 2021. And we feel like the proportion of spend in 2021 is going to be very similar to what we're seeing this year.
So as we look at the back half of calendar 2020, we're not expecting a spike in memory spending and we're not expecting a precipitous fall. The company is performing well in this environment. You see how well we've performed in the first half of the calendar year versus the first half of calendar '19. And we're just going to keep competing, delivering innovation for customers and driving our business. So we feel good about how we're doing.",287

It sounds like, in your answer to C.J.'s question, that foundry actually gets stronger half-on-half in the second half of the year. I'm just kind of curious given that the largest foundry guy spent more than half of his CapEx budget this year. Can you help me understand better sort of the business outside of that large guy? And especially coming from China, how much more growth do you see in kind of the -- I hate to call it second or third tier foundries, but let's just use that for lack of a better term and/or from China as you look into your fiscal fourth quarter guidance?",116

John, let me try to help you with what we're seeing in the market. So as we look at our foundry/logic business, a couple of things I would say. We've been saying for several quarters now that we are going to see strength in foundry/logic throughout the year. Nothing's changed on that front. We see a diversification of spend underway in the market. We see multiple customers ramping multiple nodes with the strong pull for the technology and innovation that we're bringing to market. We see our business significantly outperforming the overall foundry/logic market. And about a quarter ago, 3 months ago, about 3 months ago, we reported our fiscal Q2 revenues, which is the equivalent of calendar Q1 in 2020. And as I look at the profile of foundry/logic spend this year and our revenue against that opportunity, it looks like our fiscal Q2 is going to be the low point for calendar 2020 in terms of foundry/logic business. And then as I think about strength into the back half of the calendar year, which is our fiscal Q4, fiscal Q1, based on everything we see today, things look good. So it's just a fundamental underlying diversification of spend, multiple customers, multiple nodes and very consistent with what we've been saying now for several quarters.",217

And then maybe as my follow-up for Gary. Clearly, one of the things that COVID has shone a spotlight on is kind of the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing capacity. We've got the CHIPS Act moving its way through Washington. Prime Minister Abe in Japan has talked about building more fabs in Japan. And I think even the EU has set up a commission. I'm just kind of curious from your perspective, how do you see kind of this regionalization of capacity potentially playing out over the next several years? And what incremental opportunities that might afford Applied Materials?",103
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3666.0,2162211.0,84953226.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,14,"Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. So first, I'd echo what Dan said. I was on a call with one of our major foundry/logic customers 2 nights ago and not only strength in 2020 but also into 2021. And I think if you take a step back and you look at what's driving this. It gets back to your question also about the strategic nature of semiconductors. And what we're seeing with COVID-19 is an acceleration of technology transforming every industry. Certainly, my 10-year-old twins are doing learning from home. You have remote working from different locations, e-commerce. All of those things that we've been talking about are accelerating and we're all living that right now. And you also see kind of from a multiyear, secular transition many leading companies developing custom, workload-specific silicon that's going to the foundry. So again, you see that happening, even some recent announcements.
And I think also, when you look at really what is the foundation for the trillion connected devices in the future, it's really all of the semiconductor chips. And you need to keep driving the PPAC, we talk about power, performance, area, cost road map, to get to the performance per watt that you need to have the right infrastructure for the data economy. So I think that driving power and performance, lower power, higher performance at the right cost is just fundamental to competitiveness going forward and way more important from an economic perspective.
And you absolutely see it, like you talked about with TSMC coming to United States. And I said before that we were certainly encouraging that to happen. I think it's a great thing for the United States. You talked about Abe in Japan and also what's going on in other geographic regions. I think that everyone recognizes the strategic importance of these technologies. I think it will become even more clear to everyone on power, performance, area, cost what's driving that future technology road map. And that's, again, where Applied is in a super good position. So absolutely, I see that playing out in the way that you've described it. It's certainly good for Applied. As customers move into different geographic regions, what we've seen is really a boost in our service business. And certainly, it strengthens the strategic relationships we have with a number of different customers.",392

Toshiya, let me talk about the deal and then I'll pass it back to Gary to talk about the industrial logic that underpins that transaction. So we've made a lot of good progress on the regulatory front. We've closed out 5 of the 6 regulatory approvals that we need in this transaction, as you know. So we feel good about that progress. We're having constructive discussions to close the final regulatory approval that we have in the process. We hope to close soon, optimistic about our progress. So we feel good about progress to date. And then just as a reminder, we continue to expect transaction is going to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP financial results upon close. So we feel we're making good progress.",126

Toshiya, we've talked about the power, performance, area, cost road map really being fundamental to how all of our customers compete. And really, people also talk about the limitations with 2D scaling, Moore's Law slowing down, classic Moore's Law slowing down. And I just deeply believe, I'm on calls with the leading customer CEOs, R&D leaders on a regular basis and I just really strongly believe that new architectures you'll see emerge over the next 2 or 3 years are going to be a big driver of the PPAC road map, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together. All of those things, I'm just incredibly optimistic that we're going to be able to drive power, performance and costs going forward, but it's not going to be what's been happening in the past.
So then if you look at Kokusai, Kokusai certainly in memory is very strong. And when we look at what some of those future structures look like, what some of those future architectures or materials look like, Kokusai has some unique technologies where they can go to much higher temperatures. They can process many, many wafers simultaneously. And it gives you another technology that we can combine with all of the other technologies that we have to create, shape, modify, analyze and connect structures and devices. So we haven't really communicated a lot on the strategic value. We will be doing that as soon as the transaction closes, but there are really some tremendous opportunities in combining these different capabilities together. And certainly, we've made tremendous progress relative to our memory market share over the last few years and Kokusai will definitely be additive to that.",282

I think you talked about your etch business at the midpoint of your guidance growing 30%. I think you talked about your process control business being up 40% in the year as well. Based on your customer conversations, based on some of the PTR wins that you're aware of when you think about 2021 and if you can then compare and contrast the potential level of outperformance into next year relative to what you're achieving this year, that would be super helpful.",99

So again, one of the things that's very interesting about the current environment that we're working in, I certainly miss having dinners with R&D leaders and some of our key customers, but I'm actually probably in more frequent connections with many of those different customers. And I'm just really optimistic if you look at what is driving the road map going forward as I talked about power, performance, area and cost. We have deep visibility. And the reason we have deep visibility into what's happening at 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer is because we're co-developing the next-generation transistor structures with customers. The wiring speed is also incredibly important for customers and driving the next nodes from a memory perspective. All of those areas, we have very, very, very deep engagements and deep insight into what those architectures will look like. And we've never been in a better position.
When we look at all of the N-plus nodes, I would say, and certainly in foundry and logic, we will continue to grow our etch business. We're in a great position with the Sym3 Y. We're delivering higher yield with that technology on the most critical steps for those customers. So we're in a great position to continue to outperform there. In inspection and measurement, we have 2 new platforms that we've launched that we're really in the early innings relative to that particular adoption. And then also we have the synergy with our inspection measurement not only in driving our PDC business but accelerating our technology inside Applied's labs and also with customers with new materials and new structures. But when you really look at those next nodes and the materials, the integrated processes that we're delivering with customers, we've just never been in a better position. And I'm very, very optimistic. We have high visibility in terms of what those architectures will look like and also very high visibility in terms of our position.",324

As a follow-up to the last question, it's good to see the strong traction in process control, especially in optical and e-beam inspection. I think that's about a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion market opportunity, and it's actually a pretty sticky part of the market. So what are the differentiators that are enabling the team to win here? And then on the metrology side, again, about another $1 billion market opportunity for discrete platforms. Any plans for the Applied team to try and intersect this market opportunity longer term as well?",97

Thanks for the question. So if you look at our PDC business, this year, this fiscal year will be significantly over $1 billion if you look at our systems and service business in PDC. And as I said in the prepared remarks, a greater than 40% growth rate. And there really are 2 things, I think, that are really important with PDC. One is the PDC growth, and I'll talk about that here in just a minute. But also our ability to accelerate the PPAC road map within Applied, on our technologies and also with customers.
So if you look at the PDC growth, there are really 2 major drivers this year. One is a new optical inspection system. And we've already generated several hundred million dollars of revenue with that new optical inspection system, and it's ramping at multiple leading customers. And we're certainly still in the very early innings with the adoption of that new system. And it's really targeted towards line monitoring, where you have multiple inspection points in a fab. And in some of the leading customers driving the PPAC road map, we have pretty extensive adoption already of that new optical inspection system.
And then the other technology that we've introduced this year is a new e-beam technology that has the highest resolution electron optics in the market today. It's about 60% higher resolution from an e-beam perspective and also has very fast imaging. So that particular technology, when you think about driving the PPAC road map with gate-all-around, or one customer I had dinner with in March was talking about nanosheets, and the ability to have a very, very high correlation with this higher resolution imaging capability in developing those future transistor technologies, and the same thing is true in the memory devices or new interconnects like selective tungsten, all of those areas, having this unique capability is really important relative to driving the technology road map going forward. And that particular technology, we have thousands of e-beam products and columns in the field today. But that higher resolution, you can almost think about it, EUV versus previous products with a wavelength reduction. It is an enabling foundation for our e-beam leadership for the next decade. So that will proliferate across all of our different platforms.
So really, those are the 2 things that are driving our business this year. But also the synergy with our process businesses has also never been better inside our labs and also with customers. So those are the 2 areas we're driving and I think really in the early innings of continuing to drive value in both of those different areas.",444

Harlan, so a little color on the $650 million. We talked about $650 million of unmet demand in our fiscal Q2. That was across all device types, spread out between foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM. And in the most recent quarter, our fiscal Q3, as you heard in one of the previous answers, our operations team, supply chain team, logistics team and our supply chain partners have just done an amazing job in a difficult environment, making much better progress than we originally thought 3 months ago. And so we've got a significant chunk of that $650 million that was satisfied in fiscal Q3.
We've got more to go. Our expectation is, is all of that will be in the rearview mirror exiting our fiscal Q4. And our fiscal Q1, which is calendar Q4, is going to be a first look-through of true end market demand across our markets. And what has me encouraged is, as I look at that true look-through of end market demand and seeing the strength we have across our businesses just gives me confidence that we're continuing to see a strong environment by our customers and strong demand and pull for the innovation we're bringing to market to enable their technology road maps.
And I guess the last point I'd make on this is, we made comments on our call 3 months ago about the strong backlog that we are carrying into Q3. Not only did we satisfy a significant chunk Of that end market demand in our fiscal Q3, we're entering our fiscal Q4 with the company's backlog virtually unchanged. And so it's a strong endorsement of the strong environment we continue to find ourselves in.",281

How much of that strength is coming from the fact that DRAM is more getting logic-like in terms of process? All I'm trying to figure out is, can this DRAM success be translated into NAND or is NAND a whole different beast?",55
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3666.0,2162211.0,84953240.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,28,"Yes. This is Gary. So certainly, high-speed memory is a big focus for a number of different customers. So like we said on the high-k metal gate technologies, those are areas where we have significant leadership and that's helping to drive our DRAM business. And also in etch, we've grown our etch business a significant amount in DRAM. If you look at the conductor etch, we gained almost 30 points of conductor etch share in DRAM since 2016 with the Sym3 platform, so really good drivers there. And as these new high-speed memories are adopted and ramped up in the next technology node, it puts us in a really good position to continue to outperform from a DRAM perspective.
And in NAND, you have different drivers, but it really still is about scaling the number of layers going vertical. And we have a number of very innovative films, different compounds that are being adopted in the next-generation NAND devices. So the combination of those very, very high selectivity films with our etch products position us to perform well also in NAND.
And the other thing I would say, really, the other thing I would say, and I talked about this a little bit earlier is, Kokusai will be definitely additive to Applied overall from a memory perspective. If you think back over the last several years, we've grown our memory business share of total spend for both NAND and DRAM from the mid-teens to 20% or more in those different segments. We believe we're very well positioned in both NAND and DRAM going forward. And certainly, Kokusai will add to that overall performance.",273

That makes sense, Gary. And then as a follow-up, your semiconductor business is getting less cyclical these days, but display is still very deeply cyclical. So I'm kind of curious, how important is display to the long-term strategic rationale of the company?",43

Thanks a lot for the question. As we think about the display business, Krish, we see display as a great opportunity to take a core technology into adjacent markets, drive enhanced revenue and cash flow for the company. And as we sit here today, we know we're at a cyclical bottom. The market continues to bounce along the bottom. We do think there's opportunities going forward for this market to go structurally larger off the levels that we're at now. What we're seeing in the current environment is a strengthening post the initial stages of COVID that give us some confidence as we look into 2021. And then as we take a look at the technology inflections on the horizon, OLED coming to TV, foldable flexible displays coming to the handset, both of those technology inflections being more capital-intensive than the current generation of technologies, we think there's some growth on the horizon in this market. So it's a great way to take core technology and monetize it in an adjacent market to drive enhanced revenue and cash flow for the company.",183

Can you give a little bit of color of how Applied can continue to outperform? You mentioned process control, conductor etch. You have new technologies like you mentioned gate-all-around, nanowires and others. Can you, I guess, maybe provide a little more color in terms of some of the opportunities, maybe a little more on the conductor etch side, but also in your core deposition businesses as well.",83
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3666.0,2162211.0,84953246.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,34,"Okay. Thanks for the question, Patrick. Well, that's a very broad one, but let me say this. I deeply believe, and I love the technology, I love interacting with R&D leaders for our customers. And I would just say, and you see this dynamic in the marketplace driving power, performance, area, cost faster than others, low power, higher performance at a better cost is really the key focus for all of our customers. And I talk a lot about what drives the road map going forward. It really is about new architectures, new structures, interconnect structures. Certainly, that includes gate-all-around, but there are other technologies that we're working on that are really, really, really important for customers, new interconnect technologies so that you reduce the resistance in the wiring. That's also a key, key driver for all of our customers, new ways to connect the chips together from a packaging standpoint, all of the new materials that we're bringing to market. So there are a number of those different areas that are super important relative to driving the PPAC road map going forward.
And I would say that one thing that I'm just so encouraged with, our portfolio, when you look at creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing, connecting devices and structures, there's no one that can do all of those different things. And even if you look at FinFET today, I've talked about a technology where we integrate together multiple products or multiple different chambers on a single platform under vacuum to manage interfaces where we can improve leakage current far beyond what exists today. So you think about improving the leakage current or a 10% improvement in drive current, that is incredibly, incredibly important.
And that particular technology, again, is an integrated materials solution. It works in FinFET. And I think there's a high probability you'll see that coming to market sometime in the next year for some of our customers. That technology can also work in gate-all-around or nanosheets. Again, there are just a number of different areas where we're driving innovation. We announced recently selective tungsten, which is kind of like atomic layer 3D printing, to increase the diameter of the wire to reduce the resistance. That is a really big technology development for our customers driving the PPAC road map forward.
And the other thing I talked about, combining these things together with the highest resolution electron beam imaging capability in the industry and proprietary algorithms where you can -- and very high-speed imaging. So you can image thousands of points on a wafer, look at the key technologies that are being developed, look at the spatial distributions and dial in your process windows for all of those new technologies lightning fast with a combination of massive, unique, actionable insight and data analytics and machine learning that we have developed within Applied, those are really game-changer technologies. So it's really a combination of many of those enabling, creating materials and films; shaping, modifying, we have many unique technologies; the analyzing, many unique technologies. The combination of those things together also means that we're strategically connected to customers in a very unique way. We have unique insights into their future technology nodes, their future architectures, the critical challenges that customers are facing. And the pull, Patrick, that we have from our customers has never been stronger.",558

And it seems like more than half of the growth in overall WFE this year is coming from indigenous China. And I guess my question is, can you update us on the $9.5 billion that you were sort of implying last call? And really like bigger picture here, it sounds like there really wasn't any impact from the recent military end-use stuff. And my question really is, can you talk about the discussions you've had with Commerce? I mean, they expanded regulation, yet it had 0 impact. So sort of whether the tone of the discussions tells you that this is it for a while or whether there could be a further effort to additionally and truly restrict access?",133

Tim, thanks for the question. I'll start off and then Dan can answer the market size question. So relative to the geopolitical question, I'm not going to speculate on any future actions that can take place. But really, what we've seen today is similar and consistent with what we previously discussed. We've assessed the rules. And as we had discussed in our last call, we continue to see no meaningful impact on our business. And so I'll also let Dan answer the overall market question.",86

Thanks, Gary. So as we think about the market in China, domestic China market, off of a baseline of about $6.5 billion in 2019, we've been saying for several quarters now that we see $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental spend. And a couple of quarters ago, I think, or last quarter, we said we're going to be at the high end of that range. And so we're at about $9.5 billion of spend. It's pretty consistent with how we viewed that market for several quarters now. And as I think about the profile of spend in China, we do see slow, steady development of ecosystems, investment in technology road maps. You see modest capacity additions behind that. You probably see a little more capacity this year. But it's not a lot more. It's a little more. And we see spend across 200-, 300-millimeter geometries. You see from a device-type standpoint, investment in foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND. So it's really a balanced profile of spend and slow, steady development of their ecosystem, but no real change in the profile as we viewed the market for several quarters now.",189

Joe, so that's the great thing about what we see today is, we still see investments in technology transitions of our customers. We still don't see nor do we see in the back half of the year a big spike from a capacity standpoint. And one of the things that we're really encouraged about given the performance of our business relative to the market opportunity, we're growing stronger than the overall market. It just shows us that we're well positioned from an innovation standpoint to deliver key enabling technologies for our customers and their road map.

If I heard your prepared comments, I think you said that you didn't see a big shift in the mix between foundry/logic and memory as we head into 2021. I just, one, wanted to confirm that. And two, I guess I'm surprised by that comment because I think we've all been looking for probably better capacity addition next year in memory. And if the mix stays the same, it feels like maybe we're not going to get it. So I was hoping you could expand on your thoughts on memory, particularly from a capacity perspective looking into calendar '21.",108

Quinn, so what we're seeing in the market is continued investment from a technology road map standpoint. We see strength in the market from a proportion of spend this year. We see more of the spend going to foundry/logic. Over 55% of the aggregate spend is going to be foundry/logic-related. We see memory growing a little more than foundry/logic this year. And as we window into 2021 from a proportion of spend, it feels very similar to what we're seeing this year. It's continued strength on our foundry/logic customers. We see it being more than 55% of the spend next year in 2021.
And what I would say about the industry is, if we go back to 2017, 2018, technology transition in the industry, concurrent investment in planar and 3D technologies, new architectures. I would say there was an inefficient level of spend as it relates to bit addition to the industry. I think you're seeing a much more efficient spend profile. Over time, we see capital intensity rising, but you're seeing a much more efficient bit production out of CapEx that's going into the industry.
The other thing I'd say is, we've got a very balanced portfolio from a share standpoint across all device types. We're a very balanced company and we're fairly agnostic to where customers want to spend, whether it's foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM. I think we're set up to perform well in all of those environments given our broad portfolio. So we'll watch the market and we'll continue to update every quarter on what we're seeing.",260

Again, our comments reflect the continued pursuit of technology road maps. And all we're doing is reflecting the strength of our business. And we talked about the first half of the calendar year, calendar year 2020 over the first half of calendar year '19. Our DRAM business is up 20%. Our NAND business is up 14%. Over the last couple of quarters sequentially, 2 quarters ago, memory was up for us 24%. Most recent quarter, up almost 17%. We're seeing sequential performance in both NAND and DRAM. And so it's more of a comment of what we're seeing and the demand for our business as our customers roll out their technology road maps. In an environment where technology road maps define the cost structure of our customers, it's costly per bit.
