251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3231.0,937136.0,39925036.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by commenting on Applied Materials' results and talk about our outlook and longer-term strategic goals. Then I'll share our views on the market and what this means for us in 2016. I'll conclude with my thoughts on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and describe how we're optimizing the company's performance and delivering strong shareholder returns.
In both semiconductor and Display, we see dramatic technology changes taking place. When we look at the advances our customers are making, materials innovation is at the heart of these changes. I believe this creates great opportunities for us. We have the broadest and deepest talent and technology to enable the materials innovation that will drive the semiconductor and Display industries forward.
Our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that make major technology inflections possible. Our strategy is working, and I'm pleased with our progress. We are turning the investments we've made in new products into profitable growth.
When I look at our Q1 results and our outlook for 2016, there are 4 main drivers of our performance. First, our leadership businesses, including epi, PVD, implant, CMP and RTP, have high market share and unique capabilities. I see these businesses delivering critical enabling technology that our customers need to drive significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10-nanometer devices.
Second, our high-growth businesses, etch and CVD, are winning substantial market share as the 3D NAND inflection and materials-enabled scaling accelerates.
Third, we are delivering sustainable growth in service. 2015 was a record year for service revenue, and in Q1, we booked our highest orders ever.
And finally, we are growing beyond semiconductor, specifically in Display. When I meet with leading display companies, it is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED. This plays to our strengths and significantly expands our market.
Now let's turn to our market outlook. Like everyone, I'm mindful of the current global economic risks. Even in this environment, we believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending levels will be similar to 2015. We are seeing industry investment focused on technology inflections, including 10-nanometer and 3D NAND as well as increased spending in China.
For our customers, the inflection-driven investments in foundry, Logic and memory are highly strategic. We have been witnessing a fierce battle for leadership in these new device technologies. When I talk to customers about their major competitive challenges, they talk about how critical it is to hit the right timing for major technology transitions.
In foundry, we believe 2016 investment levels will be more or less the same as last year. We anticipate that the majority of spending will be for the 10-nanometer node, which will be heavily weighted towards the second half of the calendar year.
In addition, we see a broadening of foundry spending and some shifts in customer mix, shifts that I believe are very favorable to us. In memory, we see NAND investment up about 25% year-on-year as more customers ramp 3D NAND technology. Our available market at a 3D NAND factory is up to 3x greater compared to traditional planar technology.
2015 was a year of heavy DRAM investment, with the highest level of spending in 5 years. This year, we expect DRAM investment to be down around 20% coming off this high. And in logic, we expect investment to be relatively flat year-on-year. 
Within the global environment, I look at China as a very significant opportunity. In China, we are seeing growth in revenue and orders, both from Chinese manufacturers as well as multinational customers who are expanding their footprints.
I believe that Applied is very well positioned. We were the first company in our industry to establish a presence in China more than 30 years ago. Today, we have strong customer relationships and great talent to support the new projects that are ramping there.
Now that I've given you this background on the market environment, I would like to talk about the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. In semiconductor equipment, I'm pleased with our momentum. Technology changes are moving the market to our sweet spot in materials engineering. And this means that our served market is now 60% of total wafer fab equipment. We are investing more than ever in innovation and unique products to accelerate materials-enabled scaling for our customers. I like how our future pipeline is shaping up, and we have very strong pull for our latest technology.
We are projecting that 40% of our 2016 revenue will come from products that we launched in the last 3 years. In 2015, we believe that we made solid share gains in wafer fab equipment, with almost all of our major businesses growing or maintaining their market position. I expect that 2016 will be an even stronger year for us.
In service, we aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We've done this by bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver more value with our service products. The changes we've made to our strategy drove record performance in 2015, and we are now focusing on sustaining growth in this business.
Because demand for service is seasonal in nature, we believe year-on-year comparisons are helpful. Our Q1 revenues are up 7% compared with the same period last year. I also look at service contracts as another leading indicator of our future growth. If we look back to 2012 and 2013, the net number of tools under contract was not growing. In 2015, we added around 1,250 tools under contract, and I expect this to continue this momentum.
As I mentioned in Display, customers are also making strategic investments in new technology. We are seeing these investments accelerate particularly for OLED displays. The Display technology inflections significantly expand our available market.
For example, we project that our opportunity at an OLED factory is more than 3x larger than at a traditional amorphous silicon LCD factory. We have great opportunities and momentum in Display, and I'm excited about how we are positioned. Our Display business has grown consistently for the past 3 years, and we expect to deliver additional growth in 2016 and beyond.
To summarize, as I look ahead, I am confident about our future growth and performance. We are maintaining a positive outlook for Applied in 2016 because our customers are making strategic, inflection-driven investments that play to our strengths.
Our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities, are performing well as the market comes to the sweet spot of our technology. Our high-growth businesses, etch and CVD, are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND inflection accelerates, and we are delivering sustainable growth in service and Display.
Across the organization, we are focused on delivering enabling products and services and generating attractive returns for our shareholders. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance and priorities. Bob?",1179
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3231.0,937136.0,39925037.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Like Gary, I believe we're in a strong position to deliver profitable growth in 2016, as our customers invest in the technology road maps across semi and Display. Based on the demand outlooks of our customers, I believe we'll make significant progress this year towards our 2018 financial model, and we'll deliver very attractive cash returns to our shareholders. 
On the revenue line, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in semiconductor systems market share. While we expect the WFE market to be about the same size this calendar year, we believe our share of WFE will be higher. We expect our SAM share of WFE to expand this year as well. In fact, we believe it will be up 7 points compared to 2012. 
Our global services business is on track for a third consecutive year of growth, and we believe our Display business will grow for a fourth consecutive year. 
I'm also encouraged by the progress our teams are making on our gross margin initiatives, and I am still confident that we'll make additional progress in our second half. 
On the operating expense line, we are tightly controlling our discretionary spending, holding OpEx relatively flat, while strengthening R&D. We are making substantial R&D investments to deliver a strong pipeline of new products for emerging inflections. These products are already delivering revenue growth today. At the same time, we're reducing non-GAAP G&A to the lowest level in years. 
We made further progress with our tax structure, and I believe we're on track to lower the rate once again this year. We continued to be aggressive with the buyback program. We've repurchased 112 million shares over the past 3 quarters, which is equal to 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the program. 
So while 2016 is shaping up to be a flattish year for WFE, we believe Applied will outperform our markets, making significant progress towards our financial 2018 model and deliver very attractive cash returns for our shareholders. 
Next I'll make a few comments about the first quarter when we delivered financial results that were slightly better than our expectations. Revenue of $2.3 billion declined 5% sequentially, and we slightly increased our non-GAAP gross margin to 42.4%. We held non-GAAP operating expenses within the range, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, slightly above the midpoint of the range. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We used $625 million to repurchase 35 million shares of our stock. We have completed 65% of the $3 billion authorization, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with the program. We also repaid $800 million in short-term debt and redeemed a $400 million bond scheduled to mature in June. 
Turning to the segments. Silicon Systems orders will 12% lower sequentially. Within the mix, only DRAM orders were higher. Our silicon backlog remained healthy at $1.6 billion. And while revenue declined in Q1, we believe our demand will increase in Q2 and the second half. Our AGS orders reached $773 million and set another all-time quarterly record. AGS sequential revenue was slightly lower, consistent with seasonal patterns. Our Display orders were down 6% sequentially, but remained up year-over-year. Our Display revenue increased 12% sequentially. Bear in mind the Display orders and revenue will continue to be lumpy. EES turned a modest profit even as revenue remained at low levels. 
Now I'll provide our business outlook for Q2. We believe our overall net sales will be up by 5% to 10% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect Silicon Systems net sales will be up by 11% to 17%. AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect our Display net sales to be down by 20% to 30%, and EES net sales should be approximately $55 million. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. And we plan to hold non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $565 million plus or minus $10 million. 
We are forecasting a Q2 non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and we believe non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. 
So in summary, we see 2016 as a year when a broad range of our customers invest in leading-edge technology across semi and Display. Our investments have put us in a position to grow our served market revenue, share and earnings. While we're mindful of the macroeconomic concerns, we believe 2016 will be a strong year for Applied Materials.

So given your outlook for you guys to outgrow WFE and where you are in terms of backlog in the orders in the quarter, the math seems to work that orders should be up at least 20%, 25% into the April quarter and then rising through the back half of the year. Is that kind of the framework you're looking for? And I guess within that, how should we be thinking about mix between foundry, logic, memory through the year?",89

The -- we're not giving any specific orders guidance, but we have said we do believe that the second half is stronger than the first half. We do believe that the first half is a little bit more weighted to NAND, whereas the second half is more weighted to stronger performance in foundry, logic and DRAM. So we do see a stronger second half. And incrementally, we see strong performance for Applied in the second half because of our position on VNAND throughout the year and also foundry in the 10-nanometer conversion. So we think the second half does feel more positive than the first half, and our position's pretty good in the second half.",123

We said on the last call that Q -- first half of fiscal '16 would be flattish with the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 when we did 42.2%. We did 42.4% in first quarter this year. We're guiding to about the same in Q2. So we're a little above what we felt we were a quarter ago, and we still believe that the second half is up from the first half. We said that in the last call that it would be a 200-basis-point-roughly increase from first half to second half. We think the full year is still positive as we said. We think we exit the year -- we think we're up in the second half. But given that we're a little ahead of plan in the first half, I don't know that there's a 200 basis point improvement from first half to second half.",147

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3231.0,937136.0,39925045.0,Question,Toshiya Hari,,Analysts,11,"I have 2 questions as well. The first one is regarding memory CapEx. Just given the recent pricing dynamics in memory, are you worried at all about DRAM and NAND CapEx in the back half of the year? Or do you think the pending projects are strategic enough for your customers to spend according to plan?",56
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3231.0,937136.0,39925046.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,12,"So generally, we think that this year is sort of flattish with last year. With last year, it was like 31.5% to 32%. But the year is a good year for Applied Materials, because if you look at the spending this year, we kind of think foundry, logic are flattish, but the mix within foundry and logic spending in terms of what they're buying and customer profile is very good for Applied. The second things is within memory, we think memory DRAM's down about 20%, and we think flash is up about 25%. And the predominant spending in flash is VNAND, so the transition on VNAND is particularly good for Applied on 3 levels. One, the absolute level of the greenfield spending for first and second-generation VNAND is higher than the absolute spending for planar NAND. The second thing is that the reuse, where they were doing a lot of reuse on the shrink on planar is significantly less than first- and second-generation VNAND, and particularly around tools that we sell. And thirdly, we're gaining on the transition. So I think that the mix within the year in place for Applied, in terms of our concern, we think the 31.5%-type number maybe a little more on the year is a fair estimate. And we think we've taken the risk you've referenced into account.",223

The second one is regarding your Display business. I know, Gary and Bob, you both touched on this. But can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of order trends, primarily in China today? And how big the OLED opportunity could be for you guys in 2017 and beyond, I'm guessing primarily in Korea?",61

The OLED is a great opportunity for Applied. We've talked about the increase in the total available market. They're added CVD, PVDs, thin film-encapsulation steps. So if you do a comparison to amorphous silicon LCD, the total available market is up by about a factor of 3 for us. In Display, we've talked about 2016 we're anticipating being a fourth consecutive year of growth. And based on everything we're seeing, we're on track to either hit or exceed the 2018 model that we published for Display previously. So Display, we have tremendous momentum and, certainly, OLED is -- especially in mobile, is a huge opportunity for us. The other thing I would say is that this is really a great proof of our ability to expand materials engineering into adjacent markets.",132

I'll take a shot at that. The -- so if you look at -- the disconnect is, we think that NAND is stronger in the second half than the first half, and we think there's an increase in traction around VNAND -- I'm sorry, NAND is stronger in its first half than second half. And you'd say, why did you have bigger DRAM orders and not NAND? We had already booked some. If you go look back at Q3, Q4 of 2015, we had very large bookings, and some of those were VNAND bookings. Secondly, we see increasing traction. So if you see why we're beating in Q2, it's around 2 things, in particular, it's around China and a wider proliferation of VNAND. So we do see the momentum on VNAND, and we're pretty comfortable that it's going to happen.",141

Through the end of calendar '15, 150,000 had been converted. We think cumulatively through the end of '16, there's going to be 350,000 to 400,000. So through the end of '16, 400,000 to 1.4 million available have been converted. We think most of those get converted over time. This year, we think NAND spending is about $8.7 million. And we think it's sustained at pretty good levels for the next 3 years for this conversion. Does this stay that high? I'm not sure. But it's a pretty healthy number.",103

First, Bob, if I look at service, orders have been pretty meaningfully above revenue for about a year now. And I thought that service usually had like a 1-year contract.

And so it's a win-win both ways. In terms of how you recognize it through the revenue plan, it is happening -- a couple of things are happening though in the quarter. One, you did have the Chinese new year, and a little bit of slowdown started up earlier in Q1. So we book a lot of contracts typically in Q1, but the revenue's -- it's not a high-revenue quarter. And fab utilization was okay in the quarter. So in terms of tactical sales of spares and services, not super high. And then 200-millimeter tools are in that number too, and those go up and down a little bit.",147

Regarding our current strategy, we like our current strategy. The outlook for '16, we think, is very strong. And beyond '16, we also believe that there's great opportunities for growth. We have a strong position in transistor and interconnect, as foundry and logic moves to the new technology nodes; very strong pull for etched deposition tools also, especially in the memory space, but certainly, in patterning and future technology nodes. We're growing service, growing the Display business. And we believe that's sustainable growth in those markets. So overall, we're making tremendous progress towards the 2018 model. And we're optimistic about growth opportunities for Applied, especially when you look at what's driving this year and what's going to drive the future. You have 10-nanometer that is really based on materials -- new materials, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, new memory technologies, organic LED displays. All of those areas are enabled by materials innovation where Applied has clear leadership. And we think this is a -- we're in the early innings of these changes in driving materials-enabled scaling. So I am personally very optimistic about growth for Applied Materials. Relative to M&A, our strategy continues to be pretty much the same. We continue to look for good opportunities, but we're very selective in what we look at. There's 3 criteria: financial returns; strategic alignment with -- especially with our materials-engineering technologies; and does the company have an opportunity for leadership in whatever segments that they're in. So those are the 3 things we look at. Certainly, we keep looking for opportunities, but I am very confident about our growth opportunities. And we are definitely not needy relative to M&A.",279

So clearly, there's a lot of activity in China. We see investments by both multinational companies and domestic companies. Applied has a very strong position in China. We were the first company to build capability there about 30 years ago, very strong team, very strong capability, very good relationships and positions with both the Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are moving to China. So we would look at this as certainly a incrementally very good opportunity in 2016. But I would -- my feeling is that this is certainly not just a 2016-story that there's a great opportunity going forward. And for Applied, we're very, very well positioned.",122

We segment it a couple of ways. One, we talk about historically, between TVs and smaller screens. And the smaller screens, historically, have been split between OLED and non-OLED. Last year, mostly what we sold was OLED, with sort of the encapsulation tools over OLED like. We talked about bookings last year of $150 million. Many people in the mainstream media speculate that there'll be a more rapid transition, particularly on the small screens to OLED. We are pretty well positioned for that. In terms of the split of revenues, we said earlier in the year that our spit of revenues that we were projecting for this year between small screens and larger screens, TVs and small screens, I think we're like 60% for the small mobile devices and about 40% for the others, mostly TVs. If anything, we think we're better positioned if there's an inflection that goes more stronger in OLED. So over time, we think there's probably more and more of that. Now put in perspective, we are much better positioned than we were several years ago there in terms of products and breadth of products. And there's about twice as many layers on an OLED devices than LED screens. So I think, we're very well positioned. The inflection seems to be happening, but we haven't talked specific numbers. And it won't hit our revenue line right away because these tools take about 9 months to build.",241

If you go look at why it would be up from the first half to the second half, it would be because -- some of foundry mix, some cost reduction is helping us, and some is maturing of new tools.

It's a little bit different mix down at the small screen size, a little lower gross margins. Now as we mature our positions there, they should get pretty good.

Let me see if I can do this efficiently. Our customers tend to think of these as sister nodes now, sort of 20, 16, 14 and then 10, 7. They do the interconnect stuff more on the first leg, and they do the transistor stuff more on the second leg. So they think of them as -- they tend to ramp quickly through the first leg, whether it be 20 or 10, to get to 16, 14 or 7, all right? And so my guess, 10 will be a long node. They are always going to start doing parallel work on 7. And so it won't be a long node. The total node of 10, 7, the sister, might be an attractive node. But they got to get to 7, okay? That' step 1 and 2. In terms of comparing 20 slash 16, 14 to 10, 7, there are differences. You have to look at what the backfill is from the previous node on a lot of stuff. So if you look at 20-nanometer, the chips interconnect, but it was the last planar transistor. It wasn't a FinFET, right? So that -- the attractiveness in terms of processing power and battery, processing speed and battery is a lot better on a FinFET. So you didn't have a lot of people pulled to go to 20. They waited till 16. You don't have that disadvantage when you're going from 16 to 10. So there will be a lot of tapeouts still coming at 16 from people who went from 28 and so forth. So that you're not going to have this backfill gap you had at 20. So point number one, 10, 7 are probably attractive. They get through 10 pretty aggressively. You won't have as big a gap as you had at 20 because 16 will backfill, and tapeouts will increase.",312

That total authorized buyback was $3 billion through the end of fiscal Q1. We've done $1.950 billion, so we have $1.050 billion left under the existing authorization. The way we execute the authorization is we look at multiple valuation metrics for the company, and we set up a table, this is if the stock price is attractive based on frankly longer-term metrics. Then we will buy stocks. So we've pretty aggressively bought stock the last 3 quarters. We started to get a little bit tight on U.S.-sourced cash in September. So what we did was we were able to trigger home some $800 million of cash as a repatriation of capital without paying tax. And secondly, we raised some money through debt. So right now, about 50% of our cash is on shore at the end of the fiscal quarter. So we think we have enough cash to execute the buyback. And then if we want to continue, we are committed to long-term cash returns to shareholders through dividends and buyback. If we want to continue to buy back after permission with the board, we believe we can find other sources of cash.",194

I'm very pleased to report that we are making great progress with all the major elements of our strategy and expect to deliver record earnings in fiscal 2016. We are focusing our investments on key customer inflections that are growing Applied Materials today and creating exciting opportunities for future growth. Our record performance is made possible by the outstanding team we have at Applied. I want to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous passion to create value for our customers and shareholders.
I'll begin today's call by summarizing our strong results and outlook in the context of our longer-term strategy for sustainable profitable growth. Then I will outline our updated view on the market environment and what this means for us. I'll conclude with a short summary of progress in each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and the improvements we're making to the company's operating performance.
At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering, products and services that make technology inflections possible. In semiconductor and display, the substantial changes in device technology that are taking place require significant materials innovation. I believe this puts Applied in a unique position. We have the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering, and our technology is unmatched. These advantages are helping us deliver the innovations that enable our customer success and move the industry forward.
In recent years, we shifted $400 million of annual spending to improve our organizational capabilities and accelerate product development. Today, these investments are creating significant value for our customers and for Applied. When I look at our results and outlook, there are 5 key drivers of our performance I'd like to highlight.
First, in semiconductor, our leadership businesses are delivering key enabling technology for logic and foundry customers. These businesses have high market share and highly differentiated products and are benefiting from robust levels of foundry investment in the second half of the year.
Second, our growth businesses are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND ramp accelerates. Our combined etch and CVD revenues for Q2 are at a 9-year high. 
Third, we are very well positioned in China. Domestic Chinese manufacturers are ramping up their investments, and multinational customers are expanding their footprint in the region. As a result, we are setting new records for quarterly semiconductor orders in China. 
The fourth driver is our sustained growth in service, where we are building upon 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. 
And fifth, we are successfully applying our advanced materials engineering capabilities beyond semiconductor, specifically in display. New display technologies such as OLED are enabled by materials innovation. This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied.
I'll now give you our latest views on the market environment. While we're paying close attention to the global economy, at Applied, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. This is because our semiconductor and display customers are focused on developing and ramping new technologies rather than simply building capacity. The inflection-driven investments our customers are making are highly strategic. They are battling for leadership and investing to ensure that they're ready as market demand shifts to these new technologies. 
In foundry, we expect investment levels for the year to be similar to 2015. We anticipate more than half of 2016 spending will be focused on the 10-nanometer node as well as 7-nanometer pilot production. 
In addition, as new projects ramp in China, we see the foundry customer mix broadening and increasing investment in trailing geometries. This is positive for Applied because we have a 30-year history of leadership in China, and we've built very strong customer relationships and a great regional team there. 
This quarter, our revenues in China are at an all-time high. In memory, we expect overall spending to be more or less flat year-on-year. However, there are important changes in the mix that play well for Applied. Investment is shifting from DRAM to NAND, and we see DRAM down at least 25%, following very high investment levels in 2015. 
In contrast, we see NAND strengthening as the year progresses. Our latest [indiscernible] will be 35% higher than 2015 as multiple customers accelerate their 3D NAND ramps. 3D NAND is a great example of materials-enabled scaling that plays directly to Applied's strengths. As I've said before, 3D NAND is all about depositing, removing and modifying materials with incredible precision. Because of this, our available market at a 3D NAND factory can be up to 3x greater than for planar NAND. In the quarter, we booked nearly $1 billion of NAND orders, which is a record for us. 
In logic, we believe the spending levels will be very similar to last year. And when we take all of these factors into consideration, we believe that 2016 wafer fab equipment investments will be similar to 2015, with some upside potential. 
I will now talk about the progress we're making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, I'm very pleased with our strategy and how our product pipeline is shaping up. We made solid wafer fab equipment share gains in 2015, even though the spending mix was not as favorable for us as it is in 2016. Based on the positions we're winning, I expect much stronger share gains this year. 
Across our semiconductor businesses, I see tremendous customer pull for our latest-generation products. In CMP, our new LK Prime system now has over 130 units at customer sites. This product is winning market share, resulting in our highest quarterly CMP orders for a decade. We are also seeing a broader adoption of cobalt in advanced interconnect schemes, and this is the driving demand for our cobalt CVD systems. This is one of the factors that is contributing to strong share gains in CVD this year. 
We continue to see rapid adoption of our Sym3 etch platform, launched at last year's SEMICON West. We project that we will ship around 700 chambers by the end of our fiscal year, fueling strong conductor etch share gains in 2016. I'm also very excited that customers are beginning to transition a number of our highly disruptive new technologies from pilot to high-volume manufacturing. These include our selective removal products and Olympia ALD system. 
In service, we are making significant investments in our organization and capabilities so that we can deliver more value to our customers. These investments are generating a strong pipeline of new service products that help customers improve their device performance, yield and costs. We're on track to grow this business for the third year in a row, which I believe is strong evidence that our service strategy is working. 
In display, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities and the unique position we have in this market. The major technology inflections that are taking place require materials innovation, so our available market is expanding significantly. One great example of this is thin film encapsulation that protects an OLED device from air and moisture. The precision deposition of this film stack is incredibly challenging and relies on Applied's advanced materials engineering capabilities. Overall, we estimate that our opportunity in OLED is more than 3x larger than for traditional LCD. 
I believe we're still in the very early innings of OLED, but we're already seeing a significant impact on our business. This quarter, our orders in display were an all-time record. 
To summarize, as I look ahead, I am increasingly confident that we are in a great position to drive sustainable, profitable growth at Applied Materials. Across the company, I believe we have greater opportunities and a stronger pipeline of enabling technologies than at any point in our history. We are investing more than ever to accelerate materials-enabled innovations for our customers. 
We are maintaining a very positive outlook for 2016 because our customers are making inflection-driven investments as they race to introduce new technologies. These investments are both highly strategic and play directly to Applied's strengths. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance and priorities. Bob?",1364
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 19, 2016",2016-05-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3665.0,989490.0,41844702.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Applied Materials is extremely well positioned to deliver profitable growth this year and for the foreseeable future. In Q2, we generated orders of $3.5 billion, the highest in 15 years. Our strength was led by Silicon Systems, which had $2 billion in orders, with nearly half from NAND; and by Display, which had record orders of $700 million. 
Our backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, and it's broad-based, with nearly half in Silicon Systems and roughly 1/4 each in services and Display. Our Silicon Systems backlog is the highest in at least 9 years. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the investments we're making in differentiated products and services, combined with our cost-efficiency programs, will drive record earnings. And I expect sustained performance as we help our customers drive their technology road maps forward, particularly in foundry, NAND and advanced displays. We have momentum in services, and we're improving our execution and operational performance across the board. 
Today, I'm increasingly [ph] confident that we're on track to achieve the earnings targets in our 2018 financial model. I'll provide a detailed update at our Analyst Day in September, but with the disruptive nature of our order strength, I'd like to give you some insights during this call. 
We're making very good progress growing our revenues. If recent demand patterns continue, which seems likely, then, by 2018, I believe we can meet or exceed our targets in Silicon Systems [indiscernible] and services. 
Through 2018 and beyond, we believe Display, NAND and China will grow by more than we anticipated last year, and our positions in these growth areas are becoming stronger. I'm also confident that we will meet or exceed our goals for tax rate, weighted average share count and earnings per share. 
Relative to gross margins, [indiscernible] progress on our overall cost structure and on optimizing the gross margins within our product lines. Even as our etch and Display businesses strengthen this year, I believe we can hold our overall gross margins flat with last year. 
Over the model horizon, we now see faster-than-expected growth in etch and Display. The net profitability gains from this revenue growth should be very positive for us, and we're committed to achieving our operating margin targets, even with the impact of this mix change on our overall gross margin percentage. 
Regarding operating expenses, Gary outlined how we are gaining share in our existing markets and expanding our served addressable markets with strong customer pull. Today, several of our customers are asking us to develop new technologies to support their product road maps, and we are choosing to increase our R&D investments in certain areas this year, notably, in Display. 
As we ramp up to support these new projects, we expect OpEx to increase by about $10 million sequentially in Q3 and stay at this level in Q4. At the same time, we'll continue to be very aggressive in controlling and optimizing our spending to invest in sustainable revenue growth while increasing our profitability. 
Let me give you some insights into how we've optimized our operating expenses. Between 2012 and 2015, we cut spending in G&A organizations by 27%. In the same period, we boosted the funding of new and disruptive products by $400 million. We did this by using G&A savings to fund R&D and by shifting spending from underperforming areas like solar to areas where we can grow and gain share by enabling major technology inflections. 
Today, our R&D-to-OpEx ratio is 67%, which is up by over 10 points relative to 2012. 
Now I'll comment on our second quarter results. Revenue of $2.5 billion was at the high end of the guidance range, led by Silicon Systems. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.7% was slightly higher than expected. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $575 million were within the range. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined to 14.4% as more profits were generated in lower tax jurisdictions. We believe 15% is an achievable rate for the balance of the year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was the highest in 4 years and the highest in 8 years when excluding solar. 
Next, I'll update you on our cash returns during the period. In Q2, we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. We used $900 million to repurchase over 45 million shares of our stock and paid $113 million in cash dividends. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion shares outstanding, which is the level we targeted in our 2018 model. 
We have now completed 95% of the $3 billion authorization we announced last April, and we expect to complete the program in the current quarter. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders using dividends and buybacks, and we plan to discuss the buyback program with the Board of Directors at our upcoming meeting. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me share some observations and expectations surrounding our Display business. Disruptive technology changes are happening in the Display market that will increase customer spending this year and beyond. 
In the TV market, while there is sufficient overall capacity at this time, we expect additional investments in certain regions. And longer term, I believe the technologies now being piloted in mobile will be attractive in TVs as well. Such adoption would be very positive for us. Today, customer demand for our Display products is increasing, particularly in mobile. As a reference point, over the past 3 years, our display orders were $750 million per year on average. 
Our display orders were $883 million in the first half of this year alone. The growth we're now seeing in Display comes largely from new products we have funded and developed over the past few years. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect Display order strength over the rest of 2016.
Most display systems are very large and often take 2 to 3 quarters to build, deliver, install and revenue. And customers are pulling for Applied to develop new Display technologies that I believe will significantly expand our market opportunities over the next several years. We'll invest in additional new and disruptive products to capture these opportunities.
And while our Display orders and revenues will continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, I believe we'll deliver sustainable growth over time. We'll have more to say about our display opportunities at our Analyst Meeting in September. 
Now I'll provide the business outlook for our third quarter. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 14% to 18% sequentially. Within the revenue outlook, we expect Silicon Systems net sales to be up by 10% to 15%. AGS net sales should be up by 5% to 8%. We expect Display net sales to be up by 70% to 90% to approximately $300 million. And EES net sales should be flat to up slightly. 
We are modeling the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be up by 50 to 100 basis point sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expense should be $585 million, plus or minus $10 million. The midpoint is up just 1.6% from the same period last year, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50. The midpoint is up 45% from this period last year. 
This EPS guidance represents a new record that is significantly above any previous performance for Applied Materials. 
To summarize, while overall economic and semiconductor industry conditions are relatively flat this year, Applied Materials is uniquely well positioned. We plan to set new records in a number of areas, including EPS for the full year. We've significantly biased our spending towards disruptive new products and customer support. And I believe we now have a great pipeline of new and emerging products focused on the key technology inflections. We also have strong customer pull in markets and regions that give us sustainable opportunities to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.

On the NAND business, very, very, very strong pull from customers, as NAND moves from litho-enabled scaling to materials-enabled scaling. So we see very strong pull for etch. We're gaining new steps in NAND; very, very strong performance. Overall, we believe this will be a strong year for our etch business. We'll gain share. And certainly, in 3D NAND, the growth there is significant. Deposition is another area. CVD is an area that's very, very strong in NAND. We have additional epi steps in NAND. There are many additional CMP steps. So there are a number of areas where there's really significant growth for us in 3D NAND. And we look at this as a wave that will continue over the next few years. So it's really a great opportunity for Applied, where our TAM is going up as you're moving from litho to materials, and we are also significantly increasing our share in 3D NAND.",163

So a couple of parts. So the first one is you talked about upside potential to flat WFE outlook. Would love to hear thoughts there. And then, as you think about growing share in etch, very favorable mix in terms of foundry and -- as well as China and what you're doing around 3D NAND. How should we think about your growth in calendar '16 relative to that flat to slightly up WFE outlook?",84

We agree it's flat to up a little bit this year. The year's unfolded as we hoped last November, and it's gotten better and better for us, frankly. If you all look at it, the NAND has picked up. We now think it's up about 35% year-on-year, whereas, DRAM's probably down about 25%. Foundry is not up a lot this year; up somewhat, but if you look at our position within foundry, it's really, really strong. And then DRAM, we're also gaining. So if you go look at our position with each, we're gaining share. I'll give you a factoid you may not have picked up on. Pre -- 2012, we were only over 15% share by the -- in 1 of the 4 major groups when you look at NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic. This year, we project to be over 20% in all 4. So if you look at the NAND spending at $9.2 billion, our share's going to go probably from under 15% to north of 20% this year, and the spending is up to about $9.2 billion, whereas in the base year of 2012 it was about $4.2 billion. So the market's up, and our share's up significantly. And the NAND's strength goes on for a number of years. As you know, by the end of this year, we're only going to have about 375,000 wafer starts converted. There's about another 1 million wafer starts out there are planar. If you go look at foundry, we anticipate it being a reasonable year in foundry, but our position's done really well, whether it's in Taiwan or a lot of the activity going on in China. So we're gaining -- we're doing very strongly there, too. And then also, logic, we're doing well, leading into logic. So the way that the year's laid out, our positioning of our products in the markets that are fastest growing, whether it is NAND, strength in leading-edge foundry, strength in China and also strength in display, is playing very well for Applied. So we expect, within semi, we're gaining share this year.",359

I'll take the etch question. So as I said earlier, we think that 2016 is going to be a really strong year for us in growing our etch share. We have a very strong position, very, very strong position, in 3D NAND conductor etch. So as that business continues to grow as that wave moves forward over the next few years, we're in a really great position. And we have some of the most exciting products in this group that I've seen in my whole career. The Sym3, tremendous pull from customers in 3D NAND and also in other segments. We're winning new steps and strong pull, really, across the board for Sym3. So very, very, very strong position there. And also, in selective material removal, we have very strong pull for -- from customers. And that business is growing also for us at a strong rate. So overall, we think 2016 is going to be a great year for us in etch. And again, some of the strongest products I've seen in my career.",177

Just a question, Bob, on the comment that there may be Display order strength for the rest of 2016. Is the Display visibility from a follow-on order to a big Korean customer?

It just sounds like the message is AMAT's total orders could be strong in the second half of the year. Just trying to get some color on that.",83

There's several inflections going on. In displays, it's around OLED; in NAND, it's around VNAND. And even in the China thing, it’s going to go on for years; and the foundry's strength, we're seeing that 10 and 7's going to run the next couple of years. So these big inflections are going to go on for a number of years. So for instance, in Display, we think it's going to go on for a while. It's not a one-quarter event. And we see the concentration in mobile. In terms of your specific question on TVs, I guess, in China, was that a specific question?",127

I guess, Bob, I'm just looking at the upside to the orders, and it really seems like it was driven from, clearly, OLED and it looks like China memory stuff. So it seems like you're finally beginning to see some of these China memory projects move within your 12-month shipment window. So I guess my question really is, how much can China add to WFE say, next year? Because if you book like an incremental $400 million or $500 million this quarter from those projects, that would argue that you could add maybe a couple billion to WFE next year. So I'm wondering if that is -- if that math works with you.",116

Let me see if I get them both. First, in terms of the second quarter just ended, we were pretty strong across the board on orders. We had a very strong quarter, almost $1 billion, as Gary mentioned, in NAND. And then, in terms of the other devices, foundry, DRAM and logic, we were reasonably strong, actually, across the board. And display was very strong and services did well, too. So our strength was pretty broad. In terms of the China impact, the Chinese talked about spending $20 billion to $30 billion over the sort of 4 to 5 years. We're seeing record revenues for our sales in China this period. And it's gone up -- our expectations for the year have gone up every quarter, basically. So in terms of -- if they spend $20 billion to $30 billion over 4 or 5 years, how much is incremental? That's about $4 billion a year, roughly, $5 billion a year. I would say, for the next 3 years, you could see some -- maybe half of it incremental. I think it provides an underpinning for overall demand, so that you feel pretty comfortable that next year's probably a good 32 year, if you'd guess, because you got this underpinning of good NAND, good China. I think the second wave of 10s and 7s is okay. DRAM, I'm not sure about.",246

And as Bob said, the momentum just keeps building. We've doubled revenue in China over the last 2 years, and the -- I'm spending a fair amount of time there myself. And certainly, you look at what's happening there now and discussions for future projects, as Bob said, multiyear wave opportunity in terms of China. Hard to say exactly what the number would be, but it's definitely going to be up a fair amount.",100

And then, I guess, follow-up is I know, previously, you guys talked about 3D NAND installed target of like 350k to 400k industry-wide, actually, in this year.

On one hand, with the strong July guide, you've got arguably a tough comp. On the other hand, I did notice that your guidance -- your revenue growth guidance for July is well below your growth in your backlog, which kind of implies that sales should be strong for the balance of the year. So just how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus first half overall?",108

Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, and we said in the -- we're going to say it in the 10-Q, I'll say it right now, 73% of the backlog is shippable in the next 6 months. And then, if you look at it, on the semi side, the lead times on that stuff typically are not too long. On Display, we've said that the lead times historically have been 6 to 9 months. Now we're able to increase our outlook for Display revenues next quarter because we've primed to pump a little bit in the supply chain. So we're optimistic that Display can continue strong in revenues for the rest of the calendar year. So we are feeling pretty good that our second half will be up from first half and that we'll do well in the year. And the underpinnings that we talked about, our strength in Display where we have the orders in backlog and continue that strong. In semi, we have said we think that share gains goes up year, and this is in semi equipment. And services will get strong for the rest of the year. It will -- continue to be strong. And so we feel pretty good about the second half.",230

Right now, we're ramping a lot of things. We're ramping new products, we're ramping production. So we think, over time, as we basically said or implied in the financial model of the company, the Display operating margins for the company will be similar to the overall average for the company. Now both Display and AGS have a slightly different business model than SSG in that the gross margins tend to be a little higher in SSG, but the operating expense metrics are less in AGS and Display.

What we said earlier in the year, that of our Display business this year, over 60% was going to be mobile. And in fact, it's probably over 70% now. And the vast -- significant majority of that -- the great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate. In terms of what it revenues, we anticipate, as we guided, that our revenues will be up next quarter. We are positive about our revenue opportunity for Q4, and we think we'll do very well in Display next year, too.

So let me first also add to Bob's comments on Display, then I'll get to etch. So I really think it's important for people to understand, we're in the early innings of this opportunity in terms of the OLED wave. And relative to the questions on sustainability, if you look at the waves that are really driving our business in Display, NAND, China, we're in the early innings of all of those different waves. We are continuing to invest, and we've expanded our TAM by a factor of 3. We have an opportunity to expand our TAM more in the future. So that one, really very optimistic that we're going to continue to drive significant growth in Display going forward. And then, in etch, we're in a very strong position in etch to gain share in 2016 and beyond. As I said before, the products that we have, Sym3, selective material removal products, it's almost on a weekly basis, I hear new opportunities, very strong pull across the board, all customers for these new technologies. And so relative to 96 pairs or over-100 pairs, we have pull from customers in some of the most critical applications. We’re PTOR, DTOR in some of the most critical applications. So I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to continue to gain share in etch in 2016 and beyond.",225

That's a good question. We are working a lot on gross margins. Let me give you, we ran an analysis the other day you might find interesting. So the company gross margins, as you know, were 40.9% in 2012, 42.1% in '13, 44.1% in '14, and we were down a little bit, around 43% last year, I think. And we'll probably be about the same next year. I guess we were at 42.9% last year. And so I say, ""Will we make any traction or not?"" So I had the guys run all of our BUs and all of our segments with current gross margins by BU and segment with '14 mix. And if you take the '14 mix, when we earned 44.1%, the gross margins this year would be 44.7%, which is up 6/10 from then and north of our committed model of 44.6%. So what you see is within virtually all the product groups, and within exercises like cost reduction and negotiation, we're doing pretty well, actually. And it is, in fact, mix that's a challenge for us. So I do think that, as I said earlier, for instance, Display has a similar operating margin to the company but lower gross margins. In etch, we're doing great in terms of growing profitability and market share with a little lower gross margin also at this stage. So those are headwinds in our face this year, but we think we'll offset them and still hit the roughly 43% on the year that we said earlier in the year.",259

We do have other areas that we're working on, but we're not really ready to forecast or signal when those technologies will be ready. But I would say that, that team in Display is an incredible team of people. They've demonstrated that they can grow in these major inflections, and I'm very optimistic that this wave that we're seeing in Display, OLED, is a multiyear wave. And then I really believe that we have a great opportunity to not only ride that wave but expand our TAM and share in Display. So very, very optimistic about that business.",163

The annual trend, going back a few years to the half this year and a little bit projection in the next year. So if you looked at the trend there, you're correct that total foundry spending from '14 was down to '15, down -- sort of flat to up a little bit in '16. I don't have '13 in front of me. I think it was similar to -- oh, here's '13. That's not total, so -- oh, there it is. '13 was -- it was about the same. So '13, '14 about the same, down a little bit in '15, down a little bit in '16. So that's the annual trend. If you look at the year, we're pretty confident that foundry's strong on the second half, based on the timing and the specifics of it. Now what you have going on, which is a little different than -- a lot of people are concerned about sort of the dynamic of what happened in '14 going to '15 and what happens -- could happen in '16 going into '17. So if you go look at '14, when we turned down to '15, you sort of had a latent excess capacity, right? You had -- the 28-nanometer business had been purchased a year or 2 before capacity for a big phone manufacturer. And then a lot of the capacity was added very aggressively in '14 for 20-nanometer for the same phone customer, so that you had latent potential capacity there that hit us in '15. And that also hit us a little bit with another foundry customer who thought they could get some of the business. You don't have the same type of dynamic this year because you're in the very early stages of the build of 10 and 7 to the overbuild you had from the previous nodes, say, 28, in this case. You don't really have that as much from 14, 16. And thirdly, they haven't ramped that much on 10 at this point. In 2014 -- at the end of '14, they had about 100,000 wafer starts, total installed of 20,000. At the end of this year, on 10 alone, they might have 50,000, right? Well, 10 and 7 would be 55,000 maybe or 60,000. So you're in the early stages. So one, it's been trending down over the years, yes, probably because there's capacity issue there, and two, as you know, phone growth is a little bit down. Second, though, is the second half good this year? Yes, it is, because we can see it. Third, do we have this big capacity issue next year? Not so much because it's different. And related to that, an unusually high amount of spending on foundry this year is at 40 and above, and 28's pretty strong because of the China phenomenon. So I think catching all of the foundry sort of floor is the China phenomenon is adding to foundry floor.",501

So this is confusing as hell, so I'm going to try to make it half confusing as hell. So I'm going to give you a really simple numbers first. So in 2012, total NAND spending was $4.2 billion. We think total NAND spending this year is $9.2 billion. Applied Materials' share of that spending in 2012 was a little under 15%. Applied Materials' share of that spending is over 20% this year. So our revenues are going to go from about $600 million in NAND in 2012 to close to $2 billion this year, okay? So the market has more than doubled, but our revenues have more than tripled, okay? Because our share is up 50%, okay? The next observation I'll give you is, if you compare greenfield to greenfield, I'm happy to do that for you. A 100,000 wafer start last planar greenfield is $3.5 billion. A 3D greenfield 48-pair is $5 billion. But what you kind of have to model is, what were they actually buying? So in 2012, there was a mix of adds and converts, right? And so as we go looked at the data, it was actually a fair amount of adds, oddly enough, in 2012. But for us, as a company, we mostly were getting the shrink money. Most of that spending was more weighted on converts for litho. So if you go look at it, and you go to a 50-50 model now, roughly, between converts from planar and 3D, our revenue opportunity for where we were in the planar world is up more than 3x. And the simple math of what's going on, it was 3x. You'll say, ""Well, Bob, it should be even more because the total spending's up."" It will be -- it would be more, but there's unusually high spending on planar adds in 2012. So our revenue opportunity apples-to-apples, is kind of over 3x.",317

So you're going to get growth in solid-state [indiscernible]. So right now, you have -- I think, last year, you had 1,394,000 wafer starts in the world of NAND, and through the end of last year, there's 150,000 converted, at the end of this year, it's about 375,000.

If you look at our strength in etch, the share gains will become evident this year, very, very strong. We're #1 in deposition. We have additional CMP steps, epi steps. So again, you look at our opportunity in 3D NAND, really, we're in a unique position. So as those greenfield factories ramp or the conversions happen, if you look at the spending profile, the spending profile is completely different than it was at 2D NAND and very, very favorable for Applied.",104

I'm very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record earnings in Q3. And with our orders also at an all-time high, I'm confident that we can beat this earnings record again in our fourth quarter. I want to thank our employees for all their hard work that has contributed to these outstanding results and their passion to keep raising the bar. 
I'll start today by outlining the key factors supporting these record levels of performance and describe how our strategy positions Applied for sustainable, long-term growth. I will also share our latest view on our markets and detail why Applied has a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. I'll conclude with brief updates on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and outlook. 
In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic advances in technology taking place. We are in the early stages of large, multiyear industry inflections that are driving growth in our business today and creating new opportunities for the future. 
First, foundry and logic customers are making significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10- and 7-nanometer devices. This plays to the strength of our leadership businesses, including epi, PVD, implant, CMP and RTP, where we lead the industry with our unique capabilities and high market share. As customers move to 10-nanometer technology, the available market for these leadership businesses grows by around 25% compared to the previous node. 
The second key inflection is 3D NAND. This is a materials-enabled technology that significantly expands our addressable market. With innovative new products, we are providing customers with the advanced solutions they need for depositing, removing and modifying materials with incredible precision. As a result, we are winning significant share gains as the industry shifts from planar to 3D technology. By the end of this year, we will have grown our share of total NAND spending by almost 7 points above our 2012 baseline. 
The third big wave of investment is China, which represents an important long-term growth opportunity for the industry. Applied has been working in China for 32 years, and during this time, we've established the strongest position in the region. While the buildout of China's semiconductor industry has only just begun, our semiconductor orders and revenue have already doubled over the past 2 years, and we're on track for a record 2016. 
The fourth big driver for Applied is organic LED displays. OLED is also enabled by materials innovation, and that makes our available market opportunity more than 3x larger than for traditional LCD. OLED is the key for high-resolution, low-power screens with faster refresh rates. We expect it to become the standard for virtual reality capable phones and headsets. 
At Applied, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that make new technologies possible. As our customers' technical challenges become more complex, it's the breadth and depth of our capabilities that sets us apart. By building on these strengths, we are outperforming our markets today and creating a foundation for sustainable growth over the years to come. We are making great progress with all the key elements of our strategy. 
First, we have strengthened our organization and processes in the field. In the past 3 years, we have increased the number of technologists and engineers directly supporting customers by 50%. This allows us to see inflections earlier and define winning products in a more repeatable way. 
Second, we have increased R&D to accelerate new product development to provide the materials innovations that our customers need. We have a strong pipeline of differentiated enabling technologies that are winning in the marketplace and extending our innovation leadership. 
Third, we've increased our focus on advanced service products. We are delivering more value to our customers, and as a result, our service business is growing to record levels. 
Fourth, we are successfully applying materials engineering beyond semiconductor. In display, we're on track to deliver more than $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016 with significant opportunities for future growth. 
I'll now provide our market outlook. In our discussions with customers, they describe near- and longer-term drivers for their business that support sustainable growth and investment. These include increasing silicon content in smartphones to support advanced features; explosive growth of data for social media 4K video and IoT that's fueling demand for memory; and, most exciting of all, emerging categories, such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence and smart vehicles that create new platforms that demand high-performance computing, advanced memory and better displays. 
Within this environment, we see customers battling for leadership and making strategic investments to ensure they're in winning positions as demand shifts to these new device technologies. This is especially true in memory where we see a broad base of customers accelerating their 3D NAND road maps. As a result, NAND investment is getting stronger, and we now anticipate that spending in 2016 will be 40% higher than last year. We're also seeing foundry investments strengthening and now expect spending for the year to be 5% to 10% higher than in 2015. 
While more than half of this spending is focused on leading-edge 10- and 7-nanometer technologies, the foundry customer mix is broadening as investments in trailing geometries increased, particularly in China. In logic, we now believe 2016 spending will be marginally lower than 2015. And in DRAM, we still see spending coming down at least 25% from the very high levels of investment last year. Overall, we now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment investment to be slightly above 2015. And as we look further ahead, our early view is that 2017 could be higher. 
I will now talk about the progress we're making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, we see strong demand across the board. Our quarterly orders and revenue are a 15-year high. And for fiscal 2016, we expect our revenue will be around $770 million higher than 2015. This gives me high confidence that this will be a strong share gain year for us. 
What I'm most excited about is our pipeline of innovative new products. Two great examples are the products we launched last month. Our Selectra system is the industry's first extreme selectivity etch tool. This disruptive etch technology enables precision materials removal that does not damage the increasingly delicate structures in advanced logic and memory devices. Selectra has great customer pull, and we see significant growth in applications at future technology nodes. By the end of the year, we expect to have shipped more than 350 chambers to a broad set of customers. 
I am equally excited about our PROVision system, which is the industry's most advanced e-beam inspection tool. e-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection market. The market doubled in size from 2011 to 2015 and is set for significant future growth. We see very strong demand for PROVision and have already shipped more than a dozen systems. In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with advanced service products that are focused on improving device performance, yield and cost. Our team is doing a great job. 
In the third quarter, revenues were at an all-time high. When we look at year-on-year comparisons, we have grown our service business for 11 consecutive quarters. In display, our capabilities in large-area materials engineering set us apart and we have tremendous momentum. The major display inflections are made possible by materials innovation, and our available market is expanding significantly. We are in the initial phase of OLED investments, and this opportunity is layered on top of solid demand for our leadership display products for TV and mobile. As a result, for the second quarter in a row, orders in display are at an all-time record. 
Looking further ahead, we're increasingly excited about VR and AR as it has broad implications, not only for display but also for semiconductor. Leading companies in Silicon Valley and around the world are making big investments in this area, and our technologists are engaged with them as they develop their road maps. We will spend more time covering this topic at our Analyst Meeting in September. 
In summary, I strongly believe this is Applied's time. We are performing better than ever, delivering new records and in a great position to sustainably outperform our markets. There are a combination of factors that are contributing to our success. We identified large, multiyear inflections early. We are making great progress with the major elements of our strategy, enabling us to unlock the full potential of Applied. We've made significant investments in our capabilities and products to extend our innovation leadership, and we are executing well across the organization. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results and performance. Bob?",1475
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2016",2016-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4111.0,1037525.0,43628308.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied demonstrated that we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. We delivered the company's highest earnings per share, surpassing a record set more than 15 years ago. Gary talked about the strategies that are helping us to anticipate major inflections, deliver more valuable products and services, and grow in attractive new markets. I'll describe some of the benefits that our strategies and execution are having on our financial performance, and I'll do this by comparing our most recent quarter to Q2 of 2011. 
I think this is an interesting comparison because Q2 of 2011 was our best quarter since 2000 and because revenue was nearly the same in both periods. Under our new strategy, we've increased our semiconductor systems revenue by 23% to the highest level in 15 years. We've put our services business on a growth trajectory and increased our display net sales by over 50%. 
We have significantly reduced our investment in solar, which is down from 22% of revenue to only 2% today, and we've increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 1.8 points. We've also cut our tax rate and reduced our share count. 
As a result of these and other improvements, we delivered a 32% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter versus Q2 of 2011. And we did this while investing 30% more in R&D. In short, we demonstrated momentum in Q3, delivering higher earnings power at similar revenue even while investing significantly more in new products for future growth. And today, our momentum is accelerating. 
In Q3, we generated record orders of $3.7 billion, and we now have record backlog of $4.9 billion. We've grown our semiconductor orders and backlog to the highest level in 15 years and our display orders and backlog to the highest level ever. We've grown our service orders by 9% year-over-year and our backlog by 18% year-over-year. 
We're also making excellent progress towards our 2018 financial model. We're approaching our targets for revenue across semiconductor, services and display. Today, we feel even more confident that we can hit or exceed our goal for WFE market share. 
We're making additional progress in gross margin, coming in at the high end of Q3 expectations. We're improving our efficiency even as we significantly increase R&D funding for new projects. In fact, we've reduced our OpEx to sales ratio to the lowest level in 5 years. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 3.6 points this quarter to 22.8% which is the highest in 5 years. We made further progress with our tax structure. 
If our geographic sales patterns continue, we now believe that we can sustain a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5%. We achieved our share count objective ahead of schedule, and we remain opportunistic with the buyback program, repurchasing 9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.88. 
I hope you'll join us for the Analyst Meeting, where I'll give you more insights into our progress and momentum. 
Next, I'll explain our segment reporting changes. Effective in Q3, we expanded our Display segment to include roll-to-roll web coating systems, which were previously in EES. The segment is now called Display and Adjacent Markets. We've also moved display equipment upgrades from AGS to display. These changes will enable us to realize technology, market and management synergies. 
Applied's remaining solar business is now included in corporate and other, and we no longer report EES as a segment. The Semiconductor Systems segment is unchanged, and 200 millimeter equipment continues to be included in AGS. Our earnings release includes the information you'll need for your models. 
Here are some of our segment highlights for Q3. We grew Semiconductor Systems revenue to the highest level in 15 years. We increased the non-GAAP operating margin by more than 5 points sequentially to 31.1%, which is the highest level in 4 years. 
In Applied Global Services, we set a new revenue record of $657 million. In display, we recorded record orders of $803 million with more than half coming from projects in China. Compared to last quarter, we increased display revenue by 67% and display operating margin by 3.5 points to 20.1%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We generated $981 million of cash from operations. Profitability and cash flow management were stronger in the quarter, and our year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 22% of sales. In the quarter, operating cash flow was 35% of sales. 
Now I'll provide our fourth quarter guidance. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 15% to 19% sequentially. Within this revenue outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems to be up by 19% to 23% sequentially, AGS should be up by 3% to 6%, and display should be up by 30% to 40%. 
On a year-over-year basis, each of our businesses is on track for strong quarterly revenue growth. Using the midpoints of our Q4 guidance, we forecast that Semiconductor Systems revenue will be up by 45% year-over-year with AGS up 12%, display up 80% and the total company up 39%. 
We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $600 million, plus or minus $10 million, and lower as a percentage of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This earnings guidance represent a new record for the company and a doubling of last year's Q4 performance. 
In closing, I believe our momentum is sustainable. Let me explain why. Our Q4 guidance reflects how uniquely well positioned the company is in major inflections, including in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, 3D NAND, OLED and the Chinese market. While customer spending patterns will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability, and we're just beginning to see the positive effects of a stronger product pipeline and better execution across the company. Based on customer polls for our products and services, I believe we'll have strong orders in Q4 of '16 and Q1 of '17. And while it's too early to know our earnings in Q1 of '17, I believe we can double our Q1 non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.",1042

I guess I wanted to ask a question on SSG. So if I take the orders you booked last quarter and I take this quarter's orders, it's about $4.2 billion. And if I use your SSG share model of roughly 22%, that implies that the overall WFE market is sort of run-rating in the first half of roughly $40 billion. So that begs the conclusion either this year's pretty front-half-loaded or you guys are gaining a lot more share and that you're going to end the year quite a bit higher than 22%, and it has to be several hundred basis points higher than 22%. So I guess I'm wondering if you can comment on whether the numbers imply that the year's a little front-half-loaded or whether it just implies that you're gaining that much share?",148

In terms of the loading of the year, historically, what you see is that the foundry is particularly good in kind of calendar to -- end of Q1, Q2, in terms of shipments. I'm doing shipments and bookings is close for them. And then this year, though -- it was later in the year as you remember, so we've been strong in foundry as they're ramping things like 10 and early 7 and then memory was stronger the beginning of this year. So if you look at Applied specifically, we benefited earlier in the year because we've gained share in memory. We've gained share in DRAM. We've gained share NAND. And that kept us strong. For instance, historically, the last couple of years, we were about 38%, 40% for full year numbers for foundry, but we were only about 37% in Q2. We're up over 50% now in foundry in Q4 and Q1, okay. So what you're seeing is we're betting from secular improvement in Applied but also some seasonal strength in foundry. So both things are working for us. So we will gain share this year pretty significantly. We don't want to say the specific number. In terms of WFE, the $40 billion run rate, I don't think WFE is that high. I think we're having some strength now. Last quarter, we said it was sort of $31.6-plus billion, and this quarter is probably up closer to $32.6 billion is my guess, but what you're seeing is secular gains for Applied across particularly memory, strong positions in foundry and also the China thing is helping, so a lot of things are working for us. That secular stuff is working for us and also the seasonality in foundry is helping the next couple quarters.",303

And we have the initial adoption of many new platforms. We're actually winning more market share also in 10- and 7-nanometer, and we're still in the early innings of some of these new platforms that are being adopted. The Selectra product, the Olympia, PROVision, LK Prime, Precision CVD, very, very strong adoption of those new platforms. And then in memory, as Bob talked about, we're gaining share in memory and especially in 3D NAND. 3D NAND is materials-enabled, not litho-enabled. So our TAM is expanding significantly, and there also, we have many new, innovative products, including the Sym3, which is the fastest-ramping product in the history of the company. So overall, this is going to be a great share gain year for Applied Materials, and we're incredibly well positioned going forward.",163

In terms of this year, what you see is trends that are helping us a lot, frankly. You see strong spending in NAND, whereas last year, NAND was about -- and I'll go into '17 for you, too. In 2016 -- 2015, rather, NAND was about $6.8 billion. This year, it's up 40% to 45%, about $9.7 billion, and that is 90% for VNAND. What we see next year is NAND is going to be up a little more, actually, and is going to be like 98% VNAND, and our position is very strong. In fact, some of the share gains we're seeing this year, you didn't quite see them last year because last year was about 50% 2D, and our gains are really strong on the transition of 3D. So that will continue for us next year. So NAND, up some next year, almost all VNAND and our position very strong. In terms of foundry, we think foundry could be flat to up 5% next year. We think it's going to be very good for us in the leading edge, and we also think it's going to be good for us in the trailing edge in China and things like that. DRAM, we think it could be up a little bit. This year was down 25% to 30%, I think, maybe 25% we said on the call. Next year, maybe up a little bit, but it's the smallest of our numbers pretty much now except for logic is a little less. So it's about $5.9 billion this year, up a little bit next year. And then logic is probably up a little bit next year also. So overall, we see an opportunity to go up some next year, but it particularly plays for us around NAND and foundry. And the second thing that  you asked about was display.

So the -- I think that stuff's lumpy. We still see very strong demand from customers, particularly around VNAND stuff. So we had a huge number in Q2 for VNAND because people, frankly, want to get in our production queue. In Q3, we have reasonable NAND orders but not as big as they were in Q2. So I'd say the demand is still strong. We're getting a lot of pull on NAND still, and I wouldn't read too much into the order's lumpiness.",84

But if I compare it to your 2018 financial model, flat gross margins versus 44.6% at $33.5 billion WFE, a little bit below that mark. What will get us -- what will get the gross margin higher from this level? I understand the display mix hurts the gross margins but the foundry mix helps them?",69

I thought earlier in the year, we would stay sort of flat to last year. We're up a little bit. Last year, it was 42.9%, we're about 43.2%, and this was a particularly strong year for display and also etch did very well, too. Now let me just say, display and etch are adding a lot to the operating profits of the company. Their model is just a little bit different. For instance, display has a little lower gross margin. It's very comparable as they mature operating margin profile. And then etch is significantly growing the operating profit of the company the last several years. And their operating margins have gone up a fair amount. In terms of the specific question of 44.6%, we said we'd do 44.6% in 2018. If you took -- I think I said last quarter, if you took the mix we had and -- if you took the gross margins we had by individual product and compared it to 2014 mix, we're like 44.7%. This quarter, we did the same, and now we're like 44.9%. So we're beating it if the mix didn't change. What we face is mix. We can offset a bunch of the mix. I don't know if we can offset all of it. So I think we'll make progress to the 44.6% next 2 years. There was a -- 44.6% was a 2018 number. Will we get there? I'm not quite sure because of the mix, but I feel very good about the top line, the gross profit dollars, the operating profit and the EPS of the company. The main issue is just the mix on the gross margin because things like cost reduction are really doing well and negotiations are going well. It's just the mix is the issue. And the operating margin doesn't get impacted as much as the gross margin with those businesses.",322

Depends on the mix. Remember that in Q3 and Q4, we've been growing a lot, very strong in terms of revenues for both display and our etch business in memory, for instance. So if in Q1 -- we probably are going to be strong pretty much across the board. So foundry, I think, has the potential to be strong, but I also think we'll be strong in display and probably in revenues in memory. Because some of the revenues we ship into NAND in Japan are delayed about a quarter after the shipment. So my guess is a little bit of upside opportunity in Q1, but I don't want to be too specific now.",116

We're still in the early innings in this smartphone transition to OLED. And the display is a key differentiator for mobile devices. So in the near term, near term being over the next couple years, this is going to be a great driver for us. Yes, if we think longer term, we also see large technology companies making huge investments in new areas like VR, AR and automotive, where display can be significant. We're also developing new, innovative products that will significantly expand or serve the market over the next several years. So normalized spending in display can be higher than in the past, and also our TAM is expanding on top of that. And the last thing on this one I'd like to say is that, really, the display as an example of where we can take materials engineering into a new market, an adjacent market, and Applied is really unique in our ability to enable this big inflection and drive growth. So really, overall great, great opportunity for the company.",187

And it's the biggest change in memory technology in decades. So when you think materials-enabled, it really -- the products that we have targeted for 3D NAND, the sensory etch tool is the fastest ramp we've ever had for any system in Applied Materials, and we're still in the early innings. One of the things that I believe is that we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have so much pull from customers on Sym3. There's still an opportunity for growth there. Our CVD business is growing significantly. This year, we expect strong revenue growth in CVD, gaining several points of overall share, very, very strong position in 3D NAND. So that's another area where, when you look at the 64 layers or you're going forward, there's a tremendous opportunity. The number of CMP steps also double in -- maybe 2, even in some cases, 3x number of CMP steps. So that's another area where we have really, really a great position. And this is the first time also for us to introduce epi into a memory device. So there are a number of different areas where we have innovative platforms, innovative new products and really tremendous pull from customers that give us a great opportunity as 3D NAND goes forward.",239

Relative foundry, what we see is that all of our customers -- all of our customers are targeting 7-nanometer as a big node, very big node. There's a lot of customers -- of their customers that are taping out. And so that is a big opportunity. And every single one of our customers are in a race to be in the right position as that node ramps. So the pull we're getting for customers on 10/7 is extremely strong. And as Bob said earlier, we see strong business in the trailing nodes also in foundry, and we see that China being a big part of that, but we see that also continuing going forward in the future.

And in fairness to us, we kind of predicted. That's why we're positioned. But one, the market changes have really come out, frankly, as we expected in terms of the transition in 2D to 3D. And also, the products they need in the transition on foundry has been going that way. And also, China has helped somewhat, and we've always been strong in China. We kept our strength there. So those market inflections in semi -- and also, we'll talk about display market inflections. We kind of had a pretty good feel for those coming, but we didn't have exactly the right products there. So we strengthened our product positions in places like etch, CVD, ALD, inspection. We're going to be talking about more because we think you need more and more of that, particularly e-beam, as you get to foundry and logic and places like that. So it's a compounding of the market turned out pretty close to what we expected, and we have the right products there. And the reason you're seeing acceleration this year, frankly, is the market inflections are happening this year. For instance, this year, you're seeing a big spend increase in NAND, and it's 90% VNAND. That's what the share opportunities are. And we're seeing a fair amount of spending at 10 and 7, where we're strong, and you're seeing the OLED spending in display. And we've introduced new products in each one of those markets to capitalize on it. So we are probably ahead of plan, frankly.",266

So since leading edge foundry, 10-, 7-nanometer foundry and also OLED are big drivers now of -- that's going to be a big driver for you -- this last quarter, and you said those are sustainable. So I was wondering, are you seeing like broadening or increased number of customer both from leading edge 10, 7 foundry as well as increased number of display customer placing order for OLED? Or was it still concentrated 1, 2 customers, and it's just that those customers are aggressively ramping?",113

So there's several inflections we've noted. One is NAND. One is OLED. One is China. And the other one, which is going on right now, is foundry, leading edge in particular. So let me speak to those. NAND is -- there's about 1.4 million wafer starts in the world. By the end of this year, it's going to be about 400,000 transitioned to VNAND. We think the vast majority of those get transitioned for many reasons. We think the spending on NAND probably is up next year, and our position is strong, and we think that, that transition remains strong for a number of years and plays very well for us. We think in OLED, they're in pretty early innings on the transition to OLED on the phones. In fact, the orders we're showing that we've been booking and we have some more to come, those things will ship through '17 into early '18. So we're going to see revenues for that for a while. And that's just what we've been booking, okay. And we believe there's more down the road, okay. So this OLED transition is going to go on for a while. And we've enriched the opportunity for us by developing new products there just as we have in semi. In terms of China as an inflection, I mean, just listen to the Chinese government. They're in this for the long term, and their interest in investing the semiconductors is probably only going to increase, okay. And our position is strong. And then finally, the foundry one you asked about, Edwin, which we're particularly focused on, right now, the leading edge is strong, and it's strong into early next year. And that one does have some seasonality. But if you look at the longer-term trends there and just listen to the voice of our biggest customer, about 50% of their growth is going to become from more features in phones and about 50% is everything else that you see in Silicon Valley, whether it's autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning, AI, all these things are driving about 50%. And it isn't just one big thing. It's a whole slew of things. And I think we're going to do at Investor Day a very interesting discussion about virtual reality, and not just what it drives in display, but what it drives in memory and what it drives in advanced processors. So in foundry on the leading edge, it isn't just phones. 50% of leading-edge customers is content in phones going up. But 50% is all this other stuff, which you can see, okay. Now in terms of the other things going on in foundry is the trailing edge is very strong, and that's kind of a China front [ph], but it's also the content in phone, whether you're talking about all the cameras and sensors and things like that. So I think foundry is in pretty good shape next year, and I think it's got probably more sustainability overall than people said a few years ago. In terms of other companies at the leading edge, I think others will need -- want to compete because it's a big market, and they want to be at the leading edge. And the timing and magnitude of the spending on that, we haven't disclosed.",561

We see the trends where the Chinese are heavily invested in display business and want to have share there probably continuing for a number of years. They are not heavily into OLED yet, but their interested in display is very strong. In terms of semi, the government has obviously said their interest is very strong and sustainable. So that I think that you may have lumpiness, but I think you've raised the baseline, particularly in semi. And the display baseline has already been going up for a while now.

And now we're saying we're going to -- we have 3.5 -- almost $3.5 billion of orders last quarter, almost $3.7 billion this quarter. Next 2 quarters, we're hoping to have around $3 billion each. So there's some things changed here. So the question you're really asking is what's changed disruptively, either in the market or at Applied Materials? I think there's really 3 answers. One, I think the market has changed. And it really has in terms of what type of equipment people need to make leading-edge devices and leading-edge displays. For instance, in 2012, 53.5% of the CapEx WFE spending by semi customers was in places where we competed. Now this year, we think it's 63.5%. And in those markets where we compete in semi, we're gaining share where we had weaker share. So in the market changes to make leading-edge devices, they need to buy different sets of leading-edge equipment, and frankly, the need for very strong, big capable suppliers because the problems are just getting harder. They're putting things into production earlier than ever before and ramping faster. In display, you'd say the same thing. Making OLED display is harder than making an LCD display. So having the right products -- we're introducing new products. So in the marketplace, there's big inflections. VNAND devices, totally different architecture. So big inflections, number one in the market. But number two, the products are very well positioned now for us. So I can see this going on for a while. Now the third thing is, well, how are you doing at Applied? I honestly believe that we will outgrow by several points the markets in which we're competing. You might be saying, well, how can you possibly know that? For several reasons. One, we've redefined the financial model here, right. The spending we put into products is significantly more than we used to relative to our total spending. So we invest more than we used to in product versus just maintaining the lights in the building and operating the place. So the investment, relatively speaking, is heavier in product development, and our batting average on new products is going up. We have put 50% more technical guys in the field, I think. We've invested in R&D. And the products we're coming out with are not just iterative products. They're disruptive innovative products. And if you go get leading edge logic and foundry customers, the number of D2R [ph] positions we have, the number of new platforms we have. We've changed the model, the investment model and the batting average on the new products. And the other reason I'm pretty confident, I can see the products coming down the pipe. So I think that Applied is going to outgrow the markets that we compete in for the next several years. Now 5, 10 years from now, I can't see. But the next number of years, I feel good about where we're investing, how we're executing and the market opportunities.",565

The fundamental driver for our businesses today from a market standpoint is materials innovation. So if you look at 3D NAND, it's materials-enabled scaling. If you look at how people are trying to solve edge placement errors in litho, there's a lot of materials innovation that can dramatically reduce edge placement errors. And that's a big deal for our customers going forward in multipatterning. So that's the core competency of Applied Materials. We're broader, deeper, have more competencies, more technology, more talent than anyone in the world. And relative to semi, you see today we're in the early adoption of some great innovative products, not incremental products, innovative products. And the pipeline we have there is also tremendous. We have great products in the pipeline. If you look at display, Applied is unique in our ability to take these technologies into large areas and into new markets. And we've also innovated with new TAM growth. Thin film encapsulation is an example. Well, we have hundreds of millions of dollars in business enabling the transition to organic LED in mobile. And we have other capabilities that are also in the pipeline that are as significant relative to growth drivers for us longer term outside the semiconductor industry. So this is personally what I love about Applied. This is what -- where I love to spend my time. The company has so much talent, so much capability. I really believe that we're still in the early innings relative to innovation in semi, in materials-enabled scaling with disruptive new platforms and also outside the semiconductor business into adjacent markets.",275

It seems that a lot of the growth drivers [ph] you've talked about on display, or even CVD and etch, it seems like there might be somewhat headwinds to your gross margin expansion. So can you just talk about what are the offsets of the levers you might have to negate the mix headwinds and enable margin expansion as you go forward from here over the next few quarters?",91

There's several things. One is the cost reduction, which is the best we've done in years. The second one is we just hammer away at every single product to get better and offset the mix that might be a little harder. And then the third one is continuing to introduce disruptive products. For instance, we think we're going to grow our inspection business in terms of market share this year and probably next year, and we have new products coming out, and those products tend to be strong gross margins. So we do have -- we have mix that's pushed it back -- us a little bit, but we have other things that could cover that.",117

The revenue growth has been obviously very strong. And the bookings we have, we believe we have momentum into '17 on the revenue line. If you look at the bookings this year in display, then probably about 2/3 or more around OLED and about 1/3 roughly around LCD stuff. So then, if you look at the revenue split, it's probably about 30%, 40% LCD and about 60% OLED this year. So last year was probably closer to 2/3 LCD, I think, and 1/3 -- not too big OLED. And here it is. Yes, it's probably -- 70% last year was LCD. So it's flipped. So it was 70-30 one way last year. And this year, it's probably 60-40, roughly, 65.",121

Customers are pulling for us big time now. So our issue is how do we optimize all the opportunities? So it's like how good can we be? And that's the tension we have every single day.

So we focus on big inflections. We're -- and I think Bob talked about this earlier. We can see the big inflections a few years in advance. And we made a decision that we would shift hundreds of millions of dollars in spending in the company. So we cut G&A a significant amount. We significantly, dramatically reduced our spending in solar. And all of -- all of that money we shifted keeping OpEx relatively flat into areas where we have great opportunities. Applied has great talent and great competencies and great technologies, but we needed to make the investments and fuel the growth. So that happened, frankly, maybe 3 or 4 years ago when we started that shifting of resources and really focused in the areas where we knew that we had great opportunities. We also have added talent into the company to help us execute on those opportunities, and that's really the playbook. And we're still driving that playbook today. So I look at the semiconductor business. In the pipeline, we have some phenomenally valuable and disruptive products still in the pipeline, where we have great opportunities going forward. And also outside semi, we have some great, great opportunities that are sizable opportunities where we can still drive growth for the company. So those are the things we did. It wasn't something that -- frankly, with the Tokyo Electron merger, we kept our eye on the ball. We were laser-focused on these opportunities all through that process, and we were ready, basically, when these inflections were ramping with the right products and the right team to execute. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything.",283

I think you have a 2-part question there, Tim. One is how come this stuff is so apparent now; and, two, did Tokyo Electron have any impact or the end of the merger have an impact? I think the answer to the first question is, if you're going to gain share in an equipment business like ours with semi display, the opportunity is on inflections, big changes in how they make chips or they make displays. And you've got to have the right product at that inflection or change or node or new OLED device. So you can look at stuff we even did in the public domain. There are a number of people who said that we should be less aggressive investing in display and solar. No, we decided they were 2 very different business models, so we increased our investment in display because we saw the inflection. But you got to weight it 2 or 3 years for the inflection or the product won't be ready. You can't shoot behind the duck, right. The duck has got to be 2 years ahead of you, 3 years ahead of you. And then, second one we saw coming was NAND. And in fact, maybe even at our [ph] conference in '14, I thought VNAND at the end of the counting [ph] was going to be a little bigger than it ended up being because we saw the inflection. So we were betting on it even if you go back to our [ph] conference, Tim, in '14, early '14. And we had the product as doing pretty well. So now what you have is these inflection of products take 2 or 3 years to come along. The hard part, frankly, was bridging this period. And now what's going to happen is the products are in the pipeline, the inflection is happening. And we have more products in the pipeline for more inflections, if you go look at areas like inspections and things like that. So the momentum is building up. We had to get through a 2- or 3-year period. In terms of Tokyo Electron, Gary forced everybody to stay focused on the business.",368

So this is going to be a very strong year for us in that business. We could have a record year -- our fiscal year '16 revenue in this business and very, very strong pull from customers. As you said, I have a lot of history relative to this business. And what I would say is that e-beam -- what I hear from customers is that e-beam is really at an inflection point. If you look at the changes in the devices, the device structures, there is a bigger problem with systematic types of problems where e-beam is the best solution. So we see tremendous pull from customers, really an inflection relative to e-beam technology especially focused on these systematic defects. So that's what we're seeing from a market perspective. Applied Materials, over half of our revenue is e-beam. We have the strongest technology in the market in e-beam. We are the leader in e-beam review. We're gaining share in CD-SEM. And we've just launched this PROVision product, and I think there's just tremendous, tremendous opportunity with PROVision. In the first year of launching the product, we're already getting reorders from leading foundry and memory customers. And I believe what we talked about before was achieving 20% share in e-beam inspection in the first year. So we see tremendous growth opportunities in e-beam in an area where Applied is the strongest relative to technology. So overall, in PDC, we have a great -- we have great technology, very strong customer pull and a great opportunity to drive growth.",269

I'm delighted to report that Applied Materials delivered record revenue and earnings in our fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year. In fiscal 2016, we grew orders, revenue and earnings to the highest levels in the company's history and made significant progress towards our longer-term strategic and financial goals. 
Some of our major accomplishments this year include our highest semiconductor orders and revenues since the year 2000; and record performance in display and service, where both groups exceeded all-time highs for orders and revenue. 
I want to thank all of our employees for their passion to create value for our customers and for making 2016 a great year for Applied. 
Looking ahead, I see tremendous capabilities, momentum and opportunities across the company. This gives me increased confidence that we will again drive sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond. 
In today's call, I'll start by explaining some of the key factors contributing to our record performance and describe our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. I'll then provide our market view and describe why Applied has an increasingly positive outlook. I'll conclude with brief updates on our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results as well as his perspective on our future outlook.
At Applied, our strategy of inflection-focused innovation leadership is delivering profitable growth. In both semiconductor and display, large multiyear inflections are enabled by materials innovation. Applied has, by far, the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering. It's our ability to combine these competencies, technologies and products that really sets us apart and allows us to sustainably grow faster than the markets we serve. 
To fuel growth, we focused our organization and investments to deliver highly differentiated solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. At the same time, we have implemented a new operating system for the company that's driving repeatable success and increasing our product hit rate. A key element of this is our product development engine. 
We've already trained more than 5,000 engineers how to use these methods and as a result, we now see inflections sooner, develop solutions faster and generate higher residual value from our large installed base of tools. 
Over the past few quarters, I talked about 5 major market drivers that are contributing to our record performance today and will fuel growth for years to come. These drivers are: leading-edge foundry and logic, 3d NAND, patterning, advanced display, and China. 
At our analyst event in September, we gave comprehensive updates on these 5 drivers, so today, I'll only cover 2 where we have new information to share.
Let me start with patterning. At the Analyst Meeting, we said we expect our patterning opportunity to expand to around $3 billion by 2019, growing 2.3x since 2012. In recent weeks, new details about EUV adoption have been made public, and this gives us increased confidence in these projections. Our model is consistent with others and assumes that EUV will primarily be used for cuts and vias in foundry and logic applications. That's about 20% of the total patterning market. 
For the other 80%, we see customers expanding multi-patterning solutions and this significantly grows our addressable market. 
Pulling all this together, we believe that in the most aggressive case for EUV adoption, our 2019 patterning opportunity will still grow to around $3 billion, as previously forecasted. 
In scenarios where EUV adoption rates are slower than the most optimistic case, our patterning growth could be significantly higher. 
Looking beyond 2019, we see cuts and vias remaining the primary application for EUV and our patterning opportunity continuing to expand. 
Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments and has room to grow. We've already gained around 15 points of market share since 2012. We see strong customer pull for new materials-enabled patterning processes where we have innovative new technologies and believe we can gain another 15 points of share by 2019. 
My second update relates to display. We announced that our equipment has been selected for the world's first Gen 10.5 LCD TV fab. The poster Gen 10.5 is driven by rapid growth in the market for large-format TVs, 60-inches and above. A Gen 10.5 substrate is about 80% bigger than the current Gen .85 (sic) [Gen 8.5] standard, allowing customers to optimize output for larger screens. In addition, demand for our OLED manufacturing equipment is broadening. 
With this strength in both TV and mobile, we are increasing our estimate for 2017 display capital spending. We now believe customers will invest around $2 billion more than 2016. 
In the past few weeks, we've also increased our forecast for wafer fab equipment. We now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment spending will be at least 5% higher than in 2015, driven by additional foundry capacity and incremental investments in 3D NAND. 
At the same time, our view of 2017 is strengthening. We believe spending will be higher this year, with logic and foundry investment remaining at robust levels and growth in memory spending. 
Looking further ahead, I'm very excited about emerging trends in virtual and augmented reality, big data and artificial intelligence, and smart vehicles. These new drivers for semiconductor and display span consumer, enterprise and industrial applications and layer on top of existing demand for mobility, PCs and other consumer electronics. 
Our discussions with leading companies in these areas make it clear that these new applications create huge demand for memory and require major advances in silicon technology. These trends add to my view that demand for capital equipment is becoming less cyclical, and normalized annual spending is increasing over time. 
I will now talk about the progress we're making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, we are seeing robust demand across the board, and as we said in September, we expect 2016 to be a strong share gain year for Applied. 
Growth in our leadership businesses is being driven by foundry and logic inflections and also by memory, as epitaxy, implant and rapid thermal processing are adopted in 3D NAND. In particular, we see strong growth in CMP, where we've increased revenues around 60% since 2012; and metal CVD, where we expect double-digit share gains this year. 
Our leadership businesses are in a really great position to grow. In 2016, we converted well over 90% of our development positions to volume production wins. We're also making significant market share gains in etch and CVD. 
Fiscal 2016 was our third consecutive year of growth in CVD and fourth consecutive year of growth in etch, where revenues reached a 9-year high. Overall, our combined etch and CVD revenues exceeded $2.7 billion for the year. 
I'm very excited by our product pipeline in etch and ALD. We are seeing rapid adoption of our innovative new solutions, including selective etch and Olympia ALD that, together, generated more than $230 million of revenue this year. 
I'm also pleased by the progress we're making in advanced packaging. We have some great new products, and based on the positions we are winning, we expect to double our packaging revenues over the next 12 months.
In inspection and process control, we also delivered our highest-ever orders and revenue this year. In 2016, we believe that we'll gain about 20 points of e-beam inspection share, around 7 points of share in e-beam overall, and secure the #1 position in this market. 
E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in inspection, and we are winning new applications that support sustainable share gains for years to come. 
In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products. Our service teams are more tightly aligned with our product groups than ever before. Together, they are reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield, and optimizing output and operating costs for customers.
In the fourth quarter, we set new records for both orders and revenue, and when we look at year-on-year comparisons, we've now grown our service business every single quarter for the past 3 years. 
Display is also setting records, with 2 large inflections driving growth. The first is large-format TVs driving investment in new Gen 10 capacity. Large-format TV units are expected to grow at 15% to 20% annually over the next 3 years compared to single-digit growth rates for TVs, overall. 
The second is OLED, where investment is increasing as multiple customers start to ramp this technology and battle for leadership in next-generation mobile screens. 
At our Analyst Meeting, we said that our market opportunity in display is expanding significantly, up to 10x in the case of OLED. 
We are focused on building out our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need to transition to new display products over the next few years. We have great traction with our new thin film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that will be announced in 2017.
In summary, I strongly believe this is Applied's time. We set new performance records in 2016, and we're seeing the impact of the investments we've made in our organization and product pipeline over the past several years. 
As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we see strength in our markets, as large multiyear inflections continue to evolve and new emerging demand drivers layer on top of mobility and computing. 
Across the company, we are focused on extending our innovation leadership. Applied solutions are enabling customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. This puts us in a unique position to drive sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our financial performance. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?",1622
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3711.0,1089503.0,45509111.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In September, we raised the ceiling on our expectations for our markets and our company. Since then, we've increased our 2016 WFE forecast to a range of $33.5 billion to $34 billion. Our internal projection for 2017 WFE is $1 billion higher than that, and it assumes only modest DRAM investment, China spending and NAND penetration of hard drives. So our early view on 2018 and the longer-term horizon is positive as well.
So while our Analyst Day was just 8 weeks ago, I already feel more confident in our ability to hit our 2019 financial model. 
After the Analyst Day, the slide that sparked the most interest was the one comparing average WFE spending and the standard deviation around the average for 2 periods, 2000 through 2009, and 2010 through 2016. What really caught everyone's attention was that one standard deviation fell from $8 billion in the earlier period to $2.7 billion since. 
The WFE industry has evolved since 2010 and that deserves some discussion. I'll give you the major factors that led me to believe it's a fundamentally more stable and attractive business.
First, the semiconductor industry we serve has become larger, more diversified and less volatile. Specifically, semi content was led by PCs, which have multiyear demand cycles, time to enterprise upgrades. Now we've added mobility, which has annual consumer replacement cycles and generates more semi revenue than PCs. And today, we're laying on additional semi demand drivers, including big data, IoT, cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving cars. 
Second, the cycles of the past were mainly driven by PC DRAM, which was the largest, most competitive and most generic technology. Today, DRAM is near the bottom in spending, there are fewer producers, and the designs have been tailored to servers and mobile devices, including multi-chip stacks. It's no longer one-size-fits-all. 
Third, NAND spending has surpassed DRAM, and NAND continues to unlock growth potential as the gigabyte cost approaches hard drives. 
Fourth, foundry capacity additions tend to be contract based and demand driven rather than supply driven, and foundry has gone from being the smallest category to the biggest today. 
And fifth, our customers now add capacity in a more flexible basis, building-out lines and line extensions instead of entire mega fabs. 
Not only has the industry changed, but Applied has changed in ways that give us larger and more diverse revenues and profits. 
Over the past few years, we have achieved relatively balanced market share across all of the semiconductor device types. Most of our businesses are now benefiting from 3D NAND, and our success in NAND has been a springboard to our new patterning wins in DRAM. 
At the same time, we've greatly expanded our service business, whose revenues are up by over 30% in just the past 3 years. By 2019, this relatively stable business should deliver almost 1/4 of our revenue and an even greater percentage of our operating profits. 
And Applied is uniquely positioned as the equipment leader in display. We're on track to triple our overall opportunity with new display products, and we're accelerating our display pipeline by leveraging our semiconductor IP, including e-beam, identifying new technology through Applied ventures, and securing R&D co-funding. 
In both semi and display, we can point to specific inflections and winning products that will drive our growth through the model period and beyond. And in all of our markets, I believe we're demonstrating systemic improvements in our ability to outperform. The better allocation spending, more efficient execution and product development engine are now culturally ingrained. 
Now what's the significance of this greater stability? I'll mention just 3 things. First, our order variations now reflect seasonality more than cyclicality. We're focused on driving year-over-year revenue and earnings growth, and we plan to stop reporting quarterly orders as of 2016. 
To help you feel comfortable with this change, I'm telling you now that I expect our Q1 of fiscal '17 orders to be meaningfully higher in both semi and display. I also plan to the detail our Q1 orders on the February call, so you can have a complete set of data for your calendar '16 models. 
Second, this stability gives us unique opportunity to get closer to our customers and here's why. The technology roadmaps are getting harder, so customers increasingly want to work with the most capable suppliers, and we are the broadest and most capable. 
Today, our customers are asking us to engage earlier and ramp new enabling technologies much sooner and more aggressively. This costs money, but the more stable business environment gives us confidence that we can invest more in our customers' roadmaps and generate more attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Number 3. This stability helps us deliver higher, more predictable profits and increased cash flow. It's great for our financial stability. 
Eight weeks ago, we showed you our 2019 financial model. Some of you realized that we plan to generate substantial free cash flow well beyond what's needed to achieve our share count objective. We regularly evaluate the best means of returning excess cash to shareholders, and we know some shareholders value dividend growth as much as buybacks. 
We're evaluating our options for this additional liquidity, and we're monitoring the tax policy environment for any changes that could influence our thinking about the mix. 
Now I'll shift gears and comment on our performance during Q4. I'll focus on our revenues and profits as compared to the same period last year. 
We grew company revenue by 39% year-over-year and more than doubled our non-GAAP earnings per share. 
We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 1.5 points year-over-year, and our spending discipline helped us to increase non-GAAP operating profit by 82% year-over-year. 
The non-GAAP tax rate was a little lower-than-expected due to a favorable geographic mix. 
At the segment level, we grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% year-over-year, and segment non-GAAP operating margin by 9.1 points. 
We increased service revenues by 13% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points, and we grew display revenue by 92% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 10.9 points. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We delivered strong operating cash flow of $797 million in Q4 or 24% of revenue. 
We grew total cash and investments to $4.68 billion after returning $279 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
For the year, we distributed 106% of free cash flow to shareholders. At year end, about 14% of cash and investments were onshore. The onshore balance has said to increase to roughly 45%, reflecting the effects of intercompany transactions. 
Now, I'll provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We expect our overall revenue to be close to the record levels set in Q4. Our expectation represents year-over-year growth of approximately 45% plus or minus 3 points. 
Within this outlook, Semiconductor Systems revenue should be near the 15-year high achieved in Q4. This forecast represents year-over-year growth of about 55% plus or minus 3 points. 
Services revenue is seasonably lower in Q1, but we expect it to be up by about 10% year-over-year plus or minus 2 points, and display revenue should be up by about 65% year-over-year plus or minus 10 points. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70, the midpoint of which would be up by 154% year-over-year. 
As a reminder, Q1 of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. 
Since it's the first quarter of a new year, I'll help you with your modeling questions. In Q1, non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be up by about 1 point from 43.7% in Q4, reflecting very positive mix. 
For the full year, we expect the gross margin to reach approximately 44%, which would bring us to within 60 basis points of the midpoint of our 2019 model. 
Non-GAAP OpEx is likely to be $625 million in Q1 plus or minus $10 million. 
Our quarterly run rate in the balance of the year may be approximately $635 million, which remains below the model. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 11%, which is at the model, and we'll continue to buy back shares to achieve the share count target in the model. 
In summary, we delivered new levels of revenue and profitability in 2016, and demonstrated the benefits of the strategy we've been working to implement over the past several years. But this is just the beginning. The industry is bigger and more attractive. Our opportunity set is larger, our customer relationships are stronger, and our new product pipeline is better than ever. We've raised the ceiling with our 2019 target financial model, and we're making excellent progress already. 
Our stronger performance is sustainable, and we're confident in our ability to deliver increasingly predictable cash returns to our shareholders. 
Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.",1466

In our fiscal year, not calendar year next year, we think in semi, it's going to be healthier in general for the environment. We feel good about the environment, and we're going to gain share. We think -- we don't want to give the exact numbers right now, but we're going to gain WFE share next year in a number of places. And then display, we see display revenues up a significant amount next year. And then we see the service business continue to grow. So we'll outperform the markets we're in, but additionally, we think the markets are pretty good next year. Our outlook is WFE is up.

Part of what we were answering there was that we think there's wind at our back into '18, too. So if you look at '17 we think NAND is up next year. We think foundry's strong, and we think logic's pretty good. DRAM, up some next year, but what we don't see is high levels of absolute DRAM spending because this year's not too big. What we're modeling, and we might be a little conservative, is not a big change in China spending. We think that hits more in '18, if you just look at building and shelves and stuff like that. We're big believers China's going to happen, but we think we have wind at our back into '18 in based on a few things. We think China ramps a fair amount more in '18. We think DRAM probably has upside in '18, not to mention semis alter-formed memories we're starting to see early now. And thirdly, the NAND by the end of next year's probably going to get to about 700,000 wafer starts, so that's about 1.4 million. And we think all of that eventually gets -- virtually, all of that gets converted, so we think there's still strong NAND spending in '18.",206

Past 4 years, you guys have had book-to-bill greater than 1, and obviously, clearly, an indicator of the growth of the business. As You look at your customer and program pipeline for fiscal '17, combined with your view on growth in flat panel and WFE, industry spending growth, is 2017 likely to be the sixth consecutive year of book-to-bill greater than 1 for the team?",94

In particular, we're going to stop reporting bookings after Q1. We're going it to give to you in Q1. In Q1, we see up meaningfully. And what we mean by meaningfully is up more than strong double digits, okay, from Q4. So people have been worried that we peaked in Q3 bookings, down some in Q4. We see a strong Q1, and we see a strong year overall. So we think the momentum's still with us and our revenues are going to be up and our share's going to be up next year. In terms of quarterly variability in orders, I'm not sure. In terms of book-to-bill next year, we don't have clarity on the second half. It's too early for us to tell. But we see a strong WFE here; share, up; strong spending on display. Frankly, it's more stronger than both of those than we saw 8 weeks ago. For instance, the large TVs are doing well, the Gen 10 stuff, the profitability at the display guys is good. So we see display is pretty darn strong next year. We see a breadthening (sic) [broadening] of demand for mobile display, up to 9 or 10 people trying to make OLED displays now for mobile. And then within WFE, we get a lot of pull from customers to increase production and shipments. So we think overall, next year, we think we're going to have very healthy bookings, whether it's -- where it is relative to one, I don't know right now.",276

And you can already see growth in display with thin film encapsulation and e-beam, 2 products that we've introduced in the last couple of years that are really generating meaningful revenue for the display business. And so we're really continuing the same playbook. We're focused on inflections that are meaningful for our customers. We have very strong pull and investment from customers in these new products and high confidence that these new businesses will add meaningful revenue for our display business and increased confidence that we're going to hit or exceed the model that we showed for 2019.

And when we look at EUV adoption, we agree with others that the view of EUV is going to be mostly focused on vias and cuts, and logic. So when you look at the leading customer roadmaps, vias and cuts, and logic is about 20% of the total patterning TAM. 80% of the TAM will continue to add multi-patterning, and that's -- that gives us increased confidence in this $3 billion estimate that we had at our Investor Meeting. Basically, if you take the most aggressive EUV assumption for adoption, something like 10 layers adopted at 5-nanometer logic for vias and cuts, you come up to the $3 billion estimate. Of course, if it's not in this most aggressive assumption, then the TAM could be higher. And Applied is really in a great position to gain share. We talked about a $1 billion number in our model for 2019 for Applied, and we have great confidence in that number. We already gained 15 points of share in patterning since 2012. We're forecasting at least 15% more between now and 2019, really great products in etch and selective removal, CVD, ALD, CMP. Really, really, really great new products. And we have line of sight to the 2019 model, with many application wins and increasing customer pull for these innovative new products.",250

Does your 2017 view assume there'll be much foundry, logic, customer reuse of 10-nanometer equipment for the 7-nanometer node? Or does it assume limited equipment reuse by foundry, logic?",45
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3711.0,1089503.0,45509133.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,25,"Sure. Let me -- we've had a couple of questions on peak questions and reuse, so let me give you some context on how we look at the business. And I'll answer your specific questions, Stephen. We actually really believe 3 things. One, that the industry is growing more and more attractive in which we compete. Total spending's trending up, and volatility's trending down in both WFE and in capital spending for displays. Secondly, Applied, I think, is trending up in terms of the breadth of our product offerings and reduced volatilities. We have the similar share across NAND, foundry, DRAM and logic. We're gaining share. We have a deep product pipeline. So I think the second thing is the trend is the industry's looking good. The trend is Applied is becoming more and more attractive and less volatile. And third, those things combined to produce very applicable cash flow, which we can talk about later on the call, gives us opportunity to return cash to investors. In terms of risk, that this -- there's some replacement and reuse in 10 and 7 in -- next year. I think it's pretty moderate, frankly. I think 10 is not going to be a big node. I think the people are going to rush to go to 7. But 10-nanometer devices are shipping next year; 7, the year after. So the ability to migrate equipment is somewhat limited. The second thing is the comparison everybody always gives is the 20 to 16/14 migration. That was distinct in a couple of ways. One, you had the biggest consumer of computer chips in the world switch from one vendor to another in a node. And secondly, you have gone from the last planar of FinFET device to the first -- last planar to first FinFET, which really made the last device unattractive. So is there going to be reuse in some type of equipment from 10 to 7? Yes. I don't it's next year, and I think it's going to be much smoother than it was in '15.",344

One, as you mentioned the business is getting more seasonal versus cyclical. When you look at the order trend, you had a dip in orders for semis in your October quarter. Is that the seasonality you're talking about on a go-forward basis? And along the same path, when you look into the calendar '17, can you help us understand -- dig a little more deeper in how the WFE profile looks like first half versus second half for NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic?",91
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3711.0,1089503.0,45509136.0,Answer,Bob Halliday,,Executives,28,"Yes, I do believe that, as we said on the call, the recorded -- the previous part of the call, I do think it's more seasonal than cyclical. We have a lot of data that shows it's so. For instance, even if you look -- as we said -- the script, we got asked the most questions about at the earnings call -- at the Analyst Day was this average WFE spending in the last -- since 2010 is up to like $31.7 billion, I think, it is, with the volatility of about $2.8 million. Versus 2000 and 2009, it was like 25.5% of the volatility of $8 billion. I'll give you more details on that. If you look at memory as a sum, because virtually every customer makes DRAM and NAND, the average, before 2010, 1 standard deviation, 1 Sigma was $6 billion on an average spend of $10.7 billion. Since 2010, it's $3 billion standard deviation on an average spend of $12 billion, when you put DRAM and NAND together. The second thing is virtually every year since 2012, I think, it is, it's up pretty much $1 billion to $2 billion every year, total memory spending. Now if you get lost in the waves between DRAM and NAND, it's a little different. But the companies manage their budgets that way. They'll say, ""We're going to spend on DRAM this year and NAND in that year. Fab -- ramp this fab this year. The other fab, the next year."" And then on foundry, foundry spending, before 2010, it was about $2 billion on an average, and the standard deviation was $2 billion. FinFET's $1.5 billion on the spend of $12 billion. And the spend pre-2010 average, $4.5 billion. So the magnitude of these standard deviations, the volatility is going down, okay? It really is. It's seasonal, not cyclical. In terms of your specific question, about -- I guess, it was about next year, we're not exactly sure. I'll give you some data for us. We think our -- number one, Q1 bookings are up. We think on the year, WFE's up. We think our share's up. I was just looking at the data, we think year-over-year, it's a chance that every quarter year-over-year is up. So I think it's less. In terms of the seasonality you specifically asked on foundry, historically, spending on WFE and foundry, foundry is the one that tends to be a little more seasonal because it's Christmas and Chinese New Year. They historically have taken equipment more March through August, like end of February through August. And then they might have another spurt if they need more later in the year. This year was a little different because one of our big foundry customers is trying to more level load themselves and get a headstart on 10-nanometer. So we had a little bit different cycle in terms of spending, because remember, 10-nanometer's not shipping until next year. And then the other thing that made this year a little different is there's just sustained demand for 3D NAND. So we had some at the beginning of the year. We have a pull at the end of the year. So the seasonality, which was kind of more than cyclicality, is being mapped to a technology transition, which is very helpful, too. And again, that's not so much cyclical, it's more of a technology trend that's going to go on for years.",575

What we said last quarter, to make sure we put a floor -- because we had spiked up a lot in every metric you could measure the last few quarters: orders, revenues, EPS. We wanted to give people a sense. We were going to continue strong that our share gains, our revenue growth, our operating margin expense were sustainable. So what we said last quarter was, ""Hey, orders are not going to fall off a cliff."" The number's going to start with a 3 in the next 2 quarters, Q4 and Q1. And in fact, they will start with a 3. And in fact, the 3 was a little bit lot -- we thought it will be a little higher in Q4. Some of this went into Q1. So we think we're up double digits in Q1, okay? So it's probably a little bit of timing. And the magnitude's probably a little stronger because where we are getting pull is on some flash devices, stuff like that 3D NAND. So it's strong, and it's probably stronger, even than we thought a few months ago.",202

We've talked about 5 drivers in our model between now and 2019, these multiyear waves. So we're very confident in those drivers, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I would say, definitely increasingly bullish relative to the longer-term opportunity as we're engaged with some of the leading technology companies around cognitive computing, the smart vehicles. You saw a big announcement from Samsung this week with an $8 billion acquisition. There's an incredible amount of money being spent. And when you look at these drivers, VR, AR, smart vehicles, cognitive computing, all of these different areas, you need a higher-performance computing. And we have the CEO of one company that was here recently, and we were talking about logic devices. What are the size of those logic devices going to be? And basically he said, ""As big as I can build them. As big as I can fit it into the radical field."" And he was also talking about the amount of memory that's going to be needed for some of these future applications. And it's much, much bigger than I think any of us could imagine. So I would think we are much more bullish about the longer term relative to the drivers for high-performance computing and for memory. I'm also bullish about the innovation pipeline that we have within Applied Materials. I really believe that the $500 million per year that we've moved in terms of innovation, we are already enabling people to design devices that they could not have dreamed of building a few years ago. And I strongly believe that the pipeline we have now, the best is still on the -- is still coming in that pipeline. So I'm really bullish about the market. Bob talked about where we compete being better, more stable, upward trajectory, less volatile. Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable all of these great, big inflections to happen.",347

Can you talk about NAND in that context and as you go through a very high capital intensity period of planar to 3D conversions and 3D greenfield? You'll get to the point where you're doing sort of more layer account increases, which is less capital intensive. That function of NAND turning into a headwind at some point in the next couple of years, and how do you think about that in that multiyear context of overall WFE?",99

Let me -- this is going to be a historic day. I'm going to use phraseology on the next minute that's never been used by a CFO in an American public company before, all right? So hold on. So I have a couple of slides in front of me that shows the demand for solid-state disk drive market growth in both enterprise and PCs. So these numbers, you can argue them a little bit, but I think they're in the ballpark. So 2015, there was about 12 petabytes of demand for solid-state disk drives in enterprise. That goes up to almost 120,000 petabytes in 2020. So it goes from 12,000 to 120,000, okay? And on the PC side in 2000 -- what did I say, 2015, it's about 20,000 going to 140,000 petabytes in 2020. Let me give you another way to look at those. Our estimate's that the penetration across all PCs, including workstations, notebooks in 2015 was 21.8%, and it was only 15% -- 14%. Up to 31.6% of those have solid-state disk drives, going to 77.5% in 2020. And if you go look at the enterprise servers, this year, it is about 20%. It was 14% of all of them in 2014. And we see it go into 26% in 2020. So again, the total petabytes, I'll use that word again, is going up over 100,000 petabytes from 2016 to 2020 in each, PCs and enterprise. So the demand is there. They're expanding the addressable market for NAND. So other data I have seen is that for servers alone, you might have to add 500,000 wafer starts of capacity, and your average NAND, a factor of 100,000, costs about $5 billion or $6 billion, say $5 billion, $6 billion. So that's about $25 billion, $30 billion. And upgrades are about another $25 billion to $30 billion. So you could have $50 billion to $60 billion of spending, and that's cross calibrated over the next sort of 5 years, maybe? 2020 type data, 4 or 5 years. So if you take it over 4 years, that's like -- you're going to be $50 million -- $50 billion, now it says. So it's over $10 billion a year, okay? So we've upped this year's forecast. Next year, we're over, I think, $11 billion and change. I'm not sure it doesn't stay at $10 billion and more for a few years to come because we're kind of looking at the end-user demand for solid-state disk drives penetrating hard disk drives by market, we're looking at capital intensity, and we're getting feedback from customers. And in the short term, they're shipping everything they can build. So what's the point? I think the NAND build-out goes on for a while, and I think people underestimate. Because the other thing is they're going to convert the 2D to 3D because they're not going to be able to sell the 2D, and that'll drive them to sell even more 3D and hit cost points that eat into hard disk drives even faster. So I think there's a bunch of ways you can get a number that could be $10 billion for a while. And I'd like to say that I was proud to use the word petabytes today.",546

In actual spending, I think probably, we're up more -- we have a slide on that so -- I think we're up probably more in TVs versus what we thought 2 months ago. We think that there's huge demand for OLED, for mobile. The question is how much -- how fast can they ramp it? I mean, I think it's a question of supply more than demand. I think on TV they can ramp the big TVs, and they're going to ramp them pretty aggressively, particularly in China. This Gen 10.5 is ramping. There's going to be more to come after that. So we're up to over $16.5 million next year for display CapEx. I don't have the numbers from 2 months ago, but the growth is in both. But I think the thing that's bigger in 2 months for us is the TV because the TV size is becoming bigger than we thought, the individual TV sizes, and the profitability is quite strong in the TV panel business, which is a leading indicator of spending, and then these big fabs. So I think they're both very healthy, but I think the increase in spending is probably a little bit more on the TV side.",212

We gave you a 2019 model that gave you a WFE assumption, revenue assumption by product, share assumptions. We told you in the Analyst Day that our share gains were almost linear from now through 2019, and we told you that our service business was going to grow almost linearly by year. And we told you that display was going to be going up to that number, too. So our growth in revenue from '15/'16 and '19, we think is pretty straight line. Now giving absolute numbers a year in advance, we don't have that level of precision.",104

In terms, of -- okay, if you want to look cost structure of Applied, most of our sales are related to physical products we sell, and they share common factories, which are predominantly in Singapore and the U.S., so the material cost, product cost is similar. And then Taiwan is a big source for our displays. So material cost structures and supply chains are worldwide. So wherever we sell them doesn't matter too much for us. In terms of differentiation and mix, which sometimes drive gross margins, different device customers use a different mix of our hardware and products. In terms of OLED, we look at the OLED display market for our existing products as being similar margin profiles to our TV markets; and by region, similar. The opportunity for us on margin is the new products we're going to be introducing in the next couple of years in display, which we think are very highly differentiated and very attractive profits, which have upside for us. In terms of margins by region, it goes predominantly to mix of products. But historically, we provide a high level of service to customers in China, and so we usually do well in terms of share there, in particular.",211

We had a good spreading this year, but why were your orders essentially flat between fiscal '15 and fiscal '16? I understand it's fiscal year, but what does it mean for 2017 -- I mean, fiscal '17 given the spending that you're seeing for the flash?",56

So I think that was the aberration. I think the trend line is up. If you look at total WFE, it's up, for flash. And if you look at -- our sales are up, and probably, they're up next year, too. So a little bit in '15 -- one particular customer, in particular, wanted to get into the pipeline in terms of the queue for production.",91

It seems like a year ago, but we only had the Analyst Day about 6 weeks ago, and maybe a little more, in New York. And I have to say, even in the last 8 to 9 weeks, I increasingly believe that the industry we serve are becoming more and more attractive and growing, and more diverse and less volatile. 
Gary talked about some of the demand drivers for our customers, whether it's autonomous cars, it's virtual reality, it's AI, big data, you really feel this. If you're driving around Silicon Valley, you'll see it everywhere. We had some of the CEOs of these companies come in and talk to us, and it's real. It's happening. Look at some of the highest performing stocks in the space this year, that's what's driving them. 
So one, the industries we serve, and display's also that the way, where it's just kind of doubled in terms of spending, and becoming more and more attractive. And more demand drivers would make it less volatile for us. 
Second, Applied is performing better. I think, we are more and more -- becoming more and more innovative and executing better, and there's compounding benefits from that. So I think that results in us in a broad range of opportunities. Our biggest problem is just picking and choosing among good opportunities at this point. 
So Applied is feeling more broader, more diverse and less volatile, and more predictably, we're going to do better, right? 
And then finally, those 2 things combined, and potentially, with tax legislation, that there's a real good opportunity to return superior cash returns to investors, including, which we've said -- I think we said earlier today, that we were conservative in the financial model we showed 8 weeks ago in terms of the cash. And we kept a little conservatism in the cash and the model because we were -- wanted to be opportunistic if there was tax law changes that we could return even greater returns to investors. 
So I think the industry's becoming more diverse and less volatile and more attractive in terms of growth, more drivers. Applied's becoming that way, and the leverage down to the cash line, especially if you get some tax legislation that's attractive is a pretty powerful combination for Applied.",384
