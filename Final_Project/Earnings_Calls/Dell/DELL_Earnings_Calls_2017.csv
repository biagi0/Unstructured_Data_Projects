Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and joining us from Europe is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. 
On this call, we'll focused primarily on Q4 results. We will provide more details on our strategy, integration efforts and capital structure at our Investor Meeting on April 5. For more details, please see the events section of our website at investors.delltechnologies.com. We posted our fourth quarter press release and web deck on our website. And Q4 results will be filed on Form 10-K tomorrow. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. In addition, fiscal 2017 had an extra week, which was incorporated into the company's Q4 results. 
Now I'd like to highlight key changes to our financial statements due to the EMC merger and the announced divestitures. As mentioned last quarter, we are reporting EMC and VMware on the Dell Technologies fiscal year. VMware, Inc. has now transitioned and will report their stand-alone financial results on the basis of Dell Technologies' fiscal year, which started on February 4, 2017, and will end on February 2, 2018. Operationally, this transition will help align our combined financial goals and go-to-market approach. 
Due to the recent divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in Q4 results. In prior quarters, all assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet. On the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and, to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the noncash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 17 as well as our SEC filings for more details on our non-GAAP adjustments. 
As a reminder, please note that our prior year historical financials do not include EMC historical results. And unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which is compared to Dell prior year results. During this call, we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most comparable -- directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-K and in the supplemental material of our web deck.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section of our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.",578
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063260.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. Fiscal 2017 was a busy year, and I'm pleased with our progress. Over the course of the year, we successfully completed the merger of EMC, becoming the world's largest privately controlled technology company with market-leading solutions. We divested certain businesses, including Dell Services, Dell Software Group and Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division. We successfully completed the IPO of SecureWorks. 
We maintained our capital allocation focus by delevering approximately $7 billion in debt since the transaction closed. We cumulatively repurchased $824 million of Class V shares, which Tyler will cover in more detail. And we continue to invest in key strategic areas, supporting our customers' digital transformation agenda, including hyper-converged, hybrid cloud, software-defined solutions and end-user computing. 
Our GAAP revenue for the full year was approximately $62 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of $3.3 billion. As Rob mentioned, our GAAP results were significantly impacted by noncash purchase accounting and transaction costs. Non-GAAP revenue was approximately $63 billion, with operating income of $5.1 billion. CSG revenue was approximately $37 billion, up 2% for the full year. Our PC business outgrew the industry by 1,000 basis points and gained share year-over-year for the 16th consecutive quarter. Operating income was $1.8 billion or 5% of revenue. In our ISG business, we exited the year with leading share positions in server units and storage revenue. Additionally, we were also #1 in revenue share in converged infrastructure, all-flash arrays and purpose-built backup appliances. 
Switching to Q4. GAAP revenue was $20.1 billion with a GAAP operating loss of $1.7 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $20.6 billion. We saw pockets of growth and areas of improvement as we start to benefit from our synergies as a combined company. While consolidated year-over-year compares for ISG are not meaningful, CSG revenue grew 11%, and we outgrew the industry in both Consumer and Commercial PC units. Our ISG business saw revenue growth in PowerEdge servers and strength in our Emerging Solutions, including all-flash arrays, hyper-converged systems and software-defined storage. But we did see softness in traditional external storage arrays. 
Gross margin at the consolidated level was $6.6 billion or 32% of revenue. OpEx was $4.8 billion or approximately 23% of revenue as we continue to execute on our cost initiatives and invest to drive growth in a rapidly changing market. Operating income was $1.8 billion or 9% of revenue. 
Now let me turn it over to Tyler to cover our EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure.",407
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063261.0,Presenter Speech,Tyler Johnson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 11% of revenue. Please see Slide 17 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. 
In Q4, we generated cash flow from operations of $676 million. As a reminder, this includes approximately $1 billion in interest expense as the majority of interest payments occurs in Q2 and Q4 of each fiscal year. In addition, we paid approximately $500 million related to a tax settlement and, to a lesser degree, there were impacts from integration and divestiture costs. Our cash and investments balance increased by $287 million versus the previous quarter, ending the year at $15.3 billion. 
Having just completed our first full quarter as a combined company, we are happy with the progress we have made in regards to our balance sheet and capital structure management. Since closing the EMC transaction, we have paid down $7 billion in debt. This includes $3.1 billion of term loan A and $2.2 billion of the asset sale bridged loan retired in Q4, both funded by net proceeds from the divestitures. In addition, to date, we've made payments of $1.6 billion on our revolver and paid $100 million in term loan amortization. These debt repayments result in a $200 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis. 
At the end of Q4, we announced our intent to reprice our existing term loan B facility and raise an incremental $500 million, which will be used to partially pay down our $2.5 billion margin loan bridge. We successfully closed this transaction on March 8, resulting in an expected incremental $40 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis and applied the $500 million as planned. We ended the quarter with $50.4 billion in total principal debt. Of this amount, $43.7 billion is core debt. The remainder included approximately $5 billion of debt that funds our global financial services business and $1.5 billion of a bridge facility backed by a legacy intercompany note due to Dell Technologies. 
Moving to our share repurchase program. Last quarter, we announced that our board had authorized a new Class V Common Stock repurchase program for up to $500 million over a 6-month period for the Class V group. To fund the new program, Dell Technologies entered into a share purchase agreement to sell $500 million of VMware Class A Common Stock to VMware. Related to this announcement, we simultaneously suspended the previous $1 billion Class V Common Stock repurchase program, which was for the DHI Group. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 8.4 million shares of Class V Common Stock for $500 million under the Class V group repurchase program. Combined with what was repurchased under the original $1 billion DHI Group program, we've repurchased a total of $824 million or approximately 15.1 million shares. 
In addition, today, we announced that our board has approved an amendment to our existing Class V group repurchase program for up to $300 million over 6 months and solely funded through a new VMware Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. I want to reiterate that our overall capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we remain focused on our plan to delever the balance sheet through profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. 
Let me turn it over to David.",557
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063262.0,Presenter Speech,David Goulden,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tyler. The Information Solutions Group, or ISG, had a solid quarter with share gains in key product areas, including all-flash arrays, converged integrated infrastructure, hyper-converged infrastructure and service. More on these in a moment. While we executed well in the growth areas of our portfolio, there continues to be pressure in traditional solutions as customers down-spend between IT and digital transformation initiatives. In total, Q4 revenue for the ISG business was approximately $8.4 billion with operating income of $1 billion or 12% of revenue. 
Looking at our results by segment. Our Server and Networking revenue of $3.6 billion increased 12%. In servers, we outgrew the market to regain the #1 unit share position on a global basis according to IDC. The strength was driven by our mainstream PowerEdge business, where we gained approximately 600 basis points of year-on-year revenue share against our closest competitor. Our high-volume cloud server business declined, which tends to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based upon customer order patterns. 
While we're very pleased with the velocity of the server business this quarter, we continue to work to improve our cost structure and ensure we have the right solutions at the right price points to meet our customers' needs. We continue to invest in this business and look forward to announcing our next generation of servers later this year. Our networking business grew approximately 2x the market and had its highest level of revenue in 8 quarters, driven by our open networking strategy and by winning new service provider and web tech customers. 
Storage revenue of $4.8 billion was up substantially due to the impact of the Dell EMC transaction. As a reminder, the change in the legacy EMC fiscal year from December to January, along with our focus on working capital efficiency, has caused a change in backlog, especially at the end of a calendar quarter. And this change will also result in a change in sales linearity, particularly in the first calendar quarter of 2017. So for today's call, we're going to talk about the performance of our Storage business for calendar Q4 on a demand basis. 
We had a record setting Q4 demand in our all-flash array business and exited the year with a growth rate of almost 100% to more than $4 billion demand run rate, gaining significant share. We believe we are nearly the size of the 3 next competitors combined as we continue to capture the market shift to all-flash. In converged infrastructure, our Vblock integrated infrastructure business also had its largest quarter ever with demand growing high single digits on a calendar basis. We remain the industry leader with well over 50% market share as customers continue to look to us to make infrastructure easier while using best-of-breed products. 
Hyper-converged solutions have been a major growth initiative this year. And with the strength of our Dell EMC XC, VxRack and VxRail portfolio, we believe we are now the market leader on a calendar Q4 demand basis, with strong triple-digit growth. Within our appliance offerings, the demand for our Dell EMC XC solution grew triple digits as customer engagement remained strong. Our VxRail offering is seeing significant growth and ended the year on a nearly $400 million demand run rate basis, only 10 months after the product was introduced. The rapid growth is driven by customer demand for a fully integrated solution optimized for VMware environments. We expect the momentum to continue in Q1 with the introduction of our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud on VxRail and global availability of PowerEdge inside VxRail. Also within our hyper-converged portfolio, our VxRack solutions continue to gain traction in larger environments as we create a new category for data center-scale hyper-converged infrastructure. 
As we look to fiscal '18, we are extremely excited about our position in the market and confident in our ability to execute against an unparalleled solution portfolio, flexible consumption models and newly aligned go-to-market initiatives. We remain focused on solving the needs of our customers as they work towards IT and digital transformation initiatives to drive business value. I look forward to sharing more with you about our views of the market and our strategy at our upcoming Investor Meeting on April 5. Additionally, I am very excited about the many exciting product announcements we'll make at Dell EMC World in May. 
So let me now turn it back over to Tom, who'll walk you through the Client Solutions Group.",735
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063263.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,5,"Thanks, David. The Client Solutions business had a strong fourth quarter as we further enhanced our portfolio of solutions and continued to focus on profitable growth. In addition, the overall market was better than expected for calendar Q4. 
According to IDC, worldwide PC unit shipments for calendar Q4 declined by 1.7%, exceeding their forecast of a negative 4.2%. We continue to drive market consolidation. According to IDC, we outgrew the market by 9.9 percentage points in calendar fourth quarter and have now gained share year-over-year for 16 consecutive quarters. Dell outperformed the worldwide market in both notebooks and desktops and in both Commercial and Consumer. We shipped 11 million PCs, which was the largest volume of product shipped since calendar Q4 of 2011. 
Turning to our fiscal results for CSG. Revenue was $9.8 billion, up 11%. This growth was broad-based across both Commercial and Consumer. Commercial returned to growth, up 12%, as we saw growth across all of our major Commercial product lines. As is typical in Q4, we saw continued strength in Consumer, which grew 9%. Operating income was $342 million, down 29% to 3.5% of revenue. 
The decline was primarily driven by pricing decisions in the quarter as well as some positive one-time items in the prior year period. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, the third quarter op inc margins were higher than what we've typically seen for CSG due to a benefit from a vendor settlement and favorable cost environments. So moving into Q4, we expected some movement back toward the normal range, especially as we have started to see an increase in component costs. We are focused on balancing growth and profitability as we move forward. 
Performance across both high-end Consumer and Commercial notebooks continues to be strong with XPS, Mobile Workstations and Latitude each seeing positive growth. Our Alienware products also had very strong growth as consumers look to us as the leading brand in gaming for high-performance systems with fast processor power, high-resolution screens and the latest graphics technology. Desktops returned to growth this quarter, driven by OptiPlex and Precision Workstations. And we have started to see the benefits of our investment and our focus on innovative form factors. 
Dell's focus on innovation was again evident at CES 2017. The company secured 62 awards. At CES, we announced several Consumer and Commercial innovations, including the world's smallest 13-inch 2-in-1 in our new XPS 13, this product boasts an InfinityEdge screen, longer battery life, best-in-class security and has already won more than 30 awards since its launch in January; the Dell Canvas, which is the world's first horizontal smart workspace of its kind, aimed at enabling more effective drawing and creation capabilities; and the world's first 32-inch 8K high-definition display. We were pleased with the performance of CSG in fiscal 2017. Going forward, we remain focused on expanding our customer base as we continue to take profitable share. 
Now let me shift to the VMware segment and our other businesses. VMware had a strong quarter. Revenue from VMware in the Dell Technologies fiscal quarter was $1.9 billion, with operating income of $565 million or 29.2% of revenue. VMware helps customers grow and enable their private clouds with software-defined data center and end-user computing software and then expand with hybrid cloud and multi-cloud solutions. 
We are seeing their value resonate with customers, which is evident in their Q4 annualized NSX bookings run rate of $1 billion and over 2,400 NSX customers, their Q4 annualized VSAN bookings run rate of $300 million and over 7,000 VSAN customers and their strong quarter for mobility products with increasing adoption of their complete workspace solution, Workspace ONE. 
In addition, revenue from our other businesses, which include SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $480 million. SecureWorks stand-alone revenue was approximately $119 million, up 26.4%, as this business continues to experience strong demand for its subscription-based security solutions. They also continue to make progress in their path to profitability, driven by record gross margin and better operating leverage. 
Pivotal continued its momentum in the fourth quarter as it achieved strong top line growth driven primarily by its subscription software. Pivotal Cloud Foundry saw impressive growth at scale and crossed a major milestone in calendar 2016 with bookings over $270 million, up 130%. Pivotal Cloud Foundry enables developers to deploy cloud-native apps on any public or private environment, including Azure, Google and AWS. Pivotal works with over 1/3 of the Fortune 100 and a rapidly growing portion of the Fortune 2000 as it benefits from our combined go-to-market approach. 
Dell Technologies delivers a strong portfolio of solutions in a force multiplier effect that provides us with the scale and the ability to serve our customers' needs across existing IT, where we are the leader in servers, storage, virtualization and PCs, and in the IT of tomorrow, including hybrid cloud, cloud-native applications, software-defined data center, mobility and security. 
So in closing, we remain focused on executing our strategy, and we are on track with a broad set of integration activities. At the beginning of fiscal '18, we introduced our new sales force segmentation model and channel program. While we are in the very early stages of the Dell EMC partner program, we have received overall positive feedback from our partners. As I mentioned last quarter, there may be some short-term disruption as our sales force and partners ramp in the new go-to-market activities. 
We will continue to drive against the cost and revenue synergies we have identified, and we will continue to invest and provide great solutions and services to our customers. We are pleased with our results this year, but we realize that there is more to be done as we continue to work our way through the integration and stay focused on our customers in the coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",978

Tom, you talked about margins being lower this quarter, and we were -- you had guided us to the fact that they would be lower. And also, I was expecting because of DRAM prices being higher, for them to be lower. But then you also mentioned things like pricing decisions. So I wondered if you could provide a little extra color around what that means and maybe how much impact some of these things had, like higher DRAM prices, on margins. And then David, same thing for ISG. You talked a little bit about you need to work to improve cost structure and things like that. But margins there were also down. So I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color around what was impacting margins there as well, maybe if you could break out some pieces for us.",147

So look, from an overall perspective, we had -- particularly in the CSG space, we had cautioned you guys last quarter that we didn't think that margins would -- our operating income percentages, I should say, was all given some of the dynamics we saw in Q3 coming into Q4. So look, I mean, we clearly have a bit of a headwind, component costs with memory and some of the glass. I think that's going to continue to be a headwind as we go through the first half of the year at least. And then also, look, I mentioned pricing decisions in my prepared comments. I do think that as we thought about how to balance growth and profitability, we were probably slightly more aggressive in the quarter in the sense of some of the acquisition deals that we were doing and some of our share positionings that we were doing. You also have to remember that the mix of the quarter is a little different, right? So you've got a higher consumer mix in the quarter given the seasonality of the holidays. And so look, as always, as we talk about the business, we're all about trying to drive, ultimately, growth in gross margin dollar growth. And so we did see a little bit of pressure on margin percent. I'm happy with the velocity of the business. And what we're always doing is trying to fine-tune what's the right pricing levels to be at given the state of the business, the state of the market and the cost structures that we're dealing with. So that's sort of the dynamic we saw as we went through the quarter from a client side. And I'll let David perhaps comment on some of the margin dynamics that we saw on the ISG side.",304

A couple of factors here. One that impacts both gross margin and operating margin is bear in mind that Q3 was a kind of a partial quarter, which impacted things because it's just a bunch of moving parts and due to the timing of the acquisition that flows through the income statement. Operationally, you saw that we gained a significant amount of market share in servers in a market that was relatively flat. So we did make a conscious decision to drive to get share gains in that marketplace, and that came at some expense on the margin side. From a server point of view, the DRAM pricing didn't affect us as much in Q4 because we bought ahead of that. That's more a factor for us as we go into this current fiscal year.",141

So hey, look, I think we're generally on track on the cost synergies to date from what we're executing against. I do think, and I alluded to it in my comments, that we are putting some investment back into the business around capacity, around some incremental solutions. So we'll have to balance that as we go forward relative to where we are on our cost synergy track. From a coverage model, I highlighted, and we had told you guys in Q3 as well, that as we moved into the first quarter of fiscal '18, as we move to a unified or a more cohesive selling motion and reorganize the sales organization, that there was the opportunity for that to be a bit disruptive in the short term. We're early on in that. And while we don't give forward-looking guidance, I would say I think we're generally on track with what we expected with the sales organization and our go-to-market motion. Customer feedback has been favorable in terms of trying to provide a more unified selling motion and a more cohesive selling motion across the family of businesses. There's still work to do there, by the way. And then with the partner program, early feedback is very positive. So look, we've got a lot of work to do, so I don't want to avoid that.

As it relates to the -- there are cash taxes that will come off -- out against the divestitures. And those cash taxes get paid generally in Q1. So we should -- and so depending upon what the tax bases of these assets were, there is some differences between gross and net proceeds, obviously. I'm not going to get into the exact specifics on that. But we've accounted for that and thought through that as we thought about our delevering plan. So that was all sort of contemplated as we moved forward. Tyler, do you want to comment on the working capital program?",122

So look, I mean, the $500 million was essentially the settlement of the IRS exam on the legacy Dell tax year 2004 to 2006, which has been out there and been in ongoing negotiation for a number of years. So we feel pretty good about how that resulted. Other than that unusual cash payment in the fourth quarter, the only other thing that we had some, clearly, some WFR-type cash costs come through in the quarter, and then the large interest expense payment. So those were generally the 3 big things. And lots of different puts and takes, but those are the 3 big things in the cash from a Q4 perspective.",116

And then maybe just turning back to the business, somewhat related questions. But I guess, one, on the server side, I mean, the share gain, obviously pretty substantial and impressive performance this quarter. I guess, how sustainable do you think that is on the server side? Maybe if you could talk about a little bit what you're seeing in that market. And then similarly, on the client side, where are we in terms of the consolidation, market consolidation story that you guys have been driving for the last number of quarters?",93

Look, I mean, I think we feel pretty good about our momentum in sort of mainstream rack servers right now. Look, the market is supposed to be a bit better as you walk into Q1. IDC, I think, is forecasting overall mainstream units to be up roughly 1.7% and for the full year, mainstream up 3.8%. So I think the market is generally okay. Obviously, there's work to do. It's competitive. But I think reasonable momentum as we go into the quarter, and I'll let David probably give you a bit more thoughtful answer on that. And then on the client side, look, I think if you look at the top 3 vendors now according to IDC, I think we're roughly at 60% market share on a combined basis. And I think that market consolidation story is clearly happening as you see some of the weaker players exiting or pulling back from the various pockets of participation that they were in. So we do believe that in a consolidating market, you have to take share, and that's our focus. Obviously, that share needs to be profitable share. And you heard our focus around some of the mobility products and the high-end products. We had really good results that quarter, very pleased with our XPS and Latitude and Precision and Mobile Workstation velocity. So I think that consolidation story continues. That's our focus. We'll see as we go through the course of the year whether we get a Win 10 bump in terms of a refresh. We are thinking at some point that will happen. There is a lot of interest out there in the operating system. And then with some of the Intel processor introductions as we go through the year, that also gives a performance boost. So we're optimistic about the PC market this coming year. But it's still going to be down, IDC is still predicting a minus 2% type of a market. And we'll have to see how it progresses as we go through the year. David, do you want to give any other color on the server question around Velocity?",374

And again, Scott, thanks for the question. So there are a couple of things going on in the server market. Mainstream servers is kind of the main focus. The hyper-scale tends to be lumpy based upon individual companies buying or not in the quarter. But in mainstream, if you go back and you look at Q4, in total, the market was flat. But the real growth was in the rack-scale servers, where we're the strongest. And there, we grew at over 2x the market. So in total, we regained that #1 unit share position. We gained 200 basis points of mainstream revenue share absolute and, of course, 600 against our closest competitor. A couple of dynamics going on there that are driving it. In Q4, we started to get some cross-sell synergy. We definitely saw that occurring, particularly into the ex-EMC base, if I can call it that. But that's really just the start of things because that will now accelerate as we moved to our new go-to-market structure in February this year, where we put our field forces together. And rather than just passing leads, they're fully cross-quoted on selling service both in enterprise and in commercial. So that should help us again this year. And then on top of that, we've got a major new product line that we're going to be launching midyear, which again should be a boost, and we're excited about that. So we see good things happening in servers. And last but not least, there's a kind of industry shift that's driving towards servers. As more and more parts of the IT infrastructure stack become software-defined, they've got to run somewhere. And that's where they run, on servers, and particularly are running on rack-scale servers, which is where we're really focused. So a number of things that should help us as we go through the fiscal continue that positive trend.",319

We've recently met with a few of your competitors in both the PC as well as the server space. And the conversation there is price increases are being implemented. It sounded like perhaps you guys didn't follow quite as rapidly as they certainly would have liked. So from that standpoint, I'm trying to figure out from your take, what's going on with -- or what will happen with elasticity of demand? Because obviously, component costs are up. You need to flow some of that through. If the industry goes, then perhaps it works. But are you a little more hesitant to try to take some of these pricing moves? Or are you expecting to do that both in servers as well as in PCs? And then I have follow-up.",138

So hey, look, it's obviously in -- I think the people that you've talked to and what they're saying publicly is relatively consistent in the context of there is a rising component cost environment right now. On the client side, we see it in memory, we see it in glass and in LCD panels. On the server side and storage side, we're seeing it in SSD drives and memory. And so it's all about balance, right? So you're trying to adjust your pricing relative to the marketplace and relative to your thinking around what's the demand elasticity impact. So we have made a number of pricing adjustments across both product lines, client and servers. Companies and the competition do that at a different pace dependent upon inventory positions and channel inventories. And so there's -- there are a number of variables and dynamics out there. But look, the reality is that if you're seeing -- we've seen some pretty significant cost increases in memory, for instance. And you're just not going to be able to swallow those and not adjust pricing over the long run. Now there's ways to adjust pricing, whether it's a list price, whether it's how much discounting authority you're giving to your sales organization. So there's ways to sort of maneuver your way through these dynamics of a headwind from a component cost. And we'll have to see on elasticity, to be honest, right? But we have a P&L to manage. And we need to make sure that we're making the right decisions for the long term. So it's all about balancing short-term profitability pressures, for instance, because of the component costs, with long-term positioning around where do we want to be from a velocity perspective. And so that's the balance we're driving right now. I think so far, we've made some reasonable decisions. We'll keep watching it. We're doing weekly pricing analytics and analysis and position analytics to see how the market is and where the market is. But David, I don't know if you'd add anything, but it's clearly a rising component cost environment right now.",356

I think you said it well. I mean, this is an industry-wide phenomenon. And it's certainly impacting everybody. And it's certainly, of course, impacting customers. Having said that, the fact is that I talked about it before. So this is clearly a bit of a headwind to the overall growth of infrastructure. On the other hand, there's some tailwinds as well. So there's clearly a balance going on here. But we have absolutely made adjustments. And we'll continue to do so as the component prices move.",89

Look, Shannon, I mean, let's -- I want to be really clear on this, right? Our primary source to our capital allocation strategy is delevering. So nobody should be confused about that. On the other hand, we continue to look at the performance of VMware and the performance of the Tracker in the market and the return to our shareholders based upon some ownership percentages. And as a result of that, we've had some nice alignment as VMware is out managing their share buyback programs, where there's been the opportunity to align what they're trying to do and align with what we're trying to do, which is -- and utilize and make it a win-win, I should say, in the sense of VMware buying Class A shares from Dell EMC, or EMC, I guess, and us then taking those proceeds and retiring Tracker, buying back Tracker. So we're going to continue to look at these programs. We're not going to make any commitments on breadth and depth as we go through the year. But you can -- we will continue to look at that and see if there's some opportunistic opportunities in the market to take advantage of the discount between the 2 securities.",205

And that seems to be working well. Is that still the case? And do you see that continuing for some time? Or does there come a time when you really kind of need to have a pure optimized all-flash architecture, more like XtremIO, that you're pushing first and foremost?",80
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063290.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,32,"Steve, what we've done is we have, as you correctly pointed out, taken some of our traditionally hybrid products and actually enhanced the architecture quite substantially to take further advantage of all-flash and therefore produce all-flash versions. So obviously, VMAX All Flash came out early last calendar and was a strong success, as is XtremIO. So it's really a combination of both. What we're finding is that, for example, in the high end, where we now have these 2 very competitive products, the general-purpose application is actually very well suited to the VMAX All Flash that includes data services. The XtremIO case is well suited to things that are very dedupe, instant copy-centric. So the combination -- or they actually complement each other quite well. And of course, we've done the same thing in the mid-tier with our Unity, again created all-flash versions. They're optimized for all-flash; they could never accept a hard drive if anybody wanted to put one in. And we're going to do the same thing for our XC component series as well. So we believe that the vast majority of the frames in the mid-tier, certainly the higher end of the mid-tier and the high end are all the moving to this all-flash configuration. And as I mentioned, whilst XtremIO was built from the ground-up to take advantage of all-flash, we've done significant things to the way that VMAX is architected to really take full advantage of this very fast media. So I actually see it as a combination of both. And I wouldn't characterize one as kind of optimized and one as not, because they're both being optimized now to take the benefit of it. And of course, there are things coming along, you'll see us out NVMe technology in the market later this year. So the family continues to move forward to take advantage of new media.",313

One of the market research firms tracks the hardware and software sales into cloud, which for you guys, I assume, is mostly private cloud. And you've got Cisco, HP Enterprise and yourselves all at 12%. And then if you want to throw in ODMs, they're also at 12%. So it seems like a very competitive, fairly fragmented market selling into mostly on-prem, which arguably could be declining. How do you view your strategic position differentiated, particularly relative to Cisco and HP Enterprise?",91
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063292.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,34,"Yes. So everything gets CloudWatch, Steve, these days. And I think I'm aware of the particular report which you're talking about. So first of all, cloud is not a place, it's an operating model. And that operating model can be applied on-prem or off-prem. It's really providing IT as a service. And I think that everybody is going to implement some form of hybrid cloud. So it's also a combination of both. When you look at the kind of IT infrastructure marketplace, as we do, the kind of server, storage, network combined marketplace, about $110 billion this year, we see strong double-digit growth in our infrastructure being sold into private clouds and into public clouds. But the biggest piece is still a non-cloud environment, often virtualized. It's still 2/3 of the marketplace. So we see ourselves particularly well positioned in letting people take advantage of on-prem and off-prem together with the strengths of VMware, with the Pivotal layer and our ability to put together complete solutions, like our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, our native hybrid cloud, underneath it and also being able to complement that with Virtustream, that uniquely handles these mission-critical workloads. So we can go to our customers and say, ""Hey, we've got a cloud strategy for your mission-critical application, we've got a cloud strategy for your general applications and we've got cloud strategy for new cloud-native applications."" And that cloud strategy embraces both on-prem and off-prem solutions, so we think that's very differentiated. So we're actually excited about how we kind of face off against those companies that you mentioned as we go into this cloud era as opposed to cloud place.",274

But we also have -- the other sort of cloud model dynamic is around consumption and pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-consume. And so we have multiple consumption models, financing models from pure utility models all the way to pay as you consume. And so I do think that we're all trying to ensure that as we drive these solutions, as David described, that we also position some of the economics models that the cloud offers to ensure that our customers have full choice and flexibility.",96

But I think my initial reaction this morning was a little bit of concern regarding EBITDA and margins. And I think it's somewhat knee-jerk. I heard a lot of what you said. But I just want to get a better sense of how much of the pricing and incremental investment and OpEx impacts are decision-making on your standpoint versus uncontrollable expenses and whether or not this is a little bit more of just a time shifting of expenses and that ultimately, your free cash flow style or whatever your internal projections are, are still in line with what you thought 3 months ago, 6 months ago. And then ultimately, from a balance sheet perspective, has anything changed in terms of both your desire or your ability to delever in terms of the size and timing of what your initial expectations were?",153

That is one very long question. So let me do it like this. So let's start with the margin conversation. So look, I think about this less as an OpEx or cost perspective story as I think about the pricing dynamics that -- and the mix dynamics that we continue to juggle is with a pretty large set of solutions in various markets. We are -- so if you think about coming in out of Q3 into Q4, we had told you guys that we thought Q4 would be a tighter operating margin quarter. And it turned out to be. So I think we're very consistent and very transparent on how we think about the business and trying to ensure that you guys understand how we operate the business. Clearly, there's -- we've got some pressures in component costs. We've got mix dynamics happening as we balance growth with profitability. And it's our job to sort of balance that across the set of portfolio. So I think that we'll continue to make the right decisions around Velocity at the top versus gross margin dollar delivery, which ultimately translates into operating income. But there will be some fluctuations on that as we go from quarter-to-quarter. We are extraordinarily focused on cost and cost structure. So we continue to be driving aggressively against the synergy targets that we laid out. I will also tell you, though, that we have made some decisions to invest back into the business, things like sales force coverage, expansion of our CSB model into the next set of countries, expansion of different solutions with -- in building out service provider support models. And so there are a number of investments that we think are there prudent things for the long term to do. And we'll continue to make the right decisions for the long term here as a company. And so look, I mean -- so yes, margins were slightly lower. You also have to remember they were a little bit higher in Q3, as David highlighted, by the fact that -- of the timing of the transaction, right? So we closed the EMC transaction on September 7. So we picked up only a portion of the quarter's sort of run rate operating expense and picked up a lot of their revenue and margin, given the hockey stick that they've traditionally had at the end of the quarter. So there are timing dynamics there, too, that you have to think your way through. So look, I mean, we're going to continue to work at this. We're going to continue to make sure we make the right decisions. And we're going to continue to make sure that we drive the right profitability models to drive cash flow, which gets into your second question around free cash flow and are we different now than what we thought 6 or 9 months ago? The answer is probably yes to a certain extent, but not -- but it's all about how do we balance and make sure that we delever properly and efficiently, which we're extraordinarily committed to, and making sure that we drive the right business investment decisions along with that delevering strategy. So if the world's dynamic continues to evolve and change, we're going to continue to evolve and change our decisions as we go forward. But don't be confused. We will delever the balance sheet. That's our focus. We'll do that as promptly and efficiently as we can while we make the right investment decisions for the business. So look, I actually feel like the team's done a pretty good job navigating the first part of this integration, knowing that we've got a lot more work to do and that the markets are going to continue to move around on us a little bit, given just the competitive nature and the changing IT consumption models that are out there. So overall, Robert, I think we did -- I think the team did a reasonable job for the quarter. Work to do, but I'm reasonably pleased with where we are as we step out of FY '17 and come into FY '18.",697

And then as a quick follow-up, can you qualitatively walk us through a bridge from the margin of -- on the EBITDA from the third quarter at 13.3% to the 10.6%? But qualitatively, what were some of the big factors? Did the -- was the one-time payment a big factor? Was it the acquisition of business, divestiture of high-margin business? Were there any mix changes, some of the component prices? I think that would be helpful to investors. I'm getting a lot of [ IBs ] on that right now.",125

I mean, if you remember -- legacy Dell, I'll say it like this, coming out of Q4, would seasonally be down in Q1 on a revenue perspective. It tends to be -- it intended to be probably the weakest quarter of the year in terms of revenue velocity as we come out of the buying season from a consumer perspective and from the end-of-the-year budget flush from a commercial perspective. I think that legacy EMC also had a relatively weak -- has a relatively weak Q1, and then builds through the year. And so I think at a macro level, that's what we expect to see. I think linearity within the quarter is going to be a bit interesting. EMC traditionally ran a pretty heavy end-of-quarter linearity within the quarter, meaning that most -- a lot of the revenue came through in the last 2 to 3 weeks of their calendar quarter. So now that we've shifted to a fiscal quarter, the dynamics of when does that demand show up and how does it show up is something we're still working -- still trying to ensure that we understand the new patterns that are going to evolve, given sales compensation models, given customer buying habits. And so I tend to think about it like that. But I do expect that -- we don't do forecasts and we don't do guidance, but I think there are some historical seasonality patterns that you would expect to see in Q1, which traditionally had been a softer quarter. In terms of EBITDA margins from Q3 to Q4, where you see it from 13.3% to 10%, you've got to think about that in the context of some dynamics around the operating expenses that David referred to. That's probably 60 to 70 basis points of that change. You did have some pricing pressure, which is probably another 120 basis points of that change. And so look, I mean, there's dynamics as we go from Q3 to Q4. It's our job to balance those out over time, which we'll continue to do. So I'm not going to do an exact bridge for you. But we're aware of the dynamics, and we'll work our way through those as we go forward.",403

So I called out -- I gave you the 2 largest components of that. And then you also had some mix dynamics. And so look, I mean, those are sort of the bridges that I would take you through, plus some of the WFR activity, which was is in there as well.",97

And to the extent sales have been weaker, has this been a function of customers deferring purchases, moving to competitors, evaluating new technologies? Just any color there would be helpful.",45
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063304.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,46,"Yes, Dan, thanks. This is David. Let me take that. There are a number of things that are happening in our numbers, particularly in the calendar Q4, which are impacting the revenue results that people are reporting. And it's actually impacting the market. We actually had a fairly material impact on the storage market ourselves. But let me explain what's happening there. So first of all, as we moved into Dell, we said we took a policy to really focus on working capital efficiency. So that means that we're going to have a much bigger backlog generally at the end of any period than we would have done inside of EMC. But then also, we've moved our fiscal from December to January. So now if you think about where things were at the end of December, there was no real focus upon optimizing what that backlog was. So we had a significant increase in our backlog in December for those 2 factors vis-à-vis a year ago that impacted our reported results as people like IDC might look at them, and actually impacted the market. To give you a flavor for kind of how we saw overall demand in the fiscal quarter if we could actually have gone back and created a true comparison year-on-year, we saw demand in the fiscal quarter down in the low to mid-single-digit range, which is actually a lot better than many of our traditional storage competitors, who were seeing double-digit declines. Now to answer your question about what dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace, we're seeing a couple of things. We are seeing softness in the high end of the market. And that seems to have continued for a little bit of time. We're actually seeing growth in the mid-tier marketplace. We're also seeing a significant growth in all-flash. And as you mentioned and another mentioned, we're now a $4 billion run rate player. Our share in all-flash is higher than it is in external storage in total. So as the market shifts towards all-flash, that should be good for us vis-à-vis others. And what we're seeing is in the marketplace, customers are still making tactical decisions. There's a lot of work going on to look at IT transformation of future architectures. So the customers who haven't made those decisions yet in terms of what their IT transformation strategy is are still doing a very much buy what they need and no more approach, different from what -- from how they were buying a couple of years ago. The customers who are moving forward with transformation are making longer-term decisions, but that's still a smaller piece of the marketplace. So you've got a number of factors. I would comment that the move to all-flash is actually not deflationary for the storage marketplace. Because what happens is that all-flash is actually more expensive, but then with data services, deduplication compression, et cetera, you get the same dollar per gigabyte effectively as you do with a hybrid system. So that's one of the things that people talk about that we don't see being a factor. So we've had an impact on the marketplaces, as external people look at it, based upon how we close our quarter. There's still some softness in the marketplace, even with that factored in. And then you get back to this combination of high end plus people making tactical, shorter-term decisions as the market starts to slowly move towards a transformation agenda. The customers who are in this transformation mode are making big, multiyear strategic purchases. So as more of that happens, then I think that could be a positive thing going forward. But those are the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace. So hopefully, it gives you a few points of flavor to think about.",634

Just one quick follow-up. The other thing that we've seen, some of your competitors discussing the market on the all-flash side, obviously you're faced with an environment of rising NAND prices now. How is that going to impact your sales of all-flash arrays and traditional drive systems from both your perspective and then from the customers'?",60
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2017",2017-03-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3902.0,1164657.0,48063306.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,48,"I think that the -- as we talked about on one of the early questions, obviously for solid-state drives and more importantly for DRAM, we see the impact on DRAM price increases being more than SSDs, and actually storage, and therefore servers, are more impacted by DRAM, and storage arrays are relatively less impacted by that relative price increase. I still think that the value proposition for an all-flash system holds even in a slightly inflationary environment because you get so much additional performance from an all-flash system. You can do things with it you just can't do with a traditional storage-based system. So I don't see that momentum particularly changing. It might slow a little bit. But I still think customers, when they're looking at these purchases and they're thinking of what they're going to do with a storage system for next 3 or 4 years, are still going to move predominantly to all-flash.",155

So as we look at quarter-on-quarter EBITDA walk, I would say that, roughly, we've got about 250 basis points of OpEx pressure coming from the ISG -- or OpEx change coming from the -- where we picked up the EMC legacy from a quarter in Q3 to a full quarter in Q4. So that's a big piece of that change. We're obviously working on OpEx to bring that back down over the course of the coming year. And then we also had some cost variances in pricing variances. It was roughly a makeup of about 70 to 80 basis points, offset by some favorable mix. So that's sort of the dynamic we saw going from Q3 to Q4. But I wanted to clarify that.",157

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. 
We posted our first quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q1 financial results will be filed on Form 10-Q tomorrow, June 9. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspectives. 
Consistent with prior periods, our Q1 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $2.7 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and related to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and, to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. As a reminder, please note that our first quarter fiscal year 2017 historical results do not include EMC, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year changes, which may not be comparable due to the merger. 
During this call, we will generally refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material in our web deck. 
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

We were pleased with the overall results given some of the dynamics we worked through during the quarter. We completed our first quarter under the fully integrated annual plan and the new go-to-market structure. We aligned the family of businesses to the Dell Technologies fiscal year calendar, and we faced component cost headwinds in certain areas. 
We feel good about the velocity we saw in many areas of the business, the work we've done on integration, our cash and balance sheet management and the success that we're seeing in our Dell Financial Services, or DFS, business. While we made progress, there's still more work to do, and we will discuss this in more detail later in the call. 
Now jumping into the Q1 results. GAAP revenue was $17.8 billion with a GAAP operating loss of $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $18.2 billion. While year-over-year compares for ISG and VMware segments are not meaningful, CSG revenue grew 6%. On a stand-alone basis, last week, VMware reported a growth rate of 9%. Our ISG business saw revenue growth in PowerEdge servers and strength in our newer solutions, including all-flash arrays, hyper-converged systems and software-defined storage, with softness in traditional hybrid storage arrays. We are focused on improving overall storage velocity as we move forward and in balancing server revenue growth and profitability given the challenging component cost environment. 
Gross margin at the consolidated level was $5.6 billion or 31.1% of revenue and was impacted by pricing actions in both ISG and CSG as we navigated through the component cost increases as well as mix shifts within ISG. As a reminder, there are some instances where pricing commitments are already in place, and we can't always bridge that gap with pricing adjustments when the cost environment moves as quickly as we've seen it move recently. Going forward, we do anticipate memory and SSD costs to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. 
OpEx was $4.4 billion or 24.5% of revenue. We continue to execute on our cost initiatives while also investing back in the business to drive growth in today's changing IT environment. Operating income was $1.2 billion or 6.6% of revenue. 
Now let me turn it over to Tyler to provide additional commentary on adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure.",383
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986903.0,Presenter Speech,Tyler Johnson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.6 billion or 8.6% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see Slide 17 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. 
In Q1, we generated cash from operations of $240 million. Operating cash flow during the quarter was driven predominantly by profitability and working capital benefits. Cash flow was in line with expectations and normal Q1 seasonality. Our cash and investments balance was $14.9 billion, down approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter. 
During Q1, we paid approximately $100 million in term loan amortization. In addition, as discussed on the Q4 earnings call, we closed on the repricing and upsizing of our term loan B using the incremental $500 million to reduce our margin loan bridge from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. Subsequently, we refinanced the bridge into a $2 billion margin loan, now with a 5-year maturity. Since closing the EMC transaction, we have paid down $7.1 billion of gross debt, excluding Dell Financial Services-related debt, resulting in a $200 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run-rate basis. 
We ended the quarter with $50.7 billion in total principal debt, up $400 million due to the growth in our DFS business. Of this amount, $41.9 million (sic) [ $41.9 billion ] is core debt. The remainder included approximately $5.2 billion of debt that funds our DFS business, the $2 billion margin loan and a $1.5 billion bridge facility backed by VMware legacy intercompany notes due to EMC Corp. 
Moving to our share repurchase program. To date, we have repurchased approximately 13 million shares of Class V common stock under the Class V Group repurchase program, totaling approximately $800 million. As a reminder, this portion of the repurchase program has been funded through a share purchase agreement to sell VMware Class A Common Stock to VMware. Since closing the EMC transaction, we've repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V Common Stock for a total of $1.1 billion when including the DHI Group repurchase program. We'll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities in the context of our broader capital allocation strategy. 
Before I turn the call over to David, I would like to highlight the portfolio growth momentum we are seeing in our DFS business. DFS is now the exclusive originator of the Dell EMC business and the preferred finance partner for VMware, which we expect to enable incremental revenue and profitability across our portfolio of solutions over time. In Q1, DFS originations approached approximately $1.1 billion and financing receivables grew to approximately $6 billion, up 19% year-over-year. As the DFS business grows so have our DFS-related debt, which includes both allocated, corporate debt and structured financing. 
I also wanted to comment briefly on the new consumption models we announced at Dell EMC World at the beginning of May. We are seeing growing customer interest in flexible consumption models as they work through their digital transformation. We expect the impact to cash to be immaterial. 
To close, I want to reiterate what I said on the last earnings call and at the recent Investor Meeting. We remain committed to our conservative financial policy and overall capital allocation strategy. We continue to prioritize deleveraging and optimizing the balance sheet to profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. 
Let me turn it over to David.",552
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986904.0,Presenter Speech,David Goulden,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tyler. Overall, the Information Solutions Group, or ISG, performed well in its first quarter with our new go-to-market structure as demand across the ISG portfolio grew mid-single digits. While I was relatively pleased with the demand and overall revenue performance, we still have work to do to improve our execution in some areas as we move forward. I'll provide more details on that in just a moment. 
At Dell EMC World in May, we announced major updates across our portfolio. These new solutions are designed to help our customers realize their IT and digital transformation goals while letting them choose the pace and consumption model best suited for their organization. In servers, we enhanced our position as the industry-leading vendor with our new 14G line that provides a more scalable business architecture, intelligent automation and integrated security. This new generation of servers is the bedrock of the modern data center, creating a common platform that is essential in a service-centric, software-defined world. 
In hyper-converged infrastructure, we announced several updates to our portfolio, including a new VxRail 4.5 appliance, expanded capabilities for our XC Series and VxRack systems as well as new flexible consumption models aimed at making hyper-converged infrastructure easier and simpler to acquire, deploy and manage. In storage, we announced a full lineup of new all-flash solutions, including the new VMAX 950F, which is up to 4x faster than our nearest competitor for mission-critical workloads; XtremIO X2 with 3x more capacity, 25% better storage efficiency and 80% better response time than the prior generation. We also introduced new Unity, SC and Isilon solutions to round out our mid-range and unstructured all-flash portfolio. 
In data protection, we introduced a new turnkey integrated data protection appliance, which combines storage protection, search and analytics and an easy-to-deploy solution. In networking, we introduced the industry's first 25 Gig-E open networking switch for the software-defined data center, designed to go hand in hand with our new 14G servers. Additionally, we enhanced our software-defined storage solutions with new ScaleIO and ECS updates. For a full list of product announcements from Dell EMC World, please visit our website. 
Now turning back to results for the quarter. Total Q1 revenue for the ISG business was approximately $6.9 billion, with operating income of $323 million or 4.7% of revenue. There are a couple of factors to note regarding our operating margin performance. 
First, consistent with historical trends, Q1 is typically the seasonally low point for the year, and we expect operating margins to build through the year with volume. Second, we had some gross margin headwinds, including higher commodity costs and a mix shift between service and storage. And third, the core was impacted by a backlog build and some noncash charges from the decision to discontinue certain products. So overall, we were relatively pleased with our top line performance, and we are laser-focused on improving profit margins in Q2 and beyond. 
Looking at results by segment. Our Server and Networking revenue of $3.2 billion increased 5%. We remain the worldwide market leader in x86 server units, driven by our mainstream business, where we gained 200 basis points of unit share and 260 basis points of revenue share according to IDC. We continue to see strength in our mainstream PowerEdge business, with units and revenue up double digits in the fiscal quarter while our high-volume cloud business declined. 
In storage, we generated revenue of $3.7 billion. To give you a sense of our performance, orders demand in fiscal Q1 was down mid-single digits, a similar rate to Q4. As a reminder, results from market research firms are based on calendar quarters and the change in our fiscal year caused our calendar Q1 results to be void of a typical month 3 as the quarter linearity shifted towards April. 
While we were pleased with the performance of our high-end all-flash, hyper-converged infrastructure and software-defined storage solutions, we still have work to do in mid-range storage. Our improvement in this space will start by taking advantage of the products we announced at Dell EMC World and by focusing our direct and channel teams on this market opportunity. We also plan to extend our lead across all-flash storage with the broad range of product announcements I mentioned earlier. All-flash demand in the fiscal quarter grew very high double digits as customers modernized their IT infrastructure with our market-leading solutions. 
Demand in our hyper-converged portfolio, including VxRail and XC appliances as well as VxRack systems, continued to grow triple digits, driven by customer demand for fully integrated solutions. Additionally, the early response from our new Cloud Flex consumption model has been very positive, with initial interest exceeding our expectations. 
We also drove strong performance against the rest of our cloud strategy this quarter as well. Demand for our Virtustream Public Cloud for mission-critical applications grew approximately 100%. And later this year, we'll introduce a Virtustream edition of our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud to encompass mission-critical workloads on-prem with seamless connections to Virtustream Public Cloud. We also saw growth in our native hybrid cloud solutions, which are powered by Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the world's most powerful software -- the world's most powerful development platform and used by organizations to rapidly develop and run modern and legacy applications as start-up speeds. 
In summary, I am extremely excited about our position in the market and our ability to help our customers with their most critical IT transformation needs. We have a solid start to the year in most parts of the ISG business, with some work to do in mid-range storage. Profitability will improve as we move through the year, driven by volume, mix and the removal of some of the factors that impacted Q1. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom, who'll walk you through the Client Solutions Group.",968
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986905.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,5,"Thanks, David. The Client Solutions business had a good quarter. According to IDC, the overall market was better than expected for calendar Q1. Worldwide PC unit shipments for calendar Q1 grew by 0.8%, exceeding IDC's forecast of a negative 1.8%. This was the first positive year-over-year growth quarter for the industry since calendar Q1 of 2012. 
We gained share year-over-year for the 17th consecutive quarter, seeing positive unit growth in every region. According to IDC, Dell outperformed the worldwide market in both notebooks and desktops and in both Commercial and Consumer. We will continue to take share in this consolidating market, but we will do this while balancing growth and profitability. 
Moving to fiscal Q1 results. Revenue for CSG was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Both Commercial and Consumer saw growth in the quarter, up 3% and 12%, respectively, as we are seeing the benefits of improved go-to-market execution and investments that we've made in premium products and innovative form factors. 
Operating income was $374 million, down 3% on a tough compare and was 4.1% of revenue. The decline was primarily due to increases in certain component costs that were not -- that we were not able to fully offset through pricing actions within the quarter. 
We saw strong momentum continue across both high-end Consumer and Commercial notebooks as XPS and Mobile Workstations each saw double-digit growth and Latitude saw high single-digit growth. In addition, we continue to focus on driving higher attach of services and accessories, which also drive higher margins to our Client Solutions. Specifically, we continued to see higher attach rates for our ProSupport offerings for commercial client, and our displays business also had another solid quarter of revenue growth. 
We also mentioned during the Q4 call and the April Investor Meeting that we are making investments back in the business in emerging growth areas. Specifically for the client business, these investments include gaming, high-end notebooks and displays. In addition, we are expanding our consumer and small business focus to 12 countries as we build on the momentum we've achieved from the 5 countries where this program was initially launched. As Tyler and David have both mentioned, we are starting to see a change in how organizations address their IT needs, looking for new and more flexible consumption models to balance operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
In the client space, we introduced the Dell Technologies PC-as-a-Service solution, which combines the latest Dell Technologies PC hardware, software and end-to-end services, including deployment, management, security and support for a single, predictable price per seat per month. We were generally pleased with the performance of CSG this quarter, especially given the component cost environment. Going forward, we are focused on driving velocity in our commercial client business and expanding our customer base through profitable share gains. 
Now shifting to the VMware segment and other businesses. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue from the VMware segment was $1.7 billion, and operating income was $486 million or 28% of revenue. We have started to see revenue synergies materialize as our integration activities continue, and we see momentum across most of VMware's portfolio that continued. Specifically, emerging technologies saw strong growth driven by VSAN and NSX. 
Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi was $462 million. In the first quarter of fiscal '18, Pivotal delivered strong top line results, primarily driven by subscription software products, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal data suite. The team's momentum is being driven by new customer wins, increasing customer footprint and an expanding partner ecosystem, including deeper engineering collaboration with cloud infrastructure players. 
For example, in March 2017, Pivotal was named Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year. As SecureWorks reported in their earnings release on Tuesday, stand-alone revenue was approximately $114 million, up 14% as this business continues to focus on growing monthly recurring revenue. 
With the breadth of the Dell Technologies portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to win in today's IT environment and meet our customers' needs in their transformation journey. We believe our position is getting even stronger with our recent product announcements made at Dell EMC World and our new flexible consumption models offered through Dell Financial Services. 
In closing, we remain focused on executing our strategy and providing the right solutions for our customers as they move toward digital transformation. This was the first full quarter with the go-to-market changes, and we made reasonable progress to date. As a reminder, we discussed in previous calls that this transition could impact our results in the short term. We will continue to refine our sales coverage models as we move forward. 
As outlined at the Investor Meeting in April, we're focused on several key themes for fiscal '18. We want to strengthen our position as the essential infrastructure provider for our customers. We're a one-stop shop that offers customers a single set of solutions to help them navigate through the rapid transformation occurring in IT today. We want to grow at a premium to the market across product and solution categories, including servers, storage and commercial client. 
As we've said for several quarters, we will grow our top line, but it needs to be profitable growth and it makes sense for the overall business. We want to accelerate and move faster in the emerging growth opportunities such as all-flash, converged and hyper-converged and high-end notebooks and gaming. We will win in the hybrid and multi-cloud environment, which is the compute model of the future. We have great capabilities in reach and breadth, both from an infrastructure and from a management and orchestration perspective. We expect that customers will increasingly look for flexible solutions and as-a-service models as they enable their digital transformation. And finally, we will continue to work on cost and revenue synergies and driving a successful integration as we move forward. 
We know we still have work to do, but we're optimistic about the opportunities ahead with the Dell Technologies family of solutions and capabilities. We expect improvement over the course of the year as we refine the alignment of our sales force and our go-to-market changes mature and as we improve storage velocity.

Tom, you talked a couple of times about investing back in the business. Could you expand on that a little bit? You talked about what sort of things you're doing. But maybe if you could give us sort of a bigger-than-a-breadbox idea of how much you're putting back into the business and where on the income statement we'll see that. Is it mainly SG&A? Is it going to show up as some CapEx? That would be helpful.",82

Hey, I'm happy to do that. So look, as we talked about at the Investor Meeting on April and as we've talked in the past, as we've looked at the areas of focus as we move the company forward, there were a couple of incremental areas that we wanted to put some funding in. So if you think about the business units with ISG, we look to and have invested incremental dollars into the hybrid cloud and the converged and hyper-converged capabilities and solutions. You're going to see that in a couple of spots in the P&L, in the R&D spot, in the SG&A spot. We also have put money back in to expand and accelerate Virtustream. And so that -- those dollars are flowing in primarily in sales and primarily in some of the R&D capabilities that they're accelerating. If you think about just business, the client business, we're putting money into the sales area in terms of the expansion of the consumer and small business capabilities, sales and marketing, I should say, as we move from 5 countries to 12 countries. We're putting incremental dollars into its R&D budget and into its marketing budget around the high-end notebooks and around the gaming capabilities. So those are a few of the areas that we're investing in. We haven't quantified those investments publicly by line item, but our expectation is that they're sort of in the range between $150 million to $300 million over the course of the year. And we'll throttle those and adjust those as we need to given the dynamics of the business.",268

And then my follow-up question is on ISG. You mentioned softness in traditional hybrid arrays. So I wondered if maybe you could talk a little bit about why you're seeing that and if some of that softness is due to new products coming in and pushing aside some of the traditional sales. Or is it more customers maybe mixing hybrid with more public cloud business? If you could just give us a sense of what you saw and why you think that was a little bit soft this quarter.",93

Tom, this is David. Happy to answer that as well. So let's kind of step back and talk about the overall storage business. We said that we saw demand on a comparable basis down mid-single digits in total [indiscernible]. We're very pleased with -- we like how we did in high end. We like how we did in all-flash, with very high double-digit growth rates. We like how we did in hyper-converged and converged and hyper-converged combined. Software-defined storage was also strong. So the area where we didn't do quite so well was that traditional mid-tier section, the IDC mid-tier price band. And we see a couple of things there. We do have 2 product families in that space. We worked hard to position them. We've just introduced new versions of them, which is giving our customers and our partners a boost. We have -- are refocusing our go-to-market teams on that mid-tier. We've got a channel program focused on those opportunities. So we think it's much more focus and clarifying our product range than it is market area. In fact, we think the market for traditional mid-tier rates, in total, of hybrid and flash is actually growing. So when we look at our overall portfolio compared to market, which is my comment, the mid-tier band for the traditional kind of file, block storage arrays, combination of the hybrid and flash is the area we are doing a little worse than the market. And we believe it's due to the factors that we spoke about. As I mentioned, we have plans in place to address that. We just announced new versions of our mid-tier Unity platform, new versions of our SC platform that gives people a comfort that both platforms are being invested in. And we've mentioned we got our sales teams focused. We've adjusted compensation a little bit. We've rolled out some more aggressive channel programs, and we're also going out more aggressively to our big installed base across both those families. So those are the factors that kind of led to the comment relative to the market and also what we're doing about it.",357

I was wondering if you could provide some extra color on operating margins and the impact of higher component costs. Particularly on the ISG side, margins were down roughly 7% sequentially. We were just wondering if you could quantify sort of what portion was driven by higher component costs versus seasonality versus pricing. And then when it comes to servers, just wondering where you see your ability to raise prices going forward and sort of what the strategy is in that market.",90
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986914.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,14,"All right, [ Jacob ]. Thank you. Again, this is David. Let me take that. So let me kind of walk you through a little bit of a bridge from the 12 points of operating margin in Q4 to approximately the 5 points in Q1. The biggest factor, about 5 points in total of that difference, came from a combination of the volume trend, seasonally volume, obviously, down from Q4 to Q1, particularly in the storage business, and the related mix that has on the overall income statement as storage became a smaller part of the business. But also, very unusually for Q1, we actually built backlog in Q1. Think about a normal Q1, we will actually drain a lot of backlog. But at the end of the day, changes from the fiscal to the calendar, we actually built backlog in Q1. That was a headwind compared to Q4. So the combination of that volume trend, the mix related to it and the backlog build were about 5 points of margin. And the rest came from a number of factors: the increased commodity cost that we talked about, some pricing impact in the market and the impact of some of the onetime items I mentioned that related to the decision we made to rationalizing products in Q1. So those are the dynamics that relate to the, basically, approximately 7 points of operating margin from Q4 to Q1. Relative to servers, we are moving and have been moving to increase the pricing. We've made a number pricing actions in line with the component costs. But as Tom mentioned, there's only a certain percentage of that, that flows through in any period of time. A lot of customers have pricing structures in place that you can't adjust until they take their next order, plus the kind of competitive dynamic around who's moving pricing and when. We do expect to continue to move pricing up in servers. We've made a couple of actions this quarter. We think we'll probably have a bit more yield from that in Q2 than we had in Q1 because we've had a little bit longer to get in front of it, but that's the dynamic that's going in the server pricing market.",374

I did mention that we have seen increases, particularly in memory and SSDs. And to get -- if you just look at spot year-over-year in terms of some of the memory, I mean, it's up roughly 100% year-over-year. And you've got SSDs up roughly in the 20 to -- the low 20s type of year-over-year. So there is a headwind out there in component cost. As David mentioned, we are -- we have moved on pricing in a number of areas, but that is in -- you typically can't catch up fast enough. And that's just an area we're going to have to continue to focus on as we expect that those costs -- that cost environment is going to continue to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the rest of the year at this point.",153

And this is Rob. I think it's important to remember that when you're in an environment where you've got component costs changing, either in a deflationary environment or an inflationary environment, there's a lag effect. So we caught the benefit of the deflationary environment last year, and we're pushing against that headwind in the first part and through this year. And so as you think about this over a longer time period, we're pretty happy with the profitability of the business, but you're going to have some peaks and some lower points as you work through a rapidly changing component cost environment. So we'll lean into this, and we feel pretty good about it over the longer term.",119

So as I understand it, 5 points of margin was basically impacted by, it sounds like, some onetime items, whether it was seasonal or some of the backlog issues you were talking about. And then 2 points of margin was impacted by this increase in costs, input costs. As you think about the rest of the year and these higher input costs, can you just help us better understand your ability to pass through some of these to the customer base? And is there a time at which you expect to sort of cross over with regards to being able to fully pass through all of these input costs?",117
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986919.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,19,"Yes. Frank, this is David again. Let me just go back and clarify what contributed to the 5 points and what contributed to the rest of it. So there are 3 factors that contributed to the 5 points. One was the sequential volume change in Q4 to Q1. That's a normal factor. That, in turn, impacted mix to drive margin rate. The unusual thing that was in the 5 points was the fact that we actually built backlog during Q1, which we typically haven't done prior to this. So those are things that impacted the 5 points. There are 3 factors again that impacted the rest, one of which was the increased component costs. The other was just general pricing pressure in the marketplace, and the onetime items related to the product rationalization we did are in the rest. So just to kind of clarify, 3 things that make the 5 points, 3 things that make the rest. Now back to your comments. I'm really going to pick up where Rob left off. So in an environment where component costs are increasing and continue to increase, there is clearly a balance here in terms of we're trying to push as much of that in through the channel and raise prices and make those prices stick. Customers, of course, don't like paying more for what they paid for last quarter, and typically, in IT, that's not been the case. Typically, in the IT industry, they'll expect price decreases on a sequential basis, not price increases. So it's a fairly complex dynamic here where, first of all, for existing contracts, we've been going back and talking to customers about raising prices on their existing orders. That's sometimes a challenging conversation. But in some cases, it is a positive outcome; in some cases, it is not. And then for the new orders, we are trying to get the right balance between increasing our prices just at the same time as our component cost increase vis-à-vis trying to get away in front of that because we want to make sure we maintain the momentum we have in the market. Bear in mind that in the server business, where this is the most acute area, we had a great quarter, we gained significant basis points of market share, and we gained even more significant points of relative market share compared to our closest competitor. So it's a definitely balance here. We -- at the point at which those component costs stabilize, then all things kind of go back to normal and you go back to this environment that, hopefully, those start coming down again. But in this period where they're going up, there's a yield expectation, as we talked about. Certain amount of the pricing increase will actually stick and will yield the incremental return. Others will not because the customer either won't go there or somebody else in the market hasn't increased their pricing and you wind up in a competitive environment. So those are the things that go into it. It's not a precise science, but I just wanted to give you a bit more flavor as to the dynamics underneath it.",529

That's super helpful. Just as a follow-up, on the balance sheet, debt reduction now since EMC is about $7.1 billion, as you mentioned earlier. It only increased by about $100 million in the quarter though. So wanted to understand -- obviously, you continue to prioritize deleveraging, but can you help us think a little bit more about the seasonal cadence with regards to how you're thinking about paying down debt? And any kind of longer-term targets you might be willing to share at this point?",86

Look, Frank, this is Tyler. So I guess, starting with your last point first. I mean, nothing has changed in our desire to get back to investment-grade metrics, and so we are going to be very focused on working towards that. The timing, I mean, look, it's going to be a little bit lumpy, right? And some of this is going to be driven by the timing of our interest payments, which happen in -- predominantly in Q2 and Q4. Some of it's going to be in the -- our positioning for upcoming maturities. For example, in the first half of next year, we've got some of the legacy investment-grade stuff that's coming off. So it's not going to be a straight linear path. But I think if you -- if I look forward to the end of the year, we are going to take more debt out. Now I'll kind of bifurcate or separate out DFS because that debt related to DFS, that's good debt, right? We want that business to grow, and we saw the good growth this quarter as the originations grew. And so you mentioned a little bit about our debt going up. I mean that was a result of adding the additional structured financing debt. So without getting into, which quarter are we going to pay down meaningful amounts? Just stay tuned, right? Because you'll see this come off at a pretty regular pace over time.",242

Also remember that Q1 is seasonally our lowest cash generation quarter given it tends to be our weakest quarter from an overall business velocity perspective as well as we typically see higher bonus-related payments and things like that in Q1. So we -- our expectation was -- is that we weren't going to do much from a debt reduction perspective in Q1, and I think we're right where we thought we would be at this point.",81

Look, if you look at our balance sheet, right, I mean, kind of focus just on the Dell Technologies side ex VMware, we ended the quarter with more than $6 billion. So we obviously have some room there. And like I said, some of this is going to be around positioning for whether it be next quarter's larger interest payments. And we do have some areas where we've got some trapped cash that we actively focus on. This does include the cash that we used to fund our [ FABs ], right, so ex VMware, like Pivotal and Boomi. And so that's just the expectation and the offset and what you can see going forward.",117

Credit investors in Dell aren't as familiar with the storage business, I guess a lot of the questions are going to be around that. And so when we look at typical seasonality for the storage market, it seems like you were reasonably pleased with how the quarter went from the transition, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And can you talk about how that seasonality plays out and through? Because it looks -- it sounds like operating leverage was the biggest factor in some of the margins, and the margin declined in the first quarter of this year. And then maybe you could talk about the -- how the sales force is adapting to what is now a Dell quarter end as opposed to a calendar quarter end and how -- what kind of disruptions that made.",151
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986926.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,26,"All right, David. Yes, thank you, and appreciate the bonus question for me. So storage, yes, much more seasonally variable than the server business, for example, so a fairly large ramp at the end of the year, then obviously a sequential decline in Q1. Typically, the storage business then builds up from there, with Q2 being a fairly large uptick sequentially from Q1 to Q2, Q2 and Q3 being approximately the same as for revenues, then Q4 being another uptick. So absolutely, David, to your point, as we go through the year, we do expect to see operating margins in ISG increase, and that'd be driven by a number of different factors. So we're going to see that seasonal volume improvements. That, in turn, will create a mix shift back towards storage that will help. We expect that the backlog build impact in Q1 will kind of normalize out. Hopefully, backlog will not build in Q2 or Q3. It might build a little bit and it typically does build in Q4, but does not because the volume levels are so high. We will, across the business, see the impact of pricing actions kick in, which we talked about. I'm going to come back to the go-to-market question because that will help drive. And some of the onetime factors that we saw in Q1, we don't expect to be there. So those are all things that will bode positive going through the year. Also, related to go-to-market, and I'll come back to the specifics, we do expect to see total storage velocity improve as we move throughout the year as we expected it to from product announcements and also just from the vetting in of go-to-market teams. Now to your question on the go-to-market side, obviously, as Tom has talked about on prior calls, what we did at the start of the year in January was a fairly significant change. We went from 2 forces that were legacy Dell, legacy EMC, focused upon the way that they were structured, and within those structures, there were differences, to 2 combined and integrated units: so one focused upon enterprise customers, the largest few thousand customers in about 20 different segmented countries; and one focused on everything else. So there are a lot of moving parts in the sales force, and not surprisingly, that did cause a little bit of disruption. We had to get quotas out, territory assignment, planning, training people on all the new products. So we expected some impacts in Q1. And actually, when you look at it, and I said that from an ISG point of view demand grew at mid-single digits in total, I'm actually quite pleased about that given all the things that we've changed in the sales structure. And the last comment you made was relative to moving towards the quarter end, we did see demand shift a little bit out of what would have been a calendar quarter to a fiscal quarter. So we saw the quarter-end effect with more business in April than we saw in March, which would have been the traditional quarter end. The good news was that, that was a bit more smooth in terms of less of a hockey stick, if I can call it, after quarter end than it would have been when we were still tied to the fiscal quarters. So all in all, with everything else moving on, I'm quite pleased about that. The one comment I will come back to is of course, that demand shift means we didn't have a traditional month 3 in the calendar quarter. Now when you see the IDC data this week, market share things, we expect that to reflect the fact that essentially the quarter end moved into the next quarter and, therefore, year-on-year comparison is going to be a little funky.",641

That helps very much. And can we talk just kind of on the overall component costs? You've mentioned it's not typical that you go back to your client and say, ""Hey, memory prices are up whatever, 100% year-over-year, and we'd like to charge you more sequentially."" So 2 things. One, has the rate of increase on memory prices, has that slowed recently? And where do you peak out on the year-over-year ramp? It looks like some time in this quarter. And have you talked to some of your customers -- and maybe one of the things that's happened when memory prices have changed is that, well, we use a little bit less memory or a little bit slower memory. So how has demand been and all that process gone?",130
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2017",2017-06-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3461.0,1225282.0,49986928.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,28,"David, it's Tom. Let me take that. So I would tell you that from a pace of -- you don't have perfect clarity here. But our expectation is, is that Q2 is the most significant move in terms of component cost increases, although right now, we are also looking into Q3 and seeing where we originally had thought it might stabilize and perhaps even potentially drop, it now looks like it's going to continue to rise on us but perhaps not at the -- as fast as it has been over the last quarter or 2. So I think that we still have to -- and all of this, obviously, is a function of the demand-supply balance out there in the market, right? And so to the extent that demand softens in some of the other areas where memory is used, and that perhaps will help us on the PC and server memory, to the extent it stays strong, then I think the dynamics are going to continue to be tight from that overall balance. So it's one of those things that we periodically go through from a cycle perspective. It's been 5 or 6 years, I think, since we last went through one of these cycles where we got into an inflationary environment, but that's where we are right now. And again, that's just part of being in this industry, and we're going to have to work our way through it. And so look, I'm optimistic that we'll manage our way through this, but there is a lot of moving pieces here. In terms of your question on, hey, as you think about how do you manage your way through it, do you go back and talk to customers about perhaps descaling their memory inputs, and that's -- as well that would be a logical conversation that generally is not what we're seeing. In fact, what we are seeing right now is increased memory on the units that are going out given all of the demands of the application environment and workloads today. And so it's a bit of a double whammy if you think about it, right? We've got incremental component cost increases as well as you've got more memory on a per-unit basis, and the combination of that is -- puts some pressure on the pricing dynamic that you've got to work your way through. But that's what we pay the organization to go out and manage their way through, and that's what we're all trying to adjust. So through all of the actions that David mentioned, whether it's list price moves, conversation with customers about raising contract prices, all of those levers are being pulled in a balanced way such that we don't stall the business, and that's what we're trying to navigate through.",468

And then, look, in addition to that, you're starting to see really some of those working capital initiatives. You're seeing some of that flow through DPO as well. So there's always going to be some seasonality and fluctuations in how working capital adjusts quarter-over-quarter. But to your point, I think as you work through the end of the year, you will see some benefits coming in.",111

And then just a broader question probably for Tom. Just wanted to understand, on the cost side, how are you -- I mean, are you thinking about any sort of additional cost savings plans or sort of any acceleration on that front since it sounds like you're expecting the margin from the component side to be a little bit sort of -- continue to sort of be elevated in terms of pressure for the back half of the year?",81

Look, I mean, we're on track on our synergy given the actions that we've been driving. Look, the reality of our business is we're always looking at costs. So it's not like we set a target and we all go away and do something else. And I know you didn't mean it like that. But we're constantly looking at are there other efficiencies we can drive and what can we do to improve the cost structure, and so we're continuing to look at that. We're already into sort of the next-generation planning around cost and what's the activities we need to get at. So we're monitoring sort of the status of the business as we move through the year, and we're ultimately looking at how do we deliver operating income. And so the leverage we're pulling are around what kind of margin delivery do you have versus the cost environment. And to the extent that things are moving around at us, we'll adjust as we need to as we go forward. So again, I'm optimistic on our cost programs, and we'll continue to take a look at them and balance as we go forward.",197

Let me start. This is David. I'll talk to you [ about ] what we announced and where the product impact is. So we announced a new -- we announced a couple of new programs. One is called Cloud Flex, which is a -- basically a fixed and reducing monthly payment that applies to a hyper-converged system. So you're right. Our XC series on VxRail, very simple, a customer signs up, we ship them the box. They have a 12-month minimum, and if they don't like it after 12 months, they stop paying and return the box to us. That obviously puts that product on a ratable revenue recognition. There was another offering we introduced called Flex On Demand, which applies to things that we can meter or monitor so that could be storage arrays, it could be our data protection appliance, et cetera. And in that environment, the customer basically is charged based upon usage. And then we do have the ability for certain situations to go to a full, broader data center utility if a customer wants to take their entire environment and put it into a variable mode. So those are the 3 things that we announced. And obviously, Cloud Flex applies to hyper-converged. The Flex On Demand is more storage and backup, and the data center utility could be a broader engagement across the full portfolio with a customer. And finally, our software license agreements, we also -- we introduced some changes to those, we call them our transformational license agreements or TLAs, that will make them more flexible for the customer in terms of the customer's ability to substitute titles and pay for maintenance as they start using things rather than all upfront. And that would apply to the software portfolio inside of Dell EMC. So those are kind of the 4 things that we rolled out at Dell EMC World. In terms of impact and timing, I'll turn it over to Tom or Tyler.",334

And so I think, overall, what we're -- which is the opportunity for customers for 1 monthly price per seat to get the hardware, the services, the support model all wrapped into one price. And so we are seeing significant interest in customers thinking through how do they convert CapEx to OpEx, how do they provide more flexibility in their cost structure. And so all of the programs that David just talked about and the ones that -- and the PC-as-a-Service are generating pretty good interest from a customer perspective. And so we're happy with the receptivity. It's early, the impact to date is relatively small. And generally, they don't have a significant cash impact. So -- but we're optimistic that there's a framework here that is attractive to our customers in the sense of how do they manage their own economics even as they make their digital transformation.",174

Wonder if you could comment on your ability to raise prices on PCs relative to servers. HPE has talked about trying to raise server prices but having difficulty in the U.S. and Europe due to price competition. And then, I also wondered if you could comment your -- you mentioned that your cloud volume business was weak. Is that specifically hyperscaler? And is that temporary? Or is that something that's going to be more ongoing?",76

Look, I mean, the PC pricing dynamic, first and foremost, as all of you know, right, it is a pretty competitive pricing environment out there. But having said that, we are -- we have been able to move prices up, right? Now again, you get a yield effect, right, because the quarter you do it, you don't get the entire impact. And you've got -- in our business, given the direct model that we have in many instances, you have a pool of quotes out there that you have to work through. But we have been, I would say, reasonably successful in adjusting prices, and that adjustment comes in a number of ways. One is it could be list price. It could be the pricing authority that we give our sales organization in perhaps lowering that -- those discount thresholds a little bit to or adjusting those discount thresholds to narrow their pricing flexibility. And/or -- and in many instances, it's also about ensuring that we're configuring the right product for the customer needs. And so as -- much like the motion we have in servers, it's a variety of actions that we're driving here to manage our way through the cost environment. And so look, we're -- again, I think this is just a fact of life in the business that we're in, that every so often we're going to hit these cycles. And I think it's the -- it's going to be up to us to ensure that we execute our way through this in a way that manages the P&L as best we can given the environment. And remember that we're doing all these pricing adjustments while not wanting to stall out demand because we are pleased with the velocity of the business. And the PC business had a -- the client business had a really nice quarter. And so the last thing we want to do is shut that spigot off, but we do want to try and feather this a little bit in the sense of trying to creep margin dollars up and as we drive through the year. So that's the activity we have going on. I'm -- work to do, but -- and part of that will also depend upon how the component cost environment behaves as we go through the year in the sense of our overall success and being able to do that. David, you want to address that cloud comment?",425

Steve, yes, I do. I think you're talking about the dynamics within the server business, where, as I said, our mainstream PowerEdge business, we saw units and revenue up double digits. We got -- we gained significant share points in terms of 200 basis points of unit share, 260 basis points of revenue share in mainstream. And as we said on the call, the high volume in terms of volume of service going out but still a small percentage of our overall server business. That business selling to the cloud hyperscale providers was down during the quarter. Bear in mind that tends to be lumpy, and it's also lower-octane fuel -- or lower-octane business than the mainstream PowerEdge. So those are the dynamics we talked about inside of service, if that helps.",133

As we think about how do we manage margin, if you will, as we go through this, one of the things you've got to remember is that we have an advantage with our -- like direct sales force is our attach motion right. So one of the things you also try to do in an environment like this is make sure that you're attaching extended service opportunities, SMP opportunities. And we saw nice growth in both of our -- on our attach rates both in the server space and in the client space in terms of ProSupport Plus, and we also saw a good attach and good velocity in our displays business.

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our second quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q2 financial results will also be filed on Form 10-Q tomorrow, September 8. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective.
Consistent with prior periods, our Q2 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $2.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and related to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and, to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments.
As a reminder, please note that our second quarter fiscal 2017 historical results do not include EMC, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which may not be comparable due to the merger. During this call, we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are disclosed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

Today marks the first anniversary of the Dell and EMC merger. I want to highlight what our Dell Technologies family of businesses have accomplished over the last year. We've combined 2 great companies, creating the essential infrastructure company with over 140,000 employees. We've unified 2 global world-class sales forces and launched an integrated channel program, both of which are helping to drive strong velocity in revenue synergies across the segments, specifically for clients, servers and VMware. We've rapidly delevered, paying down approximately $9.5 billion of gross debt after excluding DFS-related debt, and we've repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V Common Stock, totaling $1.1 billion.
We've expanded our Dell Financial Services, or DFS, portfolio to approximately $6.7 billion in financing receivables, up 30% year-over-year. And we are now the exclusive originator of the Dell EMC business and the preferred finance partner for VMware. And we're driving industry leadership in multiple categories, including newer solutions such as all-flash and hyperconverged infrastructure.
We also recently closed multiple large deals, including a multiyear, multisolution agreement with General Electric. This is just one example of the interest we are seeing from our customers to enter into large, multiyear agreements, which further validates the powerful combination we've created for our customers.
We have been pleased with the velocity in many areas of the business and with the strong demand for our newer solutions. While the integration has gone relatively smoothly in many areas, we recognize that we still have work to do to drive profitability higher and improve velocity in our storage business. As we work to improve these areas, we'll continue to stay focused on balancing growth and profitability.
Moving to our results for the second quarter. We were pleased with the top line momentum in the client business, servers and networking, hyperconverged and infrastructure and all-flash arrays. Margin pressure persisted in parts of the business given the component cost environment and mix dynamics within the Infrastructure Solutions Group.
For Q2, GAAP revenue was $19.3 billion with a GAAP operating loss of $1 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $19.6 billion. While year-over-year compares for ISG and VMware segments are not meaningful, the Client Solutions group grew revenue 7% to its highest revenue level in 3 years.
On a stand-alone basis, VMware reported a revenue growth rate of 12%. Gross margin at the consolidated level was $6.1 billion or 31.1% of revenue, which was impacted by a challenging component cost environment and mix shifts within ISG. We continue to believe memory costs will be a headwind through the remainder of the year even as we work to minimize the impact on the P&L.
OpEx was $4.5 billion or 23.2% of revenue. We remain focused on cost optimization and executing our cost initiatives while also investing back in the business for the long-term success of the company. Operating income was $1.6 billion or 7.9% of revenue.
I will now turn it over to Tyler to provide commentary on adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure.",501
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2017",2017-09-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3471.0,1295453.0,52221572.0,Presenter Speech,Tyler Johnson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom. We had a strong quarter of cash generation in Q2 and paid down additional debt. Cash from operations was $1.8 billion, driven predominantly by profitability and ongoing working capital initiatives. Cash flow was impacted by interest payments, tax payments and strong growth in our DFS business.
As a reminder, the majority of our interest payments occur in Q2 and Q4. The strong cash flow generation enabled us to repay $1 billion of core debt during the quarter. Our cash and investments balance was $15.3 billion, up approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 19% -- was up 19% sequentially to $1.9 billion or 9.5% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see Slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments.
We ended the second quarter with $49.9 billion in total principal debt, down $800 million from the prior quarter as the $1 billion of core debt pay down was partially offset by an increase in structured financing debt that funds DFS. Our core debt ended the quarter at $40.5 billion, which is down from $48.8 billion at the time we closed the transaction last September. The remaining $9.4 billion of principal debt consisted of debt that funds our DFS business, the $2 billion margin loan and the $1.5 billion bridge facility backed by VMware legacy intercompany notes due to EMC Corp.
Early in the third quarter, VMware completed a $4 billion debt offering and used a portion of proceeds to repay $1.23 billion of the legacy intercompany notes. Dell Technologies used the proceeds from this partial payment of the intercompany notes along with other cash to repay the $1.5 billion bridge facility. Including these latest debt payments, we've paid approximately $9.5 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS-related debt, since closing the EMC transaction. We've provided a breakdown of our capital structure on Slide 8 of the web deck.
To simplify the discussion going forward, in addition to categorizing the DFS-related debt as noncore, we are creating a new line item for subsidiary debt that will include the recent VMware debt issuance. This aligns with how we present our capital structure to the rating agencies and should help limit confusion, focusing our leverage discussions on core debt for Dell Technologies.
As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we continue to see growth in our DFS business. In Q2, originations were approximately $1.6 billion, and financing receivables grew to approximately $6.7 billion, up 30% year-over-year as DFS continues to benefit from the expanded base now including EMC and VMware. We also expanded our DFS operations to Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter.
I want to remind everyone that as the DFS business grows, so our DFS-related debt, which includes both allocated corporate debt and structured financing. In Q2, DFS-related debt ended approximately $600 million higher than the prior quarter. We realized this increases the total gross leverage of the company, but this debt is supported and repaid by financing receivables and does not impact our overall deleveraging plans.
Jumping to our share repurchase program. We have repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V common since inception of the program. This includes 13 million shares under the Class V Group repurchase program. On August 24, we announced that our board has approved a second amendment to our existing Class V Group repurchase program for up to $300 million over 6 months, which we intend to solely fund through a new Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. This combined arrangement remains an efficient way to repurchase shares, benefiting both Dell Technologies and VMware shareholders. We are pleased with our continued cash flow generation and the progress we've made on our deleveraging goals to date, and we remain committed to our conservative financial policy and overall capital allocation strategy.
Let me turn it over to David.",646
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2017",2017-09-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3471.0,1295453.0,52221573.0,Presenter Speech,David Goulden,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tyler. ISG continue to drive solid overall demand with orders up mid-single digits year-on-year. While server orders velocity remained strong, storage orders declined in the mid-single digits, consistent with the last 2 quarters. We have robust plans to improve our storage order growth rate, which I'll expand on in just a moment.
But before we get further into our results, I wanted to highlight some of the broad trends across the business. This quarter showcased the power of the Dell Technologies portfolio as we drove revenue synergies across the family and signed several large multiyear strategic deals. The largest of these deals was a landmark partnership with GE. The new agreement was one of the largest nongovernment contracts in our history and makes us GE's primary IT infrastructure provider. Our broad portfolio and position as a private controlled company gives us the flexibility to partner with our customers on a long-term basis in a manner that best matches their needs, and we've made some proactive decisions to lean into these long-term relationship opportunities with our major customers.
A key example is the introduction of a new set of flexible consumption models, or FCMs. These include long-term utility-like structures that are billed monthly and new transformational software license agreements, or TLAs, that are billed or financed upfront and make it more flexible for customers to substitute titles and pay for maintenance. Both utility and TLAs have ratable revenue recognition characteristics that over time should drive more predictable and recurring revenue streams through our P&L.
Turning to results for the quarter. Total Q2 revenues for the ISG business was approximately $7.4 billion, up 7% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by our Server and Networking segment with revenue of $3.7 billion, up 16% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. We saw good demand for our recently launched 14th generation PowerEdge server portfolio and are making good progress against our revenue synergy targets. Overall, server demand grew in each of our major regions.
In networking, our open networking strategy continues to gain momentum in the software-defined data center and with strategic cloud and service provider customers. Our focused investments in the service provider market help drive more than 20% orders growth across the ISG portfolio.
Our storage revenue of $3.7 billion was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, with orders up mid-teens quarter-on-quarter. The primary differences between our reported sequential revenue and orders demand was growth in our product backlog and an increase in flexible consumption deals. We also continued to see strong growth in our Virtustream enterprise class public cloud, with revenue growing more than 50% each quarter since the merger.
As a reminder, the change in our fiscal year will cause third-party storage market share figures to compare different year-on-year fiscal periods until calendar Q2 2018. Our storage market share figures are also impacted by flexible consumption models as more business is recognized ratably.
Business model and calendar shifts aside, we still have work to do to improve our storage velocity, especially in the higher transaction volume commercial segment of the markets. Our action plan includes better alignments of our sales teams through quota changes and modify incentive programs to better emphasize and capture storage opportunities. We're also adding several hundred storage specialists across our commercial go-to-market segments, our global storage specialty team and our channel team to increase our storage go-to-market capacity. We expect the impact of these changes to build over the next few quarters.
To go hand in hand with these go-to-market initiatives, we'll continue to arm our sales team with a leading portfolio of products, and we're seeing good traction from the product introductions at Dell EMC World this past May. For example, demand for our Isilon scale-out NAS grew double digits this quarter driven by our new Infinity architecture, which offers up to 6x IOPS, 11x the throughput and 2x the capacity of the prior generation. We also started shipping our new integrated data protection appliance late in the quarter and have a strong pipeline heading into Q3.
In all-flash, we continue to see good growth at scale on a more than 2x the size of our nearest competitor. Our portfolio enhanced with a strong first quarter for our new VMAX 950 solution and in Q3, we expect further benefit from the launch of our new XtremIO solution X2. Our hyperconverged portfolio continues to grow triple digits with strength in both XC and VxRail. Since the global launch of VxRail in March 2016, we sold more than 14,000 nodes to more than 2,000 customers. In addition, we have several exciting announcements planned for later this year to further strengthen our storage market position.
Moving down to the income statements. Our operating income for ISG was $430 million or 5.8% of revenue. During Q&A on the last call, we talked about 5 factors that will drive operating income improvement through the year. These factors were a seasonal volume improvements, a mix shift towards storage, more normalized backlog, pricing actions and improved storage go-to-market capabilities. Let me walk you through how each of these played out.
During the quarter, seasonal volume improvements drove higher operating income dollars from servers. And while we experienced solid seasonal volume improvements in storage orders, storage revenue was approximately flat sequentially due to the flexible consumption models and a build of higher margin storage backlog. This impacted the server storage revenue mix within ISG.
The pricing actions we took offset a portion of the commodity cost increases, but we still faced headwinds in the quarter. And lastly, we are seeing storage go-to-market momentum with larger customers, and we have solid plans in place to improve order velocity in the higher transaction volume commercial segment of the market. Overall, storage growth rates were similar -- storage order growth rates were similar in Q2 to Q4 and Q1. We expect to see improved storage order growth rates in the second half.
So to net things out from an orders perspective, improvement is starting to play out as expected, but the increase in flexible consumption models and an in-quarter backlog build dampened the impact to the P&L. Notably, the impact to cash flow from these items is less than the impact to the income statements. We expect these factors to continue to be the key drivers of operating margin improvements through the rest of the fiscal year.
In summary, we continue to drive hard against operational improvement targets in our go-to-market product portfolio and cost-out initiatives. We are encouraged by the overall velocity in the ISG group, and we are seeing the rationale between -- behind the Dell EMC merger playing out. We're leveraging our product portfolio and our ownership structure to build long-term customer relationships, and we believe we have an unmatched set of capabilities in the marketplace.
Let me turn it back to Tom, who will walk you through the Client Solutions Group.",1145

The Client Solutions business had another strong quarter as we continue to take share globally while growing profitably.
According to IDC, Dell outperformed the worldwide market, growing units 3.7% in calendar Q2 compared to a total industry decline of 3.1%. We gained share year-over-year for the 18th consecutive quarter and hit our highest market share since 2006, with unit gains across every major region. We expect to continue to take share in this consolidating market with our focus on balancing growth and profitability.
Moving to fiscal Q2 results. Revenue for CSG was $9.9 billion, up 7% and was our highest revenue quarter since Q2 of fiscal 2015. Consumer revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in notebooks, continued strength in gaming and by initial traction from our CSB key country expansion program. Commercial grew 6%, due in part to expansion of our customer base as well as strength in the channel, mobile solutions and attached services.
Operating income was $566 million, up 17% or 5.7% of revenue. CSG did benefit from a vendor settlement of approximately $70 million, which impacted the op inc rate by approximately 70 basis points. We continue to execute on profitable growth despite ongoing challenges from the component costs and competitive environments.
Let me go into a bit more detail on our momentum in CSG. This segment is benefiting from the execution of our strategic investments in growth areas of the market. We saw strong momentum continue across both high-end commercial and consumer notebooks as Latitude, Mobile Workstations and XPS each had double-digit growth during Q2.
In calendar Q2, Dell ranked #1 in unit share for workstations worldwide. The expansion of our consumer and small business focus to 12 countries also helped drive growth in revenue and profitability. In addition to strength in notebooks, we are having success driving higher attach of services and accessories.
Specifically, displays revenue grew double digits during fiscal Q2. And according to display search in calendar Q1, Dell remained the #1 display provider worldwide, which marks the 16th consecutive quarter. We also saw higher attach rates for our premium client service offering, ProSupport Plus, primarily driven by our commercial client business.
CSG has been performing well while managing a tough component cost environment. As we continue to work through these cost headwinds, we remain focused on continuing to drive velocity in our commercial client business and on expanding our customer base through profitable share gains.
Now shifting to the VMware segment and other businesses. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue from the VMware segment was $1.9 billion, and operating income was $561 million or 29.4% of revenue. Stand-alone VMware reported license and subscription bookings up double digits along with strength in NSX and VSAN.
We are pleased with momentum we've seen in cross-selling across the portfolio between the VMware and Dell sales forces as we leverage the family of businesses to expand our customer base. We look for this business to continue to grow as it goes to market with its new product offerings, including VMware cloud on AWS and VMware app defense announced at VMworld last week.
We are excited about another announcement made last week at VMworld that truly simplifies that Dell Technologies is better together. VMware and Pivotal launched Pivotal Container Service, or PKS, in collaboration with Google Cloud, delivering a simple way to deploy and operate production-ready Kubernetes containers on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud platform.
Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $472 million. Pivotal again delivered strong top line results, with rapid growth in Pivotal Cloud Foundry software solutions. In addition, the team continues to increase its customer footprint and expand its partner ecosystem. SecureWorks released its stand-alone earnings yesterday, where it reported double-digit revenue growth to $116 million, continued gross margin expansion and solid operating cash flow. This business continues to focus on growing revenue and improving profitability as it looks to accelerate momentum heading into next year.
In closing, we've had many bright spots over the past year in the Dell Technologies family of businesses, with good velocity in client, servers, all-flash, hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined data center, great progress on debt pay down and steady expansion of our DFS portfolio. But as we said on past calls, we did expect some disruption due to the many changes brought into the organization, particularly in go-to-market.
I think it's also fair to remind everyone that we've been doing this while managing our way through the most challenging cost environment in over a decade. We believe we're making the right decisions for the long-term health of the business. And though we have made progress, we have work to do. Some of these decisions may take longer to impact the results as we move forward.
As a privately controlled entity, we have the flexibility to make these long-term decisions. We are the only provider that has this level flexibility and breadth of solutions that can offer a single set of solutions, and this is resonating with customers and partners. We're pleased with how far we've come over the past year and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to focus on growing faster than the market, accelerating in growth opportunities like all-flash and hyperconverged and winning in the hybrid and multicloud environment. We remain committed to driving cash flow generation, delevering the balance sheet and balancing cost actions with investments to position the business for the long-term success.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",925

You talked about the 5 factors that would drive sequentially better performance, and you did show 110 basis points of operating margin improvement in the quarter on a sequential basis. But historically, we would have seen a little bit better quarter-over-quarter growth. And obviously, on a year-over-year basis, it was down. So can you just help me better understand was it -- obviously, you should have had the seasonal uplift. But when you think about the storage business in particular, how do we think about improving the trajectory of the business? And how quickly can that happen with regards to thinking about the sales force additions and other actions you're taking there?",128

Yes, this is David. Let me handle that for you. So yes, as you said, we did see a modest improvement sequentially, and the 5 factors that we talked about that would kind of let us improve during the year are the key factors. From a storage point of view, we saw what we expected in terms of sequential growth to play out from orders point of view. We had a sequential order growth in storage in the mid-teens. It's just kind of the way you would expect to go from a Q1 to a Q2. But as I mentioned, sequentially, the revenue was roughly flat. That was impacted by 2 factors. One was a build in storage backlog due to the timing of when the orders came in, in the quarter and our decision not to try and chase that backlog all out of the door in the actual quarter. And also, our choice to lean into these flexible consumption models, which let us have long-term relationships with customers but basically those are recognized ratably. So we did see things playing out from a sequential order growth point of view. But the 2 factors that I mentioned dampened the impact on the sequential growth. The last factor that you mentioned was the go-to-market adds, where we're doing very well in 2 of the major growth markets in storage in all-flash and hyperconverged. The third area is the traditional mid-range storage system, which is heavily weighted to the commercial marketplace, where as I mentioned, we're adding several hundred sales specialists, we're modifying our incentives and really engineering the way we go after that mid-market opportunity more aggressively, and that will start to build over the next several quarters. So those are the things that kind of altogether impacted what you saw happening in the storage business in the quarter.",311

And so as I sort of walk that forward and think about a year ago, right, 3Q 2017, we typically seasonally see a pretty big bump in terms of margin performance for this segment. And so when I think about the seasonal uplift into 3Q plus the backlog that you've essentially held back for the quarter and the order momentum that you're generating there plus the sales force, should we expect a typical 3Q margin trajectory for the ISG segment?",82

And typically just to kind of go back to the heritage EMC model, typically Q2 and Q3 are relatively similar from a top line point of view. So any changes in operating margin are kind of more related to kind of mix and backlog movements and things like that. Obviously, exactly how much of the quarter winds up being in flexible consumption models is yet to be quite figured out. That's the kind of lumpy factor. A few large deals make a big difference. But from a top line point of view, don't expect any significant difference really in the storage segments, which will be perhaps the biggest driver of operating margin as you move forward sequentially into Q3. Obviously, Q4 is the much bigger quarter.",140

And while the revenue that you produced was about in line with what we were thinking, the actual cost, especially on the Client Solutions side was -- were better than what we thought. So I wondered. You talked a little bit, Tom, about what things that you were doing to offset those costs on the cost of sales sides. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on that? And then I have a follow-up.",102

So look, we did tell you, I think, back in Q1 when we did this call that the sequential jump in component costs from Q1 to Q2 was relatively significant. And as we look forward, we still think memory costs will be a headwind for the year, although we do think that Q2 to Q3, the sequential jump will be significantly less than what we saw in Q2. But it's obviously going to be a headwind. But having said that, look, I mean, we haven't been static about what we're doing in the sense of managing configuration. We have adjusted price a number of times as we balance both list price moves and our overall discounting frame work that we've used, particularly in our commercial base. And I would tell you that in general, we've seen reasonably good success sort of navigating through this. It's obviously not perfect. And in general, what we have seen is a gradual mitigation of the component cost environment. Now the question is as you go forward is balancing that, those pricing actions and component and our configuration actions that you're doing and trying to balance that growth velocity with profitability. And so it's a careful balance here because as you know, Tom, we're a believer in premium growth to the market, and you got to be careful around making sure that as you adjust prices appropriately, you're not somehow stymieing demand. And so it's been a balance that way. I think the team's done a pretty good job, particularly in the client and in the server space on sort of navigating through that. There's more work to do. So I don't want to tell you that we've been perfect in that execution, particularly as I look at the server business, I think that there's an opportunity to continue to adjust, and we're pleased with the performance so far that we're seeing early in Q3 in that area. Also, as you think about some of the storage and server space, particularly you get a bit more lag in terms of how effective the price moves are given some of the longer nature of the contracts. And so price moves feather in over a bit longer time frame, particularly in the data center space. So all in all, look, I think the team's done a pretty reasonable job. We'll see how the environment migrates over the next couple of quarters and on into next year. And we'll continue to manage to drive both velocity of the business as well as margin dollars. So that's the balance we're trying to thread right now.",438

And then for my follow-up, I just want to be clear on the takeaway that you want us to have regarding deleveraging. Because while -- I'm sure everyone appreciates that the details of getting a level of core debt and other debt and -- I want to make sure that we walk away with the right thought process and how you think about deleveraging. When you talk about deleveraging, are we talking about all debt to all EBITDA, the way that you book it? Or are we talking about subtracting out VMware debt or subtracting out VMware EBITDA or some other measure? How will you guys -- when you say that you're deleveraging, how should we think about what that means?",122

Tom, and I'll let Tyler do most of the heavy lifting on this question, but let me just be real clear with everybody as we think about delevering. We are focused on delevering the balance sheet, and we tend to talk about delevering as it relates to core debt, okay? And Tyler will take you through what we mean by core debt. Clearly, the capital structure is getting a bit more complicated as we think about core debt, debt that supports our DFS business, which is backed by the cash flow from the financing receivables and now we have subsidiary debt with VMware, which is backed by the VMware cash flow. So I am very focused on core debt delevering. That's been our focus. That's what you've heard us talk about, and Tyler perhaps can go into a bit more detail on how we're managing through that and trying to provide you actually a bit more detail about it so that it's clearer to you, and you can give us feedback whether we're successful in that area.",178

But keep in mind, right, we've always talked about VMware or our cash balance ex VMware, right? So when you look at VMware's ability to pay off or to manage the debt load that they've taken on the $4 million is obviously -- they're obviously very comfortable with that, and the rating agencies are very comfortable with that. And then we want to always be very distinct about DFS, and I think you've heard me talk about it historically where I almost referred that as good debt, because that's debt which is allowing our business to grow. It's supporting our customer needs. It's being settled through the financing receivables that come with that. And as those kind of amortize down or pay down, right, that's what settles that debt. So to Tom's point, we look at everything, but core debt is where you'll really see the emphasis of the deleveraging, right, which includes the term loans and the investment-grade notes and the debt that was really there to fund the acquisition of EMC, the debt which is ultimately settled through our cash flow generation and EBITDA generation.

Can you just talk about if there are any further changes or challenges in the overall industry regarding the shift to flash and weakness in traditional and kind of mid-market? And what gives you confidence you can improve the orders in the second half of the year from where they've been on a year-over-year basis?,62
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2017",2017-09-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3471.0,1295453.0,52221591.0,Answer,David Goulden,,Executives,22,"Yes. Jeff, thank you. This is David. Let me take that. So within the storage industry, we're seeing -- I think the biggest kind of trend, which you see is a shift in the market mix towards more the mid-range storage system. So the high end of the market, the systems of -- they're over $500,000 are -- that market is declining and has been declining in the kind of mid-teens percentage range. And the growth in the market is in the mid-range, the mid-range systems has become more capable. It's still a significant difference in terms of the core capabilities of the kind of multiprocessor, scale up, scale out high-end systems, but nevertheless, the growth is in the mid-range. So that's a big dynamic that's going on. In terms of the movement towards all-flash, that has now represented the majority of shipments in the high end of the marketplace, where the price-performance benefits of all-flash really play out strongly. And it's starting to take a bigger impact of the mid-tier market as well. Below $50,000 systems, there's not a lot of all-flash right now, probably it won't be for a couple of years. In terms of where the growth opportunities are in the storage market, as I mentioned briefly before, there are really 3 major areas of growth within the overall storage marketplace. One is all-flash in general, where we're doing very well. We're growing nicely at scale with 2x the size of our nearest competitor in all-flash. The next is in hyperconverged, where again we're doing well partnering with VMware, a triple-digit growth in that segment of the business. And the third area, back to my earlier comment of growth in the market, is in that mid-range price band, which is where we have more work to do. And that's where we are focused upon adding the sales resources, which I've talked about, changing our quota and compensation schemes to put more emphasis on the mid-market within storage, introducing new products, et cetera. And we believe that, that investment in that mid-market storage opportunity is a thing that's going to help us do better in the second half from a growth point of view than we did in the first half.",373

I do think it's fair to say that, that sales force expansion will ramp over the next number of quarters, right? That's not going to be an immediate impact even as we build that capacity. So Jeff, I think that you're going to see perhaps the storage velocity ramp more towards the latter half of the year versus -- of the second half I should say versus the first half of the second half, so to speak. So I do think that this is going to be a gradual build as we adjust the coverage models, particularly in that commercial space. And lots of other levers being pulled, by the way, in terms of marketing programs and other things that we're doing around incentives and things of that sort. But look, I think this is one of those things that's going to take a little bit of time to work our way through. But our focus there is to build back that velocity, because it's clearly an area of the market that we're not performing as well as we should be, and it's just a focus area for us to drive velocity and drive a nice margin flow as well. So we've got to get it fixed.",213

And just my follow-up on free cash flow. Were there any major unusual items during the quarter? And I know you were going to pay significant taxes related to prior asset sales. How much was that? And anything you can say about what will drive free cash flow over the next few quarters, be it actions the company is taking or other seasonal issues?",67

Look, I think you are right. I mean, we talked last quarter about the taxes that were related to divestitures, which was -- that would have been netted into that cash flow. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it was -- I think it was somewhere around $800 million to $900 million, and so that was obviously fairly impactful. I think the good news is -- and your question is the right question because you're thinking about it correctly. I think now as we move forward, you're going to start to see more -- the cash flow is less impacted by integration or acquisition or divestiture-type charges. And so you'll see it be more related to profitability and working capital. And look, we've -- we're making great progress on our working capital initiatives. I mean, you can see there was a good benefit this quarter. That was partially driven by the P&L growth, which because of the negative cash conversion cycle, obviously, it always throws off good cash. But then within there also, look, great progress around getting the suppliers coordinated on both sides between the legacy EMC and Dell and moving channel partners to channel financing programs. And so those actions are continuing to happen, great progress. We expect to see some more benefits flow through the P&L. But like you said, a lot of the one-offs, I think, are going to be behind us.",242

And we are seeing because of customer interest in flexibility around the software titles that perhaps they're interested in, the structures are changing. And as a result of that, from an accounting perspective, we're deferring that revenue, deferring that margin, but I'm still getting the cash flow upfront from that end. I think that's a phenomenon we're going to continue to see. Because as customers are navigating through sort of a more flexible environment, which is what they demand, so I do think that that's going to be an area that we're going to have to continue to talk about and provide visibility to as we go forward, because I think our EBITDA and our adjusted EBITDA numbers are going to be, well, obviously, a calculation. We're going to have to think about how we think about some of these new types of structures.",209

Look, we're happy with the debt pay down we did this quarter, the $1 billion, and you'll continue to see us pay down the debt as we've talked about, but we do have those maturities in the first half of next year.

So let me clarify a couple of things. When we talk about backlog, we're not talking about SGMs, and I want to come back to that in just 1 minute. Backlog is the products that we take orders for in the quarter, and we don't shift in the quarter. So that's a different phenomenon. I'm going to come back and explain the SGMs in just one moment, but the backlog is simply product backlog that is not shipped at the end of the quarter. That is impacted by a couple of things: the timing of order flow during the quarter and also just how much inventory we keep waiting for those orders to come in, how much that we ship out during end of the quarter.",128
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2017",2017-09-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3471.0,1295453.0,52221600.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,31,"And Arun, it's Tom. Remember what we said earlier on, on earlier calls, which was that we were not going to -- unless the customer needed it, we were not going to drive extraordinary measures to try and optimize shipments at the end of the quarter from a rev rec perspective. We would let the shipments fall in the natural period in which they fall. Quite frankly, because it was -- it's more cost-effective and more economical to do it that way. And so David is right. We had a skew in linearity where orders came in very late in the quarter from pure storage product demand, and those were just typical products that will ship out in Q3. Now your follow-on question has to be well how do you think about backlog in Q3? And the question's going to be, we'll have to see how the linearity works in Q3 as we work our way through that. We have driven some changes in our comp plans to perhaps drive some incentive to bring those in earlier in the quarter. I've had mixed success over my career trying to mix shift that curve. So we'll have to see. But backlog will just shift in the normal course, and we'll have to see what linearity looks like next quarter, right, as it relates to pure product backlog.",226

So now let me come back to the flexible consumption models that are different. Specifically, there are 2 things that are within this bucket of flexible consumption models. The first of these transformational software license agreements, we call them TLAs. As Tom mentioned earlier, we used to have something called ELAs, which were enterprise license agreements. Those were revenue upfronts, multiyear commitment revenue upfront. The TLAs are the next generation of that. They are typically for our storage software. They cover a multiyear period. The customer is basically taking a commitment to a basket of software products for multiyear period. And under the structure of the TLAs, we give the customer more flexibility in terms of how they can substitute titles. We let them choose to when they want to basically start introducing maintenance on those products. And therefore, because of the nature of a TLA, it is now recognized ratably. So that's one form of flexible consumption model. The other form of flexible consumption model, which we are seeing growth in is product utilities, where previously a customer would have bought a fair amount of storage product, typically upfront storage or backup are now moved to a model where it's a utility purchase. They are paying it based upon use again over a multiyear period of time. So those are the 2 things that in total are call -- going to this category called flexible consumption models. You asked for a sizing. So to put it into perspective, if we were to look at the total storage demand in the quarter, the flexible consumption models represented kind of mid-teens percentage of total storage demand. So it does have a meaningful short-term impact on the difference between what we're getting from a sequential growth in orders versus less of a growth in revenue. So that hopefully clarifies the dynamics around FCMs.",312

The utilities clearly in over time depending upon usage or whatever the mechanism is. And so look, I mean, that's why I was trying to explain earlier, there are some dynamics that we'll have to help you guys with as we move forward from a -- how do you think about EBITDA, how do you think about cash, how do you think about order velocity within the business of the storage business given. What I think is going to be continuing interest with our customers to explore these different types of structures given the flexibility that they're asking for. And quite frankly, Michael and I have told the team to lean into these things in the sense of they're great arrangements. They typically build out a frame work for customer relationship for a number of years. They tend to be nicely profitable over that period of time, but it is a bit of a transition that we're seeing right now, even as quite frankly, we still do need to drive mid-range storage and some of those others just classical transactional demand generation that we need to do. So we got to do both, and that's the focus that we have right now.",232

You did extremely well there versus our model, and you introduced the 14th generation of PowerEdge. Was there a bit of buildup from the sales of the new PowerEdge that helped drive some of the sales? Or was it more systematic or more selective when you look at the server business performance in the quarter?",66

So yes, we introduced and just started to shift towards the end of the quarter the 14G. So we started to ramp what was a kind of a small percentage of our overall mix. I think what happened in servers was a couple of things. People really like the 13G family, particularly our strength in the rack scale systems. We're seeing a lot of synergy. We're seeing a lot of cross-sell in servers. A lot of growth is coming from the enterprise segments, where, obviously, we've been able to take the server business into our traditional high-end accounts that were the stronghold of the data center sales force that the EMC side brought, but also we're seeing good growth in mid-market as well. So the server business is, I think, relative to the top line firing on all cylinders right now. 14G, I think, gets a lot of people excited. They like to see that -- there's a road map out there. It's kind of future-proofing their decisions to kind of invest in the Dell portfolio there, but didn't make a very significant part of the quarter from either a bookings or revenue point of view yet.",203

And so we are seeing incremental interest in some of these new form factors and solutions, which is also helping to drive that number as well.",78

So yes, they're kind of moving toward software-defined data centers. Hyperconverged is certainly one of the drivers in the server market and of course, working very closely with VMware has been a big driver of the server business as well.",64

So you're driving from great strength now the PC market with 18 consecutive quarters of taking market share. The server business is performing very well and as everyone has asked about like to have data storage business move a little bit more rapidly forward. So with some of the sales momentum that you've had in those lines of business when you look at the ISG group, are there -- or are you starting to gain some of these cross-selling traction that you might have expected from the combination of all the entities with EMC?",100

And I'll let David comment since it's his business. But look, I think we've been pretty -- very pleased overall with the cross-selling activity that we have seen, and that was one of the sort of key thesis of the deal, which was between the family of businesses with VMware and Pivotal and our core business of client, server storage that -- and the fact that the customer bases didn't really overlap that well in terms of share -- relative share for these respective business units or respective LOBs, I should say. That we have seen very good velocity in general with that cross-sell activity, really good velocity in the VMware capability, good velocity in client. We've pretty good velocity in server. We got some work to do in storage, to be blunt. But that part of the structure or how we thought about that has -- I think has performed quite well, David, from my perspective.",161

Obviously, the enterprise segment was largely comprised of the legacy EMC business, and that's where we're seeing great lift in the cross-sell left, where we're seeing server, client. We've also let that group start to resell VMware as well, which has proven to be a lift and helpful. And then in the commercial business, which is largely again not entire, largely the ex Dell team. Although we, obviously, moved the related parts of ex EMC in there, seeing strong growth again with server and client, VMware is doing well. And just that one area where we still have to do some more work is in the storage momentum in the commercial market segment. So if you kind of look at all -- if you look at that kind of matrix of kind of different go-to-market versus different product segments, I think we're seeing everything we expected to see with one area for further improvement.",204

Obviously, things -- we've done a lot of things that I think have worked reasonably well. We got some things that we have to continue to focus on whether it's storage velocity or some of the other, continue the cost optimization work. But again, those are all things that are in process that we'll continue to focus on and drive even if -- but again, I want to make sure everybody understands that the goal here is to get the velocity in the business back, make sure that we're driving the right sort of margin dollar profile here and then continue to delever the balance sheet from a core debt perspective, because you will see, I believe, DFS debt continue to grow as the financing structures continue to grow given the interesting opportunities we have at DFS. So that's the balance we're trying to drive and trying to make sure folks that follow us understand how we're going to -- how we're approaching this as we move forward.",217

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; and our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke. Jeff has primary responsibility for Client Solutions Group and Infrastructure Solutions Group segments, in addition to leading our supply chain function. Also joining us from Europe for Q&A is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.
We posted our third quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q3 financial results will be filed on Form 10-Q on Tuesday, December 12. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective.
Consistent with prior periods, our Q3 non-GAAP operating income includes approximately $2.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. 
As a reminder, due to the EMC merger and, to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. Please note that our third quarter fiscal 2017 historical results include only a portion of EMC's results, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which may not be comparable due to the merger. Beginning in Q4, we will get to fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results. 
During this call, we will generally refer -- or we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck. 
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom.",386

Overall, I was pleased with the third quarter results and the momentum we're seeing in the business. We continue to see growth on the top line, and we're seeing increasing customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. We also had solid cash flow generation and improved profitability. 
GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $19.6 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $19.9 billion with strong results from client, servers and VMware. Overall, we were generally pleased with the balance of top line growth and better profitability. As we've highlighted over the last few quarters, we are working to improve our storage business velocity. And while we have begun to see some progress, we believe this will be a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as we ramp go-to-market resources and introduce new and innovative product features. 
Gross margin was $6.4 billion or 32.2% of revenue, which was 110 basis point improvement over the second quarter, driven by pricing discipline and improved overall cost of goods sold. OpEx was $4.4 billion or 22.3% of revenue, which was down 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to drive OpEx discipline across the business as we focus on optimizing our cost structure. 
Operating income was $2 billion or 10% of revenue, up 210 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 24% sequentially to $2.3 billion or 11.6% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see Slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. 
Now let me give you our summary view of the financial performance of the business segments, and then I will turn it over to Jeff who will go into more detail on the segment operational highlights. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was $7.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by servers and networking with revenue of $3.9 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Servers delivered its second consecutive quarter of record revenue with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers on strong demand. We delivered solid unit performance while also seeing expansion of server ASPs. Our storage revenue was $3.7 billion and was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter as growth in all-flash and newer solutions like hyperconverged infrastructure was offset by softness in traditional storage. 
Operating income for ISG was $678 million or 9% of revenue, which is a 320 basis point increase over the prior quarter, driven by better profitability for servers and storage as well as OpEx discipline. ISG operating income is moving in the right direction, but we still have more work to do to improve the overall profitability profile of the business. We are working on balancing velocity and profitability within servers and building momentum in storage and data protection going forward. 
Revenue for the Client Solutions Group was $10 billion, up 8%. Commercial revenue grew 8% due to strength in commercial notebooks, workstations, displays and attached services. Consumer revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in notebooks and the benefits of our investments in gaming and our consumer and small-business key country expansion program. 
CSG operating income was up 6% to $672 million, which was 6.7% of revenue as the team continues to execute on profitable growth despite ongoing challenges from the component costs and competitive environments. Going forward, we're focused on continuing to drive profitable growth, especially in commercial client.  
VMware had another strong quarter as revenue from the VMware segment was up 2% sequentially to approximately $2 billion and operating income was $639 million or 32.7% of revenue. Standalone VMware reported a strong Q3, which included the enterprise agreement with DXC Technology announced on VMware's Q2 earnings call. Its growth rate for license revenue plus the sequential change in total unearned license revenue was up double digits year-over-year. License bookings for NSX grew over 100% year-over-year in Q3. The DXC enterprise agreement included a large commitment to NSX, underscoring the strategic importance of NSX to customers. VSAN license bookings were once again up over 150% year-over-year. 
I also want to congratulate VMware for being named to the Fortune Future 50 list of companies best positioned for breakout growth. VMware ranked #6 in the Leaders category, which is a testament to the company's forward-looking and innovative company culture. 
Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $475 million. Pivotal again delivered strong top line results. The team has also seen nice momentum across its platform partner ecosystem, having recently announced over 100 global and regional system integrators and consultancies as part of its Pivotal Ready Partner Program. Additionally, in November, Pivotal and Accenture announced that they formed a new business group, the Accenture Pivotal Business Group, to help enterprises accelerate cloud migration and software innovation. 
SecureWorks released its stand-alone earnings yesterday, where it reported approximately 10% revenue growth to $118 million and continued gross margin expansion. RSA had solid orders growth in the quarter. Customers are embracing our RSA security solutions as evidenced by the positive year-to-date growth for all of its 4 product suites. 
Before I jump to the balance sheet, I want to mention the flexible consumption models that we offer customers. We continue to see strong demand for these solutions as we remain focused on providing customers with flexibility and building a larger recurring revenue stream for Dell Technologies. We saw a lower level of these frameworks in Q3 versus last quarter as the multiyear strategic nature of these offerings resulted in variability quarter-to-quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. In Q3, cash from operations was $1.6 billion, predominantly due to improved profitability and working capital benefits. Our cash and investments balance was $18 billion, up approximately $2.7 billion versus the prior quarter and includes debt proceeds from VMware's recent debt issuance. Also, as a reminder, you will see our cash balance grow as we position our balance sheet for approximately $3 billion of debt maturities coming due in the first half of fiscal '19.
As we did last quarter, we discussed our debt consistent with how we discussed it with the rating agencies, which is total debt including subsidiary debt, total debt excluding subsidiary debt and total core debt, which excludes subsidiary debt, DFS-related debt and the margin loan. For additional detail on what's included or excluded in these balances, please see Slide 7 of the web deck. 
During Q3, we paid down $1.7 billion in debt, including $1.2 billion from VMware's repayment of legacy intercompany notes as well as approximately $500 million from cash on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $52.5 billion in total debt, up $2.6 billion from the prior quarter. Our total debt balance increased as a result of VMware's $4 billion bond issuance mentioned above as well as an increase of approximately $300 million in structured financing debt that funds Dell Financial Services. 
During the quarter, we repriced $14.2 billion of term loan debt and revolving credit facility and also took the opportunity to reposition the tranches. The combined effect of these resulted in approximately $60 million of annualized interest rate savings and enhanced liquidity management. Our core debt ended the quarter at $40.3 billion, down from $40.5 billion at the end of Q2 and $48.8 billion as of September 2016, which is when we closed the EMC transaction. Since closing the transaction, we've paid down $9.7 billion of gross debt excluding DFS-related debt and remain fully committed to paying down debt and delevering the balance sheet. 
In Q3, DFS originations were approximately $1.6 billion, up 48%, and financing receivables now stand at another record high of $7 billion, up 28%, driving an increase of DFS-related debt by approximately $300 million in the quarter. Demand for DFS remains strong and continues to grow across our business segments as customers respond to our innovative financing offerings. As we see the financing receivable balance grow so will our DFS-related debt as we continue to fund the business. 
Jumping to our DVMT share repurchase program. We recently completed our latest $300 million program, which was announced in August and was solely funded through a Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. To date, we have repurchased approximately 23.4 million shares of Class V Common Stock. This includes 16.8 million shares under the Class V group repurchase program. We are generally pleased with our continued cash flow generation and remain focused on balance sheet management and debt repayment. 
Let me now turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG.",1427

It's great to be here to discuss CSG, ISG and our supply chain. As Rob mentioned, I now lead a combined products and operations organization, the only one of its kind. As one product and operations organization, we will be able to drive a more holistic set of integrated, innovative solutions for our customers from the edge to the core to the cloud. 
I've been in the new ISG part of my role for a little less than 3 months. I thought it might be helpful if I share some of my initial observations. First, our strategy to be the essential infrastructure provider is resonating well with our customers who are looking to us to transform and digitize their environments. Second, our portfolio is second to none across the breadth of the IT spectrum, from the edge to the core to the cloud. Third, we have more complexity in our offerings than is needed and simplification is required. And lastly, we need to continue to enhance feature functionality and add new capabilities to our storage and data protection offerings, sharpen our engineering and product execution focus to ensure we're meeting customers' needs and expectations and execute to our go-to-market initiatives. 
Now let me provide some third quarter highlights for ISG and CSG. As Tom mentioned, ISG's revenue for the third quarter was $7.5 billion and operating income was $678 million. Both saw positive growth from the prior quarter. As a reminder, due to the fact that the EMC transaction closed during Q3 last year, I'll be making reference to mandate it where appropriate to facilitate a more meaningful year-over-year discussion. 
ISG demand continue to grow trajectory in Q3, with orders up in high single digits on a year-over-year basis. Server revenue and unit growth were strong for both PowerEdge and cloud servers. We are seeing higher memory and storage content in servers as customers look for more computing power to run big data and software-defined solutions. We have effectively managed pricing to mitigate ongoing memory cost inflation, resulting in higher selling prices. Additionally, we've also seen higher ASPs as we ramp our 14th generation of PowerEdge servers, demonstrating we are capturing the value of our industry-leading R&D capabilities and innovation. 
In calendar Q3, the overall x86 server industry grew in both units and revenue. We outgrew the market in units and revenue for both the mainstream and hyperscale markets, and we are a worldwide leader for servers based on both units and revenue. Looking at revenue share, we gained 250 basis points of share on a year-over-year basis for total x86 revenue and 400 basis points of share in mainstream revenue. 
Moving to storage. Orders declined in the mid-single digits with solid growth in our newer storage solutions. Our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio continues to grow triple digits with strength in VxRail. Demand for Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays continue to grow in double digits. As discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we have implemented actions to improve storage growth, particularly in the midrange, and expect benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year. 
We increased our go-to-market capacity by adding storage specialists, and we are ensuring our sales compensation plan spurs the appropriate behavior to drive long-term strength in our results. In addition, we continue to evaluate our portfolio and are focused on developing world-class products to solve our customers' needs. For example, in our midrange portfolio, we recently introduced 2 Dell EMC SC all-flash appliances, along with key application upgrades -- excuse me, along with key software upgrades for our Dell EMC Unity that include in-line data deduplication, synchronous file replication and the ability to perform online data-in-place storage controller upgrades. The Dell EMC SC all-flash products will be available this month, and the Unity upgrades will be available later this quarter. 
As the same time, we introduced our Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program, offering storage customers investment protection and multiple cost-saving benefits. The early feedback from customers and partners has been very positive. We continue to drive hard against our operational improvements in ISG, targeting our go-to-market, product portfolio and cost-out initiatives. 
Moving on to CSG. We had another strong quarter as we maintained our focus on profitable growth, balance the -- balancing velocity and share gain with margin improvement. CSG revenue in Q3 was $10 billion, which was up 8% while operating income was $672 million, up 6%. 
The overall PC market moved back to positive year-over-year unit growth in calendar Q3 2017 according to IDC. Dell outperformed the worldwide market growing units 1% in calendar Q3 and delivering above-market growth in desktops and in the commercial segment. We increased our global PC share on a year-over-year basis for the 19th consecutive quarter. We continue to be the leading provider of workstations worldwide. In calendar Q3, Dell outgrew the industry for workstation units and had a positive year-over-year growth in every region. 
Our investments in gaming were evident at PAX West, where we announced a new mainstream gaming laptop and gaming desktop featuring a new clear panel with polar blue LED lighting and Alienware 34-inch curved gaming display. These new products demonstrate our commitment to deliver world-class gaming products for every player at every level in the marketplace. We are also seeing success in CSG SMP and attached services. Displays were a highlight in Q3, and Dell continues to be the #1 display provider in the world. 
We saw higher attach rates for our premium client service offerings, ProSupport Plus, for both commercial and consumer clients. During Q3, we announced a new top-tier Premium Support Plus to deliver the most comprehensive support service available for consumer and gaming PCs. Powered by Dell's exclusive SupportAssist technology, it's the first and only consumer service to proactively find issues, predict problems before they start and automatically remove viruses and optimize performance of consumer PCs. Dell continued investment in innovation -- Dell's continued investment in innovation is helping Dell drive across CSG -- drive growth across CSG. We expect to continue to take share while maintaining our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
From a global operations standpoint, we've made good progress over the past 14 months integrating our supply chain, reducing cycle times and inventory, and we continue to look for areas of improvement, working closely with the various teams on multiple working capital initiatives. It's been an unprecedented year of inflationary memory pricing, and we believe memory will continue to be a slowly moderating headwind through the first half of next year. 
Overall, we have a number of areas that we are working to improve, including storage sales velocity, storage product performance and positioning and ramping up sales productivity, but I want to be clear that we've also made significant progress over the last year. We're a leader in servers, storage, displays, workstations and gaming. We continue to see strong demand for hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined data center solutions, and the client business continues to gain profitable share. 
I believe we offer more holistic view and set of solutions for our customers, allowing us a higher level of innovation and integration across the edge, the core to the cloud, and it's unmatched in the industry. I like our hand, and I'm optimistic about our future. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.",1224

In closing, I echo Jeff's sentiments that it's an exciting time to be part of Dell Technologies. We have made good progress across the family of businesses, including strong velocity in client, servers and hyperconverged infrastructure, growth from VMware in our other businesses and steady expansion of our DFS portfolio. We also recognize that there's still work to do to improve our storage and data protection business and to improve the overall profitability of the ISG business. 
I'm generally pleased with the overall state of the business 14 months into the integration and believe we're tracking in the right direction. We are the best positioned company to win in today's IT environment and meet customers' needs in their digital transformation journey. We are gaining broader acceptance as the only provider that has the flexibility and portfolio breadth that can offer a single integrated set of solutions. This was on display in New York in October when we unveiled a new IoT strategy, division and solutions to accelerate IoT adoption for customers. 
The new Dell Technologies IoT division, led by VMware CTO, Ray O’Farrell, is designed to help customers navigate and implement flexible architectures and provide tailored solutions and services across our entire family of businesses. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on growing faster than the market and gaining share and consolidating markets, generating strong cash flow to enable additional delevering of the balance sheet, balancing cost actions with investments to position the company for long-term success and bringing the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to our customers in a comprehensive and seamless experience. 
Finally, let me remind you that when we report our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we will be comparing those results against our first full quarter as a combined company. In addition, note that Q4 of fiscal 2017, our previous Q4, was a 14-week quarter as compared to this year's 13-week fourth quarter, so year-over-year growth rates need to consider this. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",344

I guess I wanted to start off just seeing if you could give us an update on the memory and input costs that you're continuing to see. There's been some market discussion about NAND prices potentially peaking over the next few months. So just as you guys work through your negotiations with the supply chain, what are you guys seeing in terms of availability? And how should we think about your ability to push on some of those costs as we move further into 2018?",86

Frank, Jeff Clarke here. A couple of things. One, I suspect, given the basis of the question, you've seen what we've gone through, which is the longest inflationary period that I can recall in memory in a decade plus, and that's a by-product of 2 things. One, there hasn't been any new DRAM capacity being brought online, and then the consumption of DRAM is at the highest rates we've seen. And in fact, our own server group, we've seen our memory density that we ship per server go up tremendously on a year-over-year basis and sequentially as well, so putting tremendous pressure on supply. As a result, our outlook is DRAM pricing, while moderating in its inflation, it still continues to go up through the first half of next year. And we think NAND is moderately inflationary as well through the first half of next year. We see all-flash arrays just driving tremendous demand for more NAND and we're pressuring the capacity that's available. Does that help?",168

And then, I guess, just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about tax reform since it looks like you guys have been focused on it with the BUILD Coalition announcement that was made last week. And I guess, specifically, I wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the 7.5% proposed tax on illiquid repatriated -- or unrepatriated foreign earnings. Do you know what that taxable foreign earnings amount would be for you?",80

So I'm not going to get into specifics about where the proposed legislation is right now. Clearly, as we have been -- we are a supporter of tax reform. We do believe that the U.S. system, which hasn't been reformed in over 30 years, does need some updating, and we're big fans of territorial tax and those types of policy changes that they're contemplating. Obviously, there are some headwinds in that tax proposed legislation that we're looking at and that we're making sure that our voice is heard, whether that's around the repatriation, which we're generally -- we've sort of reconciled ourself to the fact that repatriation is going to be part of this and also things like the interest deductibility, which is a potential -- is a headwind for us that we're talking to our representatives about how we might -- how they should think through some of the impacts given that it's effectively an antigrowth strategy as you think about how debt has funded job growth and capital growth -- or company growth here in the U.S. So again, I'm not going to get into specifics about what are specific aspects of the bills and how we would navigate through that. I will tell you that we'll see where this lands at the end of the day, and then we'll take the appropriate actions to ensure that we're best positioned as we can to move forward.",252

I guess, just so I understand, if I were to look at your 10-K, it looks like the undistributed book earnings from your foreign subs was about $79 billion at the end of last year.

And I'm wondering if you could just talk about the margin profile in both of those businesses. You're well above your 4% to 5% prior target in CSG. In ISG, we have had DRAM continue to increase recently, and your mix seems like it'll be negative, with storage lagging the growth in server business, which is a lower-margin business. So if you can go through that in terms of the margins.",85

Let me do that, and then Jeff can add some color commentary, if he'd like. But look, I think, overall, there's a couple of things affecting our margins as you look at it quarter-to-quarter. Clearly, as Jeff highlighted, component costs have been inflationary on us, and so that's been a bit of a headwind clearly. I think, as you step back and think about it though, what -- it's pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the prior quarters, which is that we have been adjusting our pricing to ensure that we are capturing the increased input costs coming from the component cost increases. So as we look quarter-on-quarter, we have seen the effect -- our pricing effectiveness, and the stickiness of that pricing effectiveness has been helpful for us. We also have been helped by things like mix, in the sense of the mix of the business has been helpful for us. And so we've also been helped -- and we've had a little bit of FX as well from -- as you look at what's happened with currency across the globe. So those 3 have been helpful. Against -- and then on the downside of that, we've also had continued impact on -- of component costs, which has been a bit of a headwind for us in Q3. So particularly on the ISG side, as it relates to your comment around, ""Well, geez, given the fact that storage is soft and you drove servers,"" we got a pretty good boost on server velocity and the related pricing actions that we've done out of that. And then mix within the configurations and within the families has been helpful. So because of that, I mean, you've seen our ISG margins, they roughly went up -- were up almost 200 basis points. And then the CSG margins quarter-on-quarter were obviously less than that in terms of absolute movement but still moving in the right direction.",328

One would be I mentioned earlier that our average server going out the door is going out with more DRAM and going out with more NAND, bigger SSD, and that's a direct result of us selling higher up in the value stack. We're selling higher-value workloads. We are selling higher-value solutions and then extracting value for that. Our 14G servers that we just launched are selling at a premium to their predecessors. So we are seeing our ability to sell the value of our product in the marketplace, and servers continue to, I think, perform quite well. The other part is, I think, the global supply chain that we have and its size. We have DRAM. So as much as I've said DRAM is going up in costs, we have it, and we're getting value for having it. And whether that's in our PC business, on our server business, I think that is something customers are coming to us for, knowing we have supply. And they're obviously paying for it, so we're seeing our margins continue to improve and our prices improve there. And then Tom mentioned the element of mix in the PC business. That's very true. If you look at our relative performance of commercial PCs to consumer PCs, that's a strong contributor to margin improvement in the PC business.",236

Look, you know we don't do forward guidance, right? So let me just start with that comment. I would tell you that if you looked at historical seasonal patterns, you would expect to see roughly a 6% to 7% sequential bump in revenue if you -- if history were to be consistent with what we're seeing this quarter. So that's something you should think about. And then remember that, seasonally, we turn down in Q1 after that, right, in terms of just the nature of how the systems flows. So look, I mean, absent that, I would tell you that the only other thing I would put in your thinking is, we've talked about it and we talked a lot about this in Q2 -- on the Q2 call, around these flexible consumption models. And we had a fairly healthy dose of flexible consumption models in Q2. In Q3, they were less. And remember, these were models where we're typically offering the customer more flexibility and, therefore, deferring the revenue. And therefore, while I'm getting -- in some cases, getting the cash upfront, I'm not recognizing the revenue upfront. Now we put -- we'll have to see how Q4 plays out in terms of those flexible consumption models, but seasonally, it's a pretty big quarter for us and -- from a revenue perspective so we'll have to watch that dynamic in mix as we go through the quarter. Also, remember, and I said it in my talking points, that last year was a 14-week quarter for Q4 and this week will be a 13-week quarter. So just keep that in mind, too, as you think about the year-over-year compares.",282

I can speak specifically to the product and supply chain side, and I'm sure Tom will jump in on the rest of the portfolio -- or the business. We have a plan. We're executing to that plan. I mean, quite honestly, we're on that plan. We have applied our Dell pricing terms across the broader purchase of our entire portfolio, which you would have expected us to do. Last year, we had that done certainly on day 1. We're reaping benefits of that throughout this year. We've seen tremendous efficiency on the supply chain, particularly through cycle time improvement, lead time improvement to our customer base and managing our working capital initiatives through our facilities, most notably in the form of inventory. So I think we're well along the path of managing our other costs outside the commodity and the supply chain and the product side.",162

That's fair, Jeff. On the overall cost synergy, we obviously have put that $2 billion target out there. We also had told you that we had made some incremental investments back into the go-to-market in the business that we're going to probably delay the full cycle of how those cost synergies would flow through. I think we've been pretty upfront about that. We remain on track on our cost activities even with considering the investments that we've been making, and we'll continue to evaluate the business. So the goal here is to drive the right level of profitability across the combined entity. We'll do that through pulling various levers to ensure that we, over time, deliver the right EBITDA generation that we're targeting. But I'll also tell you that we're also in this for the long term, right? So we are making appropriate investments to position the company as we think about where we want to be in the 3- to 5-year range as well.",166

But we haven't quantified it specifically, and I'm not really -- don't really want to go there. The dynamic that you have though, obviously, is that from -- the business continues to evolve and the environment continues to evolve, and so we're continuously looking for cost-out opportunities and efficiency opportunities such as part of the DNA of the company. And so what we had said earlier in the year, that we were probably delay it a year or so in terms of realization of those synergies as we move forward given the investments back into the business.

Look, I'm not going to get down to that level of detail. I mean, we did see benefit from both the velocity in servers and the price expansion, I'll say, in servers given the configuration mix that we're seeing in the business. So I would tell you that servers -- and then we got better pricing and better mix in storage even as we drove -- even as volume wasn't quite where we wanted it. And then we've got -- Jeff highlighted it, the fact that we are loading a heavier mix of memory and NAND on some of these products, and therefore, that's helping us as well. I also would point out -- remember that as you look at that, we also got benefit from OpEx, right? So -- in the quarter. So I think the team did a reasonable job in managing OpEx, and very, very -- generally pretty pleased with what we saw in terms of profitability expansion. It's not where we want it yet. So I want to be really clear about that. Yes, we made some progress. We had a lighter mix of flexible consumption models in the quarter, so therefore, I didn't defer as much revenue and profitability as perhaps that you saw in Q2. That's going to vary quarter by quarter. So you've got to keep that in mind. But I think, overall, I'm pleased with the progress this quarter, but clearly, more work to do.",244

So maybe you've got $11.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of this quarter. Could you talk about it? How much of that is in the U.S.? Remind us -- historically, is the current quarter a bigger-than-usual, average or less-than-usual cash generator? And then the EMC bond, the $2.5 billion that come due beginning in June, are you expecting to pay all of that down with cash? Or is there any chance that you'd look to refinance?",92

And hopefully, you guys can hear me okay. So first, just as a reminder, right, when you're looking at that cash balance, that's also including the VMware cash. So remember, the Dell Technologies ex VMware, which is how I think about it when I'm looking at debt pay-down, is a smaller number, right? So it's, call it, somewhere around -- a little over $6 billion, $6.3 billion. The geography of that cash obviously moves around kind of depending on what's happening in the business and different intercompany flows. But I think, in any given time, we have probably 35% to 45% of that sitting in the U.S. And just like we said, right, we try to keep the balance as low, taking into account -- look, we do have places where maybe the cash is restricted or tied up. We've got investments on the books and that type of thing, but the focus is going to be taking that excess and paying down cash -- paying down debt. And just like Tom mentioned in the talking points, we're going to probably conserve cash. You asked about Q4. Seasonally, Q4 tends to be a stronger cash quarter, so that would be my expectation. But then that's followed by Q1, which typically tends to be a weaker cash quarter as we pay out things like certain tax payments and bonus and compensation, that type of thing, right? So I've got to prepare for that. And we've got those 2 maturities. The one in April is a little bit smaller. And look, that June maturity, I mean, look, my expectation is that's going to be funded through a combination of cash currently on the balance sheet, cash flow generation between now and then, and I do have the untapped revolvers. So if I need to depend of that to fund a portion of that, I have that available. And now keep in mind, if I do, do that, that's purely temporary. So we use that to kind of fund some of these inter-quarter gaps typically, and so if I did that, it would only be for a short period of time. I mean, I -- my expectation is -- once again, we've got about $5.5 billion worth of debt coming due when I include the amortization payments for next year on the term loan, and I'm looking to pay that down with cash over time.",404

The next 2 maturities just happen to be investment grade -- or non-investment-grade bonds. And is there -- is that just when you're thinking about paying down things in cash? Or is it just that they happen to be non-investment-grade bonds that you're paying down and maybe thinking about, in the future, paying down other non-investment-grade bonds and maybe refinancing some of the investment-grade bonds? And how's Dell thinking about that as they go forward?",83

So look, I think we'll pay things down as they come due. If it makes sense for whatever reason or there's a good opportunity to refinance, I mean, I'm not saying that's off the table. I mean, it's always a consideration as I'm trying to optimize the balance sheet and capital structure. And we'll pick a part of the term loans, right, I mean, because that's the stuff that's prepayable and easy to take out. I've got -- the A1 is gone now, so that's nice to see that's no longer in my capital structure. I've got the A3, which is due at the end of the year, so that's embedded in that $5.5 billion number I threw out earlier. And then we've got the A2 and the term loan B down the line. So look, I think we'll continue to do what we're doing, deleveraging. Take -- paying down debt will be the focus. But I don't want to say that refinancing opportunities are not existing or something I wouldn't consider.",198

But I would tell you, if you just look at the dynamics of the business right now, clearly, we are seeing extraordinarily strong server velocity and demand for lots of reasons, right? More compute-centric solutions being driven, ASPs are up, as Jeff mentioned in his talking points, because of the richer mix, the pricing actions, the component cost inputs that have gone up. So as we think about Q4, if you look at seasonally, historically, this would be an extraordinarily strong storage quarter. And I do think that, that's -- we do think that we'll see some of those old seasonal patterns hold. The question is, is how strong are servers going to be. And so we expect -- we'll have to see how that plays out. But historical seasonal patterns would tell you that storage should be -- this is typically the strongest quarter of the year from a storage perspective. And you do see, at times, end-of-the-year budget flush from some of the corporate customers as they're finishing their projects in their budget cycles, and therefore, you should -- we'll have to see how that plays on the server activity as well.",205

Look, I do think that you shouldn't read anything into the fact that Q3 was a little bit softer than Q2 in terms of flexible consumption models. I think these things are going to vary. They're complex. They're multiyear. They take time to negotiate with -- and they're typically the larger customers -- they're global customers that are negotiating these types of arrangements. And so I think we are going to see some variability. I think all things being equal, it's entirely conceivable that we'll see an uptick in flexible consumption models in Q4 just given natural end-of-year sort of activity both from a customer and from a Dell Technologies perspective. But we'll have to see how that plays out.",121

And then still kind of on that topic, I think you touched on it briefly in one of the prior questions, but the presence of these kind of flexible consumption models, does it impact kind of how you recognize margin for the business, both kind of on a short term and over the life of the relationship? And I'm trying to think about if it's still fair to kind of think about incremental margin for storage in kind of the 50% area.",83

They do have the effect, as you guys all know, of deferring recognition of revenue and amortizing that revenue and associated margin over a contract cycle that might be 2 to 5 years depending upon the term of the agreement. So historically, what we have seen is, over time, these tend to be -- over the course of the contract period, they tend to be a better -- they tend to have a better profitability profile, but it ramps. So it starts a little lower and ramps over the course of the contract. So on an all-in basis, margin dollars generally have shown to be higher over the entire length of the contract, but it does change the timing pattern and pattern of when those are recognized. And so remember, we like these constructs (sic) [ contracts ] in the context of building a more intimate customer relationship, ensuring that we are a more strategic partner for these customers and builds sort of a -- more of an as-a-service or a stream or recurring revenue stream that's helpful for us. And we've got the flexibility being privately controlled to do these types of structures and not be as focused on short-term quarter-to-quarter profitability, although, clearly, we're all trying to -- we are trying to drive the profitability of the business, but we do have some incremental flexibility here.",238

Well, I think, a couple of things. When I look at the marketplace and as I'm learning through my first 3 months, it's a big market that we get confused, that we think is shrinking. This -- external storage market grew last quarter. It's a $24 billion market. It's a big opportunity. We have a big, big opportunity with our 30% share to grow in this market, and that's what we need to do. Clearly, the competition is NetApp and Pure, most notably. What I see about them is they have extreme focus and they have clarity in their product line. And I think they're reaping a benefit from that. If you -- some of my remarks are about pivoting our organization to that. I think we mentioned last quarter that we're going to invest in more sales specialist capacity. We hired more sales specialists in Q3. We're going to hire more sales specialists in Q4. We're going to build out that investment -- Tom actually talked about investments. One of the areas we consciously have decided to do is build out more capacity for more coverage in the mid-market commercial segment, and that's not at the exclusion of the enterprise segment either. We're building out more sales capacity in the enterprise. We're moving sales leadership between the organizations so we could get more storage knowledge base in our commercial organization. We're making adjustments and continuing to tweak our sales compensation towards a -- more biased toward storage. We just made 2 significant updates to the product portfolio. We added deduplication in Unity, and we added all-flash offers to our SC product line in the midrange. Our XtremIO, which is, I think, a very differentiated asset in the marketplace, particularly against the 2 competitors that I mentioned earlier, with its in-line data services and its performance attributes, is a great product. Another thing we just launched in the last -- I think it's a week or 10 days is a new customer loyalty program, which, if you compare it against the competitive landscape, is absolutely unmatched. Our competitors basically guarantee their product or program for 30 days. We guarantee ours for 3 years. It's got 7 key components and it basically is an investment protection with a set of guarantees for our customers that, quite honestly, the industry analysts and our customers have responded quite well to, which I think is upping our competitive nature. So I think we're in a big market. It's a big opportunity. We clearly have lost share. It's undeniable. The public results are out. We're not satisfied with that. We're investing in sales capacity and coverage and expertise. We continue to add to the product portfolio and its competitiveness. We needed deduplication in Unity. We needed all-flash in the SC. We need to continue to drive the performance advantage we have in XtremIO. We now have a set of loyalty programs that, again, I believe, puts us in a position to walk in the customers and say, ""There is no risk picking us or pulling out the competition. Here's our guarantee behind it."" I hope that answers your question. I'm happy to -- if I didn't, to go into more detail.",538

It's the Dell family of assets. I'm absolutely going to integrate, top to bottom, one team. You may be aware of some of the more siloed orientation of the previous organization. That's not going to be the case going forward. We're going to look at the storage portfolio. We're going to make decisions across the portfolio in the best interest of our customers. When I look at the high-end storage stack, the midrange storage stack, the low end across data protection and ACI, we are going to work more seamlessly across the organization and build the right number of products positioned appropriately in the marketplace. I mentioned in my remarks that we have a bit of complexity in the portfolio. We're going to make it clearer for our sales force and clearer for our customers which one -- what products to buy for what applications or environments. That's something we can do and we will do, and it's going to be across the entire portfolio. I don't know if that answers your question.",189

But complexity doesn't mean less products. Complexity can mean the number of offers per product, how many countries we offer our product in.

It's not clear to me the 180th country in the world needs all of the entire storage breadth of our portfolio, and we can make that less complex, easier for our sales and marketing teams to communicate and much easier for our customers to buy. So you'll see us work on that over the next handful of quarters.",116
