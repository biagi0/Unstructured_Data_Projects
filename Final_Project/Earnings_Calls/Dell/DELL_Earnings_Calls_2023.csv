We are pleased with our FY '23 execution and financial results given the macroeconomic backdrop. FY '23 was ultimately a tale of 2 halves with 12% growth in the first half and revenue down 9% in the second half as the demand environment weakened over the course of the year. Net, we delivered record FY '23 revenue of $102.3 billion, up 1% on the back of 17% growth in FY '22, record OpInc of $8.6 billion, up 11% and record EPS of $7.61, up 22%. ISG, in particular, had a strong year with record revenue of $38.4 billion, including record revenue in both servers and networking and storage and record operating income of over $5 billion.
Importantly, we are structural share gainers and continue to outperform the industry. We expect to gain over a point of share in mainstream server and storage revenue when the IDC calendar results come out later this month. In servers, we remain #1 in the market and have gained 9 points of mainstream server revenue share over the last 10 years. In storage, we are far and away the industry leader, bigger than #2, 3 and 4 players combined and have gained 4 points of share in the key midrange portion of the market over the last 5 years. And in PCs, we gained over 140 basis points of commercial PC unit share in calendar '22, our 10th consecutive year of share gains.
Focusing on Q4, we again proved our ability to deliver against our commitments and execute no matter the market environment. We delivered Q4 revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with operating income of $2.2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.80 driven by strong ISG performance and disciplined cost management.
ISG revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7% with record profitability. ISG has now grown 8 consecutive quarters, and our end-to-end business model has proven to be a demonstrable competitive advantage in this changing environment. We've enhanced our relevancy with customers as spending priorities shifted from CSG to ISG over the course of the year, and we positioned our business to capture growth where it materialized in the IT market.
Specifically in ISG, we delivered record storage revenue of $5 billion, up 10%, including demand growth in PowerFlex, VxRail, Data Protection and PowerStore. We are pleased with our momentum in storage. The investments we made over the years strengthening our portfolio are paying off and have allowed us to drive growth and share gain in what was a resilient storage market in 2022. We grew servers and networking 5% in a challenging server demand environment by optimizing server shipments, along with strong attach and growing ASPs, a clear indication that we continue to sell deeper into customers' digital agendas.
Turning to CSG. The PC market remains challenged. From a historic 2021, the PC market slowed markedly in June and experienced a sharp decline in calendar Q4. Consequently, our fiscal Q4 CSG revenue declined 23% to $13.4 billion. It was a continuation of trends we've seen in recent quarters. Commercial revenue fared better than consumer, down 17% as customers delayed PC purchases in the face of macroeconomic and hiring uncertainty. Consumer was down 40%.
Given the decline in revenue, CSG operating income was $671 million or 5% of revenue, primarily driven by descaling with revenue decreasing faster than OpEx. We are seeing increasing competitive pressure and elevated industry channel inventories, but we continue to maintain pricing discipline, execute our direct attach motion and focus on our relative performance in the most profitable segments of the PC market.
In this challenged and uncertain environment, we've stuck to a playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, staying customer-focused, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline and sustaining our unique and winning culture. In short, we have focused on what we can control.
And in Q4, we continued to take decisive action, extending our existing cost controls, pausing external hiring, limiting travel and reducing outside services spend. We reduced our operating expenses, excluding compensation and benefits, by 5% versus last year, normalized for the extra week in the quarter. We also made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by an additional 5% as announced in February. We will continue to stay disciplined in our expense management as we navigate the current IT spending environment.
In Q4, we also advanced our innovation agenda. We launched our next generation of PowerEdge servers with significantly enhanced AI and machine learning capabilities and improved energy and cost efficiency for data center, cloud and edge environments, including new purpose-built XR servers for telecom, Open RAN and mobile edge use cases.
At Mobile World Congress this week, we announced new solutions and partnerships that will enable the telecommunications industry to accelerate the adoption of open network architecture, including Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks for Red Hat, an integrated solution specifically engineered, validated and supported by Dell to help network operators run their telecom workloads more efficiently.
And we continue to lead in defining the next era of hybrid work solutions. At CES, we made announcements in a number of areas, including high-margin peripherals that improve the employee experience like our premier collaboration keyboard with dedicated touch controls to easily manage Zoom calls and a series of new monitors, including a 32-inch ultrasharp display with 6K resolution. We're proud of the substantial innovation that we've driven in all of our businesses in FY '23, and we have more exciting announcements coming in May at Dell Technologies World.
Let me conclude by offering some brief observations on the demand environment. The broad caution in the IT spending environment that we started calling out in Q2 persists as customers continue to scrutinize every dollar in the current macro environment.
Exiting FY '23, we saw select growth in verticals like financial services, transportation and construction and real estate. However, we've continued to see demand softness across most other verticals, customer types and regions. Underlying demand in PCs and servers remains weak, and we are seeing signs of changing customer behavior in storage. Though Q4 was a very good storage demand quarter, we saw lengthening sales cycles and more cautious storage spending with strength in very large customers, offset by declines in medium and small business. Given that backdrop, we expect at least the early part of FY '24 to remain challenging.
That said, our fundamental belief in both the long-term health of our markets and the advantage of our business model haven't changed. Data continues to increase exponentially in both quantity and value, and customers continue to see us as trusted partners, helping them navigate the complexities of hybrid work, multicloud and the edge.
Unlike in prior cycles, customers are not outright stopping digital investments. They continue to plan projects even as they scrutinize spend. This gives us confidence that we will see a rebound in spending and a return to sequential growth later this year. We're industry leaders in our categories, we're central to the technology agendas of our customers, and we have a track record of meeting our commitments and improving our strategic position no matter the environment.
We plan to stick to the playbook that served us well in FY '23 and prior cycles. Control what we can control, stay disciplined and agile, invest for the long term and meet our commitments to customers, team members and other stakeholders. We've positioned the business to navigate the current uncertainty and for the inevitable rebound.
Now over to Tom for the detailed financials and guidance.",1261
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3307.0,2756779.0,103175173.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Chuck. We're pleased with the full year and Q4 P&L performances given the macro environment. As Chuck highlighted, we set new records this year and have continued to build on our industry-leading positions.
Turning to our Q4 results, which, as a reminder, included a 14th week. We delivered revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with strong ISG performance, particularly in storage. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 410 basis points. Gross margin was $6 billion, up 3% and 23.8% of revenue. Gross margin rate was up 3 points due to a mix shift to ISG, component and logistics cost deflation and pricing discipline.
The pricing environment in ISG was generally consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters, while in CSG, we saw areas of pressure, particularly in consumer and in some commercial markets where, in some cases, our competitors were working to reduce their channel inventory. We continue to be disciplined in our pricing execution and within CSG, driving our direct model with a focus on attaching services, software, peripherals and financing.
Operating expense was $3.8 billion, up 5%, driven by an extra week in our quarter and 15.1% of revenue. In Q4, we recorded a $281 million charge to our GAAP operating expense for our previously announced workforce reduction. Operating income was $2.2 billion, down 1% and 8.7% of revenue with the extra week of operating expenses roughly offsetting an extra week of gross margin.
Our quarterly tax rate was 26% and 20% for the full year. Q4 net income was $1.3 billion, down 5%, primarily driven by slightly higher interest expense, including a 14th week in the quarter and a slight decrease in operating income.
Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.80, up 5% due to a lower share count. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.6 billion a quarter, up 12%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $40 billion, down due to a reduction in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to an increase in service and software maintenance agreements.
Now turning to our business units. In ISG, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7%, driven by strong storage and server and networking performance. Storage revenue was a record $5 billion, up 10%, and servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5%.
ISG operating income came in at a record $1.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, up 360 basis points as we benefited from cost favorability, pricing discipline and revenue growth, including a higher mix of storage software.
Our Client Solutions Group revenue was down 23% to $13.4 billion primarily due to continued softness in both the commercial and consumer PC markets. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 17%, and consumer revenue was $2.7 billion, down 40%, though average selling prices continued to trend higher in both businesses. CSG operating income was $700 million and 5% of revenue.
As we have historically seen when the macro environment has slowed, customers' interest in consumption and financing models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability has increased. Our Q4 Dell Financial Services originations were $3 billion, up 12%, with strength across all geographies. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while credit losses remained at historically low levels, given the strength of our portfolio, which is over 60% investment grade. And we more than doubled the number of active APEX customers that have subscribed to our as-a-Service solutions over the course of the year.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion in Q4 and $3.6 billion for the full year. Our strong Q4 cash flow was driven by profitability partially offset by a use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was down $1.4 billion sequentially due to disciplined management and strong shipments at the end of the quarter. However, the inventory improvement was offset by a temporary increase in receivables driven by linearity of revenue in the quarter and a decline in payables given reduced inventory purchases and timing of disbursements.
Our commitment to improving working capital efficiency remains a priority as we continue to focus on unlocking capital within the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in cash and investments, up $3.7 billion sequentially driven by free cash flow generation and a $2 billion debt issuance, partially offset by $400 million in capital returns.
Our core debt balance ended the year at $18.1 billion, up due to the debt issuance. We intend to use part of the issuance proceeds to pay down the $1 billion maturity coming due in June and will consider using the remaining proceeds to prepay other debt in the capital structure over time.
Turning to capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining the flexibility to be opportunistic. In Q4, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock for $150 million and paid $236 million in dividends. And for the full year, we repurchased 62.4 million shares for $2.8 billion and paid approximately $1 billion in dividends.
As we highlighted in our press release earlier today and as part of our commitment to capital returns, we are raising our annual dividend from $1.32 to $1.48 per share, an increase of 12%, reflecting our confidence in our long-term business model and our ability to generate and grow cash flow over time.
Turning to guidance. Given the demand trends we saw last quarter, we expect Q1 revenue to be seasonally lower than average, down sequentially between 17% and 21%, 19% at the midpoint. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 300 basis point impact to Q1 revenue. We expect the ISG business to be down sequentially in the mid-20s as we come off a seasonally strong storage quarter to Q1, which is typically a seasonally weaker storage quarter, and we expect CSG revenue down sequentially in the mid-teens. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and expect gross margin rates to be relatively flat sequentially.
For our tax rate, you should assume a 24% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q1 and for fiscal year '24. We expect our Q1 diluted share count to be between 737 million and 742 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $0.80, plus or minus $0.15, down sequentially, primarily driven by lower revenue.
For the full year, we continue to see a wide range of outcomes. We expect revenue to be down between 12% and 18% and down 15% at the midpoint of the range. Given Q1 guidance, this implies a return to sequential growth as we move through the year. We'll continue to be mindful of our pricing discipline and our cost structure, making adjustments as appropriate, depending on the environment while also continuing to invest in innovation.
Interest and other will be up approximately $200 million as we fund DFS originations in a higher interest rate environment. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $5.30 plus or minus $0.30.
In closing, we delivered solid fiscal year '23 financial results. And over the last 3 years, we have now grown our revenue at a 6% CAGR and our EPS at an 18% CAGR. While there is near-term uncertainty, particularly in the first half of fiscal year '24, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term, and we remain committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted earnings per share CAGR of 6% plus and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time.
We have returned approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal year '23 through share repurchase and dividends and expect to return 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business in the current macro environment, focusing on what we can control and delivering for our customers. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1369

Thinking about the guidance into the April quarter, I'm curious if you could help me unpack particularly the server business, what you're seeing as far as the demand environment thus far into the April quarter. And how do we kind of triangulate what you've seen from a pricing perspective, sustainability of that as we look at the deflationary elements of component pricing?",71
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3307.0,2756779.0,103175177.0,Answer,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,7,"Yes. Aaron, let me start. The -- look, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we saw a continuation of the trends that we started calling out in Q2 and accelerated in Q3 in the server business with weak underlying demand. And frankly, it deteriorated over the course of the quarter.
The texture we would add would be -- the slowdown is probably most pronounced in the largest customers. Ultimately, our transactional business performed a bit better but was still declining. And the texture was we saw customers still digesting inventory, tightening budgets, stretching decision time lines.
Our win-loss ratio didn't change, and it was in line with historical performance. And as we said, we expect to gain share in Q4. So ultimately, this is the market going through a digestion cycle, not our performance.
As you said, our performance of 5% was driven by a couple of things. One was optimizing shipments in quarter, but the other was higher year-over-year revenue per unit performance. That was higher content rate of memory and SSD, higher services, good attach of our enterprise peripherals, sort of our direct sales motion in action.
Look, ultimately, we are seeing pricing pressure in all our business, and server is not immune. I'd just say we've expected that. We factored that into both our operational and financial plans, and we've factored it into the guidance going forward. So we anticipate in this environment continuing to see pricing pressure, but obviously, we're pleased with the content rate performance and ultimately, the performance of our attach business.",259

I know obviously, it's a difficult backdrop and you talked about sort of the pressure that you saw throughout the quarter and into the beginning part of this quarter. But I think I also caught you mention that it sounded as if ASPs were trending higher. Can you kind of discuss kind of what's driving that and where sort of inventory is for you guys? And how do you think the market inventory looks as we move through the balance of this fiscal year? When do you think we can get to a more normalized inventory position from an industry perspective.",107
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3307.0,2756779.0,103175180.0,Answer,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,10,"Yes. Sure. So look, the CSG business, as you said, it continued to be challenged in the quarter. We won't repeat all the market data, but obviously, Q4 was one of the more challenging volume quarters in history. And both across the consumer market, which continues to be under real pressure where we're seeing significant amounts of inventory in the channel, a much slower China market. And the commercial business continues to remain challenged as those customers are delaying purchases, buying for immediate needs and tilting IT spending elsewhere.
We are seeing, from an inventory standpoint, elevated inventory levels. We obviously benefit in our business from much lower inventory levels, which you have seen consistently in our performance. But there's inventory in both the consumer business and the commercial business now.
Look, ultimately, the guidance that we've given in our comments on the year, we expect the business to return to sequential growth over the course of the year. But without calling specifically right now when inventory -- we'll get back in profile. It will be later in the year, certainly as we enter Q1, inventory is elevated.",188

Look, we benefited from a higher commercial mix in Q4. We benefited from more notebooks than desktops, which carry a higher ASP. And we continue to benefit from our unique operating model, the direct model where we can attach peripherals, software and services, which I think continues to help us. And those businesses are very strong for us. And then if you look inside commercial, our Precision workstation business had a very good quarter on a relative basis, which carries substantially higher ASPs.",94

Historically, you're down about 7% sequentially. You're guiding for down 19%. How much was the extra week? How much was backlog drawdown in the quarter that you don't think replicates? And how much is your assumption for kind of incremental macro weakness because there's still a really big gap between being down 7% and being down 19%, and then you're calling for potentially normal seasonality thereafter?
And then can you also just address free cash flow? I think you're guiding for net income of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. Do you expect free cash flow realization to be better or worse than that number?",128
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3307.0,2756779.0,103175185.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,15,"Toni, let me sort of take the first part of that question on the walk from Q4 to Q1 revenue. So we printed $25 billion, and you're right, typically, we do see sequential sort of in that minus 7% to minus 9% range roughly. So how we think about it in the guide sort of works like this. So the 14th week provided roughly $700 million to $800 million of incremental revenue. So back that off. If you do the RPO deferred revenue math that we provided for you, you sort of get to a backlog adjustment, roughly about $2 billion to $2.2 billion. And then the incremental seasonality or the incremental weakness that we're seeing is sort of the remainder of that, okay? So that walks you down to the $20.2 billion.
So look, I mean, as Chuck mentioned in his opening comments, we are seeing that continued softness. Our expectation and how we have built our plan for the year says we recover throughout the year but we do expect Q1 to sort of have -- to be in that sort of zip code at this point in time.
And then on free cash flow, as you know, we don't guide free cash flow. But I think we would expect cash generation given the plan that we have with sequential improvement as you go through the year to improve cash flow. Tyler, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",243

No, I think that's right.

When we think about a softening demand environment in the year 2023 and your cautionary below normal seasonal for Q1, how should we think about capital deployment?

We're committed to our long-term framework of 40% to 60% shareholder capital return over time. Obviously, we were -- we had an accelerated return in fiscal year '23, given the amount of share buyback we did. I would think about it like this. We raised the dividend 12% to $1.48 on an annual basis for the year. I think that provides a foundation as we think about our confidence in the long-term business model and long-term cash flow generation of the company.
From a share buyback, we don't forecast that, but I'm on the record of saying that we'll manage dilution from a share buyback perspective. And obviously, we'll continue to be opportunistic as we look at the -- where the share price is relative to other uses of our capital.",145

We saw each of them trend kind of in opposing direction, CSG lower than normal, ISG higher than normal. As we think about looking forward, is there any structural change that we should be thinking about? Particularly on the CSG side, should we be thinking about operating margin for this business now closer to 5% to 6%? Or is 6% to 8%, what you've been doing over the last few years, more likely, again, as we look past this near-term dislocation to more normalized times?",98

I would say that I think you're in the ballpark on op margin over how we're thinking about it for the year to be blunt, right? I mean we did enjoy higher op margins over the pandemic period. But I think a more normalized view of -- in the range that you talked about is how we're thinking about the business for the year. Obviously, we're going to do all we can to maximize profitability while making sure that we drive relative performance and share as appropriate. So -- but I think you're in the frame -- you're in the ballpark on how you're thinking about it.
The ISG margins, look, we had a strong Q4. You think about the impact of all of the storage strength that we saw, clearly was very beneficial to the margin. I would highlight the fact that within that storage mix, we had a really strong mix of our own storage software IP, which is very helpful from a profitability perspective, and we expect that mix to continue to be helpful on a go-forward basis.
So look, I tend to think that we're probably back in sort of more normalized, a little bit couple of points less than perhaps we finished in Q4. As you think through the year, 200 to 250 basis points, something like that. But that's the chemistry of the P&L. We expect storage to be stronger next year, servers to be slightly softer in ISG and the CSG business to sort of generate the margins we talked about.",259

You're guiding to about 12% to 18% decline in revenues. Can you share your thoughts about how you're thinking about that split between CSG and ISG for the full year guide? I know you gave some directional commentary on 1Q itself, but just wondering if you can sort of rightsize as to how to think about CSG and ISG. And when you talk about that wide range for the full year guide for the year, where is the bigger variable? Is it more on a CSG recovery? Or in your mind, is this more sort of contingent on how ISG pans out?",117

I would say it like this. I would expect that as we look at the performance of the business units next year, from a growth perspective, they're generally sort of both in the mid -- sort of negative mid-teens in terms of growth rates for the year. Obviously, we guided to a midpoint of minus 15% or you can do the math, $87 billion. So they're generally on top of each other in terms of growth rates.
In terms of the variability, look, I mean, we're cognizant of the state of the macro, the uncertainty in the environment, and as Chuck highlighted in his talking points, there is a level of customer hesitancy out there at this point. So I do think that we built a plan that says that, hey, we expect the sequentials to improve as we go through the year. That's how we thought about the business.
One data point to think about, particularly with PCs is that if you go back and look over time at other recessionary periods, whether it's all the way back to the dot-com bust of 2000 or the great financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, in general, what you see is a period of decline in both client and servers of, say, 4 to 6 quarters worth of decline. And if we think about where we are -- it's not a perfect predictor, but if you think about where we are in the context of that sort of metric to where we are today, we're on the tail end of that. And so we're optimistic that as we go through the year, we'll see some lift in that.
And so look, I'm not going to probability weight where my risk is. I do think that -- I think we've got a solid plan that is focused on executing, and you can count on us to navigate the environment, and we'll be disciplined in how we do it.",327

It sounds like you had a pretty back-end loaded quarter given your comments on the receivables, but you're also talking about weakness here more than normal seasonal in 1Q. Can you talk about maybe what you saw happen to orders a little bit more granularly? What did you see in January? What did you see in February? And are you expecting order patterns to trend here in the near term?",85

Let me start and just tell you what we observed in Q4, which was -- we did see our -- as is typical, given our high storage quarter, linearity trend towards the back part of the quarter. That's not atypical for our business in Q4, particularly given the heavy storage mix and the seasonally strong storage quarter.
I would say that maybe versus historical norms, the server business also tended to trend a little bit more back-end loaded. As I mentioned in my earlier response, we did see deterioration over the course of the quarter of server demand. And to the extent that large bids or deals closed, they did tend to close in the back part of the quarter more than normal. So there was a little bit of uneven seasonality.
I don't know that we expect any material change sort of coming into our next quarter, and we certainly won't try to forecast linearity in the next quarter. I would say storage tends to be booked in the last portion of the quarter, that's very, very typical. Server was a little bit of an anomaly and, I think, reflects the cautious demand environment that we're navigating our way through.",202

That's not unusual on a 6-month quota period. So that also sort of highlights that it was a bit more back-end loaded.
And so -- but Wamsi, in terms of trying to extrapolate that into, okay, how do you think about that demand trend for our linearity pattern for Q1, it's a different pattern in Q1. You're coming off of year-end budgets for corporates that tend to spend a bit more in the fourth quarter versus a seasonally softer quarter. And so it tends to be a bit more -- a little less back-end loaded, but that's hard to predict in this environment, to be honest.",149

That seems to be more severe than I think what your storage or server peers are talking about. I think NetApp said flat storage environment. HPE, I think, raised the full year guide actually right now. So I'm just trying to understand, what are you seeing that's driving a much more tempered outlook versus your peers?
And as you think about this down 15% expectation in ISG, can you just [ slice ] the servers versus storage? Or are you seeing share gains reverse somewhere? Just any clarity that would be helpful because it seems a bit more severe than what IDC, Gartner or your peers are saying.",131

I would say I can't speak to what others have said about their businesses. All I would tell you is that as we think about the trends and what we expect is that we would expect servers to be softer than storage as we go through the full year, right, with probably more pressure on the front half on servers than on the back as we go through the year. We do expect storage to hold up better. Yes, I'm not going to do the split, but that's our general thinking. That's what we see. If it's stronger than that, great. But that's our expectation right now about how we plan the business is on that sort of framework.",120

We build our plans to gain share. So this is what's reflected in our core guide is to gain share in all of our core business as we have consistently. Again, I think the customer texture is what we're reflecting in the guide in Q1, which is that as we enter the year, it's a challenging demand drop -- or demand backdrop, excuse me. It weakened as the quarter progressed.
As we look forward for the rest of the year, as Tom said, we do expect a return to sequential growth. It's driven by really a couple of factors. One is just a belief that when you compare this cycle to prior macro cycles in our industry, that 4 to 6 quarters of demand decline that Tom referenced as being the historic level, we're deep into that now.
And then customers, what I would say is that just the cycle feels different right now. There's less outright company financial distress. There's fewer outright cancellations of projects. We're seeing some evidence of budget stabilizing and even increasing given inflation. So look, in infrastructure, customers are continuing to plan projects, but they're also behaving cautious right now, and that's what's sort of reflected in our commentary.",207

In that last earnings call, you did sound cautious on servers but were more optimistic on your storage business, and now we're seeing you more cautious on storage.

So I'm trying to understand better, what changed in the last 90 days or so to change that view on storage?",95

Thanks for the question. Look, we're just seeing underlying evidence of moderating growth as we came through the quarter. So look, as we said in the prepared remarks, we had a good quarter. And specifically, we saw strength in our very large customers. But that large strength was offsetting declines that we saw in medium and small business. So our medium and small business performance in storage did moderate quarter-on-quarter. And that's typically a leading indicator for us for a slowdown in the business.
And texturally, I would tell you the caution that we saw in the server market is starting to appear in the storage market as well. Cycle times on deals has stretched, the number of opportunities we see has declined, and we see customers resizing budgets, increasing the number of approvals, all of the things that we saw in the server market.
So as you referenced, we've long cautioned that the storage market is not immune to the broader trends in IT, but it often lags the server business. It also shows less amplitude than servers, but it's ultimately not immune. And so that's the caution you hear us, reflecting that's what we saw in Q4. We think we're seeing the early signs of a little bit of slowing in the storage market.",217

Obviously, things seems to have deteriorated throughout the quarter and the correction, like you said, could be 4 to 6 quarters. But I'm curious, are you seeing any of your businesses reaching a trough sooner than others because of your customers so aggressively cutting back on inventory? I'm thinking about server, storage and PC, maybe within PC, consumer versus commercial. Which one will help you come back to resume growth later in the year?",84
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2023",2023-03-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3307.0,2756779.0,103175210.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,40,"Yes. Sidney, look, I think if you look at the pattern, we saw the softness -- if you go all the way back early last year, we saw the softness first manifest itself in the PC space, right? And then the server space followed as we got through Q2, on to Q3, Q4. So logically, one would think that PCs come back -- as we think about a pattern that and how we plan the business, we would expect to see some level of PC recovery as a leading indicator. And then I think servers would follow.
I will highlight Chuck's comment on storage, which is, look, it's not immune to some of the softness, but the amplitude of the variation there is going to be, we think, less just given the data creation activity that's out there in the market and the underlying trends. So I think our perspective is how past patterns have been, I would expect PCs first then servers and then storage to be sort of relatively stable but a little bit of pressure on that.",180

I'll do commodities and then I'll hand it over to Chuck to talk about pricing. But if you think about the environment we're in today and you look at the landscape of inventory, what's happening with the falling demand, we were deflationary in Q4, we expect component cost to be deflationary in Q1 and Q2, most notably driven by DRAM, NAND and LCDs across our businesses.
We also think when you look at freight costs, which we've talked a lot over the past the -- seems forever, but 2 years plus about the rising logistics costs, they have tilted the other way as well. We're paying fewer dollars and supplier premiums, fewer parts are being expedited. Our freight costs are down on those parts. We're able now to use our ocean network more vastly than our air network. We've seen ocean costs come down to near pre-COVID levels, and we've seen air costs come down, not quite to pre-COVID levels, but they have tilted going the other way. So our input costs for the first half of the year will be down.",185

It was most acute in the consumer business where we saw high levels of discounting and front- and back-end rebates being used to move channel inventory. We saw pressure in the commercial PC business as well. It was most acute again in large bids and in our channel stock and sell business where there is still elevated levels of industry inventory. And pricing aggression stepped up in servers as well, again, particularly the largest bids and largest customers.
I'd say -- given what Jeff just said, ultimately, we recognize that in a weak demand environment and a deflationary commodity environment, there's going to be downward pricing pressure. We've obviously factored that into our financial and operating plans and ultimately, the guidance we gave you today. I'd just add that we try to remain very disciplined in our pricing. There's frankly not a lot of elasticity right now in the market, particularly in the commercial PC and server business, so we're being very disciplined given that backdrop.",176

We are -- again, if you compare it to the historic cycles, 4 to 6 quarters of demand decline, and we're deep into that in the PC business.
I think what we would say is in commercial PCs, customers continue to reinforce the criticality of that device to us. As you said, there were 62 million core commercial notebooks shipped in the first 9 months of 2020. A refresh cycle is coming. When exactly that starts is what we're trying to think our way through.

As you are all aware now, Tom has decided that it's time for him to retire from Dell. He will be leaving us at the end of Q2 after an incredible 26 years with the company and as our longest-serving CFO in company history. Since joining Dell in 1997, Tom has overseen every aspect of finance, guiding us through tremendous growth and through some extraordinary milestones, from the merger with EMC, to returning to the public markets, to spinning off Dell's stake in VMware. Tom, thank you for everything, and most of all, thank you for your friendship.
With Tom's retirement, I'd like to welcome Yvonne McGill, currently, our Corporate Controller, as our new CFO effective day 1 of Q3 FY '24. Many of you already know Yvonne. She also joined Dell in 1997. Among other roles, Yvonne has been ISG CFO, Chief Accounting Officer and led our finance functions for our APJ and China business. And as our Corporate Controller, she has been responsible for a number of functions, including ISG, tax, treasury, accounting and Investor Relations since 2020. She is a proven finance leader, and we are all thrilled to have her as our next CFO.
Tom, Yvonne and the team will work closely to ensure a smooth transition. And I know you will all join me in congratulating them both.
To close the call, let me reiterate what you've heard from Tom, Jeff and Chuck. We have delivered strong performance over the last few years, and we did so again in FY '23. We delivered for our customers, drove share gains, generated strong profitability, accelerated our innovation agenda and executed against our capital return commitments.
While the near-term demand environment is challenging, we expect it to improve as we move through the fiscal year.

Our Q1 results demonstrate our strong execution and the power of our model in what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment. At the summary level, we delivered revenue of $20.9 billion, operating income of $1.6 billion, diluted EPS of $1.31 and cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion. Consistent with our commentary in recent quarters, the demand environment remains challenged and customers are staying cautious and deliberate in their IT spending. 
We continue to see demand softness across our major lines of business, all regions, all customer sizes and most verticals. That said, we did see pockets of stronger demand performance worth noting. The CSG business performed sequentially better than our expectations at the time of our Q4 earnings call. And we did see some early signs of demand stabilization in commercial PCs in our small and medium business segments and across our transactional business. In storage, we saw continued demand growth in PowerStore, our marquee midrange offering, and in PowerFlex, our leading software-defined storage solution. 
PowerStore has grown for 11 consecutive quarters since its release and PowerFlex has now grown for 7 consecutive quarters. And in servers, we saw an increase in demand for our AI optimized solutions. Interest has been particularly strong for our new purpose-built 16G server for artificial intelligence, the PowerEdge X9680, though we caution that we are early in the demand cycle for AI infrastructure and it will take time to translate to the P&L. In what was a challenging demand backdrop, we executed extremely well and stayed focused on what we could control. We maintained pricing discipline even as competitors continue to reduce excess channel inventory. Our average selling prices increased, and we delivered strong sequential and year-over-year gross margin performance given lower input costs. 
We continue to maintain strong cost controls, reducing operating expenses by 6%. Since Q1 of last year, we have reduced operating expense by $240 million, and we'll continue to focus on prudent cost management as the year progresses. Our supply chain performed well. We reduced inventory by approximately $800 million in Q1 and by $2.3 billion over the last year, and our lead times and backlog have normalized post pandemic and ahead of competitors. And we are clearly focused on relative performance. We again gained share in calendar Q1 in commercial PCs, excluding Chrome, the most profitable segment of the market and our focus. And we expect to gain share in Q1 in storage when IDC results come out later this month. Though we anticipate some fluctuations in share performance as the year progresses, given the timing of industry backlog reduction, we remain confident in our ability to remain a structural share gainer over the long term. 
We also pressed forward on a substantial innovation agenda. Last week, we hosted our annual Dell Technologies World event with more than 10,000 attendees, and made several big announcements as we advance our strategies in multi-cloud, edge, AI, security, hybrid work and as-a-service solutions. In multi-cloud, we introduced 3 APEX cloud platforms developed with Microsoft, Red Hat and VMware to seamlessly extend cloud platform operating environments to on-premise environments. We also announced new APEX cloud storage for public cloud offerings, bringing Dell's industry-leading block and file enterprise storage capabilities to Azure and AWS environments and delivering on the promise of Project Alpine announced last year. 
We delivered on the vision of Project Frontier, introducing Dell NativeEdge, our software platform that makes it easier for customers to manage, simplify and secure their entire edge estate with a single solution. We announced Project Helix, our collaboration with NVIDIA that enables customers to quickly deploy generative AI on-premises at scale using their own proprietary data safely and securely. Under APEX, we met our commitment to extend as-a-service capabilities across our full portfolio with the addition of compute and PC as a Service. And finally, we announced Project Ford Zero, a collaboration with over 30 partners to develop a U.S. Department of Defense validated solution that will ease the adoption of Zero Trust security in private clouds. 
Looking ahead, we expect the cautious IT spending environment to continue in Q2. We expect CSG to perform closer to historical sequentials, given the pockets of commercial PC demand we saw in Q1 and the duration of the PC down cycle relative to prior cycles. We expect Q2 ISG spending to remain muted as customers scrutinize and prioritize spend, though customers continue to move forward with digital investments. Sales cycles continue to lengthen given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And as the industry levels continue to normalize, we expect an increasingly competitive environment relative to Q1. 
Ultimately, we have confidence in the long-term health of our core markets and the advantages of our business model. Data continues to increase exponentially in both quantity and value, and customers see us as a trusted partner, ready to help them navigate the complexities of multi-cloud, edge, AI, data management and hybrid work. We remain the industry leader in all of our key solution categories, are central to our customers' technology agendas and have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments in any environment. So short and long term, we'll stick to the playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, focusing on customers, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, prudently managing costs, maintaining pricing discipline and investing for the long term. 
Now over to Tom for the detailed Q1 financials.",903
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347890.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Chuck. We're pleased with our Q1 execution given the current environment. We delivered revenue of $20.9 billion, down 20% with strong gross margins and operating cost management. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 290 basis points. Gross margin was $5.2 billion and 24.7% of revenue. Gross margin rate was up 2 points, driven by lower input costs and pricing discipline. We did see increased pricing pressure in Q1, but we're selective on deals depending upon the customer and the opportunity. Expect us to continue to focus on the more profitable segments of the market and remain disciplined on pricing. 
Operating expense was $3.6 billion, down 6%, driven by lower marketing and headcount-related costs and 17.1% of revenue given scaling. We will continue to actively manage our overall spend as we move through the year. Operating income was $1.6 billion and 7.6% of revenue due to a decline in revenue, partially offset by a higher gross margin rate and lower operating expense. Our quarterly tax rate was 22.7%. Net income was $963 million, primarily driven by lower operating income and, to a lesser extent, a higher tax rate. Diluted earnings per share was $1.31, down 29% due to lower net income, partially offset by a lower share count. 
Our recurring revenue in the quarter was approximately $5.6 billion, up 6%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was approximately $39 billion, which was down 7% due to a reduction in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in services and software maintenance agreements. ISG revenue was $7.6 billion, down 18%, driven by soft demand in servers and storage. We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion with demand growth in PowerStore and PowerFlex. While Q1 is seasonally our softest storage quarter, we did see customer decisions extend out and some deal sizes reduced. 
Servers and networking revenue was $3.8 billion. We saw server ASPs continue to expand, and our mix of high-value workload servers increased as we continue to sell deeper into the customers' digital agenda. ISG operating income was $740 million, or 9.7% of revenue, down 2 points, primarily due to a decline in revenue, partially offset by a better gross margin rate. 
Turning to CSG. The PC market has continued to slow since June of last year, and the market declined sharply in calendar Q4 and again in calendar Q1, down 29% in units. Our fiscal Q1 CSG revenue was $12 billion, down 23%, primarily driven by a decline in units, partially offset by higher average selling prices in commercial and consumer. In a continuation of trends we've seen in recent quarters, commercial fared better than consumer. 
Commercial revenue and consumer revenue were $9.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. CSG profitability was strong in Q1, with operating income of $892 million or 7.4% of revenue, up 20 basis points, driven by a higher gross margin rate and lower operating expenses. We remain focused on commercial and the high end of consumer relative performance in executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing. 
Turning to DFS and APEX. Customer interest remains high in consumption and financing models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability. Our Q1 Dell Financial Services originations were $1.8 billion. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.3 billion, up 9%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels. During the quarter, we continued to see APEX momentum, including an increase in the number of APEX customers that have subscribed to our as-a-service solutions. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was seasonally very strong at $1.8 billion, aided by our focus on working capital efficiency. As Chuck mentioned, we reduced inventory by approximately $800 million in Q1 and by $2.3 billion over the last year through disciplined execution and improvement in our supply chain. And our receivables balance benefited from strong collections this quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion in cash and investments, down $1 billion sequentially due to a $1.1 billion of core debt paydown and $527 million of capital returns, offset by free cash flow generation. Our core leverage ratio improved sequentially to 1.7x as we prepaid our $1 billion note due in June. 
Turning to capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining the flexibility to be opportunistic. In Q1, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for $251 million and paid $276 million in dividends. 
Now I'll turn it over to Yvonne to cover our guidance.",777
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347891.0,Presenter Speech,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to guidance. we expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $20.2 billion and $21.2 billion or between down 3% and up 1% sequentially, with a midpoint of $20.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 200 basis point impact to Q2 revenue. We expect CSG revenue to be roughly flat sequentially and ISG down in the low single digits sequentially. With inventories normalizing across the supply chain, we expect a more competitive pricing environment. Given Q1 profitability, combined with more muted sequential component cost deflation, we expect gross margin rates to be down roughly 50 basis points sequentially. We expect our Q2 diluted share count to be between 733 million and 738 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.10. 
For the full year, we're maintaining our FY '24 revenue expectations, down between 12% and 18% and down 15% at the midpoint. Given Q2 guidance, this implies a return to sequential growth in the second half of the year. Interest and other will be up approximately $100 million as we fund DFS originations in a higher interest rate environment. For our tax rate, you should assume 24% plus or minus 100 basis points. We are increasing our expectations for diluted earnings per share to $5.50, plus or minus $0.25. 
In closing, expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business in the current macro environment, focusing on what we can control and delivering for our customers. While there is near-term uncertainty, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term. We are committed to delivering our value creation framework with revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted EPS CAGR of 6% or higher and the net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or higher over time. We have returned $5 billion to shareholders over the last 6 quarters through share repurchases and dividends, approximately 96% of our adjusted free cash flow over that time period, well in excess of our 40% to 60% return target. 
We value our relationships with our shareholders, and we are actively listening to your feedback. We increased our annual dividend by 12% last quarter, and we recently put in place new governance enhancements to our Board and oversight structure. Ellen Kullman, has been elected by our Board as Lead Independent Director, with robust oversight responsibilities. And our Board committee members are independent directors. Also, with recent S&P Global eligibility rule changes, we are encouraged about the potential for future inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.

You only raised the full year guide by $0.20. And then on the revenue side, we're seeing some moving pieces that just look a little bit different than what you expected last quarter in terms of, last quarter, you talked about sequential revenue growth through the year. Now you're talking about a little bit of a weaker 2Q. And so can you just help us understand some of the moving pieces why seasonality might look a bit different today than what you thought 90 days ago and why the first quarter beat doesn't flow through fully through the year?",119

Thanks. I'll start off here. So we did raise EPS given where we landed in Q1. In Q1, you really did see the strength of our model. So we were happy with that performance. But with the channel inventories and backlog clearing across the industry as well as access to lower cost components, we're expecting a more competitive environment going forward in the second quarter and beyond. The other areas we're looking at around component costs expecting to be deflationary in the second quarter, and you'll see that resulting in some gross margin dilution going forward. 
All of these areas were contemplated in the guide we gave. And I want to reiterate it's still early in the year, right? It's the first -- we just finished the first quarter. And so we want to make sure that we maintain balanced approach there and with our priorities around our relative performance, balancing growth and profitability and continuing prudent cost control.",161

I think, Yvonne, you just said it's definitely a more competitive environment. So where is Dell going to be kind of flexing more in its ability to drive more share with price? And in what areas do you think that won't be quite as much where there might not be as much elasticity of demand?",87
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347898.0,Answer,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,11,"Wamsi, it's Chuck. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think our posture has changed over multiple quarters on that topic. We maintain a balanced approach to profitability. And we are finding in the current environment, whether it's the CSG business or end servers or storage, there's just not a lot of price elasticity out there to use. If there's a place in the business where we see elasticity, it's in the consumer business, which is a very small portion of what we focus on. So look, the pricing environment, as we've seen it through Q1 has been more challenged. 
We're certainly seeing more aggression out there that always presents to us deals that we could choose to take at a margin losing proposition and we tend to steer clear of those. If we don't see a path to margin recovery, we tend to not play. So even in the falling deflationary environment, that's the posture we're taking. I would say across the business generally, we've seen TRUs remain stable, and that's both a function of, I think, that pricing discipline as well as the power of our direct model. Our attach in our CSG business as well as in our ISG business was good in Q1, and that helped offset that competitive pricing pressure that we saw across the portfolio.",221

That's part of the model that Chuck referred to in our prepared remarks. I think we've also been consistent that not all share gain in all categories is equivalent. So our focus continues to be in what we think are the advantaged opportunities for us, commercial PCs workstations, high-end consumer PCs and gaming and the opportunities that exist in our broad storage portfolio and server business. That's where we'll focus on share gains. We're a long-term share acquirer or gainer, and we'll continue to do so.",106

So I was hoping you could talk about, a, just free cash flow generation for the company broadly, how do you really think about it for the year, and is there any way to think about what normalized cash cycle they should look like for Dell. That would be really helpful. 
And then b, I think, Tom, you talked about in the press release about how shareholder return is in excess of your target. Does that mean we should start to think about buybacks consistently outpacing your prior framework? Or anything on the buyback front would be helpful.",114
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347902.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,15,"Amit, it's Tom. Let me start with your second part of that question, and then I'll pivot over to Tyler, so we can chat about how we think about free cash flow in context of the financial model. Look, I mean, I think the shareholder return over the last 6 quarters has been -- I think we're right around $5 billion of overall capital return. And I think that's roughly about 96% of our free cash flow generation over that period of time. Obviously, part of that was the catch-up from the dilution that came out of the VMware spin, but we've been very much focused on how do we return and create shareholder value over that period of time. 
I also think you've seen -- you've heard from Michael over the last month or 2 or last quarter or so around the fact that he believes that there is incremental capability and capacity around capital return to shareholders, and that's something we're clearly evaluating. As we work our way through that, we'll continue to be opportunistic in how we think about share buyback relative to other uses of capital, we do have some debt that we're continuing that will -- we're focused on paying down this year in addition to the $1 billion that we just highlighted in the call. But look, I think from our commitment to our investor base is that we'll continue to drive shareholder value and capital return through, I think, an appropriate level of capital allocation. 
And then, Tyler, why don't we turn it over to you and talk about free cash flow for a second?",272
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347903.0,Answer,Tyler Johnson,,Executives,16,"Yes. Let me try to frame it, maybe talking a little bit about what happened last year and then what we're seeing now, right? So last year, we obviously had a headwind from a working capital perspective. And we -- as you know, we've got a negative cash conversion cycle, and that can be a big driver of what our cash does. And we talked about last quarter how we didn't expect working capital to be a headwind this year. And what you saw in Q1 was obviously a pretty big benefit coming from both inventory and on the receivables side. 
As I think about going forward and just recognizing, as a reminder, we don't give guidance, I would think about it this way. I think we still have opportunities in working capital, but it's not going to improve in a linear fashion. So I think that this is going to happen over time. We remain very focused on it. And as you think about what we've talked about in the second half of the year, returning to sequential growth, that would help throw off good cash. So look, I feel good about the year and where we are. I think that we'll migrate back towards that [ 1x ]. And I think to your question about what's normalized, I think what I would pay attention to is working capital. That has the biggest impact. And as you see us improve there, you'll see cash improve.",246

I think historically, you're up about 6% to 8% in revenues on a sequential basis. You're guiding for flat to slightly down. And I think you also commented, or Chuck did, in the prepared remarks that you expected kind of normal seasonal growth in PCs. So I wanted to understand, I'm still struggling to draw the bridge between normal seasonality and what you're guiding to. Is this all price? Or do you think the markets are weakening incrementally so that they're below normal seasonality? Or is there something about what happened with backlog this quarter? I was sort of under the impression you were going to build more backlog than normal this quarter, which would point to above seasonal growth. Maybe you can just help square the circle on how we should think about your guidance relative to seasonality and what the demand outlet out there is.",158

Thanks, Toni. Let me start on the CSG portion of the question, and then let me hand over to Yvonne on unpacking the guidance. But look, I would categorize the client business as still recovering. So I'd start with the consumer business, obviously, it remains under pressure. The commercial business showed some pockets of improvement. Our small and medium business performance improved as we called out, and it outperformed large enterprises. That is typically a good leading indicator for us. And our transactional business, which is inclusive of our small and medium business segment, but also reflects the run rate enterprise demand that is out there, also showed some signs of stability as we move through the quarter. 
But what has not fully recovered yet is the large bids from the largest customers. And that's ultimately the demand that we're going to need to see for a full-scale recovery in the PC market. Enterprises just continue to be cautious about their spending. So that's what's factored into our Q2 guidance. We expect CSG revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. That reflects a recovering but not fully recovered market. I think if you look at it, it's probably closer to the 3-year average sequential but not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. Yvonne?",212
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2023",2023-06-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3301.0,2830173.0,105347907.0,Answer,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,20,"Thanks, Chuck. Toni, I'd also add, I think our 3-year sequential is running at about 4% from Q1 to Q2. So that will be -- that's part of that. And what we flashed obviously is lower than that, sequential at the midpoint, down 1%, with CSG being flat and ISG being down [ 4 ]. So I think that we're starting to see that. We also had -- as we disclosed today a better-than-expected first quarter. And so that's having a little bit of an impact in the CSG space also. As I look through the rest of the guide, I think, again, we've talked about revenue, but other areas, we're expecting OpEx to be down sequentially, really in line with revenue at the midpoint. And we're expecting interest and other to be up about $60 million sequentially. So those are some of the elements that we're evaluating as we look through the guidance.",154

Let me also just add, if you step back and think about the Q1 revenue of $20.9 billion, which obviously came in higher than what our guide was when we talked about this a few months ago, included in that was some backlog reduction. And yes, backlog in our minds, is in a normal range, and we think about that as a range, not a point estimate and our -- if you look at our lead times, they're generally in line, except for maybe 1 or 2 outliers. So there was -- between -- if you look at our RPO walk, you can see there's roughly a $400 million to $500 million backlog reduction in that Q1 revenue number. And then so you think from a normalized base of roughly 20.4, then you take a -- we're about a 2% sequential growth up -- or 1.5% to 2% sequential, up to get to the [ 20.7 ]. It's lower than the 4% normal seasonal. There's also a bit of pricing pressure in there from ASPs given some of the component cost declines. And so that's the mix that's in play right now as we think about that 20.7 midpoint guide.",203

But I'm also wondering in your conversations with customers, and I know it's early days, but how they're thinking about AI deployments where they think the data will reside where they want to inference. Just I'm curious because you have all these conversations, it would be helpful to get some feedback.",94

Let me start on the question of kind of the demand we're seeing and what we're hearing from customers, and then I'm going to ask Jeff to jump in on the technical aspects and what we're seeing in the portfolio. But look, I mean, we are seeing a lot of demand for AI optimized infrastructure. That's obviously a very good thing for our business. Customers, enterprises are broadly pursuing and experimenting with AI efforts right now. They're doing it on-premise and at the edge. And as the leader in infrastructure and data, that obviously has -- is good news for our business. As we said in our prepared remarks, demand for our XC9680, that's our 16G and first-to-market purpose-built AI server with 8 NVIDIA H100 or A100 GPUs, has been very good. But we're also seeing demand across our portfolio. It's not simply the specialized 8-way GPU servers that can run AI, not everything needs billions of parameters. 
So net, look, we look at it and say, AI is going to drive demand for our business. It's going to drive demand for our business on-premise and at the edge, which is incremental growth and profitability for us. I just caution, as we said in our prepared remarks, that we are early in the demand cycle. And it's going to take time for that to translate to the P&L. Excitement for AI applications is ahead of GPU supply right now. And AI-optimized servers are still a very small part of our overall server mix. So ultimately to see a full recovery in our server business, it's going to require mainstream service to accelerate as well.",277

Maybe Shannon some perspective on use cases. We've had AI and our PCs for years. So I don't know if it was recently said that we've been putting AI in our products across our server portfolio, our storage portfolio and our PC portfolio for many, many years. So those that are following -- that's the right thing to do. It's putting intelligence into our products to make better experiences for customers is absolutely what we've been doing and see. We're excited in the PC with what was announced at BUILD last week with new versions of Windows 11 with co-pilot and more integrated AI capability. I love it as perhaps a reason to buy a new PC. We've got to get that done and get the products out of the marketplace, but that's a pretty exciting opportunity being able to use Windows and the different forms of applications in a very different way and a more efficient way. So that's exciting. And then where all the buzz is, is on generative AI and large language models. And it's an incredible opportunity. 
Demand, as Chuck referred to, has been great. I think that continues because, quite frankly, what customers are trying to do is to figure out how to use their data with their business context to get better business outcomes and greater insight to their customers and to their business. And while there's a lot of discussion around these large generalized AI models, we think the more specific opportunity is around domain-specific and process-specific generative AI where customers can use their own data. The data sets tend to be smaller. Those data sets then can be trained more quickly, and they can use their business context to help them inform and run their businesses better. We think that's the opportunity in front of us. 
And it's quite honestly why we announced Project Helix last week with NVIDIA, an opportunity to take enterprise AI at scale. They are easy to deploy, easy to design, easy to put install and use pretrained models, tune models and be able to drive inference out in the data center and at the edge. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities in front of us.",370

You mentioned loss volume leverage. Was there anything sort of unique in the quarter that maybe hit margins? I know you had a little bit of a benefit in the fourth quarter that was not sustainable. And how do we think about it as demand comes back reasonably to normal? Should server margins and storage margins be in that sort of historical 11% to 12% range? And longer term, what is potentially richer configurations mean for ISG margins down the road as we see obviously higher end use cases? And obviously, the talk of the town is AI. But as configurations become richer and richer, does that mean better pricing and ultimately clearly better margins for the ISG business? Or should we expect sort of a run rate that's more consistent with the past?",149

So in general, what we saw was relatively strong server margins given the cost environment we were in. So with the inventory work that the team did, the ability to get to the component -- incrementally lower component cost was helpful in the discover portfolio in Q1. And so I'm pleased with what we saw from the server op margin in Q1. Storage is a slightly different story. Now think about seasonality in storage typically our softest quarter from a demand perspective and from a shift perspective with storage and that clearly played out with what we saw in the quarter, generally soft storage demand. And in there, we did see some year-over-year margin pressure given some of the descaling that we saw, quite frankly, with lower revenue, lower gross margin dollars and some pressure on operating margin there. 
Now look, we'll continue to make sure that we're adjusting the portfolio and the cost environment as we move forward in that as you go forward. As you fast forward and you think about the opportunity around margins, given pricing and component costs, I think there's some opportunity there that we'll be able to take advantage of as it relates to gross margin dollars, particularly on configuration as configurations get richer. I do think that, as Yvonne and Chuck alluded to, that the server ASP dynamic where we're going to see some declines over time, given some of the pricing dynamics. So I think you get back to more historical norms, and storage is generally going to be just what's the revenue velocity going to look like in the mix within that. Chuck, Yvonne, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",298

I think the question on AI margins, I would just continue to say, look, we view it as incremental growth and incremental margin dollars, the ASPs of our AI-optimized service are a multiple of our normal server average, and we see lots of opportunities to provide services around this infrastructure. These are critical workloads that are dealing with critical-sensitive data. So we ultimately don't see it as a commoditized space in the enterprise.

Let me take that, Samik. As we are talking about sequential growth in the second half across the portfolio and inclusive of ISG and CSG, from an overall standpoint, I think that as we look at an OpEx level and spend level, that's certainly something that we'll continue to optimize.

It's come in stronger than what I had anticipated, quite frankly, because we got to lower component costs. As we thought -- as the inventory management, I think, was quite strong. So that, combined with the pricing discipline that we talked about in our talk track as well as the fact that, quite frankly, we didn't see a lot of elasticity out there. So to burn economics on transactions or customer deals that didn't make sense to us we passed on. 
So CSG profitability was quite strong. And that's really a driver of a lot of the margin upside or the profitability upside we saw in the quarter. As it relates to ISG, it's sort of a tale of 2 different sort of [ labs ], right? The server margins were in the range that I expect it to be maybe a little bit stronger than I expected them to be given the component cost declines again. Storage margins were lower than I anticipated, quite frankly, because of the descaling that we saw in the P&L with the lower revenue, which obviously translates into lower gross margin dollars. And even though we've taken a number of OpEx actions, those are going to work their way through the P&L as we go through the year. So yes. So there were some -- obviously, some variances against the guide that we gave. I think we'll work through those as we go forward.",261

Where are we in the cycle? And what's your expectation for the year?",66

Let me build on my prior comments. Look, I don't think we have a ton to add to our prior public comments on the size of the unit PC TAM. We continue to peg at around 250 million units. And as I always emphasize, the reality is not all of these PC units are created equal, right? So on an ASP basis, a commercial non-Chrome PC is more valuable than a Chromebook and a premium consumer PC above $800 is 2.8x more valuable than a mainstream consumer PC. So when we look at the TAM post pandemic, what we see is a bigger revenue and profit market than we did going into the pandemic, and that's net impact of the PC being asked to do more in a hybrid world. 
In terms of the refresh cycle, again, as we called out, we see the business moving closer to normal sequential. So the rate of decline in the business has come down. That's starting to show signs of stability. And look, what we know is we've, as an industry, shipped 950 million units over the last 3 years. We, Dell, shipped 160 million PCs over the last 3 years. That mix is more heavily notebook. And all of our telemetry data says those devices are still in use. 
So you have a commercial PC installed base that's at the highest levels that we've seen since 2014, given that we're now entering the fifth quarter of a commercial PC downturn that is typically 4 to 6 quarters in length. All of that points to improving sequential growth as the year progress. When and how fast that recovers, to be determined. But we certainly see customers having stretched a very large commercial installed base for some time.",295

We were taking share before the pandemic. We took share through the pandemic. We expect to take share after the pandemic. We are a consolidator. We were consolidating before, through and after. We'll continue to focus on the differentiated aspects of our model, which allows us to attach services, software and peripherals and drive differentiated performance with our business, which you saw in the quarter.

Thanks for the question. Let me share what I can. Look, we continue to be really pleased with our APEX strategy and performance. We're seeing really healthy customer interest and growth, particularly in this economic environment where customers are looking to stretch every IT dollar and they're looking to optimize cloud spend. Look, as we've highlighted in the past, our focus is on trying to offer customers choice across our portfolio and steadily building the customer base and our ARR while driving technical milestones. So on the latter, we made an important series of APEX announcements at DTW last week, including a number of differentiated multi-cloud solutions, APEX cloud platforms, APEX Storage for Public Cloud and our APEX Navigator offering. And then we extended our APEX portfolio across our entire business with the addition of APEX Compute and APEX PC as a Service. 
So it is now the most comprehensive as-a-service and multi-cloud portfolio in the industry and we're getting a lot of client and customer interest in that offering.

Look, it just remains a challenging demand environment clearly on ISG. The caution that we saw enter the spending environment in Q2 of last year continues a year later. Customers aren't outright canceling digital projects, but they are prioritizing spend and they continue to constrain investments in infrastructure hardware after the burst of pandemic spending the last couple of years. If you look specifically at servers, the most acute demand challenges are in the large bids with the largest customers. That reflects that tightening budget environment, and we're seeing lengthening decision timelines. And look on storage, as we cautioned during our Q4 earnings call, it's not immune to the IT cycles. It typically lags servers, but it's never fully insulated. And after seeing slowdowns in small and medium business in Q4, we saw a slowdown in larger customers in Q1. So you take our Q4 and our Q1 storage results together, we're clearly seeing a lull in the storage market. And so that's what's inputted into our guidance of ISG, down in the low single digits in Q2, which just sort of reflects that continued cautious spending environment.",208

So including today's call, this is my 38th earnings call as the CFO of the company. And so it's obviously been an amazing journey as we've transformed the company and created shareholder value over the last decade or so with our solution capability, the EMC merger, then the latest being our spin out of VMware as our shareholders. And we also have evolved our technology vision. We're #1 in virtually every category, and we're clearly at the center of our customers' digital journey.

But I also want to just say thank you to all of you for your feedback, your partnership and your deep relationships that we've had with the investment community. So I'm going to leave the company in strong hands with a great team and great hands with Yvonne as she steps into the leadership role as the CFO. And obviously, I'll be cheering the company on as we move forward. So let me just finish by saying thank you, thanks for your support and your trust over the last decade. So talk to you guys at some point in the future. Take care.",244

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2023",2023-08-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3434.0,2900477.0,107186363.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. Coming into the quarter, we were cautious given our Q1 results, but the demand environment improved at a faster rate than we anticipated, particularly as we move into June and July. Operationally, we executed well with expense controls, pricing discipline and lower input costs. We sharpened our focus on pricing this quarter, and we were selective on deals, particularly where share benefits would have been temporary. While revenue was down year-over-year, a better demand environment and strong execution enabled extraordinary Q2 results, revenue was $22.9 billion, with operating income of $2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.74, well ahead of our initial expectations.
We are encouraged with some of the signs we are seeing in the macro environment as we move into the second half. We saw better underlying demand in the U.S. market and EMEA was better than anticipated. We also saw demand growth in government and SMB and our transactional demand improved through the quarter. However, most of our largest global customers remain careful with their spending levels. From a solutions perspective, we saw significant strength in AI-enabled servers. PowerFlex and PowerStore demand grew within our storage portfolio. 
PowerFlex, our proprietary software-defined storage solution has now grown 8 consecutive quarters with demand in Q2 more than doubling year-over-year. Workstation demand grew and was another bright spot that will continue to benefit from the rise of AI. Developers and data scientists can now fine-tune GenAI models locally before deploying them at scale. Commercial PC demand improved sequentially and as we move through the quarter. And S&P attach rates were strong, particularly in software. Our ASPs continue to expand across AI servers, traditional servers and commercial PCs.
Overall, we were pleased with the quarter given strong sequential growth of 10% and growing interest in orders in AI solutions. Artificial intelligence is a strong tailwind for all things data and compute as well as CSG when you think about the potential for workstations and eventually all PCs. AI is expanding the TAM for total technology spending and is projected to grow at a 19% CAGR for the next couple of years to approximately $90 billion, including hardware and services. 
In Q2 alone, we saw unprecedented strength from our PowerEdge XE9680. It's the fastest ramping new solution in Dell history and builds on the success of other GPU-enabled servers we've been selling for years. The 9680 is a key element to our Dell generative AI solutions engineered to speed the deployment of a modular, secure and scalable platform for generative AI in the enterprise. 
AI servers increased to 20% of our servers order revenue in the first half of the year and the 9680 was a big factor. Currently, we have approximately $2 billion of XE9680 orders in backlog and our sales pipeline is substantially higher. GenAI represents an inflection point driving fundamental change in the pace of innovation while improving the customer expectation and enabling significant productivity gains and new ways to work.
As the #1 infrastructure provider, we are clearly positioned to serve the market in a unique and differentiated way. And we have the world's broadest GenAI infrastructure portfolio that spans from the cloud to the client. Customers big and small are using their own data and business context to train, fine-tune and inference on Dell infrastructure solutions to incorporate advanced AI into their core business processes effectively and efficiently. We can help customers size, characterize and build the GenAI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Many of these new workloads will be on-prem or at the edge given the importance of latency, data security and cost.
In the near term, we are seeing organizations concentrate on 4 GenAI use cases, customer operations, content creation and management, software development and sales. And internally, we are doing the same to enhance how we build products, service our customers and improve productivity and efficiency.
As we think about the back half of the year, we are coming off a Q2 where we grew above normal seasonality and demonstrated the power of our model to generate cash in a sequential growth environment. You should expect us to focus on growing and extending our core business in the areas with the most attractive profit pools, deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined on our pricing and focus on costs with multi-cloud edge and GenAI as tailwinds. I like our hand and look forward to talking more about our views on technology trends, strategy and innovation at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October. 
Now over to Yvonne for a detailed Q2 financials.",763
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2023",2023-08-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3434.0,2900477.0,107186364.0,Presenter Speech,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,3,"Thanks Jeff. We're pleased with our Q2 execution in an improving demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.9 billion, down 13% and up 10% on a sequential basis with strong gross margins and strong operating expense and net working capital management. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points.
Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.1% of revenue. Our gross margin rate was up 270 basis points, driven by lower input costs and pricing discipline. We did see increased pricing pressure in Q2, but we're selective on deals depending on the customer and opportunity. As Jeff mentioned, we are focused on profitable opportunities rather than temporary share gains.  And you can expect us to continue to focus on the more profitable segments of the market and maintain pricing discipline.
Operating expense was $3.6 billion, down 4% driven by lower discretionary spend in SG&A and was flat sequentially. Operating expense was 15.5% of revenue and we will continue to actively manage our spend as we move through the second half. Operating income was $2 billion, up 1% and 8.6% of revenue. With the impact of the decline in revenue offset by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense.
Our quarterly tax rate was 20.4%. Net income was $1.3 billion, up 1%, primarily driven by higher operating income and diluted EPS was $1.74, up 4% due to lower share count and higher net income. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 8%, and our remaining performance obligations or RPO, was $39 billion, up 1% sequentially driven by deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements.
ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 11% and but up 11% sequentially on the back of improving server and storage demand. We delivered storage revenue of $4.2 billion with demand growth in PowerStore and PowerFlex.
Servers and networking revenue was $4.3 billion. We saw server ASPs continue to expand and our AI server mix of server revenue demand continued to increase given the recent rise in customer interest in generative AI solutions. Both storage and servers and networking revenue were up 11% sequentially. ISG operating income was $1 billion or 12.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points, driven by an increase and gross margin rate, offset by a decline in revenue.
Turning to CSG. The calendar Q2 PC market was down 14% in units but is now showing signs of improvement, up 7% sequentially. Our fiscal Q2 CSG revenue was $12.9 billion, down 16%, primarily driven by a decline in units, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Revenue grew 8% sequentially and commercial continues to fair better than consumer with commercial revenue growing sequentially to $10.2 billion (sic) [ $10.6 billion ]. Consumer revenue was $2.4 billion. CSG profitability remained strong in Q2, with operating income of $1 billion or 7.5% of revenue, up 120 basis points, driven by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense as we maintained pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs.
We remain focused on commercial and the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing. Customer interest remains high in financing and consumption models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability. Our Q2 Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 1%. 
DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong and credit losses near historically low levels. During the quarter, we continued to see Apex momentum, including a strong double-digit percentage increase in a number of new Apex customers that have subscribed to our as-a-service solutions with strength in our data center utility and flex on demand offerings.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, sequential growth and profitability. Within working capital, we reduced inventory $0.4 billion sequentially and continued strong collections performance with [ pass-through ] now at record low levels. 
With the work we've done on net working capital post pandemic, our cash conversion cycle has now improved to negative 50 days in Q2, in line with pre-COVID levels. Cash and investments was up $0.7 billion sequentially driven by free cash flow generation offset by $1.1 billion of debt paydown and $0.5 billion in capital returns. In Q2, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $49.53 and paid a $0.37 per share of dividend. Our core leverage improved to 1.6x exiting the quarter, and we ended Q2 with $9.9 billion in cash and investments, which gives us flexibility to increase our return of capital going forward.
Since we implemented our current capital allocation framework 6 quarters ago, we have returned over 90% of our adjusted free cash flow in the form of share repurchase and dividends, and we continue to evaluate enhancements to our framework based on investor feedback.
Turning to guidance. We're seeing signs of stability across a number of areas within our business, including small and medium business and government. But our largest corporate and global enterprise customers are still measured in their IT project investments and spending plans. Against that backdrop, we expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $22.5 billion and $23.5 billion with a midpoint of $23 billion, flat sequentially.
Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 40 basis point impact to Q3 revenue. We expect both CSG and ISG revenues to be roughly flat sequentially. Although we remain disciplined and focused on profitable share, we expect a more competitive pricing environment. 
Combined with more muted component cost deflation, we expect gross margin rate will be down 150 basis points sequentially. Our continued focus on cost controls will drive lower sequential operating expense that partially offset expected gross margin dilution. We expect our Q3 diluted share count to be between 733 million and 737 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $1.45 plus or minus $0.10.
For the full year, we're raising our FY '24 revenue expectations to be in the range of $89.5 billion and $91.5 million, down 12% at the midpoint. Given Q3 guidance, this implies sequential growth in Q4. We expect interest and other to be roughly flat year-over-year. For our tax rate, you should assume 22.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We are increasing our expectations for diluted earnings per share to $6.30, plus or minus $0.20.
In closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term with AI, multi-cloud and edges tailwinds. We have generated $8.1 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency in working capital during a more challenging demand environment. And our Q2 performance underscores the power of our model to generate cash when we return to sequential growth. We remain focused on executing our strategy, investing in innovation to expand our TAM and winning the consolidation of our core markets, including multicloud, edge, telco and AI.
Expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business, focusing on what we can control and delivering to our customers and our shareholders. And we look forward to seeing you all at our Security Analyst Meeting in October, where we'll provide updates on our strategy, long-term value creation framework and capital allocation policy.

Discuss 4 core use cases, but can you talk on a segment and a geographic basis? And how should we think about ASP potential for both servers and storage with AI-oriented solutions. I'm just wondering, is AI going to drive sort of a change in hardware spend that you think is more of a secular positive versus maybe temporary in nature?",87

First of all, we think AI, and I think I've said this in our last, Ask the Experts, call but I think it's worth reinforcing is, it's just a new series of workloads and new incremental capability that goes across the PC to the data center to the cloud. And we think it is absolutely because of the uniqueness of the workload, a growth opportunity in all 3 of those areas. Distinct and how it's built out, distinct and how it's going to be used on the PC, opening a whole new opportunity to drive productivity and a great productivity device as is, being able to use these big foundational models at cloud scale. 
And then what we think really happens on the enterprise level in business is sort of the notion of domain-specific, process-specific or field of study type of AI, where we actually use customers' data, business will use their data, they will tune the model and then run inference at site on edge, whether that be in a smart factory, smart hospital, in a transportation network.
So when you think about the vertical nature of this and how it will actually work in the real world, we think that technology makes its way all the way out to the edge, AI follows where the data is going to be created, where the sensors are collecting the information and that allows us to put those compute resources where the data is actually being again created. That is not specific to geography. It's not specific to size of business, it going to be really driven by the type of application and the usage environment. And I think that is what's really exciting about this. 
We think it's one size does not fit all. We think there's a whole slew of AI solutions, again from the PC to workstations to what happens in the data center and the data center could be a single server running inference at the edge. It could be defined as a small cluster doing a small micro or fine level tuning all the way into these big foundational models where we do cloud scale training. 
So -- in a nutshell, I guess, that's as quickly as I could describe the opportunity. We believe it is incremental. Am I going to say it doesn't come at the expense of some data center servers, of course, not. I don't think we know it's in the early innings. We do know the workloads are distinctly different. The architectures are distinctly different, and we will build different systems for AI and that massive, if you will, data processing that's done in parallel versus how we've historically built applications in the past for the data center.",464

So obviously, it's a bit of a rush right now with some limited supply and some gating factors, and you talked about $2 billion of servers in your order book. Can you kind of just share with us sort of how you see yourself competitively sitting into that queue? And are you seeing any sort of challenges in getting ample supply to sort of meet that order book? And how should we expect that order book to sort of filter through revenue as supply becomes available?",119

Maybe the easiest measure to determine where we are with supply is demand is way ahead of supply. If you order a product today, it's a 39-week lead time, which would be delivered the last week of May of next year. So we are certainly asking for more parts, working to get more parts. It's what we do. I'm not the allocator, I'm the allocatee. So we're advocating our position on our demand. Again, we are winning business signaled by the $2 billion in backlog today with a pipeline that's significantly bigger. 
I was in the discussion yesterday with 2 different customers about AI, the day before about AI. It is constantly something that's coming into our business that we're fielding the opportunities. From different cloud providers to folks building AI as a service to enterprises now beginning to do proof of concept and trying to figure out how they do exactly what I just said earlier, use their data on-premise to actually drive AI to improve their business. 
We'll continue to work and advocate for more supply, and then I'll also tell you, we're tracking at least 30 different accelerator chips that are in the pipeline in development that are coming. So there are many people that see the opportunity. Some of these new technologies are fairly exciting from neomorphic type of processors and 8  types of accelerators, there's a series of new technologies and quite frankly new algorithms that we think open up the marketplace and we'll obviously be watching that and driving that across our businesses and helping customers.",264

Just trying to square the guidance for ISG to be flat when you talked about seeing order improvement? And maybe if you can talk about what are the -- sort of what did you see in terms of linearity of orders during the quarter, both in servers and storage. I mean I understand large enterprises might be still measured, but you did mention there are sort of other segments of the market or verticals that are spending, and it does look like you're seeing more sort of macro -- green shoots of a macro improvement. So just trying to square like how much of that flat guidance sort of embeds pricing being the major driver of that sort of flattish guide versus demand? Just help me square that, please.",133

So as we're looking into the third quarter and we're talking about the external environment. We have a lot of near-term dynamics that we're navigating through. We're confident about the go forward, but we're guiding to flat sequentially at $23 billion. We're expecting stability we've seen in the transactional business. So I talked about small business, medium business and government. .
But in the ISG space, which you're particularly asking about, we're expecting that to be overall flat sequentially with servers a bit better, really on the -- leaning in on the GCI -- GPU mix, excuse me, but not expecting that rate of decline to improve much on the rest of the server portfolio. And then from a storage perspective, we've got a seasonality, we're normally seasonally down in the third quarter.
And so that storage -- we're expecting a lower storage performance in that quarter. Now at CSG, we also have it flat. We have some mixed dynamics in there with mixing more towards the holiday period. So we'll have that coming in. And we'll have that also with some [ TRU ] pressure that we're expecting from the external environment.",202

I might add it's a complement, Yvonne, just said on the ISG, specifically storage as you mentioned, it's seasonally down Q2 to Q3.

I think you said your server backlog in revenue terms was 20% GPU or accelerator based. I just wanted to confirm that. And as context, could you add what was the percentage of server revenues this quarter that was GPU-based and a year ago? .
And then my question is just on operating margins, you're kind of above your historical levels in [ CSG ] of 5% to 7% you're above ISG historically, maybe 11% to 12%. Is there anything structurally that's changing or was this kind of a unique quarter in terms of strong sequential growth in cost control and maybe even next quarter given the gross margin guidance, we should be back down to normal levels or is there something either about AI or about how you're picking where you want to participate, that the kinds of margins we saw this quarter in both businesses might be something we might continue to see.",164

I believe my remarks were 20% of the first half orders in servers or AI-based servers, the XE family, et cetera. And if you were to compare it against a year ago since the XE family of products did not exist, and that's the vast majority of the backlog. It's a very large percentage on a year-over-year basis. I actually did calculate it, but it'd be a very big number. given most of the $2 billion backlog I noted is XE9680 base. .",93

I think what we saw or what we did see in Q1 and Q2 was really, I think, a great example of our differentiated model, right, with the ability to capture that deflationary environment and translate it through the P&L quite quickly. We saw component deflation that was better than anticipated and stable [ TRUs ] and that let us really deliver that higher margin rate. In Q3, though, we're expecting a few things, right, a more competitive environment now that we're seeing inventory levels more normalized. 
And we think that we'll see more of our competitors have that broader access to lower component costs. And then I'd wrap on that with saying that we're expecting a deflationary environment to continue, but less so or more muted in the third quarter than what we saw in Q2. So there -- we're very pleased with how we performed in the second quarter. And both CSG and ISG that are expecting that competitive pressure to -- and mixed dynamics, especially in the third quarter coming through in ISG as we mix less towards storage seasonally, and we'll mix back into the storage element in the fourth quarter.",205

Thanks for the question and also congrats on the results. I'm going to shift away from the AI narrative and maybe talk a little bit about the balance sheet side of the equation for Dell. I think in your prepared comments, you highlighted that you've now got, I think it was close to $9.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And one of the things you also mentioned was improving flexibility or increased flexibility on capital return side. So I'm curious of how you're thinking about capital return relative to M&A? And any context of how much capacity or maybe put in other way, how much operational cash do you necessarily need as we think about the excess cash that you're carrying on the balance sheet on top of the free cash flow generation for the company.",139

Maybe I'll start and Yvonne might step in. But I think we've always talked about our minimum cash balances being somewhere around, call it, $4 billion to $5 billion. Now it doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to run at those levels. But clearly, we have excess cash. As you saw, it was a really strong cash quarter. And actually, if you look at the first half of the year at $5 billion of CFOps that's a record, right? So great job by the teams on working capital and something we've been extremely focused on.
So it's great to see the progress that we made. So just like Yvonne mentioned during the opening remarks that does give us more flexibility. As I think about our capital return framework, nothing has changed there. So -- as we look at share repurchase, for example, we look at dilution first and then we think about opportunistic buys. And I think this just gives us more flexibility as we're working through that. We don't provide guidance on that, but obviously something that we're looking at.",184

I imagine that was better than expected. Can you maybe just walk us through what you're seeing in the storage market? Where do you think we are in this cycle? Maybe said differently, how much of the performance in 2Q was Dell specific versus the market?

If you -- I mean, our performance was primarily driven by our strength in HCI, most notably, our PowerFlex, which is our proprietary software-defined storage solution and its growth. We're seeing great momentum there. Its ability to independently scale compute and storage for high-performance applications. We're seeing that technology being embraced in the marketplace. And it clearly has grown. I think I made a remark that it's grown now I think it's 8 consecutive quarters, and it grew triple digits, more than doubled in the quarter. So that certainly was a highlight of the portfolio in storage. 
PowerStore, our mid-range offering now has grown 12 consecutive quarters in a row. It is the mainstay of our mid-range offer, so that continues to be a strength in the business, particularly given the largest multinational customers in the world are very guarded in their buying, being able to sell to large corporates, large midsized -- medium-sized businesses, certainly is the home of where our midrange product is. 
I mentioned earlier in one of the questions that our high-end storage is going through that down cycle where we saw the mainframe refresh we saw buildup through the COVID time are now in the digestion of that capacity that was brought online. That's the backdrop of our storage business. I'm very optimistic. We're working to get tighter correlation that the AI compute side should be driving the unstructured storage side and the object storage side, our ECS business. When you think about the large amounts of data this is going through.
And I think we'll really see this as enterprises deploy AI more broadly that the unstructured data in its various forms all-in structured will be looking for highly scalable solutions, and we have the most highly scalable, high-performance unstructured systems in the market with our PowerScale and ECS object storage. So I'm optimistic. I would tell you there's not a tight correlation to the moment. Most of it is compute with software-defined storage inside that compute. I hope that helped.",338

Maybe just go back to the AI server opportunity. I was hoping you folks could talk about who are the customers that are buying this from Dell? Are they traditional  enterprises? Are they hyperscale customers? And I guess Jeff, maybe just help us understand what is Dell's value proposition when it comes to GPU-enabled service? Because I think the concern might just be that what's the durability of these revenues, if they're coming from customers that typically use ODMs and they can't get GPU allocations. Can you maybe just talk about the value prop that is providing who the base is? And is this accretive or dilutive do you think then to your ISG margins?",123

So let me work my way through that. I mean, clearly, we believe today. And my words, hopefully, at the opening resonated that this is a big incremental opportunity and that these new workloads demand a new type of architecture and new type of technology. We believe we've hit the sweet spot with that with our XE9680, for example. But there are 3 other AI servers in our portfolio as well. If you think about the 9680, why is it an interesting product. I mean, clearly, we worked closely with NVIDIA over 3 years.
Tuning its performance. We believe it's the highest performance, most dense AI server you can buy today. You can give it as a [ 6U] product. We think about it as power efficiency, what we've been able to do around air cooling at ambient temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, what we've done with iDRAC, what we've done around the connectivity side with 10 PCIe ports for it to work on high-performance clusters.
So we've built something purposely for AI. If you think about the types of services that we announced that Dell Technology World and subsequently, a broader range of services with Helix, the ability to help enterprises deploy this, help them understand where their data is, how to get their data prepared, how to implement the infrastructure with ease and how to begin to train models, tune models and then ultimately be able to run inference at the edge or in their data center. That package of services and capabilities we're just in the beginning of. 
The types of customers we're selling today is a wide range. There is a density of that today with some of the new AI as a service companies. We're seeing enterprises, as I mentioned, early buy in small volumes so they can do proof of concept, so they can begin to understand, test, do that sort of work. 
But if you look at the long-term attributes of this opportunity, we think it's AI in a lot of places at the edge. at the data center and cloud. It's going to track the data. In my mind and architecturally when we look at this in every way that we've looked at it, AI is going to follow the data. It's highly unlikely you're going to have a smart factory or a smart hospital or a set of robots that are going to continuously look to be trained or run inference a long way away. Latency will matter. We think security will matter. We think performance will matter, and we ultimately think cost will matter. 
And when you put that equation together, we think it's going to be a hybrid world. There will be some AI done in the cloud -- will be done, some AI done on-prem. We think it's going to be very, very heterogeneous in the way that this will be done with classic compute as well as accelerated compute. In a nutshell, that's what we think of the opportunity. I certainly could go into more detail, but I think I hit a series of questions, at least on the surface.",532

Our view of the market hasn't materially changed from our last call. I hear -- maybe that's on our end, a scratch. I'll try to talk over that. 
We see the market at roughly 250 million units, which would roughly have it down 15% over last year, 2 consecutive years down, we see it slowing in the second half against easier compares. That's reflected in what Yvonne just gave us guidance for both Q3 and tied into the year. So we see PC rates have declined slowing and to the point where we head into next year, and we're optimistic that there is growth in the PC next year. 
Low single digits. We can debate that number. If you told us, we'd give you, say, probably in the 3% to 4% range is what we think today the opportunity to grow next year. What's really interesting through this phase is the types of PCs we're selling tend to be at a higher ASP. If you look at our ASP against the balance of the industry, we're roughly 2x. Why is that? One, driven by commercial mix; two, the attach -- the attach of our peripherals, our software and services, it generally drives a 2x ASP to the industry. Also driven by the types of products we've build are focused to the profit pools that we build to commercial PCs. 
Again, premium consumer and gaming that recipe has served as well. That's not where all the units have been in the first half of the year. There have been a lot of units, which is why, quite frankly, we've struggled with a bit of share challenge this year as many of the units have been in emerging markets, have been in a low price band consumer and Chrome, which we're not particularly strong in. We focused into the profit pools where we are very strong and a market leader. We think about next year and as we end this year with a new version of Windows with CoPilot, all of us building AI-enabled PCs. We think AI at the edge on the PC is a great, I call it the killer app. I think that killer app is going to drive a productivity increase. And any time we've seen new applications that drive productivity at the edge on the PC, we've seen the market rebound. 
And if you're going to ask your PC to do more, it generally means it needs a bigger CPU, a little more memory, a little bit more storage, a better display, et cetera, et cetera, which is another proxy for driving ASPs. That was a mouthful. I think I covered it all. We're going to weather the storm this year. The market is down. That's not going to change. It's rate of decline slows in the second half. ASPs are holding the opportunities in the profit pools, which we continue to focus on, and we're optimistic about a modest growth in calendar '24.",498

And clearly, you're very excited about how AI and some of Dell's core offerings are helping shape the market as well. So if you could just talk about when you think about your growth, your market opportunity, how we should think about that in the face of AI? Is that something that we should expect to maybe edge higher just given the growing amount of workload, the higher ASPs on the computer side as well -- and is that something that we should expect for calendar '24 to see an acceleration in growth relative to your long-term market growth forecast, especially coming off a down year in calendar '23.",132

So if you think about our leadership position across PC storage, compute side, you think about our large go-to-market presence, you think about our, I think, scale and advantage in the supply chain are very scaled service organization. How do you take those 4 attributes and apply it to new growth opportunities? We've clearly picked and talked about them in the past as telco, which is off to a good start. 
Edge, we just -- we've been engaged through partners in the marketplace, but the native Edge product that I announced on stage at DTW ships here very shortly next week. We think about the opportunity in multicloud as we build out the multicloud platforms that I talked about on stage. They get delivered later this year. They're on schedule. And then there's the fourth tailwind that we've talked about a bit already today, which is AI. 
And again, to be clear, we think it is an incremental opportunity. Is it wholly 100% a new category, not cannibalizing some of the data center, I don't know. I don't think that's worth debating. I know the workloads are different. I know the architecture and the types of products that we have to build to serve that demand and need are different. I think that is pretty exciting. Our model plays quite well there. 
Given the backlog and allocation of parts, we will be carrying AI backlog into next year, it's just -- we won't get enough parts to clear the backlog even the 39 lead time of today. And I think it continues to build momentum because the early adopters tend to be concentrated in this AI as a service and the hyperscalers. And we've now talked about and firmly believe it's going to be deployed on-prem and at the edge. 
We've said this before. We think there's going to be AI factories everywhere, little ones and big ones and little ones on the edge and medium-sized ones in data centers and large ones at cloud scale. That paints a picture of a pretty significant opportunity for us, and we have to continue to build our portfolio of services, which I think is key with the hardware. So our hardware aligned with certification of the application, the open source community that's out there today, making sure they run great on our portfolio of XE servers and then ultimately build servers both embedded services and professional services around the platforms themselves.",427

And maybe in a logical order. When we think about this, our improvement in the P&L in Q2 was driven by the sequential growth in both storage and in servers. And because we had a favorable cost environment, we saw margin expansion in both servers and storage, which was good. You saw that in our performance. When I think about the role of AI servers, AI servers from an ASP point of view are significantly greater than a data center or a general-purpose computer, if you will. They're dilutive on a margin percentage. They are accretive on a margin dollar basis. That's how Yvonne and I look at the business.
That's the backdrop of how we look at AI servers in our portfolio, continuing to drive gross margin dollars, making sure that it's accretive from that point of view. Given that this is the early innings, we have our selling services around these. Much of the service is deferred on our balance sheet when we sell service around these. That's an opportunity to collect that when we can build more services around the deployment of these things like Project Helix that we've talked about being able to help our customers across the entire ecosystem that provides more opportunity for us to grow our part of the AI hardware and service market, which I believe I quoted in our remarks that we think it's going to grow 19% over the next handful of years to $90 billion.",263

And I'm just wondering how to think about the effects on both your revenue and margin in storage?",79

As Yvonne mentioned in a couple of her remarks as well as to the questions thus far, we had a deflationary cost environment in Q2. Our view is that we'll be deflationary in the second half, although the rate of deflation is slowing. And that clearly benefited our businesses from PCs to servers, to storage. The actual material content in storage as a percentage of the sales price is actually smallest of all of our businesses. The spread is the value we believe we bring by our differentiated assets, our capabilities and features, mostly in the software. Typically, when cost increase, we are able to pass that through in time. It isn't 1 for 1 or on the nanosecond, the cost increase that we can change the price, given quotes and what's in the system, but we are generally efficient at passing through cost increases over time, and we'll do that here. 
The signal is -- or given our purchasing capability and the scale of it. We tend to see that first. We tend to try to move first, and we have to be sensitive of how we price not getting ahead of the competitive environment of raising price, we become uncompetitive but able to do that in a prudent way where we're passing along our incremental cost as we see them in our business. That's how we've always done this. There won't be any difference in this cycle. You are correct. I anticipate a cost increase cycle in the future. I'm not good enough to tell you what day that's going to occur. I can tell you our reach and understanding into the supply base is really good, and those signals will be measured -- or pushed all the way through into our prices, and we will understand that.

When we think about pricing in Q2 in the second half, in many ways, it's business as usual. When you see a slowing market and you see excess inventory, you tend to see pockets of aggressiveness to move inventory to try to generate demand. We don't think the market is very elastic. As a result, we're very disciplined. And we are very disciplined in the profit pools. There were -- as I mentioned, and I think the previous question several back, there were units in the marketplace to go get, which tend to be in less profitable pools near 0. 
And that's just not attractive for us. We're very disciplined in that regard. When you look at big deals, as Yvonne and I have said several times now, given the conservative nature or cautious nature, probably more accurately stated of enterprise-class customers and not as many large deals, they tend to be pockets of aggressiveness. But the market is generally stable outside of the areas that I just described. We see that in Q2. 
As we go into the second half of the year, we'll see consumer -- it's consumer promotion time. We think consumer promos will be aggressive in the second half of the year, getting inventories back to historical levels, moving some of the old product that we know that's in inventory out there today, which isn't our issue. We're not exposed with any inventory because we run a very lean inventory model. We think those big deals will continue to be aggressive when they come about. They always have been. 
So there's really nothing new there, just it's business as usual. Or if you prefer a similar pattern that we've seen before, we'll just be disciplined. There are places where it makes sense for us to acquire new customers. There's places where in a customer that we want to expand our portfolio. We call it cross-selling. We'll be very judicious and very disciplined in acquiring new customers and making sure that we can address as much of a customer's state with our portfolio as we possibly can. Yvonne?",366

We delivered Q3 revenue of $22.3 billion with solid profitability and strong cash flow. Operating income was $2 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.88, and cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion. 
In ISG, the demand environment for traditional servers improved over the course of the quarter, and demand for AI servers continues to be strong across a wider range of customers. Demand for storage was down as expected. ISG revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter with sequential growth in servers and networking revenue driven by AI-optimized servers as we begin to convert more PowerEdge XE9680 backlog into revenue. 
For the quarter, we shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers, including our XE9680, XE9640, XE8640 and the R750 and R760xa servers. Customer demand for these AI servers nearly doubled sequentially, and demand remains well ahead of supply.
In CSG, the demand momentum we saw in June and July continued into August but slowed as the quarter progressed. The result was CSG revenue was down sequentially and short of our expectations. Operationally, we executed well, remaining disciplined on pricing in an increasingly competitive environment. And we controlled our expenses, focusing on profit and cash flow, including outstanding working capital performance. 
And lastly, we've returned another $1 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. Yvonne will go into more details on cash flow and capital returns later. 
AI continues to dominate the technology in business conversation. Customers across the globe are turning their operations upside down to see how they can use Generative AI to advance their businesses in meaningful ways. These AI initiatives are being driven at the CEO and Board levels. And as a result, we are at the front of a significant TAM expansion. 
AI-optimized server mix increased to 33% of total server orders revenue in Q3, driven by strong demand from AI-focused cloud service providers and growing interest from other customer verticals. We drove improved demand margins, increased services attached and incremental unstructured storage attached over the course of the quarter. The XE9680 is the fastest-ramping solution in Dell history. And in Q3, we continue to see strong demand and big wins, including customers like CoreWeave, a cloud provider that specializes in GPU accelerated workloads; and Imbue, which is using high-performance computing clusters powered by the XE9680 servers to train foundational models. 
Our AI-optimized server backlog nearly doubled versus the end of Q2, with a multibillion-dollar sales pipeline, including increasing interest across all regions. That all said, AI hype is everywhere, and we need to be measured in our expectations. We are still in the early innings with AI as customers continue to work through their AI strategies. Experience over multiple technology cycles tells us that progress won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. 
We believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers size, characterize and build GenAI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Our AI strategy, AI in our products, AI built on our solutions, AI for our business and AI for our ecosystem partners, is the foundation for our actions, priorities, road maps and partnerships. And in Q3, we continue to build our capabilities. 
We are collaborating with Meta to make it easy for our customers to deploy Meta's Llama 2 models on premises, with Dell AI-optimized portfolio. We are also collaborating with Hugging Face to help users create and fine-tune and implement their own open-source GenAI models on Dell infrastructure. And earlier this month, we introduced the ObjectScale XF960, an all-flash scale-out appliance for GenAI and real-time analytics based on our software-defined object storage solution, which can run on Linux and Red Hat OpenShift on PowerEdge servers. 
Looking forward, the recovering ramp in PC demand we were expecting in Q3 has pushed out with large enterprises and corporate customers remaining cautious with their spending. The PC install base continues to age, and there are exciting changes coming to the PC next year, including advances in AI-enabled architectures from Intel, AMD and Windows on ARM, which will help drive a PC refresh cycle. We are also seeing the beginning of a traditional server rebound, and historically, storage follows a couple of quarters later.
We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turn new opportunities, including multi-cloud, edge and AI, into incremental growth. And we are positive on FY '25 and fully expect to return to growth next year given the expected tailwinds to our various businesses, including AI. 
Technology is everywhere, and Dell is ready. The amount and value of data continues to grow, and as that happens, the opportunity for Dell Technology grows in tandem. We have proven that over 4 decades through wave after wave of innovation. And we have proven our ability to capture the growth as our TAM expands and translate that into results for our stakeholders. Regardless of the economic cycle, expect us to focus on growing and extending our core businesses in the areas with the most attractive profits, deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined in our pricing and focus on costs. 
Now over to Yvonne for the detailed Q3 financials.",860
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188217.0,Presenter Speech,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. 
We're focused on driving a balance of growth, profitability and cash flow in any demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 10%, with strong gross margins, lower operating expense and improved working capital management. Gross margin was $5.3 billion and 23.7% of revenue, flat year-over-year. 
We continue to see increased pricing pressure in Q3 but remain focused on profitable opportunities. And you should expect us to continue to maintain discipline and focus going forward. 
Operating expense was $3.3 billion or 14.9% of revenue, down 5%, driven by lower SG&A costs, and down 7% sequentially as we actively manage our spend. Operating income was $2 billion, down 17%, and 8.8% of revenue, with the impact of a decline in revenue, partially offset by lower operating expense. Our tax rate was 19.2% year-to-date or 15.4% for the quarter. 
Net income was $1.4 billion, down 19%, and diluted EPS was $1.88, down 18%. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 4%. And our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $39 billion, flat year-over-year, with growth in deferred revenue, offset by a decrease in backlog. 
Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements and VMware resell. ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 12% and flat sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.7 billion, up 9% sequentially. We saw server ASPs continue to expand in both AI-optimized and traditional servers, and our AI mix of server demand accelerated again sequentially given customer interest in GenAI. 
We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, down 13%, with demand growth in data protection and PowerScale. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 170 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross margin rate. 
Looking forward, our many #1 positions are proof of our deep enterprise expertise. And with a TAM of $200 billion growing at a 7% CAGR over the next few years, we are confident in our ability to grow the business as the market returns to growth. 
Our fiscal Q3 CSG revenue was $12.3 billion, down 11%, primarily driven by a decline in units, while ASPs remained flat. Commercial and consumer revenue were $9.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. CSG profitability remained strong in Q3, with operating income up $0.9 billion or 7.5% of revenue. 
Op inc was down 20 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, offset by lower operating expense, and an increase in gross margin rate as we maintained pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs. With a TAM of $400 billion growing at a 2% CAGR, we will continue to focus on commercial, the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing. 
During the quarter, we saw continued strength in APEX and our data center utility and Flex on Demand offerings and added new multi-cloud offerings, including APEX Cloud Platform for Azure and Red Hat OpenShift. 
Our Q3 Dell Financial Services originations were $1.8 billion. DFS ending managed assets reached $13.9 billion, up 1%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remained strong, with credit losses near historically low levels. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvement and profitability. Working capital benefited from an approximately $200 million sequential decline in inventory, strong collections performance and continued improvement in receivables aging. Our cash conversion cycle improved again sequentially and is now at negative 52 days, a 20-day improvement since the end of last year. 
We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion in cash and investments, flat sequentially, driven by free cash flow generation, offset by $1 billion in capital returns. Core leverage was 1.6x exiting Q3, flat sequentially. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $66.55 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend. 
Turning to guidance. Enterprise and large corporate customers continue to be cautious in the current macro environment. Against that backdrop, we expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $21.5 billion and $22.5 billion, with a midpoint of $22 billion. Sequentially, we expect ISG revenue to be up mid-single digits, driven by sequential growth in traditional servers and seasonal growth in storage. 
We expect CSG revenue to be down low-single digits sequentially. We're seeing pockets of stability in PC demand but have yet to see a broader recovery in the PC market. And in our other business segment, we expect to be down in the low 20s sequentially. 
Operating income rate should be down marginally versus Q3, driven by a more competitive pricing environment in CSG. And for our tax rate, you should assume roughly 20% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q4 or 19.5% at the midpoint for the full year. We expect our Q4 diluted share count to be between 729 million and 733 million shares, and our diluted EPS should be $1.70, plus or minus $0.10. We're increasing our expectations for the full year diluted earnings per share to $6.63, plus or minus $0.10. 
Turning to FY '25. It's still early in our planning process. However, I recognize you're thinking about next year. So let me share our current thinking. We're seeing signs of stability and inflection in parts of the portfolio, including traditional and AI-optimized servers. We expect revenue to return to growth next year, above our long-term financial framework. The opportunity is the broader IT spending recovery, with large corporate and enterprise customers, particularly in the U.S. 
We'll continue to focus on profitable growth, but we'll be mindful of the competitive environment and inflationary input costs as we move through the next year. Pricing discipline and cost controls will help mitigate these headwinds. Count on us to continue to execute our unique operational model focused on cash flow and returning capital to shareholders. And we look forward to updating our FY '25 expectations in more detail on our Q4 earnings call. 
In closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term, with technology trends like AI, multi-cloud and edge in our favor. At the end of the day, our strategy is simple: Leverage our unique operating advantages to extend our #1 leadership position and capture new growth. This strategy, coupled with our P&L leverage and strong cash generation, drives a resilient long-term financial framework and capital allocation plan. 
We have proven our ability to generate strong cash flow through profitability and working capital efficiency, including $9.9 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months. And at our Analyst Meeting last month, we committed to increasing capital returns to our shareholders. 
Expect us to continue to invest in innovation, be disciplined in how we manage the business and focus on what we can control, delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We are excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.

I think you essentially said your orders doubled, so does that imply something north of $4 billion right now? And then how do you think that manifests itself into revenues into fiscal '25? And maybe you can touch about how broad this customer base is becoming versus perhaps hyperscaler. That would be really helpful.",69

Let me pull that apart, Amit. So I mentioned our demand nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And what was, I thought, very interesting about that is every part of the AI-optimized portfolio grew quarter-over-quarter, and we saw significant growth for enterprise customers. So I think that's important to note, is we saw the entire portfolio grow. We saw the number of customers grow, and we saw the number of enterprise customers grow quarter-over-quarter. 
When I think about the $2 billion that you mentioned, that was a backlog comment that we made in August. And what we talked in August was a $2 billion of backlog. And that included, up until that point in time, the August, first month of the quarter, because that was a real-time update of our backlog, $2 billion. We shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers during the quarter. So when we think about demand nearly doubling, and I mentioned backlog doubled, we'd like you to part with $1.6 billion of AI-optimized servers backlog at the fiscal exit of Q3. 
Equally important, we saw the pipeline in the quarter triple. I'll say that again. The pipeline for AI-optimized servers tripled quarter-over-quarter during Q3. Lead times remain 39 weeks. Demand is ahead of supply. We continue to work to improve supply. And we're working now to convert that pipeline into real sales, into orders, so we can continue to ship and benefit from this exciting time. 
As far as next year, Yvonne, I'm sure, will talk about this in greater detail. But we're still in the planning process. We think it's a tailwind. We talked about it at each of our last financial engagements. It's a large market opportunity, 18% CAGR over the next 4 years, growing to $120-ish billion. There's nothing that suggests that's not the case. And it's not coming at the cost of our traditional servers.",311

Given some of the puts and takes that you called out, both on revenues and margins, just wondering when you say it's going to be higher than your long-term range, is the comment pertinent to overall Dell Tech? Or is it also a comment that we can attribute both to CSG and ISG? Frankly, we're coming off cyclical bottoms, in so many of your businesses, it feels as though you should be able to materially outgrow. So any kind of maybe characterization of that would be helpful. 
And also on the cost side, Yvonne, I think you noted pricing discipline, cost controls but also some headwinds. So just thinking through that, would you say that there is also upside from a margin perspective or EPS growth rate perspective?",136
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188225.0,Answer,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Wamsi. I'd tell you, we're certainly at the early stages of the planning process. We usually wrap that process in the January time frame. But I recognize everyone's interested in next year. So I wanted to give you a little bit more context there.
We expect to return to growth, as I mentioned on the call already, above our long-term financial framework. And so we're seeing an inflection point in traditional servers in addition to those AI-optimized momentum that we've been talking about. And we expect servers and networking holistically to be a bigger portion of our ISG mix in the next year. 
If I move to PCs, our growth expectations will be dependent on the timing of the PC refresh cycle. We are also expecting a decline, and mentioned it for Q4 also, in VMware reseller revenue with no impact to profitability. We're expecting a more competitive environment overall. We started to see that in the third quarter. So we'll expect that to continue, especially in the PC market into the next year. 
Other things to consider, input costs are expected to be inflationary next year, led by NAND and DRAM. And of course, as we always do, we'll continue to be mindful of our cost structure. But regardless of the environment that we're operating in, right, we will continue to execute our proven operational model. You can continue to count on us to be financially disciplined, all while driving growth, profitability and cash flow. We're really optimistic about FY '25 and really excited about returning to growth, and look forward to giving you all even more context and update in our Q4 earnings call in February.",279

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188228.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,14,"Your tone on the call around the demand environment sounds very, very different than it was 90 days ago, where you talked about growth accelerating and a rebound in spending better than you had thought. And it sounds like the complete opposite this quarter. You were wildly above normal seasonality in Q2, you were below normal seasonality in Q3, and you're guiding below normal seasonality again for Q4. 
Did you just misgauge demand in Q2? Like was there a pull in from Q3 to Q2, and you just misgauged the characterization of demand 90 days ago? Or like what really happened and changed?
And if I could, I just want to clarify the AI situation. So it would be helpful if you could just give an update right now in your backlog relative to 90 days ago, which was $2 billion. And if I think about what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline, it sounds very credible that backlog could be like $5 billion exiting this year. If it's a 9-month lead time, shouldn't we expect like $5 billion to $7 billion in AI server delivery? And if you're saying servers are -- demand is improving for traditional servers, why shouldn't we expect a gargantuan number for servers next year?",211

Let me work my way through those. So what happened? You recall in Q2, we talked about the improved demand in June and July for PCs. And that certainly helped us close the quarter, and we benefited from that. And when we were together in August, we had seen that continue in August. In fact, through the month of August, the first month of the quarter, our PC business was up year-over-year. And then things changed. The business started to slow. It slowed in September. It slowed more in October. 
We saw more cautiousness from our customers. We saw them being more selective, particularly large commercial customers, enterprise customers and particularly in North America. We saw the public sector slowdown, while at the same time, we actually saw stabilization in [ SP ]. But the big change was the number of large deals slowed over the course of the quarter as our customers again became more cautious and selective. 
And as the market slowed, which you've probably seen in some of the output numbers from the OEMs, we saw increased pricing pressure. So the pricing pressure changed in PCs from August to October. Those large deals became more competitive. I think you also saw inventory that was shipped in the June and July period. Now it was caught up, and you saw promotional pricing throughout the quarter. And it was more aggressive as we exited the quarter and we ended the quarter. 
So that did change the PCs. We did not see or call the slowdown in our guidance. The guidance that Yvonne and I gave a quarter ago was what we saw through August, and we were optimistic that we were seeing a recovery. It's clearly pushed. Things have slowed, while at the same time, we now have 2 consecutive quarters of quarter-over-quarter growth of our traditional or data center servers, and we have the tailwind of AI continuing to grow. 
As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline of AI tripled in the quarter. Demand doubled -- nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. So those are the tailwinds of the change that we see in the business. The biggest change was PCs because storage performed as expected. 
Backlog, the number I'm going to give you is the Q3 exit backlog was $1.6 billion. Orders nearly doubled. Pipeline tripled. Our job is to convert that. We're working with our field, our customers to convert that pipeline. That grew significantly. The interest in our AI products continues to be strong. On-premise deployment at AI -- or interest continues to be strong. 
The fact that we now have been working with Meta and Llama 2, bringing that on-prem, Hugging Face in an open-source environment to bring those models and tools on-prem, I think, continue to reiterate AI is going to follow the data. The data is on-prem, and we believe the pipeline and opportunity continues to build for us.",489

Jeff, I just want to kind of dig into some of your comments about spending on AI-optimized infrastructure and the impact that might have on traditional hardware spending because obviously, there's a lot of money, as you're very clearly showing us, being thrown at AI-related infrastructure. 
So can you just maybe give us a bit more detail on what gives you confidence that this spending won't cannibalize traditional either general compute spend or overall hardware spending as we look out over the next 12-plus months? What are the signposts that you're looking at that give you that confidence?",99

Let me try. So we believe what we've seen for 2 consecutive quarters in our traditional server business is growth. That's grown sequentially from 1 to 2, now 2 to 3. What we saw for the first time this year was the pipeline actually grow in quarter for traditional servers. That's a very encouraging sign.
We saw the adoption of our brand-new 16G server double quarter-over-quarter. We saw the activity with our sales force and our accounts increased. We saw the opportunities in large deals increased towards the end of the quarter. Our conversion improved over the course of the quarter. And I think those signals tell us that this 8-quarter digestion of what was built or bought, I should say, through the course of COVID has now worked its way through the system that data centers need to be updated, upgraded additional capacity. 
Those workloads continue -- need to be fed. More data is being created, while at the same time, there's a whole new category of computing, accelerated computing, AI-optimized computing fed by all of the market momentum around generative AI that says that there's a big opportunity in both that we think early signs -- I'm not going to -- I won't use that word that you probably want me to use, there's recovery, but we have early positive signs that there's a changing in the demand profile of traditional servers. And we're seeing a lot of excitement across our broad portfolio of AI-optimized servers that have us feeling pretty good, as Yvonne just mentioned, about next year.",264

I wanted to ask about PCs with regard to your comments around 2025. What is -- are you expecting that growth to be above model? And what do you think the impact will be of the Windows 10 expiration and some of the new chips coming out that harness AI? If you don't mind touching on that, that would be great.",63

Let me take a run at it, Ben. It probably is important to set context as we're heading into calendar '24, our fiscal '25, in PCs. We expect the market to close in Q4 being down. It will be 8 quarters of negative growth in the PC industry, the longest I can recollect. And it's ripe for a refresh. 
Another data point for you to think about, there'll be 300 million PCs turning 4 years old next year. That's typically a tipping point for upgrading in commercial. And most of those are notebooks. As everybody was working remote, the notebook mix went up, 300 million PCs that year. They're aging in time to refresh. 
And we have the opportunity with new architectures from Intel, AMD and Windows on ARM to really begin to see AI make its way out to the edge and to PC. And it's a pretty exciting time. I've used the moniker, the notion of this is the next great application, the next great use case of the greatest productivity device on the planet, and it's coming real next year. 
So I think 8 quarters of decline, an aging installed base and installed base of greater than 1.5 billion units, 750 million of them over 4 years, all 300 million more coming next year. That will age, become 4 years old, the time to upgrade. None of those are capable of running the new AI workloads coming out to the edge and the PC, new architectures coming that are exciting and interesting. And we have what you said around Windows. There's another forcing function of an upgrade. 
So historically, when a new version of Windows is available or one is retired, that drives a replacement cycle, and that's an opportunity for us. So we're excited about that, particularly given our bias towards commercial. 80% of our revenue comes from the commercial PCs. I think the opportunity is good for us. 
And then the other question was around the silicon alternatives. Was that it, if I remember correctly?",341

Just on the AI opportunity that you talked about in the enterprise, maybe if you could share with us the workloads and the use cases that you're now seeing. Is this gone beyond the cloud service providers that you talked about that you're interacting with? I think you mentioned CoreWeave and Imbue on the call. But if I recall, there was some commentary as well on enterprises. So are you seeing an opportunity for your CI pipeline growing with the enterprise use cases? If you can share any anecdotes on that.
And then on share buybacks, obviously, you kicked that up this quarter. Should we expect this level of share buybacks to continue into fiscal '25? Or given improving cash conversion cycles, improving top line, we should see a further step-up in that run rate?",142
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188244.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,30,"Sure. I'll lead with the AI question. A couple of maybe specific data points to help understand and characterize what we're seeing. Number of buyers up. Number of enterprise buyers up significantly. All of the portfolio saw quarter-over-quarter growth. And the reason that's important, because not everybody needs a 9680. Smaller models, smaller data sets, perfect setup for our other products, which line itself up with where we're seeing the opportunities in enterprise.
So institutions of higher education, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing is where we're seeing pull for our products. That's data on-prem. That's models. That's doing AI and ML work across the board. That's what we're seeing, and we're pretty excited about that. And the tripling of the pipeline included enterprise customers and enterprise demand.",131

Look, I think as you mentioned, look, we tripled share repurchase this quarter versus last quarter. As a reminder, last year, cash was really kind of running more on the weaker side, and we had pulled back and focused more on dilution management. And then as we've seen cash accelerate this year, it's put us in a good position so that we could be a little bit more opportunistic. 
We don't typically guide around share repurchase, but I guess the way I would frame it is we're obviously very focused on the 80% plus capital return. If you go back to when we first started our dividend, which would have been FY '23, the beginning of FY '23, we're running at 96% return of capital. So I feel really good about that. And I do think recognizing we don't guide, I think it's fair to say, as we look forward, we'll definitely be repurchasing more than just dilution management.",166

First, on the AI margin profile, you obviously had very strong ISG margins in the quarter despite rising contributions from AI server mix. So could you just talk a little bit about how much of a headwind to that ISG margin rate came from the rising mix of AI servers, if that's the right way to think about it? 
And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk about the relationship between AI servers and networking and storage for you guys. Should we expect some of that AI sales pipeline that you talked about to eventually include selling Ethernet for AI or InfiniBand or more storage in the near term?",120
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188249.0,Answer,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,35,"So let me start with the impact of margin rates. We did see a little bit of dilution, if you will, from the impact of the shipment, as we called out, but really not a material impact right now. We saw nice performance really across the server -- holistic server portfolio. And so that increase that Jeff already talked about in the traditional servers was helpful in that mix. 
So it does have an impact, but we've talked about it being margin dollar accretive but margin rate dilutive. And so we saw a little bit of that but not to a significant extent in our third quarter. But expect as that grows, we will see more of an impact. Again, margin dollar accretive. And so -- and as we have more services attached, as we expand that into the enterprise space, we'll see more and more margin accretion coming from those AI offerings.",153

The team did a great job improving margins of our AI-optimized servers quarter-over-quarter, selling the value, the design, the performance attributes, its thermal attributes, its connectivity attributes. And then attaching storage and services around it allowed us to see improved margins quarter-over-quarter.
And Mike, to your question, is there a relationship between storage and networking with AI, absolutely. These are typically cluster -- small clusters, large clusters, high bandwidth needed. We see it ultimately deployed out where the data is being created. Much of the data that will be created in the future is outside of the data center. Much of that data is unstructured. Much of that opportunity is really a nice -- a really nice tie to what we do with our own structured and object assets. And then networking is the high-speed interconnect, the fabric. They matter. They matter more. Whether it's InfiniBand or ultra Ethernet, those are all exciting new technologies for us.",165

I wanted to see if you could unpack what you see going on trend-wise in storage, particularly given that -- I know you said it came in as expected, but the revenue was a bit light versus Street expectations, and it looks like it's still down year-over-year in the next quarter.
And where my question is going is to think about the longer-term trend because I'm wondering, is AI pulling money away from storage? And do you see essentially margins trending better or worse given shifts in input costs and the better margins that some of your peers have called out recently? Just wondering how you're seeing that trend as well.",112
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188253.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,39,"Sure. Maybe a couple of data points, and Yvonne can chime in as well. From us, when you think about margins, since that was the last comment, we saw our storage margins improve quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year on a demand basis. That's exciting. We continue to sell the value of our products and the broad portfolio we have.
We do see customers cautious. A large concentration of the storage businesses is in very large customers, and they're absolutely being cautious and selective. And that clearly impacts our high-end product portfolio. But what was exciting during the quarter is we saw our data protection and our unstructured categories actually growing on orders basis year-over-year. 
So when I think about the opportunities around protecting valuable data, when I think about the opportunities of what data is going to be created, again, unstructured largely outside of the data center at the edge, I think it's a great opportunity for us to continue to protect these valuable workloads and the opportunity for us to be where the data is created out at the edge with our vast array of unstructured assets. 
So I don't think AI pulls away storage dollars. I think what we see is the effect of 8 quarters of server decline has impacted storage. Customers are cautious. Historically, as the server business rebounds and recovers, we think our experience tells us that storage lags it by about a couple of quarters. That's what we're expecting. We see nothing that suggests that's different. And in the meantime, the opportunity around unstructured is immense, and we'll continue to focus on that.",267

The margin accretion that you referred to on storage is real, and it's great because it's going to be recognized over time in the P&L, right, with the high services and software attached.

I have a question on AI as well. It's great to see very good momentum in that business. Are there any concerns that some of these orders could be like just double booking just because supply is tight everywhere that, that could ease over the course of next year? I assume you have great visibility into the backlog, the $1.6 billion you talk about in terms of timing. 
But how about the multibillion dollar pipeline? How comfortable are you with that? And also, what I would ask about is that can you clarify what products and maybe services are included in that order number? Is that just AI-optimized service like the XE9680? Or do you include like CPU-only service in there? Any professional services or even APEX as a service in there?",133
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 30, 2023",2023-11-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3588.0,3055066.0,111188258.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,44,"The last one first. When we talk about our AI backlog and demand, it's not high-performance computing. It's not CPU-based. It's simply the portfolio that is optimized for artificial intelligence, the 9680, the 9640, the 8640, the 760 and the 750. That's it. So it's clear it is that portfolio that we built to be optimized for AI. 
The double booking. It's a very unusual way that the marketplace is working with the role that NVIDIA plays and helping the -- obviously, the supplier or the -- they're out helping generate demand. I think there's reasonable fidelity in the demand signal that we see today. Is it possible there's double booking? I can't sit here and tell you that there's not. I don't -- from my seat, I don't see it. 
When we see the opportunity of we are competing with others for the same opportunity, the opportunity is qualified. It's got to be qualified for NVIDIA to give the supply or to suggest the supply will be available. So I think there's a lot of control points in place that suggests there's great fidelity in the demand signal that we're seeing. But I can't sit here and tell you with 100% certainty that there isn't 1 or 2, but I think it's a really good demand signal. And given where our team is and what we see across the globe in enterprise with CSPs, we know where the opportunities are. I hope that helps, Sidney.",246

I'm kind of curious. You spoke about AI PC. What is your definition of an AI PC? And also, how much do you expect the ASP uplift to be for an AI PC? And how much incremental growth could it drive from the current 250 million unit run that you're going through?",58

Not a cloud service. The capability of running an AI workload in an app that has been AI-optimized and to be able to run it locally. The architectures that are coming all meet that criteria. There's variations in performance, but they're all meeting the threshold that we believe is required to call them PCs that they'll be AI enabled and AI PCs, if that's a name. And I think we're quite comfortable with that definition. 
Whether it drives tremendous growth to the TAM is to be seen. What I believe is you don't want to be a PC user that doesn't have an AI-enabled chip in it. You're going to be next to people that have one, and yours doesn't, and it will perform differently. It won't be able to take advantage of some of the new exciting workloads, whether that's new forms of search, new forms of security, new forms of interacting with your PC itself, the ability to put some form of assistant around you. 
Those are going to be huge productivity uplifts, and I think it's going to drive a refresh cycle. And again, the scale of this business is so large with 1.5 billion-plus units in the installed base, 950 million units sold over the last 3 years. This is a catalyst to increase the -- or reduce the refresh cycle or increase the refresh rate, whatever you prefer. 
And I think that's an exciting time. But I can't call what that number is. Our estimate for the marketplace is low single-digit growth. I think I mentioned 3% to 4%. That would take the market from roughly 250 to 260 next year. Let's get there. Let's get it growing again after 8 quarters of decline.",313

We've offered our services. We'll help where we can. I'm hopeful for the day to tell you that supply has improved greatly, lead times have reduced, and we can work the backlog down faster. That's our job. I don't have those answers today. It's 39 weeks. We're trying to continue to get more supply. That's where we are. 
As we look forward into calendar year '24, there's clearly alternatives coming. There's work to be done in those alternatives. Software stacks have to be taken care of, resolved, the opportunities around them. But there's more options coming. Their adoption rate, we'll see. But right now, that multibillion-dollar pipeline that I referenced, the backlog that we've talked about is NVIDIA-based 39-week lead time. We're working our behinds off every day to get more supply.",204

Just curious, with lead times holding where they are, how should we think about the trajectory of sort of what we expect for shipments in the coming quarter? Is it fairly stable in that sort of $0.5 billion range? Or should we expect some level of sort of ramp up if -- with supply easing? 
And then just a quick clarification, Jeff. You've mentioned a few times now the improvement you're seeing in traditional servers. Even as you sort of called out that customers are pulling back spending in most recent months, you've seen some signs of that. Just curious, what's the driver there? Like why -- what's your insight in terms of as customers are pulling back? Why is there sort of this green shoot in traditional servers that runs a bit counter to that overall theme?",156

Our shipments are -- for AI are implied in the guidance that Yvonne gave. I really don't want to break it down into a specific of how many that will ship of AI servers. But 39-week lead time, 9 months. Can kind of look at the math and go, maybe that's probably the right sort of ZIP code to be in. But we're hand in mouth for the parts.
Traditional servers and why we think there's a green shoot. I think it's the comments around -- it's been an 8-quarter digestion period, the longest that I can recollect in the server business. Data centers have aged product in. They worked through what they have bought in the early -- the first half of the COVID era. They now need to add capacity, and we're seeing that in different areas. 
And to the point now, again, to be slightly repetitive, 2 quarters in a row of sequential growth, a building pipeline, which hasn't happened this year. Improved -- increased activity, improved conversion makes us feel comfortable that something's changed. Again, I'm not using that word recovery, but something's changed. It's an inflection point that Yvonne mentioned earlier, and we're going to continue to obviously feed that inflection and continue to look at the opportunity.",230

I might have missed it earlier, but I just wanted to get a sense for how that would sort of impact the rest of the ISG business. 
And then just quickly on CSG. Can you kind of share with us your thoughts, maybe, Yvonne, on sort of the margin impact from higher component costs, whether it's DRAM, NAND or however you're thinking about it?",110

So the ability for us in our  networking business will benefit from an uplift or an increase in supply. And I think that's encouraging. And as I talked about, storage attach is important. We are certainly working with our sales teams, working with -- to find the opportunities as this data is being created in increasingly greater rates outside of the data center to make sure that we're there and it's landing on Dell storage, and as it lands on Dell storage, making sure that as AI follows the data, that our AI-optimized portfolio is next to it. 
I mean that's the sales motion, a set of professional services around that, a set of services that attach around that. So think of every opportunity of a model training, fine-tuning ultimately, as we get to inference is an opportunity for compute assets, which drags a set of storage assets around that, and it's got to be connected. We kind of look at that as the AI estate, if you will, and that's the opportunity. It's real, and our teams are focused on it.",203

And so when we have component cost increases, we try to recover them as quickly as we can by raising prices and passing those through into the market. So you'll see us continue with that. It's certainly not the first time that we've had this happen. And so it's an engine that's well tuned within Dell. But we'll have to navigate through that with the competitive environment, and we will. But it usually takes a period of time to recapture that impact of the [ question ].",111
