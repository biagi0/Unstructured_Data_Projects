Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first call of calendar 2021. 2020 was a year that none of us anticipated and none of us want to repeat. But it also brought out the best of humanity and reinforced the criticality of technology to solving the problems of today and tomorrow. 
At Dell Technologies, we are grateful and honored to have a central role in helping our customers, from consumers to the largest enterprises, keep our society, our economy and our lives moving forward. 
Finally, I could not be prouder of how our teams responded in Q4 and throughout this challenging year, delivering for customers worldwide the real business outcomes they need. As a result, our customer relationships and conversations have deepened. And no customer is asking how they can unwind their investments in digital transformations. It's all about moving their businesses forward and investing in their future. 
For example, gaining insights from data, customers like the University of Pisa in Italy, turned to PowerStore, PowerScale and PowerMax for core storage infrastructure to enable remote learning and accelerate their hybrid cloud and AI projects. 
Swisscom AG is using our as-a-Service and flexible consumption storage solutions for affordable, on-demand access to extra capacity when they need it. 
And Dell Technologies is in the middle of the edge and telecom transformation, most recently with Tech Mahindra and AlefEdge in Brazil to offer edge computing as a service to local telecommunication service providers. 
These customer examples illustrate not just the market tailwinds that will benefit Dell Technologies, a future that is highly digital and highly distributed, but why we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the trends. Our unique direct sales engine touches more customers than anybody in technology, giving us insights as we build solutions and allowing us to meet customers where they are in their digital transformation. 
Our breadth from edge to core to cloud makes us relevant no matter the customer challenge, and our unmatched global services allow us to simplify IT complexity for our customers. Behind all of this, of course, our award-winning product teams, a global supply chain with unmatched scale and reach and financing capabilities that make us trusted IT -- makes us trusted advisers, excuse me, to IT decision-makers of companies of all sizes. Dell Technologies has never been stronger or more relevant. 
Turning to the financial results. We delivered a record $26.1 billion of revenue in Q4 with sequential revenue growth of 11%, driven by strong results in our CSG and VMware businesses as well as our improvement in the ISG business. Tom will cover Q4 in more detail later in the call. 
For the full year, revenue was a record $94.4 billion, up 2%. Operating income was up 6% to $10.8 billion. And adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 billion, up 8%. Earnings per share for the full year was $8, up 9%. 
Throughout FY '21, we leveraged the depth and breadth of our portfolio to lean into the pockets of growth when and where they occurred. We executed with discipline, speed and precision. And in what was an extremely dynamic environment, we delivered record results. 
Our Client Solutions Group had an outstanding year, delivering record shipments, revenue and operating income. Revenue for the full year was $48.4 billion, up 5%. And operating income was up 7% to $3.4 billion. And for the calendar year 2020, according to IDC, we shipped 50.3 million units, up 8% and the most ever in a year. Our commercial PC results were even stronger with commercial unit growth of 11%. Dell gained the most commercial unit share of the top 3 vendors with share gain concentrated in notebooks. 
Resilient demand was driven by the fast-growing technology-enabled world where consumers can do anything from anywhere. Instead of going to work, school, entertainment, a restaurant or shopping, it all comes to us. The PC is the hub of this new economic model. 
Our consumer business delivered record revenue of $13 billion for the year, up 12%. Customers have shifted to e-commerce, and our strategy shift earlier this year to advantage our direct and online selling paid off. Our consumer business was up 51% on a revenue basis based on orders, and our consumer online business was up 64% for the year on orders revenue. 
Commercial revenue was up 3% to 34 -- or $35.4 billion, also a record. Orders for our commercial notebooks were up 46% on a unit basis and 28% on an orders revenue basis, while orders revenue for Commercial Chromebook was up triple digits. 
ISG Solutions Group revenue was $32.6 billion, down 4%. We saw demand in the second half of the year improve with our best results in Q4, as spend increased in the infrastructure needed to power the do-from-anywhere world. 
Servers and networking revenue for the year was $16.5 billion, down 4%, but with growth in the fourth quarter. Server demand improved in Q4, and PowerEdge orders were up mid-single digits. 
Our storage revenue was $16.1 billion, down 4%, but we did see demand growth in key areas. PowerMax, hyper-converged infrastructure and PowerProtect Data Domain all saw solid growth during the year on an orders basis. 
Our midrange storage business returned to growth in the fourth quarter, driven by accelerated adoption of a PowerStore. PowerStore orders grew 4x compared to the third quarter orders as customers embrace the next-generation of modern data center technology and applications. 
In a challenging environment, PowerStore is ramping faster than XtremIO and VxRail, making it the fastest new architecture we have released. Additionally, approximately 20% of our PowerStore customers are new to our storage business as we tripled the number of wins against key competitors quarter-over-quarter. 
Our VMware business also had a strong year with revenue of $11.9 billion, up 9%. Our partnership and co-innovation engine with VMware has never been stronger. In Q4, we announced a collaboration with SK Telecom and VMware to deliver 5G-enabled edge computing solutions to help enterprises quickly act on data where it resides. Throughout a year of unprecedented disruption, we were able to pivot quickly, deliver profitable growth, disciplined share gains, consistent execution, innovation and strong financial returns. 
Now let's move from FY '21, and I'll share a little perspective of what we see ahead. We believe the demand environment will continue to improve. Estimates from both IDC and Gartner see IT spending growing mid-single digits in calendar year 2021, including growth in our core PC, server and storage markets. 
The do-from-anywhere world is here to stay. We believe the total addressable market is expanding as there are still millions of children around the world that need PCs. The number of PCs in the household continues to increase. And additionally, the refresh cycles are accelerating with the shift to notebooks. And we are on the cusp of widespread 5G connectivity driving real-time, automated and intelligent outcomes at the edge. This will drive an estimated $700 billion in cumulative spend on the edge -- on edge IT infrastructure and data centers within the next decade. 
There is a lot of opportunity ahead for Dell Technologies, and we are going after it with a balanced growth strategy. That begins with growing and modernizing our core businesses. The value creation potential in our client and our infrastructure business is enormous as we consolidate share in the markets that have steady GDP-like growth. 
We also know long-term success means doing more than just winning the consolidation. It requires us to keep modernizing the customer experience, which brings us to APEX, announced last October at Dell Technologies World. With APEX, we are extending our long history of offering IT as-a-Service to deliver IT resources on demand, Dell managed infrastructure, enabling our customers to pay for only what they use, built on a foundation of trusted technology all at scale. 
Starting in May, we will bring the first of the new APEX offers to market and add new offerings over the course of the year. This foundational work sets us up to respond to accelerating customer needs and capture market momentum, momentum towards a hybrid, distributed future fueled by data and analytics. We are integrating and innovating on VMware and across our leading capabilities and partner ecosystems to create the automated, integrated infrastructure for 5G and the data era that is AI and ML enabled with intrinsic security throughout. 
And that's how we win at the edge, the next technology frontier. By extending our cloud model and ecosystem to the edge, we can provide a consistent approach to infrastructure, data, applications and security across the entire environment. 
The competitive advantages I highlighted earlier, our end-to-end portfolio, our sales force and customer intimacy, our global services capability give us a distinctive position in the next evolution of our industry. 
Before I turn it over to Tom, let me leave you with a few thoughts. We are emerging in an advantaged position for the enormous opportunities ahead, technology delivered as-a-Service, 5G and edge computing. Technology is clearly front and center for the digital futures. And Dell Technologies is uniquely positioned to win in the data era that is already underway. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom for a closer look at the financials.",1534
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411038.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. Given what we were modeling for the demand environment early last year with the onset of the pandemic, I am pleased with the record results in revenue, operating income, earnings per share and cash generation, both for the full year and the fourth quarter. Flexibility of our business model and the adaptability of our team positioned us to successfully navigate the macro environment while enabling our customers' digital transformation. 
We ended the year with a strong Q4. Revenue was up 8% to $26.1 billion, driven primarily by the strong growth in our CSG and VMware businesses, with improvement in our ISG business. With a weaker U.S. dollar, FX was a tailwind in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. 
Gross margin was $8.6 billion, up 3% and 33% of revenue. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 170 basis points lower, driven by the overall mix shift to CSG given the strong client demand environment. 
Operating expense was $5.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year, but up 6% sequentially. In the quarter, we started to add back certain employee-related costs, like 401(k) match, merit, promotions and new hiring to support growth. 
Operating income was up 19% to $3.3 billion or 12.6% of revenue, driven primarily by our operating expense controls, revenue growth in CSG and improved consumer gross margins. 
Consolidated net income was $2.3 billion, up 36%, and earnings per share was $2.70 a share, up 35%. 
Our operational execution and the strong demand environment combined to deliver record P&L metrics and a record $5.9 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Total deferred revenue was $30.8 billion, up $3 billion. Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-Service models, is now approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 8% year-over-year. 
And as Jeff highlighted, our APEX offerings will broaden our as-a-Service solutions across our portfolio, giving customers more flexibility to scale their IT solutions to meet their business needs and budgets. 
Turning to the business units. Our Client Solutions Group delivered record results. The ongoing strong demand for remote work and learning solutions, along with gaming systems, drove CSG revenue up 17% to $13.8 billion as we delivered record shipments again in the quarter. 
Commercial revenue was up 16% to a record high $9.9 billion as we continue to see strong growth in Latitude and Precision notebooks and Commercial Chromebooks. Consumer revenue also reached a record at $3.8 billion, up 19%, driven by strength across all of our consumer notebooks and gaming systems. 
CSG operating income was up 67% to $1 billion and was 7.6% of revenue. We saw better-than-expected profitability due to our record shipments, favorable component costs, improved profitability in consumer and continued operating expense controls across the business. 
Our client solutions business had an extraordinary year in FY '21 as we moved quickly to take advantage of demand opportunities. This business consistently provides stable revenue and generate strong cash flow regardless of the demand cycles we see in the PC space. Now with the record year we just finished, CSG revenue has grown at a 7% CAGR over the last 5 fiscal years, while the CAGR for operating income has grown by 18%. 
ISG revenue was $8.8 billion, which was flat year-over-year, but up 10% sequentially. We were pleased to see improvement in this business as we ended the year, and we believe that there will be improved demand for infrastructure as we move through fiscal year '22. 
Storage revenue was $4.4 billion, down 2%. Midrange, PowerProtect Data Domain and VxRail were highlights as all 3 saw solid orders growth. As Jeff described, PowerStore is gaining momentum, and we are encouraged by the upward trajectory of the ramp as orders grew 4x quarter-over-quarter. 
Servers and networking returned to growth with revenue up 3% to $4.4 billion. We are pleased with mainstream orders growth, up 11% sequentially. And we saw improved demand from large enterprises and continued improvement from our small and medium customers. 
ISG operating income was a record at $1.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue, which was up 80 basis points as we benefited from lower operating expense in an improving demand environment. 
The VMware business unit also had a record quarter, delivering revenue of $3.3 billion, up 6%, and operating income of $1.1 billion or 32.2% of revenue. 
Based on VMware's standalone results, subscription as-a-Service revenue grew 27%. The business saw strong growth in the VMware Cloud Provider Program, End User Computing, Carbon Black and VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS once again had a great quarter with both workloads and revenue nearly doubling year-over-year. 
Looking at our Dell Technologies results from a geographic perspective. We saw an encouraging rebound in Q4 orders demand across many of our largest countries. In our top 3 markets, the United States was up 1%, China was up 12%, and U.K. was up 18%. 
Dell Financial Services fourth quarter originations were $2.4 billion and were $8.9 billion for the full year, up 5%. DFS ended the year with a record $13.1 billion in total managed assets, up $1.5 billion year-over-year, with global portfolio losses at historical lows. 
Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet. We had record cash flow from operations, both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our strong profitability and sequential growth, along with our working capital management, drove record Q4 cash flow from operations of $5.9 billion. For the full year, we generated $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion, up 46%. And for the year, adjusted free cash flow was $10.5 billion. 
Cash flow from operations for the past 3 years maintained an average of $9.2 billion, illustrating a strong, stable cash generation ability. 
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion and approximately $10.6 billion at core Dell. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 billion, up 19% at 14.6% of revenue. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 billion, up 8%. 
We delivered on our fiscal year '21 core debt pay-down target of $5.5 billion and are pleased with the progress we've made on delevering. Considering the uncertainty that arose in the early stages of the pandemic, this progress is extraordinary, and I'm proud of the team for our strong liquidity position as we exited the year. The strong debt pay-down, along with lower interest rates, drove interest expense down approximately $300 million year-over-year. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid down approximately $2.4 billion of core debt. Since the quarter ended, we have notified our bondholders of our intent to repay $1 billion in legacy and high-yield notes that are coming due later in the year. With this anticipated pay-down, we only have approximately $500 million of remaining scheduled maturities for fiscal year '22. 
Our total debt principal balance as of fiscal year-end now stands at $48.5 billion, and that includes DFS-related debt of $10.3 billion and subsidiary debt of $4.8 billion. 
Our core debt ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, and our core leverage ratio is now approximately 2.5x, which is well within our target core leverage range of 2 to 3x. Given our continued strong cash generation and debt pay-down, S&P and Fitch both raised their credit outlooks for Dell Technologies and VMware from negative to stable while maintaining their current credit ratings. 
We will continue to prioritize debt pay-down as part of our capital allocation strategy, and we are confident in our path toward an investment-grade rating. 
Now to our outlook for fiscal year '22 and Q1. For fiscal year '22, while the exact timing is fluid, we expect the global economy to improve as we move through the year. This should benefit ISG and VMware as the year progresses, particularly as our customers return to the office. We expect CSG strength to continue through the first half with tougher compares in the second half. Factoring in VMware's standalone guidance, the divestiture of RSA and the ongoing risks associated with the macro environment, we currently expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
We expect to see costs come back into the P&L, though not fully back to prepandemic OpEx levels. We have reinstated a number of employee-related benefits, most notably merit, promotions and 401(k) match, and VMware and Dell core businesses are investing for long-term growth. 
These expense additions and their full year impact, combined with VMware guidance for operating income of 28% for their standalone P&L, should be factored into your operating income models. Also, remember Dell Technologies' VMware business unit results include additional OpEx that we recognize related to the combined solutions selling expenses. 
Below the operating income line, we will benefit from the lower interest expense and a stable tax rate of 18%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Please also factor in a higher weighted average share count, driven by the absence of a share repurchase program in FY '21 and currently planned for FY '22. 
In addition, we expect to pay down at least $5 billion in debt this year, including the $1 billion I referenced a moment ago. 
For Q1, there are a few items we would like you to consider: First, you should factor in VMware standalone revenue guidance, which is in line with normal seasonality. We also expect typical revenue seasonality for ISG. 
For CSG, we had an exceptional fourth quarter, and we expect continued solid industry demand in Q1, with industry demand potentially outpacing supply. As a result, we currently expect strong revenue growth in the mid-teens year-over-year. Given our exceptional results in Q4 and Q1 last year, we would be happy with that result. This nets out to Q1 revenue -- Q1 year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range. 
Below the revenue line, the same perspectives I shared for the full year will also impact your Q1 modeling. Factoring this in, we expect operating income dollars to be down slightly year-over-year. 
In closing, we have a strong operating heritage focused on execution in our core businesses and value creation over time. Our model delivers top line growth, solid profitability and generates strong cash flow through various economic cycles and environments. Over the last 4 years, our ISG and CSG combined revenue has grown at a 5% CAGR and contributed more than $310 billion in revenue with approximately $25 billion in operating income. In that same time period, our VMware business segment has delivered $41 billion in revenue and $12 billion in operating income. 
Last year was no exception to that strong execution and value creation focus. We outgrew our competitors, gaining share in commercial client and servers. We reenergized our midrange storage offering. We grew profitability faster than revenue and generated record cash flow. We delivered on our fiscal year '21 delevering goal and continue to focus our capital allocation policy on debt pay-down. And we've taken the appropriate corporate structure steps as evidenced by the ongoing simplification of operations, the divestiture of RSA and the exploration of a potential tax-free spin of Vmware. 
As we look forward, we will continue to focus on what we can control and be disciplined in balancing growth with profitability and investing in future growth vectors. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1876

As we look at your growth, commercial up 16%, I think your competitor tonight was down 6%. I'm just curious, how do you see, as we return back to normal, just the demand environment on commercial PCs? And what's your expectation of growth in that segment as we move through the course of 2021?",63
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411042.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,7,"Sure, Aaron, this is Jeff. If you think about where the strong points of growth have been in commercial this past year, we think there are sources of growth as we head into 2021, education being one of those, the public sector being one of those. There's modernization moving towards notebooks, the mobile form factor. We're seeing the mobile form factor now represent roughly 25% -- or, excuse me, 75% of the marketplace, desktops being 25% of the marketplace. That bodes well for [ public ] organizations that have been roughly 50-50, notebooks, desktops. So some catching up to do there. We think that continues to fuel growth as we head in to the 2021 calendar year, soon to be, or now our fiscal '22 for us. 
So I think those signs are good. I think we also have to realize that people are going to go back to work and go into an office, in many cases, they haven't been in for 5, 6, 7 quarters, depending on when that occurs. That will be the largest aging or the most significant aging of an installed base that certainly we've seen ever in our industry. 
I also think this -- it's an important consideration. This work-from-home and do-from-anywhere environment, we don't believe slows down postpandemic or post people going back to the office. So we're going to continue to see an environment where people will do more and more work, more and more of their activities away from the office, driving demand for PCs, which has become essential in this type of work environment, this type of consumer environment. I think I said on our last call, there's no question in our mind that the PC has become one of, if not the most, essential device in this work from anywhere, do-from-anywhere environment that we're in today. 
Long-winded way of saying, I think the market continues to look strong. If you saw the IDC data that came out yesterday, their strength of the demand environment continues to be strong in both the commercial and consumer marketplaces in calendar '21. I hope that helps.",353

I mean, normally in April, you'd be increasing working capital. I wonder if that's going to be the case this year. Just maybe talk us through kind of how sustainable some of that is.",71
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411045.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,10,"Yes, Rod, I'm happy to chat about it. First, let me just say, I think the company had an extraordinary Q4 from a cash flow perspective. And I think it shows the power of the model when you get sequential growth quarter-on-quarter in the business like we get. And Q4 is normally a strong cash flow quarter for us to begin with, Rod. 
So if you look at the demands or the dynamics within working capital, what you saw was despite the strong revenue growth, which drove a build in accounts receivable, our aging actually improved. I think we had good discipline around our inventory positions. And our payables positions were, I think, appropriate. 
As we think -- so there wasn't really anything unusual in the quarter from a working capital dynamic other than I think the team executed well in managing the balance sheet, and we benefited from the strong business environment and the revenue environment that we saw. 
I would -- so as we step from Q4 into Q1, I would remind everybody that Q1 is traditionally our weakest cash quarter. It's also generally our weakest quarter of the year from a business perspective. So we normally see a cash -- we normally burn some cash in Q1. And I think our expectation is, is that we'll do that again in the quarter, although probably not to the extent that we did it a year ago. 
So I mean I think we're being good -- I feel really good about our cash position, $10.6 billion at the core Dell level. I think the teams -- I think we're well positioned from a liquidity perspective. If you heard in my prepared remarks, we've already notified the bondholders of $1 billion pay-down from some of the maturity schedules that are due this year, which only leaves us $500 million of scheduled maturities for the year. 
So I think we're in good shape, Rod, and we'll continue to manage our way and be disciplined in the balance sheet. Tyler, would you add anything to that?",344

I don't expect there to be a material shift as we work through next year. 
So I guess the only other thing is, keep in mind also that Q1 a year ago, we did have some impacts from COVID to working capital, right? So obviously, we won't have those same impacts going into Q1 this year.",87

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411049.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,14,"Sure. I will tell you, it's one of the questions Tom and I often sit back and reflect on inside the company as we look at our FY '22 plan, just how the ISG market responds. You've seen the market forecast there shows growth to be in both the server and storage sectors. We spend a lot of time trying to figure out and model what that looks like in terms of when and at what rate it comes back. It's still a little foggy, if you will, to call because if you look at the IDC forecast for storage, as an example, in Q1, it's negative. That said, I think there's some encouraging signs in our business. 
If you recall in our Q3 comments, I think I made a comment that our server business accelerated throughout the quarter, and that momentum continued in Q4 to the point where our server business had, for the first time in 8 quarters, growth. That's encouraging. We saw in our server business, large bids respond back positively. Our small business and medium business sectors came back positively. So seeing growth in the server sector is, I think, very encouraging for us. 
We saw growth in the high-value workloads. We're actually very excited about the progress that we've made in high-value workloads, seeing that growth being in, let's say, significant double digits, if you will, and increasing our share position in the most valuable workloads in the data center. I'm encouraged by that, and it clearly looks like server momentum continues. 
Storage. Clearly, you've seen our results. We were down in the quarter, an improvement over Q3. We saw vast improvement in the midrange. The first time we've grown the midrange now in storage, I believe it's in 9 quarters. We grew midrange by 8% on the back of PowerStore. We had growth in both our PowerStore business, our HCI segment. We grew in our data -- our PowerProtect Data Domain segment. And we grew, which I think is equally important, in our all-flash array segment. So we had growth in those areas in our storage business. Obviously, still down, but I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in the midrange. 
I think I made reference in our talking points about PowerStore is now up 4x what it was in Q3 and Q4. 20% of the customers are new storage buyers. Our win rate against the competition is up or tripled or up 3x, if you will. And I think that bodes well, given the progress we've made over the last 3 years, in consolidating the high end of the storage marketplace, where we've aggregated our share position by over 1,300 basis points to over 50% of the market in the high end. Now with the momentum we have in the midrange, the opportunity is to grow the sub-$250,000 segment, the midrange, and that's what we eye. 
How to call that? Tom can weigh in here in a moment. We both spend a lot of time -- I don't know, which is probably -- you've seen some of the prudent outlook that we have for the year of when that comes back in our business.",531

Congratulations on the quarter. [indiscernible] if you could drill down a bit on the gross margin outlook into fiscal '22, specifically as related to component costs and any supply chain considerations there.",39
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411055.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,20,"Yes. Let me start, and then, Jeff, you should take the supply chain and component cost. So look, I think as we think about margin -- and I'm not going to go to gross margin. Let me just sort of think -- tell you about how we think about the bottom of the P&L, so to speak. 
Look, there'll be some mix dynamics as we work our way through the year in terms of the CSG, ISG businesses. We also -- let me remind you that we've also added -- we are adding OpEx back into the business this year as we think about the -- some of the employee benefits that we've reinstated, like 401(k) match and some of the merit cycle. VMware is also investing in their business. And so they've got a heavier -- a bit more OpEx into the business. 
So net-net, I would tell you that we do think there's a -- if we think about operating margin, we do think on a percentage basis, that it is -- it probably runs slightly lower than it did this year. And the absolute dollars are probably down slightly as well. So those are the things that we're working our way through. 
Now, look, I mean, I think the reality is, is that we'll have to work our way through the year in component costs, which Jeff can highlight. This is going to be a dynamic that we're going to have to work through as well.",249

Happy to weigh in on the supply chain and commodity cost dynamics. Clearly, in 2020, we ended the year as a deflationary year. Our view right now, as we look at 2021, Q1 is light deflationary. And then we believe, over the year, it becomes inflationary. What's driving that? We see, in Q1, SSDs continue to be coming down in costs, offset, if you will, by increased cost, what we see in LCDs and ICs that are driving some of the demand-supply shortages that we have in the marketplace today. 
If I was to call out one specific thing, which we're keeping our eye on, is freight costs. Freight costs continue to be a challenge for us. So that's not exactly a component or a commodity cost that's part of our supply chain transformation. And while rates have, I think, eased a little bit, the fact is the industry is using, and we are using, more air. We're expediting more, and the air network is tight. So we continue to watch the cost increase overall in that area as well as steering into an overall inflationary year in calendar '21. But to be specific, deflationary in calendar Q1 -- fiscal Q1, excuse me.",204

But I think at spot rates, currency will probably help almost 2 points. Maybe you can confirm that. And you also talked about IDC and Gartner end markets growing at 5%. So putting those all together would be that you're kind of assuming share loss in 2022, and I'm wondering if you can reconcile that. 
And maybe more specifically, I think there's always a lot of interest from investors about ISG. That's been the one business that has been up and down over the last 4 years. I think it's been down 3 the last 4. Do you believe that servers and networking and storage can grow at constant currency in fiscal '22? And is that sort of embedded in your guidance?",137

So look, I think as our -- our view right now is we think our way through fiscal '22.

So we'll take advantage of the growth opportunities that are there as they present themselves. 
I think from a revenue framework, I would have you think about -- our range of thinking right now is roughly in that 3% to 5% from a revenue growth range with what we know today. Obviously, we'll continue to watch this and take advantage of the opportunities and continue to provide you our perspective as we think our way -- as we go through the year.

I'm not sure, Simon. I know exactly what you're hearing, but I'll at least illustrate what we're working through. And clearly, we've been maneuvering across our supply base for now the better part of 2.5 years. There are shortages, most notably for the past couple of years with microprocessors. I think we made mention of it at the end of last quarter, the notion of that's now impacting things like LCDs. 
At the core of the issue is wafer capacity is taxed. There's been a number of substrate issues that have disrupted the supply. That has impacted particularly the 8-inch network. The 8-inch network makes a lot of the basic components that we all need in the industry from TCON, to driver ICs, to power ICs, to microcontrollers, card readers, codecs, you name it. Those are the types of issues we are working through as an industry. Certainly, Dell is working through that. 
I think we've shown the ability to be resilient and responsive. At this point of pride, we shipped the most PCs we've ever shipped in Q3. We followed that up in Q4 by shipping the most PCs we've ever shipped in Q4. We had the best quarter in terms of absolute shipments and calendar [indiscernible] more according to IDC. We just came off 50 million units of PC shipments in the calendar year. This is what we do for a living. This is -- there are challenges. I'm certainly not in denial about that. 
If you look at the forecast that came out from IDC last night, there's certainly a lot of demand. And we have challenges to make sure that we get the supply for our companies. Again, it's totally new. We think our total buy helps us here. We think our long-term relationship with our supply base helps us here. We think our direct model helps us here by shifting demand to the components that we do get. But if you are hearing that there are supply shortages, you are hearing correctly. I hope it's across the areas that I described. And that's what we see, and we're navigating real time today. I hope that helps, Simon.",363

And you highlighted some share gains a few quarters ago. How should we think of that momentum going into FY '22? And where is your storage market share today?",64

Let me see if I can work through that. So we've largely spent the last 3 years simplifying and consolidating the portfolio into the Power portfolio that you would know them as PowerMax, PowerStore, PowerVault, PowerScale as the primary storage of vehicles. That's gone from -- I think I've quoted in the past of 88 different platforms consolidating that to roughly 20 across our portfolio. We've seen tremendous progress in consolidation in the above $250,000 product space. Over the last 3 years, I think I mentioned we've taken 1,300 basis points of share, have over 50% of the most valuable storage market. 
The challenges that we had, which we've talked about at numerous of these calls, is midrange, which is the largest single portion of the marketplace. And PowerStore is the vehicle that we built, we launched in May and have been ramping through the year to begin to change our growth trajectory in that business. 
I'm pleased to say midrange grew 8% in fiscal Q4, again, the first time we've grown midrange in 9 quarters. It's all on the back of PowerStore. The product is being received well by our customers. Again, over Q3, we grew 4x. We tripled the amount of competitive takeouts. 20% of the customers are new to the -- or excuse me, we doubled the amount of new customers. 20% of the customers are new to our storage business just for PowerStore alone. It is clearly the vehicle that we intend to take share with in fiscal '22, calendar '21. 
I like the progress we've made, but we have work to do in front of us. Tom and I have talked about our, I guess, strategic impatience of we want more faster. We like how we've ended the year. We exit on a high note, and we have a big set of ambitions about taking share in the midrange and storage for PowerStore. Given the progress that we've made in unstructured, the progress we've made in the high end, this is the space for us to absolutely capture needed market share. We intend to do so. 
Your last question, what's our market share? If memory serves me right, it's right at 28% from the last reported quarter from IDC, which was Q3. I believe. If I'm off by a couple of tenths, I'm in the zip code.",395

So let me try and sort of give you some context around it. As -- obviously, fiscal year '21 had a number of twists and turns and with the pandemic and the extraordinary growth in the CSG business and the work from home environment, along with the sort of the supply-demand dynamic, pricing has -- in FY '21 was relatively stable, which helped us from a margin perspective. 
I think a couple of things to think about as we step into '22 and as it relates to sort of op margin, we do expect op margin to go down in '22 for a couple of reasons: One, think about the VMware stand-alone guidance, first and foremost, where their operating margin guidance is down; secondly, we have incremental OpEx going into the business, both from an employee benefit perspective as reinstates and benefits as well as some investments. So we do think from a operating margin percentage, that it will be less than FY '21. If you go back to an FY '20 context, for instance, I do expect that it will be lower than the FY '20 operating margin. So I do think you got to take that into account. But principally, you got to think about the VMware dynamic within our consolidation. 
So -- and from that perspective, I think that, that's something you should be thinking about. So I think overall, we'll work our way through the year and take advantage of the growth vectors that are there, but we'll have to work -- there will be some challenges as we work our way through the year, as usual.",274

Amit, look, I think we don't give a cash flow forecast per se. So I mean our cash flow generation will be, to some extent, dependent upon how the business performance drives, right? But look, I think we're optimistic about our cash flow and our -- the business overall as we work our way through the year and the cash flow generation as a result of that. 
Our capital allocation policy is going to remain fairly stable in the context of focused on delevering. We've been pretty consistent on that. And what we have talked about is the fact that as we get to and achieve investment grade, then that allows us to rethink or relook at the capital allocation policy and broaden it out as we've talked about before in terms of how much of our capital do we want to vote to, to debt repayment versus some type of a shareholder return program as well as continuing to invest in the business.

We'll generate good cash flow. 
And conversations with the rating agencies are all very positive. I mean I think quite frankly, my guess is, with all 3 of them, our performance for the quarter and for the year is better than what they had modeled. I think that we'll see what happens going forward for the year. We'll see what happens with VMware. Obviously, they're watching that closely, and that goes into their modeling and their expectations. 
But we've got a little bit of work to do. We're at 2.5 using our metrics, and I think we want to get closer to 2, right? We're -- I think we're probably over half a turn inside of where S&P wants to see us. There are 3 crossovers. So we're probably sub-2.5 now. We're 2.5 with our metrics. We'll get Fitch and Moody's there, and we'll get [indiscernible].",215

We haven't made significant change to our comp plans or channel strategy. We continue to refine them, focused on incentivizing the behaviors we want around driving our higher-value products and services and capabilities and making sure that our programs, both from a inside seller and Dell and team member compensation framework and our channel frameworks, are consistent. 
So not a lot of change, to be honest, right? We've adjusted certain payout structures based upon focus and emphasis, which you might imagine, we continue to be focused on the ISG portfolio to a heavy extent. We continue to be focused on the -- our solution capabilities with VMware, and we're incentivizing those appropriately.

I'd just like to ask 1 follow-up question on the storage business. You talked about how you've done a lot of consolidating of your products, and you feel like your portfolio is in really good shape. If we compare, though, your recent results to, say, NetApp and some of the other ones that just recently came out, though, your year-over-year sales decline is still lagging the others. So can you help me bridge the difference between your comments of the portfolio realignment and where you're positioning with the midrange? Or is it simply a lot of that positioning is yet to come in the future?",120
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3792.0,2224647.0,86411089.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,54,"Well, I think, Jim, part of the answer lies in do we have a very large, broad, diverse portfolio playing in all aspects of the storage marketplace. Not all of them grow at a similar rate. For example, I mentioned about the progress we've made in the high end. We've made tremendous progress in the high end. The high end of the marketplace, I think, will show that it slowed down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our exposure to that, as I mentioned, was half of the marketplace or half of the share is Dell share that has slowed down, that has an impact. Conversely, the area that is growing for us now is on the HCI side and the midrange side. We've had continued success with HCI, and that continues to this day and optimistic about that going forward. 
But we've talked on this call about the challenges that we've had in the midrange. One data point does not make a trend, but we're encouraged that we had exited Q4, the fiscal year, with positive momentum in our midrange business. We have a lot of work to do there. We're optimistic. We think our product continues to hunt in the marketplace. It's doing very well. And I point to the things that keep us -- get us encouraged. 
The number of competitive takeouts, I don't know what others had said, ours tripled quarter-over-quarter. The number of new customers on PowerStore doubled. 1 in 5 of the customers are new to the Dell storage business. It's 4x larger than it was the previous quarter. We clearly have momentum that we have to build, certainly, and great momentum we need to build from that into FY '22. We have large expectations in that area. That's going to be key to our absolute performance. We've made progress in unstructured. 
So when I look at that, I'm optimistic -- back to one of the earlier questions. I believe it was from Katy. We're looking for the market to continue to rebound or respond, and that's how we're looking at our share and our business performance over the year. 
Look, I'd ask you to go look at what product performance was in some of those results as well versus what our product performance was in the quarter and make those comparisons. That said, we're not satisfied with where we ended in Q4 and the year. It improved over Q3, and we have greater expectations in FY '22. 
And back to the point that was made in one of the earlier questions, we run these businesses to outperform the marketplaces. We expect to take commercial PC share. We expect to take server share. And we're going to run the business to take storage share in calendar '21, fiscal '22.",462

Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are coming off a strong first quarter and a successful Dell Technologies World, where we connected with more than 60,000 customers, partners and stakeholders. We made important announcements on APEX, our edge strategy, and social impact and sustainability commitments, and the response was fantastic. We are energized by the positive feedback on our strategy, innovation and opportunity. 
One of the real silver linings of last year is that digital transformation has been accelerated. Our world is running on data highways now, and we're experiencing everything technology makes possible, deeper, data-driven insights, connectivity and even a deeper human connection. Technology is no longer the IT department. It's the entire organization. It's how you enable everything to deliver better business outcomes. 
And customers are looking to Dell Technologies as their strategic partner to help run their business, deliver their outcomes, capture their opportunities in the data era. For example, a large Fortune 500 retailer made VxRail and VMware Cloud Foundation the hybrid cloud standard for workloads in their data centers. Another example is Honeywell, who is helping its customers transform day-to-day business operations through Software-as-a-Service solutions for the industrial sector. Built on Dell infrastructure, Honeywell Forge Connect is the edge interface for Honeywell Forge Enterprise Performance Management.  
Turning to the financial results. We started the year strong, delivering record revenue in Q1 of $24.5 billion, up 12%. These results are driven by the ""do anything from anywhere"" economy where technology enables connectivity and outcomes for all of us. Instead of going to work, school, entertainment or shopping, it all comes to us through our PCs. That need for connectivity was demonstrated in the record demand last year and has continued into this year. Our Client Solutions Group delivered record revenue for the first quarter of $13.3 billion, up 20%. 
In our Infrastructure Solutions Group, we are seeing improved demand as customers invest in the solutions they need to power our do-from-anywhere world. The improvement we saw at the end of last year continued into Q1, with revenue growing 5% to $7.9 billion. We saw growth in Q4 for servers and midrange storage, and the momentum continued into Q1 with PowerEdge orders up 7% and midrange storage orders up 23%. 
Our VMware business also had a strong quarter with revenue of $3 billion, up 9%. Our partnership continues to expand and our ongoing strategic relationship has been formalized with the commercial agreement announced last month. For example, we have a framework in place to identify new areas of first and best joint innovation. Our unique partnership will continue to deliver highly differentiated, integrated solutions that are multi-cloud and accelerate digital transformation. 
We are pleased with the quarter, and we are even more excited about the opportunities ahead and the long-term value proposition for Dell Technologies and our stakeholders. With a $4 trillion total IT market, we are only servicing a portion of that total surface area today. Our value creation framework is focused on 4 key areas that expand that surface area or serviceable market. We do that by focusing on our core markets, the broader ecosystem, new growth opportunities, and our corporate and capital structures. I'll cover the first 3 today, and then Tom will cover the fourth. 
Our strategy begins with growing and modernizing our core businesses. Our serviceable or addressable market is expanding. In 2019, the serviceable TAM for the broader client ecosystem was approximately $600 billion. And looking out to calendar year 2025, it jumps to a projected $750 billion. This expansion in TAM is driven by increased systems per household, faster refresh rates with higher notebook mix, and investments in a hybrid and remote workforce. Our investments are focused on making the PC more personal and intelligent. But it's just not about the PC. It's about providing technology to deliver an experience to customers that allows them to be connected, productive and effective no matter where they are, and that's increasingly about software. 
A few recent examples. We continue to innovate with our built-in AI software, Dell Optimizer, that learns, responds and improves the way you work. We recently updated Dell Hybrid Client that gives users access to their applications and data whether delivered from the public cloud, private cloud or on the device. And we introduced the new SafeShutter on selected devices, the industry's first automatic webcam that knows when to open or close by syncing to your video conferencing applications. It's all of these things combined, devices, software, services and peripherals and a higher profitability profile that have us excited about the future opportunity. 
The serviceable TAM for our infrastructure business is also growing, from approximately $150 billion in 2019 to a projected $200 billion by 2025. That means growth in areas like servers, storage and networking where we are strong, and growth in areas like hyperconverged infrastructure, where we are innovating for the future. 
Just a few weeks ago, we launched software updates to PowerStore, improving workload performance by up to 25%. By automating data processes, we are saving customers money while lowering latency by 15%. We also introduced the cost-effective, entry-level PowerStore 500 to the lineup. PowerStore now serves all midrange price bands. PowerStore is the industry's first modern, midrange storage architecture in a decade. It's a container-based, micro-service software, allows for rapid deployment of new capabilities with no disruption. It continues to ramp faster than any new architecture we've ever released and accelerates our opportunity in midrange storage. 
We recently launched a new line of AI-enabled PowerEdge servers that help customers meet the challenge of digital transformation with a secure infrastructure that supports modern workloads. 
We are leading with innovation and taking share where we are strong, but we also know long-term success means doing more than just winning in the consolidation. It also means delivering a leading customer experience, including modernized consumption. This is where APEX comes in, to deliver the scale of the cloud with the ease of as-a-Service. It's a critical component to how we modernize and grow our core businesses, grow private and hybrid cloud, and win the edge. 
Building on our long history of offering IT as-a-Service, earlier this month at Dell Technologies World, we launched the new APEX portfolio offerings, Data Storage Services, Cloud Services and Custom Solutions. APEX helps customers simplify digital transformation by increasing IT flexibility, agility and control via a cloud-based service model. We are seeing increased customer interest. Customers like GE are turning to Dell for an as-a-Service approach that assists the industrial giant in delivering solutions that make the world work more efficiently, reliably and safely; and Magellan Health, looking for better control of their infrastructure to help serve patients faster and more effectively. 
And we're building the technology ecosystem of the future. We are innovating and integrating with VMware and our partner ecosystems to create an automated, intelligent infrastructure for 5G and the data era. This includes our better-together solutions with VMware that customers have embraced, such as VxRail, VMware Cloud on Dell EMC, VeloCloud SD-WAN as well as security and end-user computing. With Dell Technologies and VMware, customers have consistent infrastructure and operations from the public cloud to the private cloud, colocations and the edge. 
It's estimated that 75% of data will be processed outside of a traditional data center or cloud by 2025, and that data will be generated in the real world at the edge. One of the ways we're helping customers make decisions at the edge in real time is with our Streaming Data Platform. This is an open platform that offers powerful real-time analytics at the edge with a smaller footprint. By putting compute, storage and analytics at the edge, where the data is created, we deliver insights in real time and create new opportunities for businesses. 
We also continue to support customer choice through an ecosystem of value-added partnerships like what we're doing with PTC ThingWorx for smart manufacturing at the edge and with Equinix for hybrid cloud and as-a-Service offerings. And next month, we'll announce an open network ecosystem that brings together infrastructure technology, partners and services to create a more agile and profitable ways for communication service providers to transform their operations and modernize to an open, cloud-native 5G networks. Together with VMware and our partner ecosystem, we are the hybrid and multi-cloud platform for the digital future. And we'll deliver it all through a consistent cloud model and as-a-Service with APEX. 
As we think about future areas of growth, we'll leverage our leading capabilities, our relationship with VMware and the broader partner ecosystem to capitalize on new large addressable markets and emerging technology spaces, multibillion-dollar markets today that are projected to grow exponentially by 2025. Here, we will pursue logical and closely adjacent opportunities where we have the unique opportunity to win, in areas such as hybrid cloud, edge, telco, as-a-Service and data management to drive high-value growth. 
We are confident in our ability to drive high-value growth for 2 reasons. One, our differentiated strategy: grow and modernize the core with software; leading with our unique VMware partnership, innovate, integrate and partner to build the technology ecosystem of the future; win the next technology frontier at the edge; deliver the scale of the cloud with ease of as-a-Service with APEX. And two, our competitive operational advantages: our direct sales force and customer intimacy, our global services capability, Dell Financial Services, and industry-leading scale and supply chain. 
Combined, we have a more focused business with the right formula to consistently deliver annual revenue growth in the GDP or better range over the long term with strong profitability and predictable cash flow. It's an incredible time to be in the business of delivering technology solutions that deliver experiences, insights and outcomes. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. 
Before I turn it over to Tom for a closer look at the financials, a quick comment on the global supply situation that extends well beyond IT hardware. As we have mentioned, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technology in every industry. And when coupled with an improving global economy with greater demand for everything, there is an overall shortage of semiconductors. We are executing our strategy as we work through this environment, just as you've seen us do before and which you've come to expect from us. 
Now over to Tom.",1727
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3578.0,2303200.0,88916585.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. I am pleased with our performance as we started the year strong with double-digit revenue growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and strong cash flow generation given the strength in the business. 
Revenue for Q1 was a first quarter record at $24.5 billion, up 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business units, especially CSG and an improving ISG business. Gross margin was $8 billion, up 9% and 32.7% of revenue. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 70 basis points lower, primarily driven by a 370 basis point revenue mix shift to CSG. 
Operating expense was $5.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. We are continuing to prudently manage our expenses. But as we talked about last quarter, some costs are coming back into the P&L. Operating income was also a first quarter record at $2.7 billion, up 26% and 11.1% of revenue. We saw improved profitability in all 3 segments, led by CSG. Given the progress we've made on paying down debt, our interest expense was down approximately $162 million, contributing to an even stronger growth of 59% in consolidated net income to $1.8 billion. Earnings per share was $2.13, up 59%.  
Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-Service models is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 12% year-over-year. And our remaining performance obligation is approximately $42 billion, up 15%, which includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. The growth was driven by a solid performance in hardware and software maintenance and custom as-a-Service solutions. Excluding VMware, Dell's remaining performance obligation is approximately $32 billion, up 18%. 
Turning to the business units. Our Client Solutions Group delivered another quarter of outstanding results despite industry-wide supply chain challenges. CSG revenue was up 20% to $13.3 billion, driven by ongoing high demand for remote work and learning solutions along with gaming systems. 
Commercial revenue was up 14% to $9.8 billion. We saw double-digit orders growth for Latitudes, Precision systems and Commercial Chromebooks. And we are starting to see improved demand for desktops as orders for our commercial desktops return to growth. 
Our consumer business delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, up 42% as demand remains strong from consumers looking for upgraded experiences in today's world of digital entertainment and e-commerce. On an orders basis, our XPS notebooks were up 21%; Alienware notebooks were up 76%; and our consumer online business was up 58%. And we are riding a wave of growing ASPs in the consumer business as more consumers are choosing high-end systems. 
CSG operating income was up 84% to a record of $1.1 billion and was 8.2% of revenue. We saw better-than-expected profitability primarily due to strong shipments, a stable pricing environment and some component cost deflation. 
We also had a strong quarter for client solutions software and peripherals and services. This highlights the points Jeff made earlier about the broader opportunity for our client business as we innovate across the ecosystem to deliver an enhanced experience for our customers looking to work and play effectively from anywhere. This total solution focus, along with our differentiated competitive advantages and strategy, have enabled us to deliver margin expansion over the last 5 fiscal years. Over that period, CSG revenue has grown at a 7% CAGR while operating income has grown by a CAGR of 18%. 
Moving to ISG. We are encouraged by the positive momentum we've seen in this business over the last 2 quarters. For Q1, revenue was up 5% to $7.9 billion, driven by an improving demand environment for compute and building momentum in storage. We believe demand will continue to improve as we move through the year as customers accelerate their IT investments with focus on hybrid cloud solutions. 
Servers and networking revenue was $4.1 billion, up 9%, as we saw increased demand for infrastructure compute across our customer base. 
Storage revenue was $3.8 billion, flat compared to last year. Highlights for the quarter were hyperconverged infrastructure and midrange, each up 23% based on orders, as VxRail and PowerStore continued to deliver strong growth. Storage buyers were up 12%, driven by PowerStore. 
ISG operating income came in at $788 million or 10% of revenue, which was up 30 basis points as we benefited from continued operating expense discipline and an improving demand environment. 
We have a significant presence with many of the leading cloud-based companies in the world. In fact, we provide infrastructure to nearly 80% of the largest cloud service providers in the world. And looking at our top 1,000 ISG customers, demand from SaaS companies, cloud-hosting companies, telco, consumer webtech and fintech companies was up double digits over the trailing 12-month period and currently accounts for nearly 30% of orders from that top 1,000 customer set. 
The VMware business unit also performed well, delivering revenue of $3 billion, up 9%, and operating income of $841 million or 28.1% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results, subscription and software as-a-Service revenue grew approximately 29%. The largest revenue contributions were from VMware Cloud Provider Program, modern applications, and end-user computing. 
Geographically, we have seen an encouraging rebound in demand across most of the countries and regions in which we operate. In our top markets, the United States was up 9%, China was up 36%, and Germany was up 19% based on orders. 
Dell Financial Services first quarter originations were $1.9 billion, up 5%, driven primarily by continued strength in our Americas business. DFS ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in total managed assets, up $1.4 billion year-over-year. We had a good quarter for our APEX Custom Solutions, Flex on Demand and Data Center Utility, where we saw bookings of $164 million. These offerings are key and will continue to contribute to our as-a-Service and growth in our remaining performance obligations. And as we talked about at Dell Tech World, APEX is the next evolution of what we've been building on for decades, aligning us even more closely with customer outcomes and results. The pace of adoption will be driven by customer acceptance, but we are seeing increased interest. We believe it will drive incremental revenue growth in the future. 
Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet. We had a strong quarter of cash flow generation and continued our focus on delevering. We generated positive cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion despite typically using cash in our first quarter due to P&L seasonality and bonus payouts. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was a record $14.4 billion. And excluding VMware, it was $10.1 billion. We have a history of generating strong cash flow with our core business averaging more than $6 billion of cash flow from operations annually over the last 2 years. 
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $15.9 billion and $10.1 billion for Dell, ex VMware. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion, up 24% at 13.2% of revenue. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.4 billion, up 13%. During the first quarter, we paid down approximately $1.5 billion of debt, paying off all of our fiscal year '22 maturities. Additionally, we paid $1 billion of the margin loan earlier this month for a total debt paydown of $2.5 billion year-to-date. 
Our debt balance now stands at $47.2 billion, and that includes DFS-related debt of $10.2 billion and subsidiary debt of $4.8 billion. Our core debt ended the quarter at $27.9 billion, and our core leverage ratio is now approximately 2.3x adjusted EBITDA. 
Given our strong Q1 cash flow performance, ending Q1 cash balances and the expected VMware dividend proceeds of approximately $9.3 billion to $9.7 billion, we are increasing our full year debt paydown target to be at least $16 billion for fiscal year '22. 
Our expectation is that once the spin of VMware is finalized, we will be upgraded to investment-grade by all 3 credit rating agencies. As a reminder, following the announcement of the VMware spin, the 3 rating agencies updated our outlooks to credit watch positive or put our credit rating under review for a potential upgrade to investment-grade ratings. After achieving an investment-grade corporate family rating, we will target a core leverage ratio of 1.5x adjusted EBITDA. Given our healthy balance sheet and strong free cash flow, along with the anticipated Boomi proceeds, there will be opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation policy, including shareholder capital return, investments to grow the business and value-enhancing M&A. We will have more to say on this topic as we get closer to the close of the VMware transaction. 
Now to our outlook. From a macro point of view, the pace of the global economic recovery is progressing with regional and country-specific puts and takes as COVID waves continue to impact many countries and the pace of global vaccine administration progress is uneven. Additionally, the pandemic drove acceleration of digital transformation across multiple industries, and supply has not kept up with demand for certain components. Geographically, North America, China and many countries in Europe are seeing stronger economic recovery and related IT spending. 
For revenue, it would be appropriate to flow our Q1 revenue upside through your full year models after considering the comments I just mentioned. It's clearly a fluid environment. For Q2, our normal sequential revenue increase is about 6%. We are seeing progress on the economic front. But given ongoing supply constraints particularly impacting CSG as well as VMware's stand-alone guidance, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below our normal sequential pattern over the past few years. 
For Q2 operating income, there's a few items I'd call out. As we talked about on prior calls, we had some costs coming back as we reinstated a number of employee-related benefits in Q1, most notably merit and promotions. I'd also remind you that the VMware and Dell core businesses are investing for long-term growth. We will see a mix shift within CSG in Q2, driven by normal seasonality of stronger education PCs and Chromebook sales. The component supply situation remains constrained, and we expect component cost to be inflationary in Q2. Factoring in these items, we expect operating income to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially on an absolute dollar basis. 
Below the operating income line, we will continue to benefit from lower interest expense. For non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 17.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. In addition, keep in mind the majority of the activity for the new $16-plus billion debt reduction target will take place in conjunction with the expected close of the VMware transaction in calendar Q4. 
In closing, we have a set of durable competitive advantages that we believe lead us to a differentiated growth strategy for GDP to GDP plus revenue growth, strong profitability and predictable cash flow. We are focused on maximizing long-term value creation for all aligned shareholders by continuing to profitably grow and modernize our core markets, adding value beyond hardware and transforming our business through APEX. We will leverage our market reach and philosophy of customer choice to bring a broad set of technology solutions to our customers through our first and best alliance with VMware and our broader partner ecosystem. We will pursue adjacent high-growth opportunities like hybrid cloud, telco, edge and data management through organic and potentially future inorganic investments. And we have been deliberate in our corporate and capital structure optimization with the announced VMware spin and Boomi transaction, along with the sale of RSA last year. We will continue to evaluate our structure and capital framework as we go forward. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1936

Are corporations ordering different things post-COVID than pre-COVID? And the component cost of memory, are you able to pass those through? Or is there like a 1-quarter lag?",61

So look, I mean, as it relates to component costs, I'd give you the following thoughts, right? So obviously, given the -- what the environment is with the pace of recovery, the supply situation has not kept up with the demand environment as we think about the need for semiconductors. And that's an industry-wide issue and clearly an issue that the technology industry is dealing with.
Look, we do expect and -- we do expect that component cost our inflationary in Q2 and probably are going to be inflationary in the second half as we think about it today. And that's principally coming out of displays, DRAMs and NAND. We're not seeing customers at this point in time adjust their configuration frameworks, if you will, in terms of the amount of memory or other types of how they're loading or configuring their systems. That has been a pattern we've seen in the past though with past memory cost or price increases in certain components. So it's clearly something we're watching.
I do think as it relates to pricing, it is our intent that we will price the input cost increases as appropriate, keeping a thoughtful eye on the market and keeping -- making sure we're in a competitive position. So that's sort of the state of play at this point.",221

How should we think about the balance of operating leverage that might kick in because of a recovery in ISG versus these inflationary costs? Is it correct to extrapolate what you're talking about in 2Q further out in the year?",85

I think about it like this. One, I'm really not going to get into the back half of the year other than let me give you a couple of thoughts around reiterating perhaps what I just mentioned. One, I do think as we think about component cost increases, we'll adjust our pricing as appropriate. We are going to have to work our way through the component supply dynamic situation, and that's going to be an area that we're going to have to actively manage as we go through the year.
So as I suggested in the -- in my comments, I would tell you to take the Q1 revenue framework and move -- to bring that forward through your sequential models with some thought around the comments I just gave you around Q2 sequentials. And then look, from my perspective, I don't want to get into the back half. So we'll update you on our Q3 thinking on our Q2 call. And then we have a scheduled -- or we're anticipating scheduling an analyst meeting in September, where we'll give you more thoughts on the back half of the year and the go forward.",202

It was a lot more positive in the April quarter versus at least what my model had, which is more neutral maybe. So maybe just talk about what drove that performance in the April quarter.

Look, I'll answer half of that question, and I'll ask Tyler Johnson to jump in as well, our Treasurer. So the performance in cash for Q1 was quite strong. And you're right, our seasonal pattern is typically a use of cash in Q1 given some of the dynamics of the business from a seasonality perspective and bonus payouts and things of that sort. Given the strength in the business though, quarter-on-quarter, we did see strong cash flow generation in the quarter. And I think coupled with working capital management, the discipline that we've shown over the last number of years around working capital, we -- I was very pleased with the cash performance. Tyler, what would you add, comments, thoughts about the environment from a cash perspective?",128

So there's a benefit there. And look, our collections teams did just an outstanding job. So that was great.
Just as a reminder, too, and as you compare it to a year ago, we did have a COVID impact last year. I think that was somewhere around $900 million. But look, as Tom said, it was a great cash flow quarter. We don't guide forward on cash flow. But as I think about the rest of the year, at least as I think about next quarter, Q2 and Q4 tends to be our stronger cash flow quarters. And I am expecting Q2 to be a good cash flow quarter.",131

Can you just update us on where your visibility and confidence in ISG revenue recovery is today versus 90 days ago? And if it recovers, as it's started to in the first quarter, does that give you a possible path to profit growth for the year if you execute through the supply dynamics you talked about?",83

I was pleased with the progress that we made in ISG in Q1, overall revenue of $7.9 billion, up 5%, operating income a little bit up against a year ago but headed in the right direction. We saw server velocity improving as the demand for compute accelerated, and servers and networking were up 9%. So pleased with that. IDC, as you would note, has a slightly positive sort of spin on server revenue growth for the year; saw improvement in storage with -- flat year-on-year, which is obvious from a revenue perspective but improvement from Q4; really pleased with the progress we're making in midrange. HCI continues to be strong. PowerStore receptivity is -- from a customer base perspective, has been good. And we're seeing net new buyers increasing in storage. So Q1 was positive.
As we look out to the rest of the year, again, while I don't want to forecast the rest of the year, we'll continue to see how the trends shape. We are reasonably optimistic that the IDC forecast for servers will -- and storage continues to -- will continue to be positive as it is in Q2, and we'll continue to see progress there. So I think as we get to the back half of the year and read it through Q2, we'll give you our perspective on the back half in terms of does ISG velocity continue. We do -- we -- at this point, we believe that it is a positive trend and that we expect it to improve as we go through the year, as we have said in the past; so overall, cautiously optimistic about the year for ISG.",280

So I think in your last fiscal year, you resold about $4 billion worth of VMware product. A small minority of that was along with Dell product. Most of it was just distributing VMware product to resellers. What is the financial arrangement when you resell VMware products? So on that $3.5 billion that's not affiliated with Dell product, do you receive a commission? And is there any sort of internal revenue transfer deduction? And then when Dell and VMware are separate, will Dell still be receiving commissions? Or what will be the financial arrangement and incentive for Dell to continue to act as VMware's largest distributor?",117

So those -- the revenue flowing through Dell is effectively eliminated as we consolidate VMware. I would harken the relationship on the $3.5 billion that you referenced to distributor arrangement, where it's a distributor-margin-type framework. And that's the intent as we move forward. Obviously, post spin, we're not eliminating the VMware revenue and related margin. But as highlighted in the commercial agreement framework, as we chatted about in April, we do expect that through our sales incentives and our selling organizations that we're incentivized to sell VMware. We still think about VMware as part of the -- from a first investor relationship given our tightly coupled solution capabilities that we have. So we're going to continue to move forward with VMware and push that as appropriate, but it's effectively a distributor arrangement.",153

Steven, it's -- what -- if we just think about storage, storage revenue for first quarter was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. What I highlighted though was as we look at some of the families within the storage framework, we were very pleased with midrange storage up 23%. We're pleased with our HCI performance. We saw slower growth but still growth in our unstructured and our Isilon PowerScale offerings. Power -- the high end, which is a smaller portion of the market, was soft for us. We've highlighted that in the past couple of quarters. But as you recall, if you think about where from a total TAM addressable market it is, the midrange storage is the biggest area of opportunity for us. And we're pleased with the dynamic and the velocity that we're seeing there. I highlighted the fact that storage net new buyers was up 12%. So pleased with that. Within PowerStore, 20% of the buyers are new storage buyers. And we've got about 25% more competitive displacements year-over-year with PowerStore. 
So we're pleased with the customer receptivity. We just recently announced a software upgrade in terms of -- which is our fourth software release for the family in the last year. And that's -- it's -- again, it's a micro-services and container-based architecture. So it's -- these are nondisruptive upgrades, but the 25% faster performance for mixed workloads, so more automation. So we're -- I think the pace of innovation within the PowerStore framework is continuing to move forward.
So having said that, look, we're cautiously optimistic about storage. So we've got -- we went from a negative growth in Q4 in storage revenue on a year-over-year basis. We now have flat. We need to get it to growth. And obviously, the point here is that it's got to continue to grow on a more consistent basis. But the overall economic environment and the buying environment and the IT forecasting would suggest that the storage market should continue to be positive for the year, and we'll -- it's our intention to take advantage of it. So cautiously optimistic but there's more work to do. We have more work to do on coverage models. We have more work to do to accelerate consistent performance across the entire portfolio. So those are areas of focus for us.",388

And you are right, it is very early in the journey with APEX. We just announced the first set of offerings at Dell Tech World a few weeks ago. But having said that, customer interest has been quite strong, and we're encouraged by that. But -- so -- but from a financial perspective, as it relates to the year, I mean it's clearly -- it's just not going to have a material impact on the year as we think about it this year just given the size of the company that we are. 
What we're going to watch and monitor is number of new customers coming into APEX to make sure that that's ramping as appropriate and within our plans. And then as it becomes more relevant to the financial situation, we'll begin to give you some framework to think about around that. But you are right, on a subscription and revenue -- with a subscription-based offering, clearly, revenue and cash flows are impacted as those -- as that business ramps. But I'm confident given our size, our scale, our ability and our strong balance sheet that we'll navigate through that as appropriate. But again, we'll give you more information on that as the ramp -- at the appropriate time as we see the ramp.",225

How are you thinking about the revenue growth for that business for the remainder of the year? And if you can comment on your expectations for commercial versus consumer separately, that would be great. And how do you discount the potential impact from component shortage, which seems to be impacting CSG more?",67
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3578.0,2303200.0,88916612.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,30,"Yes. Look, we're very pleased with the CSG performance, if I can get those words out. It's a pretty robust demand environment, and we saw that -- we saw strong demand in Q4. We saw it again in Q1, very -- overall revenue up 20% to $13.3 billion; 42% growth in consumer revenue, up to $3.5 billion; and $9.8 billion of commercial revenue, up 14% for Q1. So as we think about the future, there is no indication at this point in time that the demand environment remains strong. 
Now what we're carefully watching is as we get into Q2 and the remainder of the year is that, as you highlighted, there are component supply and component cost dynamics that we will have to manage and work our way through. I highlighted in my prepared remarks that component costs in Q2 are going to be inflationary. We will price that inflation -- that input cost to increase as appropriate, and we'll have to watch to make sure that the -- we'll watch to see of any impact on demand. 
And that's really the framework we're going to have to work our way through as we go through the year. If you look at IDC forecast, they are forecasting a very robust demand environment for calendar '21. I think something appropriately like 355 million, 357 million units, 18% growth, if I recall properly. And so we're optimistic about the business, but I do think that the supply dynamic in terms of availability is going to be -- have to be something we're going to have to navigate. And that's going to be with us. Our best point of view is that supply constraint continues on into next year. And our supply chain team is working that daily to ensure that we are managing that to the extent possible. 
But Sidney, we're very positive about CSG. [ The security ] is strong. The longer-term trends are also very strong in CSG, as we think about the TAM expansion, as Jeff highlighted in his comments, from $600 billion in calendar '19 to $750 billion in 2025. And that's all based upon what's happening with the PC in terms of the PC as an essential unit. The density of PCs within households is increasing. We've got -- we're seeing faster refresh cycles given the migration to notebooks from desktops. We -- and so there's just lots of positive indicators. And then the ecosystem around the PC itself in terms of software and support, the services element, we've got work we're doing on making the PC experience a much more seamless and holistic experience.
And so we're very optimistic about the opportunity over the next coming years in the PC space as we continue to think about how do we grow and modernize the core business and then how do we build out the ecosystem and take advantage through our direct selling and cross-sell motion around the PC unit itself. So -- but again, there's work to do in the short term as we work our way through some of the component supply dynamics.",519

If we look at this cash flow glide path and all the other pieces of cash coming to you guys in the deal and Boomi and so on, I mean that seems like a lot of cash that frees up for Dell Technologies shareholders to be distributed or maybe it's M&A. But I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on the timing on that. And then also, what are your priorities? Is it -- do you have any thoughts on -- is it dividend? Is it buyback? How do you prioritize the return of that cash?",115

Rod, you are right, if things play out as we presume they will, given the VMware spin and the business performance that we're seeing, we -- there is a substantial amount of cash coming to Dell Technologies. And we've highlighted that as -- vis-à-vis our adjusted upward target around debt repayment to $16 billion-plus of debt repayment. If those play out as we think about it and we're investment-grade post the anticipated VMware spin transaction, it does open up the opportunity to broaden out our capital allocation framework. And we've talked about this a bit, as you know. I think over the last 5 years, roughly about 90% to 95% of our free cash flow has been devoted to debt repayment. That pivots obviously given the situation or the opportunity we'll have later in the year. 
So we are going to broaden out our capital allocation strategy. Part of that will be a program around shareholder capital return. And that's a balance between -- as we think our way through dividend or share buyback or some combination thereof as well as investment in the business and potentially targeted inorganic M&A activity. I'd offer up that we will provide some more thoughts on this whole area as we get closer to the VMware spin transaction date and give you some frameworks to think about at that point in time.",229

Matt, so China is roughly, from a revenue basis, about 6%, 7% of consolidated revenue at this point. It's our second largest business unit. Having said that, it's -- from a percent of operating income generation, it's much less than that, okay? It tends to be a lower ASP business. And the mix dynamic over there is a bit more skewed towards the client. The sustainability of it -- look, I mean we've come through a couple of tough years with China in terms of having to reset that business and refocus the business from customer base -- refocusing on specific segments of customer base, principally focused on the smaller corporates, medium business, building out the direct selling motion, building out the medium business frameworks over there. Sustainability continues to be an area that we're thinking our way through. 
There's obviously geopolitical dynamics we -- that you have to work your way through. But the China market is a big market. We're -- we've been in China a long time. We're there to make sure that we can serve the China market appropriately. But we will continue to watch the cost structure over there and adjust appropriately given the business velocity that we're seeing but reasonably optimistic in the long term, but it's an area of continued focus as we -- to make sure that we set the business model over there appropriately.",234

And what I'm getting at is really trying to understand what kind of pressure you're experiencing from supply chain for Dell from things like expedite fees for components or increased prices. So just trying to get a better sense of how to quantify the gross margin headwind you would relate to your supply chain issues.,81

Simon, I'm not really going to parse that a lot for you. But I will tell you that, as I highlighted, that we are seeing component cost inflation in Q2 and remind you that Q1 was a component cost deflationary period for us. So we're moving from deflation to inflation. We have seen increased logistics costs just given the availability of containers. The overall transport costs are up. We have air transports up. Shipping containers are at a premium. So those have all been headwinds into the logistics cost. Now this is what we do every day. So we're managing our way through it. But to the extent that we're seeing increased costs there, we are passing those through as appropriate. And there is no signs that these are going to subside anytime soon. I'll say it like that just given the strong economic environment that we see from a demand perspective.",153

As we think about the ISG segment, a lot of the component costs or a lot of component constraints have been kind of centered, it seems like, on the PC segment. Have you seen constraints in your ability to meet demand in the ISG segment, particularly servers? And if so, how would you characterize kind of the lead times on products or for that matter, kind of backlog building if you are seeing constraints?",85

We really haven't seen significant supply constraint in the server space at this point. Obviously, some of the input costs are going up around DRAM and NAND. But in terms of our ability to meet demand, we've been able to navigate through that. And our lead times in servers are generally on standard lead times. So that environment -- the ISG environment to date has been reasonably unaffected by some of the supply chain constraints as we look at it today.",94

Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We made it through the first half of the year, and in this incredibly unpredictable environment, we delivered our best second quarter ever. That's because whether we are reopening or reclosing, eating in restaurants or ordering out, returning to the office or staying at home, the one constant has been an unprecedented demand for technology. Another constant is our ability to execute against our stated strategy and deliver consistent performance no matter the market dynamics.
In the last week of June, we released an investor presentation where we outlined our differentiated strategy to drive growth and value creation post the spin-off of VMware. As we've engaged with investors, there are a number of key points I want to reiterate today from that presentation. These can also be found on Slide 4 of today's earnings web deck.
First, we have leadership positions in large, stable and expanding markets with strong underlying fundamentals. Q2 was an exceptional example of how we've leveraged our leadership positions to seize the opportunities in these growing markets. In Q2, we set a second quarter record with revenue up 15% to $26.1 billion and record second quarter EPS of $2.24, up 17%. We have talked previously about our ability to quickly pivot the business where the demand is strongest, and that was evident in these results. The need for better technology connectivity and productivity in the new do-anything-from-anywhere economy has driven strong IT spending across multiple industries and customer sizes, from large enterprises to medium businesses to small business and consumers. And we're leaning in to capture our share of the strong IT spending.
Our Client Solutions Group delivered record revenue of $14.3 billion, up 27% as we leaned into commercial, along with solutions in the broader client ecosystem, including software and peripherals, where we are #1 in displays and we believe we gained more than 100 basis points of share in calendar Q2. There are positive secular trends at play in client, especially in the areas we are most focused, notably the commercial market, premium price bands and gaming, that should enable stable growth over the next few years.
The Infrastructure Solutions Group continued growth with revenue up 3% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by growth in servers and networking as customers modernize their IT infrastructure to enable data-driven AI and machine learning technologies. We are also encouraged by the strengthening of storage during the quarter and the overall demand for hyperconverged infrastructure and midrange storage. Tom will dive into more of the financial details of Q2 in just a moment.
The second point is that we have durable competitive advantages that uniquely position us to win in our core and adjacent markets. A few I would call out that drove our Q2 performance. We have built an end-to-end innovation engine that delivers engineered solutions and software enhancements based on our unparalleled market reach and ability to see across a customer's full set of IT needs. These include management and orchestration, embedded intelligence, automation, predictive analytics, proactive support, telemetry and intrinsic security. 
A key example is PowerStore, our micro-services-based midrange storage solution, which is ramping faster than any new architecture we've released with double-digit increases in net new storage buyers for both Q1 and Q2. We are utilizing our industry-leading scale and differentiated supply chain to successfully navigate through the operational challenges caused by the unprecedented demand that is way ahead of supply right now. Despite industry supply shortages, we shipped a record number of PCs and displays in the second quarter.
The third point is that we're driving a differentiated strategy to seize the tremendous growth potential ahead. We are focused on winning the consolidation and modernizing our core businesses by driving ongoing share gains and improving margins through scale, engineering, innovation and product mix shift. We are the clear #1 in external storage, #1 in hyperconverged infrastructure, #1 in mainstream servers, #1 in data protection appliances, and our Client Solutions business is #1 in revenue. 
We have demonstrated the ability to adapt to the market dynamics over time as evidenced by our commercial client share gains in 30 of the last 34 quarters, and we have gained more than 700 basis points of share over that period. Additionally, we have gained more than 700 basis points of share for mainstream servers and approximately 200 basis points of share for external storage over the last 5 years as of calendar Q1 2021 according to IDC data. 
We are focused on the midrange segment of storage and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing, but we know we still have work to do. When server and storage calendar Q2 share data is released in September, we expect share gains in both markets. We are also prioritizing customer outcomes and modernizing our business model with APEX, which provides an incremental growth opportunity as we introduce more as-a-service solutions and gain traction with current offers.
For example, in July, we announced GE is using APEX Data Center Utility to blend automation and software architecture to support its increasing workloads from traditional IT applications to data analytics.  With APEX, GE can scale up or down its data center, storage and compute resources on demand as the company executes an approach that adapts to each business unit's strategy. We are innovating, integrating and partnering to create the technology ecosystem of the future for our customers with our unique partnership with VMware as the centerpiece.
We continue to drive new product innovation and business opportunities with VMware. For instance, in Q2, we launched new VxRail systems with the latest PowerEdge servers and new software advancements that deliver faster performance as well as simplified deployment and management. Additionally, we introduced VxRail dynamic nodes that expand how customers can use existing Dell Technologies storage resources to support new multi-cloud workloads. VxRail continues to be an area of growth in one of the fastest-growing segments in storage with orders up 34% in Q2.
We're also pursuing adjacent high-value growth opportunities where we are uniquely positioned to win, areas like multi-cloud, edge, telecom, data management that open up adjacent multibillion dollar markets. We are investing in these opportunities and expect meaningful contribution from them in years to come. And we're already seeing powerful customer use cases today. 
For example, our disruptive bet in telecommunications has led to multiple flagship wins to build open radio access networks, or Open RAN. We are working with Vodafone to build Europe's first commercial Open RAN, bringing more broadband access to European businesses and communities; with Orange to launch Europe's first 5G stand-alone, fully end-to-end cloud network; and with Deutsche Telekom, whose multi-vendor Open RAN network in Neubrandenburg, Germany is now live. These are just a few examples, and we are excited about the progress we are making in this space.
With these leading market positions, durable competitive advantages and a differentiated strategy, I believe we can drive consistent growth and significant value creation. I'm really excited about the opportunities ahead, and I look forward to talking in more detail at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on September 23.
Before we go to Tom and our financial performance, let me introduce Chuck Whitten. As most of you are aware, in June, we announced Chuck was joining me as Co-Chief Operating Officer. He and I have worked together for many years alongside of the rest of the leadership team to help shape Dell's strategy and growth initiatives. Welcome, Chuck.",1248

I'm thrilled to join the Dell Technologies leadership team and look forward to regularly engaging with investors. As Jeff said, I've worked for more than a decade with Michael, Jeff and the rest of Dell leadership on the company's strategy and positioning. 
The company has tremendous opportunity ahead, and we're focused on executing the strategy laid out in the June investor presentation. And we have never been more optimistic about our ability to innovate, delight customers, deliver growth and create value for all shareholders in the coming years. We operate in large, growing markets with ample headroom. The markets we target total $1.3 trillion today with core markets growing in the low single digits and adjacent markets growing faster through 2024 as widespread digital transformation drives sustained technology investment.
But beyond sheer size, those markets are evolving in ways that play to our market positions and the durable competitive advantages Jeff mentioned. As technology becomes ever more essential, more distributed, more hybrid and more multi-cloud, customers need a scale, trusted and global partner who can help them simplify and create business value, from the PC to the core data center to the cloud to the edge. 
In short, this company was built for this moment in technology, and there is substantial growth opportunity in both our core markets and in high-value adjacent markets where our competitive advantages matter. And the spin-off of VMware will unlock the opportunity for us to pursue a balanced capital allocation strategy and invest in sustained profitable growth for years to come.
Our strategy is good for customers, employees and shareholders, and our first half results are proof. It's clear to us that our strategy will drive sustained value creation post spin-off, and that's what we're focused on executing every day as a team.
I look forward to speaking with you in more detail at the Analyst Meeting. Let me now turn the call over to Tom.",326
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2021",2021-08-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3515.0,2399614.0,91348354.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Chuck, and glad you're with us. I am pleased with our performance and the execution of our strategy as we delivered another quarter of consistent growth for revenue and profitability. Over the last 4 fiscal years, we've grown operating income faster than or equal to revenue every year. Secular trends such as work and learn from anywhere, digitalization of businesses and governments and real-time decision-making with edge data leads us to be optimistic on our long-term growth prospects.
Revenue for the second quarter was a Q2 record at $26.1 billion, up 15%, driven by growth in all 3 business units, led by outstanding performance in CSG and growth in ISG. Demand was ahead of revenue growth as we managed supply constraints, which should not come as a surprise to anyone. 
Gross margin was $8.3 billion, up 9% at 31.9% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 160 basis points lower, primarily due to a 540 basis point revenue mix shift to CSG. We are navigating the inflationary cost environment and have adjusted prices for the higher input cost while being mindful of our competitive positioning.
Operating expense was $5.5 billion, up 10%, as we invest for long-term growth, and we have certain costs come back from the depressed levels we saw last year. Given our strong performance, our variable costs, such as sales compensation and bonus, are running ahead of prior year levels. We have been disciplined in our decisions and will continue to be prudently managing our expenses going forward.
Operating income was also a second quarter record at $2.8 billion, up 7% and 10.8% of revenue. Our interest expense was down approximately $134 million given the progress on debt reduction, contributing to the expansion of our consolidated net income to $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.24, up 17%. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion, up 7% at 12.7% of revenue. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 billion, up 16%. Our recurring revenue is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 14%. 
Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $46 billion, up 24% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. The growth was driven by an expanded backlog given that demand is ahead of supply in addition to solid performance in hardware and software maintenance. Excluding VMware, Dell's RPO is approximately $35 billion, up 30%.
Turning to the business units. We had another quarter of very strong performance by our Client Solutions Group despite industry-wide supply chain challenges. CSG revenue hit a new record at $14.3 billion, up 27%, on the strength in demand for devices and solutions that offer improved connectivity and productivity. We continued to see strength across notebooks, but we also saw strong double-digit growth in commercial and desktop orders. As Jeff mentioned, we leaned into commercial where more than 70% of our CSG revenue comes from, and commercial also contributed to our return to share gains per IDC's calendar Q2 results. 
Commercial revenue was up 32% to a record $10.6 billion as businesses looked to upgrade devices and productivity solutions for their long-term in-office, remote and hybrid workforce environments. Consumer revenue was a second quarter record at $3.7 billion, up 17% as digital entertainment and e-commerce are still driving strong demand for upgraded experiences. 
CSG operating income was $995 million, up 39% and was 7% of revenue. We saw solid profitability primarily due to strong shipments, a mix shift to commercial and a balanced pricing environment.
Moving to ISG, where revenue was up 3% to $8.4 billion. We saw a strong demand environment for compute and positive momentum in storage. Customers across all regions are investing in IT infrastructure focused on multi-cloud solutions and accelerating digital transformation. Servers and networking reported its third consecutive quarter of positive growth, with revenue of $4.5 billion, up 6%, with strong demand across all customer segments and geographies. 
Storage revenue was $4 billion, down 1%. On an orders basis, we were encouraged to see positive overall storage growth of 2%, with ongoing demand in high-growth areas like hyperconverged infrastructure, where VxRail's orders were up 34%, and in midrange storage, where orders were up 17%. PowerStore continues to ramp nicely, making up approximately 38% of our midrange storage portfolio. 23% of PowerStore customers in Q2 were net new to Dell storage. 
ISG operating income was flat at $970 million and was 11.5% of revenue. The VMware business unit revenue was $3.1 billion, up 8%, and operating income was $849 million or 27% of revenue. 
Dell Financial Services originations were $1.9 billion, down 27%, due to the tougher comparison last year as more customers leveraged financing during the early stages of the pandemic. DFS ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in total managed assets, flat year-over-year with global portfolio losses at historic lows.
Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet. We generated strong cash flow in Q2 and are making good progress on delevering. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. Although cash flow was slightly lower sequentially, impacted partly by working capital dynamics, our cash flow from operations was $4 billion through the first half of the year, which was up 56% compared to the same period last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $12.8 billion, and excluding VMware, it was $8.4 billion. Over the last 3 years, on a trailing 12-month basis, cash from operations grew at a 15% CAGR. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion and approximately $7.5 billion for Dell, excluding VMware. 
During the second quarter, we paid down $3 billion of the $4 billion margin loan that was outstanding as of the beginning of the quarter, and we paid down the remaining $1 billion earlier this week. We have now paid down approximately $5.5 billion of debt year-to-date and expect to pay down at least $16 billion for the full fiscal year. Our core debt ended the quarter at $27.6 billion, and our core leverage ratio is approximately 2.2x versus our long-term core leverage target of 1.5x. 
We expect to achieve an investment-grade corporate family rating once the VMware spin is finalized. Once we get to IG, there will be opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation policy, including shareholder capital return, investments to grow the business and value-enhancing M&A. We will provide more details on our post-spin capital allocation policy at our Analyst Meeting next month.
Now to our outlook. From a macro point of view, the global economic recovery is driving broad demand across multiple sectors, including IT. As a result, demand for integrated circuits and components that are fundamental building blocks of today's modern IT, automotive, industrial solutions and home appliances are in tight supply. One of our durable advantages is our industry-leading scale and supply chain expertise. This is serving us well in this environment, and we are actively managing demand that is ahead of the industry's ability to deliver ICs and components. 
For Q3, we now expect an above-normal sequential revenue growth pattern and year-over-year growth up mid- to high teens. For CSG, we expect high single-digit growth sequentially. For ISG, we expect low single-digit growth sequentially. And for VMware, you should factor in their stand-alone revenue guidance, which is roughly flat sequentially. Given this, we expect Q3 revenue overall to be up mid-single digits sequentially versus a normal 2% decline. 
For Q3 operating income, we expect a mix shift to CSG sequentially, ongoing component cost dynamics, a modest increase in OpEx as we invest for growth, and we are considering the impact of VMware stand-alone guidance. With all of these factors, in our view, operating income dollars will be up 1% to 2% sequentially. Below the operating income line, we will continue to benefit from lower interest expense as we reduce our debt. But do keep in mind, the majority of our $16 billion plus in targeted debt paydown will occur at the time of the VMware transaction, which we now estimate to be -- to close in early November.
For non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 17% plus or minus 100 basis points. In the absence of share repurchase activity, diluted share count should also increase slightly sequentially.
In closing, we have a track record of consistent execution across any economic or IT spending cycle given our durable competitive advantages, and we are investing in innovation and software development to differentiate our solutions and appliances. We are optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our businesses. I'm confident in our ability to deliver consistent and predictable financial performance. 
From fiscal year '18 through fiscal year '21, we grew revenue at a 6% CAGR and grew adjusted EBITDA at a 12% CAGR, and we generated nearly $28 billion in operating cash flow. We are well positioned and have the right strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for core Dell with all of you on September 23.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin the Q&A.",1512

I mean first to answer your question about share. In the most recent IDC-published share data, Dell was the top share gainer of the top 5 manufacturers in the marketplace. We took share in total PCs. We took share in commercial PCs, our focus. We took more share than any of our other competitors in those spaces. So to answer your question, yes, we're taking share. We took 120 basis points of share, for example, in the commercial PC market in calendar Q2.
Your specific question of where are the shortages in the industry, as we've, I think, mentioned through several of these calls now, it's semiconductors. The industry demand, and industry being IT, consumer electronics, automotive, industrials, for electronics, for semiconductor continues to be strong. That is the area that is challenged certainly for us. We continue to work through it. I think we are working through it reasonably well. 
The execution of our supply chain team is, I think, quite impressive with record shipments for the quarter for PCs, record shipments for displays. But the types of devices would be scalers, TCONs, microcontrollers, power ICs, driver ICs. Those types of devices are the ones that we see consistently challenged at different times. I hope that helped.",210

Your U.S. competitor has just signaled that they're reducing their promotional and marketing spend assumptions substantially, and that had a big impact on margins in the quarter. And we're assuming it will have a large impact on their PC margins looking forward. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing that kind of promotional and marketing spend reduction in the market today and what you're thinking in terms of your own expenditures in that respect in the back end of the year given the demand dynamics against the supply dynamics.",101

We like where our business is. We think we are executing at a very high level.

And Jeff, I'd love to get your perspective here because overall sales on storage were, I think, down 1%, compares were fairly easy. And I think a couple of your peers in that space actually had double-digit growth yesterday. So I'd love to understand, how do you think storage performed versus your own internal expectations this quarter? And then what do you think is fundamentally needed for Dell to start gaining share on the storage side over the next few quarters?",90
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 26, 2021",2021-08-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3515.0,2399614.0,91348365.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,15,"Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe sometimes I think we don't do a good job of describing our storage business. And let me start with, first, we have the broadest portfolio in the marketplace. Second to none. We're the leader in high-end storage, midrange storage, entry-level storage, unstructured storage, object storage, all-flash as well as modern storage, software-defined, HCI, the hyperconverged space. Our share position in calendar Q1 was 32.3%, which is larger than #2, 3, 4 and 5 combined. 
Our business -- and Tom and I, I think, referenced it in our prepared comments. Our business grew in the midrange. Our business grew in HCI, and we believe we grew in unstructured as fast or faster than any of our competitors in those spaces. In the midrange, which is defined as the $25,000 to $255,000 price bands, which is about 60% of the marketplace, we grew 17%. That's very competitive against the numbers that you mentioned from yesterday against our pure-play competitors in the midrange market space. In Q1 -- or I should say, and this marks the third consecutive quarter with that 17% that we've grown in the midrange. So for the last 3 quarters, we grew 8% in Q4, 23% in Q1, 17% in Q2. Our midrange business is growing. Our midrange business is taking share. 
We've recently added the PowerStore 500, which allows us to cover the entry-level price band. So we now cover all price bands in the midrange marketplace. We also added new performance upgrades to our product in a seamless upgrade that happened earlier this year. Our storage buyer base grew double digits, as we mentioned in our prepared comments. PowerStore remains the fastest-growing new storage product in the history of the company through its first 5 quarters. 23% of our PowerStore buyers are new to our storage business, and 20% of them are repeat buyers. So we think we are executing at a very high level degree of performance or execution in our midrange. 
That said, you called out one of our challenges that our orders growth was 2%. Our P&L growth was negative 1%. And we have a very large high-end business. That large high-end business is cyclical in nature. It was down year-over-year, and that's down year-over-year after a very solid first half of last year. 
So we like our hand. We like our execution today. We do have this broad portfolio that is subjected to the cyclical nature of some segments. But in the high-growth space of HCI, our VxRail product grew 34% and midrange at 17%. We are growing very competitively against our pure-play competitors there. And we like the momentum. As I've said, as a trained engineer 3 data points makes a trend. We now have a trend of 3 growth data points in midrange storage.",469

And I think you guys noted that your RPO, excluding VMware, was up about 30%. If I put that in context, your deferred revenue, ex VMware, grew about 11% year-over-year. So clearly, the RPO balance is expanding much faster than core Dell deferred revenue.

Aaron, let me take that. So you saw quarter-on-quarter that overall RPO was up roughly about $3.9 billion. The vast majority of that principally related to backlog growth, right?

If you think about that backlog growth and the momentum that we saw in our business, at least from our seat, that indicates strong demand for our products and our services as that backlog build. Our cancellation rates didn't change over the quarter. Our ability to deliver for our customers or to our customer commitments, I think, is indicative of that cancellation rate not changing at all. Again, we shipped a record number of PCs and displays as we had the building backlog, and our supply chain team continues to be agile in this dynamic marketplace. We're maneuvering to maximize shipments for our customers. And probably just a little plug here, there are 200 PCs available today on dell.com with next-day ship ready to go.",131

Look, I think as we step back, we like the demand environment that we're seeing right now. Yes, it's challenging from a supply [ chain. ] They're -- clearly, we're constrained on certain parts, as Jeff and his team worked their way through that. But the demand signals that we see from our end customers, it looks promising. And so as we think about the business and our position within the -- what we're trying to drive, as Jeff mentioned, very strong client demand. 
And we, as you know, are more heavily oriented towards commercial PCs, and that mix was up this quarter. And we've seen continued strength in commercial PC demand. So we're encouraged by that even as consumer demand was double digits this quarter. So we're pleased with how that's growing as well. 
So look, I think from a parsing the guidance, I would tell you, we're pleased with CSG, which is what I mentioned in my guidance comment. From an ISG perspective, strong compute opportunity. We're encouraged by the improving storage performance there. I don't want to oversell that. There's work to do in storage, but we're pleased with the environment and the spend we're seeing in the data center. So for us, the dynamic is going to be the supply chain framework around can Jeff get the appropriate -- Jeff and team get the appropriate parts in and the configurations that we need to be able to ship, right? 
And so -- but overall, I think the demand environment from our perspective for Q3 looks healthy. We've talked about the fact that we've got -- we've talked about the fact that we saw some component cost inflation beginning in Q2 with  component costs are inflationary in Q3. And so we are working our way through that. We have adjusted pricing accordingly. And it does not, at this point, seem to have impacted any of the demand signals that we're seeing. So I think we're well positioned. We've got to go execute. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about where we are at this point.",352

Katy, maybe just 2 points of color to emphasize what Tom said. We saw the movement in CSG towards commercial away from consumer and away from Chrome to commercial, and we believe we positioned our supply chain to capture that momentum. 
And then secondly, I think we've talked about this with our growing server momentum now 3 quarters in a row of server growth, that we're seeing a returned investment into the data center, that a couple of years of delayed investments and aging installed base, new product transitions with the new processors that are available in the marketplace, some of the supply uncertainty is having customers prioritize their projects to transform, modernize and protect their digital businesses.

Unlike some of our competitors, I'm not going to tell you how many weeks of backlog we have. I'll just tell you that it's extended and that -- or it's expanded, and we need to work our way through it. 
As we think about Q3, I think what you should -- what you need to think about is that, look, we believe the demand environment remains healthy. We are -- we did adjust pricing for higher input costs. So there is obviously some translation to higher TRU. But the overall prevailing framework that we're going to have to work our way through for Q3 is around what our are shipment mix -- what's our shipment mix look like, right?

Look, in aggregate, the semiconductor industry needs more capacity. I think we've talked about this before, but we're seeing the same thing. It's constrained. I think the constraints certainly last or go into next year. The most constrained nodes are the trailing nodes, most particularly the parts that come off the 8-inch network. Quite frankly, no one's investing in a lot of new 8-inch capacity, if any. There's wafer and substrate shortages. We have assembly and test. Wire bonding lead frame areas are challenged. So I think these are consistent things that we've talked about as we've got into the semiconductor challenge broadly across multiple industries. 
The path out of this is ultimately more capacity. It takes a long time to build these different fabs anywhere from a couple of years to 3 years depending on the process technology we're talking about. And obviously, lots of capital is required to do that. Our job is that's the environment we're playing in. We've been directly managing our components for a very long time in this company. We have longstanding relationships and partnerships. We continue to let people know what our long-term demand is. It's how we plan this company. And what we have found is those partnerships over long periods of time and consistency in those partnerships and the agreements that we have in place certainly help us navigate these types of situations. That's what we're focused on. 
You're not going to see us get into the semiconductor business. It's certainly not a core competence and something that we wouldn't touch. We're working with our partners to continue to understand what the demand characteristics long term look like for these marketplaces. I think as we've been consistent, we believe the PC market long term continues to grow. We believe the server industry continues to grow long term as we believe the same to be true of the storage business. And letting our partners know that there'll be long-term demand is the best thing we can do to ensure there will be capacity in the future.",349

Are we starting to see those kind of impact your guidance for the next quarter? And when do we kind of -- typically with the lag through the channel, when do we start to expect the full impact of that?

Samik, so the way I would think about it is we have adjusted our pricing given the higher costs we're seeing, and Jeff has mentioned some of the constraints we have in that space. We have -- I mentioned earlier that we expect Q3 is inflationary from a component cost perspective. We expect Q4 to be inflationary with what we know today. 
We've talked a lot for a while now about the fact that with our broad, diverse portfolio, as we adjust pricing, it does take a little bit of time for that to flow through. I think we've been pretty proactive on it at this point. We expect that some of those price increases, a portion of those price increases will impact Q3 and then obviously on into Q4. 
The challenge in the dynamic that we're working our way through -- or the mix dynamic, I should say, we're working our way through is the fact that I'm coming into -- I've got backlog that's priced at different price points given where we were in the cost curves at the time of the transaction. So there's some mix dynamics within backlog that we'll work our way through. Hence, why I guided like I guided. 
While we're bullish -- while we like our revenue guidance, the op inc guidance wasn't quite as expansive. In fact, our EPS -- you just think about our EPS and probably our guidance as being similar to how I guided on operating income. And that's just -- we've got some mix dynamics there that we're working our way through. And obviously, the gating factor, again, comes back to what can we get shipped within the quarter. 
So look, I think the teams reacted well. The encouraging news from -- encouraging perspective that I have is that even with the price increases, we have not seen demand signals change. And I think that's very encouraging. We watch our transactional velocity quite closely. That has not really moved on us even with the price increases. 
So again, it comes back to, yes, we've got build in backlog. Cancellation rates are -- haven't changed at all. So we feel good about the overall environment. And look, customers have generally been accepting of the price increases given there's inflation in the environment broadly in many different commodities and areas. And so they're -- they've -- and quite frankly, with the lack of supply in the industry, there's not a lot of places that they can go.",418

Look, we're bullish on Windows 11. Our industry has a history of new operating systems driving an upgrade cycle. The upgrade cycle, when the product is formally released into the marketplace, we believe, is there. We think Windows 11 brings a lot to end users from anywhere from a new user interface to the ability to see some productivity enhancements, run multiple desktops and such, drives a higher hardware specification, which is good for business. 
We have a large installed base that will continue to need to be refreshed against that. We believe that this is really a replacement of a PC, not an upgrade of an OS on an old PC. So that generally drives demand in our industry. You couple that with what we believe is a general change in usage patterns that the PC has become more essential in this work-from-home, learn-from-home, game-from-home, buy-from-home, entertain-from-home world. 
And we think that we're on the verge of new models where, a long time ago, we thought success was one PC per household, now we're seeing multiple PCs per household. We're seeing a more mobile PC base, which requires a more frequent upgrade or replacement cycle is the right word. We think the future is pretty bright for the PC. And a phrase that we've been kicking around the organization is all signs point to a stronger and longer demand cycle for PCs. And we think commercial PCs, in particular, will benefit from that.",252

So that is the one major milestone out there. And so we're continuing to work very closely with them, and it's tracking as expected. So that's the remaining major hurdle, if you will. 
Everything else is moving as planned, right? The teams are working very closely together as they continue -- as we continue to sort of work through our workflows and work streams around post-spin work, innovation targets, innovation areas. The go-to-market motions are all in place. So we feel good about where we are. But we do obviously need to close and get the successful ruling of the private -- from the IRS on the private letter ruling, and that remains on track as of this date.",154

Your ISG margin has improved to now close to long-term trend. Conversely, CSG has come down a little bit, but still very good. How do you expect operating margins of both segments to trend for the next few quarters given the higher input cost? Maybe you can choose -- pick and choose which one to serve in the supply-constrained environment. It sounds like Q3 is a dip, but how about beyond Q3, especially when IT spending continues to improve?",88

Sidney, I don't really want to get into long-term operating margin guidance on this call. But I would just tell you, look, we're pleased overall with the progress we made with our CSG performance and strong profitability. We have talked about in the past that we expect -- we think that, that business runs somewhere between 5 to 6 points of operating margin on a sort of a long-term basis. We're continuing to evaluate that, whether that's the appropriate model on a go-forward basis, and we'll share some of that at our Analyst Meeting on the 23rd of September. 
I think from an ISG perspective, we're pleased with the performance -- the progress, but I think there's more work to do there, particularly as we continue to push on storage growth, which generally drives a higher operating margin. So look, good progress, but always more to do, and we'll update you guys on our long-term thinking as we -- at the Analyst Meeting here next month.",167

So just trying to understand how much of this good revenue trend, the revenue growth is driven by mix versus price increases. If you could just help us break this down in terms of kind of what's sustainable here and what are the key factors on the overall growth. I assume it's not just about more units.",85

So you know, having been around this business for a while, that some of the TRU dynamics within the business are going to be generated based upon what's the component cost environment. And so they will move as component costs move. Right now, with the higher input costs, we've raised prices. So yes, that does have a TRU impact. So we do expect some favorability coming through the -- from TRUs as we look into Q3 and probably into Q4 just given the component cost environment. 
Having said that, we're also bullish on demand, right, with what we know today. So we do expect the demand environment to remain favorable absent some sudden change. And so again, I think it's going to come down to -- as you're trying to think your way through how do I think about revenue in the future, at least in the near term, it's going to come down to the shipment mix, right? And that's the thing that we're continuing to work through in all transparency as the supply chain team continues to work through component cost shortages and what they can get in into and what does that look like. 
So I'm not -- that's about the most straightforward answer I can give you right now, which is, look, yes, TRU should be somewhat of a benefit, but the mix dynamics from the shipment is going to be what's going to really sort of move -- will decide how the P&L shake out. And we feel good about what we can get done in Q3, hence the guidance we gave you, and we'll update you on Q4 at the appropriate time.",290

You talked about different end segments you feel pretty proud about and pleased about. But when you look at the overall numbers, they look pretty disappointing relative to your competitors out there. So the question is, are you guys like disengaging in quite a few markets and we should be aware at that?

So the 17% growth that I mentioned is in the biggest part of the storage market. It represents 60% of the revenue, the midrange, the price bands that cover $25,000 to $250,000. We grew that 17% in the quarter, the third consecutive quarter that we've had growth in the midrange on the back of our new product PowerStore, which we've talked about is our game changer in the midrange. And it's proven to be that to date. We're excited, fastest-growing product we've ever launched through its first 5 quarters. We have a growing customer base, and we have repeat buyers. Good signs. 
Hyperconverged, the fastest-growing space in storage, where we have the privileged position of being the market leader. Our combined product with VMware, VxRail, grew 34%. So in the 2 most important marketplaces, midrange and the new 2-tier architecture, modern architecture, we're the leader and we're growing. And we're growing at or a faster rate than our competitors in those spaces. 
What I mentioned before is in the high end where we have the privileged position of having a share position of in excess of 42%, that market is declining. It's cyclical in nature. Last first half, it grew. This first half, it's not growing. That business, we're obviously exposed to a large percentage of that business being the market share leader with 42-plus percent share, is declining and we're declining like the market is declining. I hope that helped put color to it.",254

Thanks for joining us today. We're 3 quarters into what will prove to be a historic year for Dell. As Michael said at our September Analyst Meeting, we're just beginning to write the next chapter of the Dell Technologies story. During that meeting and with industry analysts at our annual Dell Technologies Summit in October, we shared our view on the IT industry, our strategy going forward and our view on long-term value creation. 
We'd emphasized 4 key points from those sessions. First, we are uniquely positioned in the data and multi-cloud era with durable advantages, market-leading positions and the financial flexibility to drive sustained profitable growth. Second, our ISG and CSG core businesses are attractive. They sit in large markets estimated at $670 billion in TAM and are projected to grow in the low single digits over the next few years. We have ample headroom for growth, a track record of gaining share and are pursuing a differentiated strategy to consolidate and modernize our core business, including through our APEX-branded as-a-service solutions. 
In CSG, our differentiation comes from our unique direct sales motion and strategic channel program, our focus on the most stable and premium parts of the PC market and our strong attach motion, which captures the value around the device as customers seek exceptional experiences and improved productivity by buying more software and peripherals. 
And for ISG, our leadership positions give us a unique ability to solve customer problems as data proliferates and infrastructure becomes more distributed, hybrid and software-driven. We are #1 in x86 in mainstream server revenue, and we are also #1 in all external storage categories with the most extensive and diverse storage portfolio in the industry. Our storage business addresses each segment of the market with a differentiated architecture optimized for workload needs. And of course, our alliance with VMware is unique in the industry. We've honed a first and best technical and commercial motion that enables faster time to market and differentiated jointly engineered solutions. 
The third point we'd highlight is the attractive new growth opportunities that surround our business. $650 billion in additional market opportunity growing at an 8% CAGR through 2024. These are markets where we have a unique right to win and are driving real innovation today, markets like telco and edge, to name just 2 examples. 
And lastly, we are firmly committed to creating shareholder value with an attractive long-term financial framework, balanced capital allocation strategy and track record of delivering consistent results in any environment. Our year-to-date and Q3 financial results, along with our steady strategic progress, offer compelling proof of these points and our long-term strategy. 
Let's start with our core markets and execution. Demand for our solutions remains strong as global economic recovery and widespread digital transformation reset IT demand to higher levels. Against that backdrop and despite the difficult supply environment, we again delivered great performance in Q3 with strong growth in all 3 business units, all regions and broad strength across our commercial PC, server, and notably, most of our storage portfolio. We gained share in servers, storage and PCs, according to the latest reported IDC results. 
As we look forward, all signposts point to continued strong market demand, and we intend to continue winning in the consolidation and gaining share over the long term. Our strategy is not just to win in the consolidation but also to modernize our business, and our APEX-branded solutions are important to that future. Though it is still early days, we're pleased with our technical progress and the momentum across our family of as-a-service offerings which will continue to expand going forward. 
For example, in October, we announced APEX Cloud Services with VMware Cloud, a terrific example of our first and best alliance with VMware. That solution gives organizations the ability to move workloads across multiple cloud environments and scale resources quickly with predictable pricing and transparent costs. 
Turning to our growth engines. As I said, edge and telecom are 2 perfect examples of the types of markets we are looking to disrupt, and we delivered a steady stream of innovation in these spaces in Q3. For the edge, we introduced VxRail satellite nodes and updates to our streaming data platform. For telecom, we introduced new Bare Metal Orchestrator software, multiple reference architectures to accelerate ORAN and edge deployments and a new service offering called Respond and Restore for telecom. We're encouraged by our ability to simultaneously deliver in our core while driving innovation in new growth markets, and we will continue to pursue adjacent growth to our market positions. Customer relationships and durable competitive advantages give us a unique right to solve customer problems in the data and multi-cloud era. 
Let me conclude with our commitment to long-term shareholder value. Since the September meeting, we have hit a few major milestones in our efforts to simplify our corporate structure and create financial flexibility to drive future growth. We completed the transaction to spin off VMware, and we closed the Boomi divestiture, each resulting in a more simplified corporate structure. In addition, we have returned to an investment-grade corporate rating which opens up the opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation strategy. 
To sum up, we remain confident that our market positions, articulated strategy, durable competitive advantages, commitment to disciplined capital allocation, and importantly, our culture and track record of execution are great for customers and our team members and create an attractive near- and long-term opportunity for shareholders. Q3 was a great example of these winning elements coming together, and we're just getting started. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff.",943

I started off last quarter's call by saying in this incredibly unpredictable environment, we delivered our best second quarter ever. We now have delivered our best third quarter ever, and we are on track for a historic year. 
The constant through all the change over the past 18 months is the unprecedented demand for technology. It is clear, technology is more essential today than ever before. We are clearly winning in the core, and this keeps us at the center of our customers' IT and digital agendas. 
Three quarters into our fiscal year, Dell Technologies has seen a record revenue of $79 billion, up 16%, along with record operating income of $8.4 billion, up 12%. For the third quarter, we delivered 21% of revenue growth as we saw broad-based growth across our business. Similar to last quarter, demand remains ahead of revenue growth as we continue to navigate industry-wide supply constraints driven primarily by integrated circuits. We shipped a record number of products globally in Q3 and have leveraged our strengths: a multi-decade operational excellence; product design flexibility, coupled with less complexity; and our direct model with its high-quality demand signal and ability to shape demand. We are also delivering on our commitment to innovation. We launched a number of new offerings during the quarter. 
Out of our growing telecom business, we introduced Bare Metal Orchestration software to give cloud service providers a flexible and cost-effective way to deploy and operate their open cloud-native network infrastructure. In storage, we announced network attached storage software and hardware innovation for power scale, providing organizations with more flexible consumption, management, protection and cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, we launched the industry's first end-to-end NVMe/TCP SAN solution, featuring SmartFabric storage software, which provides the intelligence for automated storage connectivity at scale. And in client, we are pairing Windows 11 with our Dell Optimizer built-in intelligence to deliver the most personalized productive computing experience on the world's most intelligent business PCs. We believe the introduction of Windows 11 will continue to drive demand in PCs. 
Lastly, as Chuck mentioned, our first and best partnership with VMware continued to demonstrate our joint ability to deliver differentiated offers with the announcement of APEX Cloud Services wit VMware Cloud at VMworld. It's multi-cloud done right. 
Turning to our segment results. Our Infrastructure Solutions Group continue to see positive momentum as enterprise IT spending rebounded and our multiyear investments in the portfolio took hold. ISG delivered revenue growth of 5% to $8.4 billion, which was our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Customers across all regions are investing in IT infrastructure focused on multi-cloud solutions and accelerating digital transformation. This investment is driving very strong demand for compute and storage. Operating income was $892 million or 10.6% of revenue. 
Server and networking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 9%, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Both server and networking demand were exceptionally strong and ahead of revenue growth throughout the quarter. Our 15G server ramp accelerated over the quarter, and we continue to see positive momentum in high-value workloads. 
We are pleased with our storage performance in Q3, where we saw storage return to growth with revenue up 1% to $3.9 billion. Our overall storage demand was strong driven by orders growth of 47% for hyperconverged infrastructure, 26% for data protection and 18% for mid-range storage. Momentum in our mid-range storage business continues to be led by PowerStore, CRN's 2021 Innovator Award for mid-range storage where 23% of PowerStore customers renewed to Dell storage and 28% were repeat buyers. PowerStore is the fastest-ramping storage product in our history. 
Dell continue to lead the transition to software-defined data center this quarter with customers leveraging the power of VxRail and PowerFlex as the foundation of their multi-cloud strategy. For example, Lotus is bringing more power and resiliency to the edge, deploying VxRail to handle IT demands in each of its more than 2,200 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada, helping the company deliver new capabilities and services that allow its employees to better serve customers during this holiday season and beyond. 
Turning to CSG. We had another record quarter driven by the global economic recovery and the new distributed work environment requiring modern devices and advanced productivity solutions. CSG delivered revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35%, driven by strong demand across the board: commercial and consumer, notebooks and desktops and across all regions. Commercial revenue was a record at $12.3 billion in Q3, up an unprecedented 40%. We have reached record commercial revenue for each of the last 3 fiscal years and are on track for another strong year. Consumer revenue was a record at $4.3 billion, up 21%, driven by strong growth in notebooks as well as premium and gaming desktops. 
Our team did a good job navigating the inflationary component cost and logistics environment, resulting in a record CSG operating income of $1.1 billion, up 14% and 6.9% of revenue. Our long-term focus on higher-value and stable segments of the client market is what helps drive our consistent results. Approximately 80% of the industry's revenue and nearly all of the industry's revenue growth has come from commercial PCs and premium consumer PCs, and that is where we are focused. 
We are driving profitable share gains over the long term, especially in commercial client, where we've gained nearly 400 basis points of share for calendar Q3 according to IDC. For total client, we gained more than 300 basis points of share in calendar Q3, outgrowing the next 4 PC vendors combined. In addition, we believe our leading share position in displays further expanded during calendar Q3 based on preliminary IDC data. We'll continue to leverage our strong attach motion to capture our share of the opportunity in the broader PC ecosystem. 
Our client business has delivered dependable and consistent growth throughout multiple cycles, and we believe trends will remain healthy given businesses around the world are increasingly digitizing and utilizing technology to increase productivity and drive innovation. 
To close, we are focused on driving consistent growth in our core businesses where we build customer trust and create insights that power innovation, and we are expanding into new growth businesses where we have a unique right to win. With our durable advantages like our broad customer reach, world-class supply chain and modern services delivery network, I believe we are well positioned to win today and into the future. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom.",1085
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3390.0,2447945.0,92926659.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Jeff. The digital trends and real-time decision-making at the edge are tailwinds for our infrastructure business, and we continue to see differentiated opportunities in how we target and execute within the PC space. These trends, along with our strategy and durable advantages, lead us to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. 
We continue to deliver strong results through any environment, and the third quarter was another example of this performance stability. We drove strong growth in revenue and delivered solid profitability growth despite some challenging dynamics. 
For the third quarter, we saw a record revenue of $28.4 billion, up 21%, driven by growth in all 3 business units, led by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG. I was pleased to see the improved demand growth in storage, although it did not all flow to the P&L given timing and deferrals. 
Gross margin was $8.4 billion, up 8% and was 29.6% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 340 basis points lower, primarily due to a revenue mix shift to CSG, along with an inflationary cost environment. 
As we told you on last quarter's call, component cost would be a headwind in Q3, particularly impacting our elevated units in backlog. We took various actions around pricing and configurations as we navigated through the quarter because of the higher cost. In general, as we've discussed in the past, we will realize a portion of the benefit of these price increases in the quarter in which we take the pricing actions as well as in future quarters. 
Operating expense was $5.5 billion, up 10% as we invest for long-term growth. And our variable costs, such as sales compensation and bonus, are running ahead of prior year levels given our strong performance. As always, we will prudently manage our spending and expenses even as we continue to invest in the business. 
Operating income was a third quarter record at $2.9 billion, up 5% and 10.1% of revenue. A decline in interest expense due to our reduced debt balances and a decline in our effective tax rate contributed to the 18% growth of consolidated net income to $2 billion and 17% growth in diluted earnings per share to $2.37. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 billion, up 6% at 12% of revenue. And for the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.8 billion, up 14%. 
Our recurring revenue is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 13%. 
Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $47 billion, up 26% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Excluding VMware, Dell's RPO is approximately $36 billion, up 32% and up 3% sequentially. The sequential growth was driven by an expanded ISG backlog. 
Dell Financial Service originations in Q3 were $2 billion, down 7%, given a number of customers who have opted to use cash to fund their technology purchases. DFS ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in total managed assets, flat year-over-year. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, which, excluding DFS debt, is now fully unsecured. Our cash flow continues to be strong and, as promised, we have repaid substantial debt and delevered the balance sheet. As of today, we have paid down approximately 1/3 of our debt balance from the end of the last fiscal year, and we have paid down $15.9 billion of core and margin loan debt. We are now solidly an investment-grade company, having received upgrades from all 3 of the major credit rating agencies. 
For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, up 9%. And excluding VMware, it was $2.2 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $13.1 billion, up 45%. And excluding VMware, it was $8.5 billion, up 76%. I'm happy with how we've managed our working capital, although we did see higher inventory levels given the supply chain dynamics and component availability. We expect inventory balances to come down as the supply chain situation improves over the next year. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $24.2 billion and approximately $11.5 billion for Dell, excluding VMware. 
Finally, as of last Friday, November 19, we have repurchased approximately 2 million shares. Our intent is to continue buying shares going forward programmatically as we manage dilution and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. 
Before I talk to our outlook, I'd like to provide a view of our third quarter financial results on a continuing operations basis, which is how prior periods will be recast beginning in the fourth quarter. As explained in Appendix C of our web deck, we currently estimate Q3 revenue from continuing operations was $26.5 billion, operating income was $2 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.69. 
It's important to note that our continuing operations financials differ from the pro forma financials we've released to date, particularly in the treatment of interest and other in a diluted share count. Please refer to Appendix C of our web deck for further details. 
Now to our outlook. The macroeconomic environment is healthy across multiple sectors, including IT. Our demand velocity reflects that businesses continue to prioritize their digital transformations to help meet customer needs and improve productivity. Semiconductor shortages, supply chain challenges, heightened logistics costs as well as inflationary input costs are common themes across the economy. We'll leverage our durable competitive advantages to adapt and deliver consistent, predictable results over time. 
I'll provide more guidance this quarter than is typical to help facilitate our reporting transition to a post-VMware spin basis. As a reminder, our fourth quarter financial results will include VMware reseller revenue. For Q4, on a continuing operations basis, we expect revenue in the range of $27 billion to $28 billion, which implies a 12% to 16% growth. We expect GAAP operating income between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion and non-GAAP operating income between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion, which is in line with historical trends. Operating income margin will be up sequentially given Q4 is a seasonally strong storage quarter. We expect a continued net inflationary environment and estimate a modest increase in OpEx as we invest alongside our strong top line growth. 
Below the operating income line, you should assume 17%, plus or minus 100 basis points, for non-GAAP tax rate and diluted shares in the range of 810 million to 820 million. Additionally, we will benefit from lower interest expense given the debt reduction we discussed. We expect diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.97 and $1.16 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $2.05.
I'll provide guidance for fiscal '23 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I'd reiterate that we expect to see growth in both our CSG and ISG businesses. We expect revenue growth and EPS growth to be consistent with our long-range financial framework, which we discussed during our Analyst Meeting in September. 
In closing, a quick reminder. ESG remains an important focus for Dell Technologies, and we have a long legacy of engagement with investors. ESG marries our corporate purpose and commitment to value creation to help move societal and business progress forward together. You can find more details on Slide 19 of the web deck. 
As I look forward, I'm confident in our ability to deliver consistent and predictable financial performance across any economic or IT spending cycle. With our track record of strong operational and strategic execution and our durable competitive advantages, I'm optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for Dell. We are focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize the core and build new growth businesses that enable the multi-cloud future, along with delivering an attractive long-term financial model of 3% to 4% revenue growth and 6% or better diluted earnings per share growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1303

I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the dynamics for operating margins in ISG. They were down 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year despite improving volumes, and whether you could comment on sort of order growth relative to revenue growth for both storage and for servers and networking.",56

Let me sort of take you through how we thought about it and what we're seeing. So from an op margin perspective related to ISG, you correctly highlighted that we're down quarter-on-quarter about 90 basis points from 11.5% to 10.6%. I would remind all of you and remind you, Toni, that last quarter, we talked about the increased component cost that would impact us in Q3, and we clearly saw that. As we highlighted that, we thought my overall operating margin guidance or operating income guidance last quarter was to be 1% to 2% sequentially, and I think we ultimately came out at 2% this quarter. We did have headwinds with component costs, particularly in the server space and particularly with the -- as I mentioned again last quarter, with the backlog that was sitting -- the units sitting in backlog at the end of the quarter which. While we did try to adjust prices on some of those units, we did have some negative -- or some headwinds, I would say, on those shipments as they went out. So that was the principal drag on operating margin in ISG. 
From an orders growth, we don't really get into demand conversations here, but I would tell you that we saw healthy demand growth in both servers and in storage. Really pleased with what velocity of those 2 particular lines of business, which is why I highlighted in the RPO that the backlog dynamic that -- our RPO expanded because of the backlog dynamic principally in ISG. So pleased with the velocity and pleased with the overall environment as we see the demand environment as we move forward.",280

I wanted to follow up on ISG because, Tom, as you said, you made notable comments about ISG backlog growing and also strong storage demand, not necessarily converting to the P&L in the quarter. Can you just talk about the shape of demand linearity, why some of that revenue was pushed and how you see it flowing through in the January quarter, particularly as it relates to whether we should expect an acceleration in storage revenue growth?",78
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3390.0,2447945.0,92926666.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,11,"Yes. Look, Katy, as it relates to storage demand, I think we've talked about in the past that the storage demand tends to be more back-end loaded in the quarter, and we clearly saw that again this quarter, perhaps a bit more than in prior quarters. And as a result of that, we were not able to convert that backlog to revenue. So much are -- much of that order demand to revenue, I should say. So that was clearly a headwind. 
Also, remember that within my storage solutions that I'm selling, I've got a high degree of software and services that usually get wrapped up into multiyear arrangements that result in it being deferred to the balance sheet. So I've got -- which I think is a good thing, by the way. So I don't want to say that's a negative because, ultimately, that gives us a revenue stream in the future. But what -- so that was the principal headwind that we saw, both we built backlog in storage as a result of the linearity, and we also deferred a fair amount of revenue to the balance sheet, just given the service attach rate as well as the software content within the storage.",205

We're encouraged by the storage orders growth because in the most strategic category, software-defined storage, we grew 47%. Mid-range orders grew 18%, which is now the fourth consecutive quarter our mid-range business has grown. That's on top of taking share in the last [indiscernible] quarter in midrange in Q2. Data protection grew. Unstructured data grew, and our entry-level orders grew as well in the storage business. So Katy, we remain encouraged by the orders growth. We have the conversion that Tom walked through that we have to continue to work on, but the demand environment in Q3, we're pleased with.",109

And Katy, I should answer, I guess, the second half of your question, which is around as you think about what's the implication for Q4 revenue. Look, I think the reality is, as we highlighted in the talk track, that we're continuing to face supply chain challenges. And so how much of server demand gets converted or backlog gets converted into shippable revenue is something that the teams are working every day. We have longstanding relationships with our supply chain, but it is a pretty dynamic environment and semiconductors continue to be a challenge, particularly for NIC cards and port cards for us. So I think that's going to be one of the things that we're going to have to work our way through as we go through the quarter in terms of how much headwind does supply chain give us. Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",152

Your ability to, I think, accelerate CSG growth despite compares getting difficult is fairly impressive. So I'm wondering if you can just talk about what are some of the drivers that's driving this outperformance. And how should we think about the durability of the CSG growth as you go forward because you compare that, you get more and more difficult, I think, through the next few quarters now. 
And related to CSG, maybe the margin discussion you had on ISG, could you just talk about margin performance in CSG? Better volumes than, I think, sequentially and year-over-year margins have slowed down.",110

Wamsi, this is Jeff. That's a lot of questions in there. Let me see if I can work my way through them. What we're seeing and why we're encouraged about the demand environment that we've called out and you see it in our performance is our focus being in commercial PCs, premium consumer, gaming and professional workstations. That's where the demand is. That's our strength. That's been our focus. And when we think about the trends that are underway, the do-from-anywhere, work-from-home, learn-from-home, buy-from-home, game-from-home, entertain-from-home, the change in the usage pattern of hybrid workers, what we think is now a reentry of workers back into the office, the addition of Windows 11 and the ability now to move to more mobile platforms and an aged installed base all set up for the demand environment we're seeing today, we believe, continues into next year. 
So we're encouraged by where the growth is in the marketplace. The areas that certainly have been challenged on the consumer side or the Chrome side, we don't have great exposure to. We have exposure to where the growth is. 
Our execution and I think what is differentiating us today is the fact that we have a differentiated model. We're encountering the same supply chain challenges, the same integrated circuit semiconductor problems that Tom mentioned earlier that everybody else is. 
What's different is our Dell direct model, our ability to really understand the pure demand signals from our customers and then equally translating that quickly into our supply base, into the demand plan that we go build to. We're able to shape demand. We built an R&D engine that is really optimized to be able to be aligned to our direct way of selling. Translation, we have fewer SKUs, less complexity. We have a design methodology that has interchangeability and leverage and reuse. That gives us tremendous flexibility where components are and being able to do, for example, fast pen quals or pen-to-pen quals and changing out of components. 
If the Dell model, all the way from its demand engine to how we market, to how we shape demand, put that demand signal into the supply chain, the product model that goes with it and then a responsive supply chain that's pretty darn quick. I mean, what I like about our supply chain is we've digitized it over the years. We're now able to do scenario planning and simulations. That simulation allows us to make quicker decisions. In this time and day, quick decisions equal execution. And then you couple that with partnerships that we've built over the past 3 decades by the leaders that are currently in our organization that go multiple levels down, I think that's a distinguishing characteristic of our performance and our differentiated model today. Does that help?",467

Year-over-year, CSG is down roughly 130 basis points on an op margin. I would tell you the phenomenon I just highlighted in server has played out in client as well in the sense of, again, remember that we stepped in from Q2 into Q3 with the most significant component of cost increases in the history of the company that we've ever seen. 
And as a result of that, we also -- obviously, with elevated backlogs, working our way through the backlog that was priced at component cost frameworks that perhaps didn't fully reflect the amount of cost increases that were coming through was a challenge that we had to work our way through as we went through the quarter. So that was probably the principal reason you see the 130 basis points design or margin differential. There is some mix dynamics in there as well. And I would recall -- if you would recall back to Q3 a year ago, where you saw consumer demand quite high, Chrome demand very high, which actually drove actually pretty better profit margins than typical. So there were some profit margin mix dynamics in there as well that have subsided as we go into -- as we look forward a year -- from a year ago.",218

It's Chuck. I'm going to start on that, and then we'll layer in. Look, as we've called out, our immediate focus in FY '22 has been centered on engaging customers and ensuring that our APEX offers are resonating in the marketplace and that we are making progress against our multiyear plans to broaden our APEX portfolio of offers. 
So while I won't quote specific numbers to your question on customer feedback, first and foremost, what I would say is interest in APEX continues to accelerate, and our pipeline continues to build across the family of offers. And the customer feedback has been good. They're drawn to the simplicity of engaging through our console, the flexibility to adjust based on their needs and the value, obviously, of only paying for what they use. 
The second thing I would call out is we continue to make good progress in broadening the portfolio, as we called out in our remarks today. We were excited to announce the APEX Cloud Services with VMware Cloud, which is available next year. That's another great proof point of our joint engineering with VMware, so we feel like we're making good progress on APEX. 
From a financial impact, look, as you said, we're still in very early innings, and we'll provide much more detailed commentary and guidance when it's appropriate. But in the meantime, we're focused on customers and delivering against the technical road maps, as I said.",242

I just have a couple of -- well, one question, really, and an expansion on that. But I wanted to check, Tom. You said you had really high backlog, I think very high backlog on CSG due to commercial orders last quarter. And I'm wondering if you worked through any of that backlog this quarter or did it remain as high as it is? And then kind of the other flip side of that is what's the visibility now in that CSG and particularly commercial order volume? Can you see out to February? How far out can you see?",100

It is still elevated. And that continues to be a challenge for us as we think about component availability as we work our way through Q4. That was why we called out, within my talk track, anyway, the fact that we saw ISG backlog expand in terms of the -- that elevated further. CSG, although I didn't explicitly say it, came down somewhat but still elevated. 
In terms of order visibility, look, I mean, it's hard to call but I mean, overall, the environment remains healthy. We're optimistic about the client space for the reasons Jeff just highlighted earlier. So -- and as that's reflected in the guidance that I provided for Q4. And also, I would remind you that we're also projecting growth for next year in CSG and in ISG.

If we think about the current quarter relative to seasonality and mix and then your ability to shape demand versus manage supply chain, can you give us a sense for how it's impacting sort of the implied margins and where you're getting better, where it's sort of status quo versus what you've done in the last couple of quarters?",77

Steve, maybe I'll start, and then Chuck and Jeff can jump in, as appropriate. I mean, look, we're shaping demand, quite frankly, to the component availability that we have, recognizing that within the CSG space, we're shaping demand towards those areas of focus for us, which is commercial, high-end, consumer, gaming and the related peripheral environment around them. And so pricing is relatively benign or, I should say, stable in terms of the pricing environment. So it really comes down to can we get supply and ensure that we can deliver against our customer commitments there. 
So -- and Jeff and team are doing a nice job every day of trying to fight their way through the component dynamics that are impacting us. So look, I feel good about our ability to shape demand given the direct model, our ability to have the sales organization sell the configurations that we have. 
And in terms of how is that impacting profitability, I think that's a little bit harder to call. All I would tell you is that what we're trying to do is make sure we hit our customer commitments and that we're optimizing for our product given the shortage in the industry that there is. So we are trying to make sure that our pricing is consistent with the conditions that exist.",223

Tom, I would add, look, our flexibility to shape demand to the available supply, I think, is well understood, and we do quite well. We priced what the -- for all of the known costs that we have coming into the system. We just went through our largest quarter-over-quarter cost increase that we have seen. 
The wild card for us or the costs that we're continuing to work on is logistics. The logistics cost environment today is pretty challenging. Inbound freight and expedited freight, the fact that we're expediting more things, we've shifted from less ocean to more air, that combination of things, making sure that we understand those input costs into our pricing models, I think, is clearly the challenge that we look to in Q4 and have to work our way through. But our component costs and component availability, I think it's well understood we can shape. It's all I -- guess the dynamic for us to work through is really this logistics cost and the variability there.",171

So we don't typically comment on gross margin at a business unit level. I would tell you at a top line level, as we think about dynamics, it's principally going to come down to how do we think about mix as it moves forward into Q4, which I would remind you that Q4 tends to be a higher storage quarter for us. So generally, gross margins improve Q3 to Q4. 
There is a seasonal pattern to storage as you move on to the next year. That's, I think, well understood at this point. I think as it relates to CSG, look, again, we're focused on the higher areas in terms of commercial, in terms of gaming, in terms of high-end consumer. Component costs are going to be the driver there for us, right, in the sense of how we think about the environment. 
We did highlight that we do expect Q4 component costs and logistics costs together are going to be inflationary, which -- so we have priced for that with what we know today. So the mix dynamic or the -- so the input costs are going to be a dynamic you've got to think your way through. So you got to think through your overall sort of what's the industry inflation/deflation look like as a -- we're not -- we don't quite mimic that dollar for dollar, but it's probably a good bellwether for you. 
And then I missed server, but server is also going to be very much dependent upon component cost dynamics, right? And so you got to think your way through that and then think through the mix dynamics. Q4 tends to be a higher ISG, higher storage quarter. We have some consumer impact in Q4, given the holiday season. You move into Q1, which tends to be our seasonally softest quarter as you come out of Q4, then it ramps again in Q2 with the higher volume coming through Q2, and then that seasonal pattern begins to repeat. So I think that's about the best guidance I can give you as you think your way through mix versus input cost dynamics.",361

Can you maybe help us get our arms around which ones are the most hardest to get now? Are they like power management integrated circuits? And what's the visibility that your suppliers are giving you for equilibrium for you to be able to catch up with demand?,59
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3390.0,2447945.0,92926696.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,41,"Sure, Jim. I'll take that one. This is Jeff. Look, we see integrated circuit semiconductors remain constrained, will remain constrained into next year. The trailing nodes are the most constrained, so anything in an 8-inch network is certainly challenged. As well as the 12-inch 65-, 55- and 40-nanometer networks are certainly most challenged across the board. You have wafer shortages that go along with that. I think I mentioned in the last 2 calls, the back end, the assembly and test had been impacted by COVID. That's improved a little bit but still constrained. There's been a number of substrate shortages around the world that continue to impact this. 
And to answer your question specifically, we track 27 different categories of integrated circuits across our portfolio. I think I've mentioned the usual suspects, but I'll deal with them here, so anywhere from codecs to audio amplifiers, USB Type-C controllers, MOSFETs, Power ICs, TCONs, sensor ICs, TPM, microcontrollers, driver ICs for our PC side. And then on our enterprise side, Power ICs, VMC, TPM, FPGAs and MOSFETs. 
So power was one that you mentioned. Absolutely, power is front and center. We are encountering the same shortages as everybody else. I think our team is navigating it quite well, I think, and primarily driven by long-term partnerships. We've been doing this a long time. Again, the relationships that I have with our supply base go back from the very beginning of the time I was a developer here. I think that helps serves us well, doing this for 3-plus decades and continuing to know the folks at these companies and knowing our long-term history and the fact that we talk about long-term design prospects as well. I hope that answers your question.",290

And I won't ask about supply chain. What I wanted to ask about is just like as you guys have executed, it looks like nearly all of the $16 billion of debt reduction is completed. Do we look into fiscal '23 and assume any incremental deleverage of the balance sheet? Or is the entirety of the capital return strategy focused on share repurchase at this point? And how do we think about, again, the bridge of free cash flow to adjusted free cash flow as we think about that targeted 40% to 60%.",94

As it relates to -- as we think about debt reduction as we work our way through fiscal '23, I would expect that there will be some continued debt reduction next year. Now clearly, we have cleaned up a lot of the near-term maturities, but we are still focused on a core leverage ratio target of 1.5. We're currently at 1.9. So there will be some element of debt reduction next year, not -- obviously not clearly to the extent that it has been in the past. 
And I would remind you, as you think about our capital allocation framework, 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow is going to go towards shareholder capital, returning it through the form of what we believe to be dividends if the Board approves those next year, our share buyback, and then obviously investment in the business and debt reduction. 
Tyler, do you want to take the free cash flow conversion question?",174

I have a question on the VMware resell revenue. If I do my math right, the revenue would be somewhere around $1 billion, maybe a little bit over $1 billion a quarter. But if I do the same math for operating margin, it doesn't seem like that business is that profitable. First, is that the right conclusion? Second, how should we think about this probability of this business going forward? And lastly, how do you plan on disclosing that revenue in the future?",84

So look, I would -- to help you guys think your way through it, I would think about Q4 VMware resell revenue somewhere in the range of $1.3 billion, okay? And you are right, as we have discussed a number of times in previous calls, the margin associated with that resale revenue is minimal, right? Now that's an area that we're focused on, beginning to drive up, but it's never going to be -- as we look at it today, anyway, it's got a ways to go to get to more distributor-like margins. But today, you should think about it as not really impacting or contributing in any meaningful way to operating margin performance.  And so that's probably the easiest way to think about it for right now.",131

So this is more of a longer-term question, and I know you're not going to give guidance on the next fiscal year. But when I listen to you talk about the strength in the order book, whether it's in servers, in storage, and you're taking share and what we're seeing relatively, at least from an industry perspective, a strong backdrop. When I think about next year from the ISG side, are we -- are you being a little bit conservative when you think about sort of the longer-term model in the context of what you're seeing near term and how that might drive revenue growth next year in ISG, maybe a little bit faster than 3% to 5% or at least at the higher end of that range?",129

And we expect, at a minimum, that our revenue frameworks will be in the range of the long-term framework that we provided and that our profitability will be in the framework that we provided. And I don't want to go beyond that at this point, other than to tell you that when we get through -- get to the Q4 earnings, that we'll clearly have a conversation about any further thinking around next year. So I'll leave it at that.",108
