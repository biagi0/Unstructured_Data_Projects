We had a very strong fourth quarter, and it caps off of solid full year for the company. We had great contributions from all parts of our business in the quarter, and have now grown revenue and improved profitability for four quarters in a row. As we've said before, our teams have been focused each quarter on delivering an operating income target. We have had quite a few areas where our execution improved significantly. We were vigilant on cost, we reduced complexity and optimized our supply-chain, we expanded our enterprise solutions and services footprint, and we were disciplined on price and sales execution. This quarter's results really speak to the momentum we feel in the business, and we're confident on the sustainability of this performance.
Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter P&L, and then I'll revisit our full year results before turning to our outlook for the next year. Our key performance metrics are provided for your reference on Pages 5 and 6 in the web deck. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $15.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by another strong showing in our Enterprise Solutions and Services business and strong commercial client growth led by Large Enterprise and the SMB business. 
Enterprise Solutions and Services grew 7% to $4.6 billion in revenue, while our Client Product business grew 4% to $8.4 billion. Also, our Consumer business showed improvement and was modestly profitable at 2% operating income. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.3% of revenue, and we delivered record earnings per share of $0.48, the highest ever in any quarter for the company. Earnings per share was up 182% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. 
For the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We delivered 21.5% gross margins, driven by strong supply chain execution, continued broad component cost declines and good pricing discipline, and sales execution, which positively impacted all of our lines of business. OpEx was $2.1 billion or 13.3% of revenue and was driven by increased investment in our solutions teams and sales capacity and additional expense related to our performance-based compensation plans. As we reiterated last quarter, our variable compensation plans are directly tied to revenue growth, operating income growth and cash flow. So we feel good about how these plans are working. 
Operating income grew 61% to $1.3 billion or 8.2% of revenue. All of our commercial and public segments showed improved operating leverage in the quarter. The Commercial segment as a whole delivered 10.6% operating income, representing a 270 basis point increase from the previous year. Interest and other expenses were $18 million, driven by approximately $60 million of quarterly interest and banking fee expense, offset by foreign currency impact and investment income. 
For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.7%, driven by an increase in earnings attributable to lower tax jurisdictions. For the full year, our tax rate was 22.2%. Earnings per share increased 89% year-over-year to $0.53 per share in the quarter. In the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations, $1.6 billion in free cash flow and our cash conversion cycle was a negative 33 days. We ended the quarter with $15.1 billion in cash and investments, and we repurchased $200 million worth of stock in the quarter.
As we described on Slide 10, we are committed to an A credit rating to support our captive finance company and ensure access to commercial paper. We continue to actively manage our global liquidity and continue to monitor the credit markets for favorable entry points.
Also, because this topic has come up a couple of times now, let me say again we have no intention to take the company private. We're focused on funding the strategic transformation of the business and maintaining a moderate share repurchase program. This year, we returned nearly 20% of free cash flow to equity investors in the form of $800 million in share repurchase. 
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find detailed on Pages 11 through 15 in our web deck. Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 7% to $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in servers and networking, which grew at 16%. Rack and blade servers both grew 26%. Our Storage business grew 6% sequentially and declined 4% year-over-year. EqualLogic had another strong quarter, with revenue that grew 49%. Clearly, our Storage business has transitioned from primarily being a Storage reseller to a full-fledged storage technology provider. Because of this change in mix, our total gross margin contribution from Storage has more than doubled over the last two years. We've made a conscious decision to invest organically and inorganically to grow our intellectual property, and we're pleased with the progress here.
Turning to Client. We continue to see a strong corporate refresh cycle, driven by consistent growth in Large Enterprise and the SMB businesses. We anticipated more pricing pressure than actually materialized in the quarter and are hopeful that this environment will continue. Overall, client hardware revenues were up 4%. Client revenue in Large Enterprise grew 20%, and in SMB, it grew 10%. Consumer client growth was up 10% sequentially but down 6% year-over-year, relative to a strong Windows 7 launch last year. 
Software and Peripherals grew 7% to $2.7 billion, driven by strong performance from displays and peripherals, and now represents 17% of our revenue.  Geographically, we saw revenue growth across all regions, with APJ up 17%, and the Americas and EMEA were both up 3% in the quarter. Emerging countries continue to be a key driver for us. BRIC countries grew 21% and now represent 13% of our consolidated revenue. India was up 37%, China was up 21%, and Brazil was up 15% year-over-year in the quarter. Revenue among BRIC plus 10 countries grew 19%, and for the full year, revenue was now almost $10 billion. In particular this quarter, revenue grew 33% in Southeast Asia. 
Turning to our segment level performance on Pages 16 through 20 in the web deck. In our Large Enterprise, Public and SMB segments combined, revenue grew 9% to $12.4 billion. Strong demand, good sales execution and a favorable cost environment led to double-digit gross margin dollar growth for Servers, Storage, Client and SMP business. The combination of these segments delivered $1.3 billion in operating income or 10.6% of revenue and up 270 basis points from the prior year.
Our Public business revenue was up 4% to $4 billion. We continue to see a mixed environment here, with challenging customer dynamics in Europe. Server and Storage revenue was up 13% and 12%, respectively. Overall, Public op inc [operating income] was $366 million and improved 50 basis points to 9.2% of revenue.
Our Small and Medium Business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter as well. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 12% to the highest level in two years, driven by strong demand across all product lines. Servers and storage revenue were up 22% and 20%, respectively, while our client hardware was also strong with revenue there up 10%. We delivered operating income of $450 million or 12% of revenue. 
In our Consumer business, revenue was $3.3 billion and up 11% sequentially, driven by the holiday season, and down 8% versus the previous year after last year's launch of Windows 7. More importantly, Consumer delivered 2.1% operating profit. We continue to make progress in our product and marketing initiatives and in matching our supply chain with the retail buying seasons. This was again the case during the holiday season. Overall, operating profit improved due to supply chain transformation, favorable component environment and a streamlined product portfolio.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Schuckenbrock to discuss our Large Enterprise and Dell Services performance.",1301
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3608.0,103437.0,7075249.0,Presenter Speech,Stephen Schuckenbrock,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. First, let me start with the Large Enterprise segment. Revenue was up 12% to $4.7 billion, led by an ongoing hardware refresh and early stages of new project investments among large corporate accounts. Client revenue was up 20% and server growth was up 14%. 
Op inc as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points sequentially and 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis, driven to a record high of $502 million or 10.7% of revenue. Moreover, FY '11 revenue in Large Enterprise was back to FY '09 levels. Profitability has improved 190 basis points from 6.4% operating income two years ago to 8.3% in FY '11. The profitability improvement in Large Enterprise was indicative of the changes we're making in our business. The first is the change in mix in our business to more Enterprise Solutions and Services. At the beginning of FY '09, Enterprise Solutions and Services represented about a third of our Large Enterprise business and less than half of our gross margin contribution. As we closed FY '11, Enterprise Solutions and Services' mix has increased to 41% of our revenue and over half of our gross margin contribution. 
The second change is better client dynamics in the back half of this year, particularly as component costs improved, coupled with a resurgence in corporate demand. The third significant change is better overall sales execution. All year long, we have been motivated and disciplined with respect to managing for op inc dollar growth. We have made significant investments in sales and marketing capabilities and are definitely seeing the result of solution selling, better pricing execution and strong positioning for robust demand that is aligned with our most profitable products. We believe all of these changes are sustainable into this year. We will continue to drive the mix towards our Enterprise Solutions and Services business, and we feel good that corporate demand will continue. 
As you know, I recently moved back to head our Services business. First, I want to thank Peter Altabef and the Dell Services team on the successful integration of Perot Systems. It is never easy to take two separate organizations and blend them into one. But in the last year, the team and plan has delivered on its first year of revenue and cost synergy targets and put together a services organization with annual revenue of $7.7 billion. This team now includes 43,000 people within services and IT, operates 60 technology support centers in 90 countries, and manages 36 customer data centers. 
Also, the acquisitions of InSite One and SecureWorks attest to our intent to grow IP in areas customers value, and where we see continued business growth. InSite One is the largest independent provider of object storage used to catalog medical imaging. It is a fantastic acquisition. Similarly, SecureWorks gives us a beachhead and security, and positions us to offer more cloud-based solutions. SecureWorks leverages unique industry-leading IP that process more than 13 billion security events per day and protect more than 3,000 customers on a worldwide basis. 
For the fourth quarter, Dell Services revenue grew 1% to $1.9 billion. Transactional warranty support of $1.1 billion, flat on a year-on-year basis and up 2% sequentially. Outsourcing revenue was $656 million, up 2%. We have experienced slightly longer sales cycles this year, but the level of bid activity continues to be elevated. Our project services grew 6% to $190 million. Solutions surrounding globally delivered application services, domestic enterprise resource planning and engineering services saw the strongest year-to-year growth. 
Our services backlog is now $13.9 billion, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Services backlog includes deferred service revenue and contracted services backlog, and provides useful information regarding trends and changes in the size of our services business over time. Deferred service revenue, which consists of primarily of our extended warranties were $6.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Estimated contracted services backlog, which is primarily related to our Outsourcing Services business, was $7.2 billion, up 8% overall, and importantly, includes our new customer signings which were up 17% on a year-over-year basis. We are very confident in the value we can create for our customers and shareholders through continued innovation and outstanding service delivery. I look forward to updating you on our services strategy on a separate call on March 31.
Now let me turn it over to Brian.",723
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3608.0,103437.0,7075250.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Steve. Let me quickly wrap up with a look back at the full year. Fiscal year '11 revenue was $61.5 billion, up 16%. Non-GAAP gross margins improved 90 basis points to 19.1% for the year, and operating income grew 40% to $4.1 billion, or 6.7% of revenue. And we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share and GAAP earnings per share of $1.59 and $1.35, respectively, our best performance in five years. 
Cash flow from operations was $4.0 billion. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business is now at $17.6 billion franchise, up from $14.5 billion two years ago. As Steve pointed out, an increasing percentage of our profit contribution is coming from these Solutions and Services business. Our supply chain teams have also done an excellent job of redefining and optimizing our supply chain to accelerate our competitiveness. Over the last couple of years, we've moved significant manufacturing capability to contract manufacturers. The ODMs now produce about 70% of our product. We now ship approximately 42% of our client hardware as fixed configurations and freight most of this volume over the water. Our product quality is also significantly improved, such that we were able to realize lower warranty expense. 
Consistent with the plans we shared with you in June, we've also been investing OpEx for the future of our business. During the year, you saw us ramp our growth investments as our margins improved in the second half. We're pleased with the results we achieved this year and believe they demonstrate that our strategy has taken hold and is progressing well. 
Let's turn to our outlook for the full year. For fiscal 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 9%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 6% to 12%, and continued strong execution on cash flow, with cash flow from operations exceeding our net income. We believe the favorable component cost environment should continue into the first half of fiscal year 12, but the rate of cost inflation could slow as we move through the second half of the year. We also note that we continue to make strategic investments to grow our Enterprise Solutions and Services business.
On a quarterly basis, we anticipate interest and other to increase to around $60 million in expense per quarter. Our tax rate for the full year FY '11 was slightly over 22%, and we see our tax rate next year to be in the 23% to 25% range. I want to reiterate that our teams are aligned and incentivized for reaching revenue operating income and cash flow targets. In FY '11, we consistently hit our operating targets every quarter. We did so by making appropriate trade-offs and pruning lower-margin business in favor of revenue that delivered higher margins. 
We also modulated our operating expenses in the first half of the year, and then made prudent investments in the back half of the year as margins improved again. We effectively improved operating income throughout the year while making key long-term investments that will drive our performance in the future. As we move into FY '12, we will sustain this discipline and performance around managing for profitable growth. For the first quarter, we expect normal seasonal declines in our Consumer and Public businesses, and as such, a slight sequential decline in revenue overall. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",556
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3608.0,103437.0,7075251.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Dell,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Brian. It's been a great year. There's a lot to celebrate from FY '11, and I'm very pleased with our full year results and the strong performance we're seeing in our Commercial business. FY '11 was largely about building out our enterprise solutions and services portfolio, and fixing and transforming or supply chain to get us healthy and more competitive. We grew our Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue 27% to $17.6 billion. And Dell branded storage now represents nearly 2/3 of Storage revenues and over 80% of storage profits. 
During the year, our supply chain improved significantly, and client gross margin dollars improved more than 40% in the second half of the year. We remain focused on developing and acquiring new technologies and capabilities, and our IT solutions portfolio has never been stronger. Among these investments are the recently completed acquisitions of SecureWorks or Managed Security Services; Boomi, as a SaaS platform to ease data exchange between cloud-based and on-premise applications; and InSite One, a cloud-based leader in medical archiving solutions. 
Our strategy around the efficient enterprise and flexible supply chain continues. We continue to develop and acquire key IP and enhance our sales capabilities. And we're also narrowing our focus on three key solution domains, namely: End-user computing, data center and information management, and services in all things cloud. Each of these solution domains represent key areas Dell has to win. 
If FY '11 was largely about getting operationally fit, then FY '12 is going to be about leveraging this position of health and strength to move more aggressively and accelerate our transformation as a services and solutions company. Customers are now seeing Dell in a fresh light, and we're heading into the New Year with strength and optimism.

Which components benefited the quarter most, and which component do you expect to fuel the continued benefit you stated going into the first half? And then as a follow-up to that, when you comment on the sustainability of results, result is that a gross margin statement for fiscal 12? Or will you adjust OpEx downward as we approach more normalized gross margins in the back half of the year?",87

I think memory obviously contributed in the quarter. LCD is continuing to contribute as well. Just generally we saw overall a very favorable component environment in the fourth quarter. But I would also say that there were a lot of other areas that contributed to the improved performance in margins and operating income in general. Great supply chain execution. We talked about product quality improvements. We have good pricing execution in the quarter, expanded product offerings, and moving into some high-priced bands in all parts of the business. And you see the performance improvement we saw in the Consumer business. So a lot of specific items that contributed to that improved performance, not just components. As we think about heading into the fiscal year '12 and the outlook that we provided, we've talked a lot about, and what we provided really is operating income, so our energy is focused around operating income and cash earnings as the priority. And we're not really fixated on gross margin. So we've been saying this for a while, over time, we've said that our strategy should result in higher gross margins and higher OpEx for the company. I think we're starting to see some of that, and we saw operating income for the year in the 6.7% range of revenue for the total year, which is a nice improvement over last year's 5.6%. And based on the outlook we gave you for fiscal year '12, we would expect to see continued improvement in the operating income percentage. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. We'll modulate around that as we move throughout the year.",300

You'll see us continue to focus on the supply chain. There are areas we can continue to find cost on the product side, pricing is clearly an opportunity; expanding the business on the enterprise side clearly has to be the biggest priority for us as we mix up business in general. So I think you'll see that as we move forward as well and some of the investments we're making from acquisition standpoint, but also the OpEx we put into the business is primarily focused on those higher margin areas that should ultimately drive expansion of overall operating income for the company. So I think that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.",132

A couple of points just to add on to some of the recent questions. Clearly, there are mixed improvements going on in the business that's helping the margins. You also recall that we embarked on a real change in our supply chain about two years ago and have really made some remarkable progress in that, showed up quite a lot in the second half of the year.

The KACE acquisition was completed about a year ago. I think we have more than tripled the size of the business and had really great success with that. We're looking at how we can expand that platform into new customer categories and new capability. And we're finding a great ability to combine more and more offers together. So we have very strong server platform. The storage platform continues to grow. We have strengthened the PowerConnect line, particularly with our own PowerConnect 10 gig switch. And software, to help the management and orchestration of large numbers of virtual machines, recently, we acquired SecureWorks, which has a substantial amount of IP and managing security incidents and has become a trusted provider to thousands of companies around the world.

So I think we'll take a conservative approach and be hopeful that, that's the environment that continues. If we see continued progress in terms of the execution of the team and supply chain changes that we've made, as well as a great environment, then it should be a good environment for us, and that's what we're hopeful for.

I do think we're fairly well aligned with what we think what most of the industry projections are around client growth for the year. Again, we're more heavily weighted towards the Commercial side of that business. So we should do slightly better than that in terms of overall growth rates, and we would expect that to play out for us. Other parts of the business, we would expect to grow faster than the market on our Enterprise Solutions and Services side of the business. So if you can put all that together, that's sort of how you get to that range that we laid out.",128

You talked about the revenues for the sales cycle rather than for the Services business elongating, and your Public Services revenues is about 40% of the total.

I think clearly, there are lots of areas where we have room to grow in the Services business in places we're going to make investments to expand beyond the current footprint we have in services.

If you look at the combination of our transactional business, which is more historical Dell and the acquisitions that we've made over the course of last year, so we've got a phenomenal healthcare business, in fact ranked the best or at the top quadrant of the space by Gartner. We are quite excited about some of the growth opportunities, including the acquisition we just made of InSite One and some of the capabilities that we're bringing to hospital communities and focused on patient care. You'll see us do similar things across other industries. And when you look at the cloud strategy, and you look at what we're doing relative to bringing IP like we did with SecureWorks, like we did with InSite One, like we're doing with some of the pack systems in the healthcare space, you'll see us to similar type plays across other industries, which I think will underpin growth rate not only in Public, but across Large Enterprise and SMB as well.",189

It's 12% of revenue right now.  Great execution by the team, great progress in growing the business, the BRIC countries is driving some strong growth for them. There's clearly opportunity to continue to improve enterprise mix in the SMB business, and that will help us continue to drive high margins there.

The revenue growth guidance for FY '12, 5% to 9%, it assumes acceleration from where we were in the fourth quarter, and most companies out there are expecting stable to perhaps moderating growth in calendar '11 from where we exited 2010. And in fact, the only categories that grew above 5% in your fourth quarter were servers and software and peripherals. So just going back to this, what gives you the optimism that growth will actually accelerate from where we were in the fourth quarter, and if you could be more specific by customer segment, products segment or region on where you expect to see that acceleration?",115

In the Consumer business, for instance, we made some conscious decisions to prune some of the growth we had in that business within the quarters, especially during the holiday season. I think we look back at that as a smart decision that helped us generate 2% operating income in the quarter. We'll continue to watch that business, and we'll continue to make those trade-offs in a smart way, but I think we expect to grow faster in Consumer this year. So that's clearly an area that you'll see us modulate around margins, but probably grow at a faster rate. I think if you look at the rest of the business, we continue to feel strong. There's going to be strong growth on the corporate side, around the client refresh. We think the Server business will continue to have above average growth rate for the industry, and some of the acquisitions that we've done will begin to attribute in terms of growth for the business on the enterprise side as well.",180

We expect that continued improvement in the tax rates into this year. That's a wonderful profit source for us, and as you saw in the preamble here, the backlog is now up to $13.9 billion. And that's an indication of both our Outsourcing business, as well as in our Transactional business underpinned by ProSupport. If you look at our outsourcing on our projects business, both of them saw revenue growth, but importantly, we've made real progress in some of the outsourcing contracts and saw improvements across those. And in the Projects business, we see significant opportunity to improve the profitability as we lean into this year.

You spent a lot of time transitioning your sales force to become more solutions-oriented, and presumably with services eventually being the driver to that value proposition. I'm wondering if you could just talk about how long you think it will take to transition Dell to become larger in solutions versus plain product? Or maybe put it another way, how much of revenues do you think you can generate with solutions-based in fiscal '12, including the hardware? And then my follow-up, can you just talk about your smartphone and tablet strategy, presumably that's higher-margin, how much of that is helping Consumer business, and what should we be looking forward to from Dell?",124

First of all, we really put a significant investment in place starting in fiscal year '11 where we increased the capacity of the sales force, but as importantly, increased the capability the sales force with some 115,000 hours of training, 116 new courses, certification of technical specialists across the entire product line, as well as into the services categories. And so it was a pretty significant effort, and I think you're seeing in the results, in the margin expansion and in the growth in the Enterprise business and in the growth in the solutions space overall, a real indication that these strategies are paying off and beginning to work. I hesitate to put a percentage on how much of our total revenue is going to be ""solutions,"" but I would tell you that looking at the contribution of the Enterprise business overall, which is up 32% on gross margin year-on-year and up over 20 points of revenue year-on-year, and then watching the continued growth of our Services business will be the best leading indicators. And while I can look at Large Enterprise, and as I said on the call, we went from about a third of our revenue being Enterprise and Services to over 40% of our revenue. I think you can see that number easily get up to the 50% kind of range as we look into the future.",240

So from that standpoint, the epicenter of the company has really shifted in terms of profitability to these other areas and away from the PC, which is now only about a third of the company’s margin. On smartphones and tablets, we were very pleased to introduce the new Venue and Venue Pro, which are Android and Windows Mobile 7 based 4.1-inch products. You'll see us enter the 10-inch tablet space, with both Android Honeycomb and Windows later on this year. And we think those will be reasonable platforms for us to participate more broadly in this space. We've also rolled out services for mobility because we see many customers really looking to integrate these mobility solutions into their environments, and that's a source of demand inside our services unit, and we're focused on helping customers address those needs.",162

I'll give you some terrific examples, things we're doing with storage is an example, where we do deployment and we do this wonderful program that we're learning from our future acquisition of Compellent around Copilot and how they do the proactive management of capacity and overall load balancing services with their customers as a part of their hardware offering. It's a wonderful offering. It's something that you can see us do across our entire product line in the future. If you look at some of the new capabilities we're offering where we integrate our server, our storage and networking products and wrap that with software and bring that to the market, that offers a significant amount of services from consulting, to implementation, to helping customers with virtualization and also providing other types of services in the future that we could potentially leverage from that footprint into a cloud. And so I think there are plenty of opportunities to take advantage of the hardware business and to drive that into different types of services offerings than you might have historically seen from Dell. I'm not sure I captured the question perfectly, but if it was how do we extend off of the hardware business and do more in the services space and wrap solutions around it, we see numerous opportunities to do that.",257

And as you look at what we've done with the product portfolio and the client-side simplifying that product portfolio, leveraging our ODM relationships, we've been able to reposition significant dollars away from our client business and into the Enterprise side of our business. So there's a pretty dramatic shift in where those dollars are being spent and to Michael's point, they would be fully aligned with those products that are high margin for the company.",98

Do you have a view on the consolidated stack versus best-of-breed point solutions? Does it matter for Dell? Or do you have a roadmap in place that you can speak with customers about?,43

We built a strategy around what we call open, capable and affordable, and that means that we preserve customers' choice, we innovate at every layer of the stack and we drive for total cost of ownership as the key metric that our customers care about. Now when we talk about open, it's very clear that some of our customers can benefit from how each of those layers get integrated together. And so we are offering solutions that have servers, have storage, have network capability, bundled together and can be sold as a unit to a customer and that unit can be bought in increments of, say, 50 virtual machines or 100 virtual machines or whatever the case might be, scale point nicely with the customers business. And so frankly with Dell, you can get it integrated and you can continue to preserve your choice at every layer, and we think that option and that flexibility is one of the critical things we do better than any of the competitions.",196

In fact, we do integration with our own IP as well as with partner IP today, and you can actually -- I think what's really key to us is we can in fact bring a vertically integrated solution from Dell to our customers in small, medium and large customers basis, and we can preserve the choice that our customers want to make in every one of the layers. And I think that's a unique capability that we intend to preserve because we think it's what drives the best value for them",94

If you take your guidance for revenue and operating income growth to the midpoint, it kind of implies operating margin of about 6.7%. Clearly, 8.2% was solid in Q4, and based upon the gross margin commentary for the first half of fiscal year '12, it kind of sounds like we're going to be on a downward trending trajectory for operating margins throughout the year, to get to the guidance for the year. So I was wondering if you could comment sort of the puts and takes on why the current operating margin level is not sustainable.",111

And as we disclosed in the past, it's 21, it's now 22 of the top 25 clouds in the world. We believe we continue to take share in this space. And margins have continued to improve throughout the year, and in fact, we see pretty positive momentum as we transition into next year.

We've added some significant new customers to our list. Now we're seeing those relationships expand. I just had the opportunity to spend a fair amount of time with those customers and we’ll tell you we're off to really good start, which is the critical phase of any of these relationships is to get out of the blocks well. And we are getting out of the blocks very well with those customers. The pipeline continues to expand. I think what you see us do is more aggressively qualify that pipeline because I think some of the elongated sales cycle issue is the result of chasing a lot of things. And so we'll narrow down the focus to those things that are right in our wheelhouse that we know we could win, and I think you'll see a lot of progress in that regard as we move forward.",170

More than a year ago, we committed to a growth strategy based on delivering efficient and flexible IT solutions for the Virtual Era. This strategy is built around 2 primary objectives: Accelerating our investment in Enterprise Solutions and Services and improving our execution in our core client business. 
Over the past several quarters, you've seen us execute on our commitment to build, develop and grow our solutions capabilities. These include organic and inorganic investments in storage, services, security and systems management. As we transition to more Dell-owned IP, we're selling higher value and more differentiated products, and we're having deeper conversations with our customers about their technology challenges and opportunities. We're seeing significant trends like driving [Audio Gap] to Dell Storage offerings and higher margins for value sold in our services, server, and networking offerings. As such, we're capturing a growing share in the faster growing segments of the IT profit pool. 
Today, our client business has radically improved from where it was 3 years ago when we first moved into retail and began our transition to more contract manufacturing. We're seeing significantly improved profitability across our client...

Sure, thanks. Well clearly we're experiencing some fairly significant technical problems there. We're just going to pick this back up and turn the call over to Brian, and start with Brian again and hopefully, we've got these problems cleaned up. So Brian, could you go ahead and get started?",128

We're pleased with the progress we're making in advancing our strategy, and the impact it's having on the company's results. More than a year ago, we committed to a growth strategy based on delivering efficient and flexible IP solutions for the Virtual Era.

Over the past several quarters, you've seen us execute on our commitment to build, develop and grow our solutions capabilities. These include organic and inorganic investments in storage, services, security and systems management. As we transition to more Dell-owned IP, we're selling higher value and more differentiated products, and we're having deeper conversations with our customers about their technology challenges and opportunities. 
We're seeing significant trends like driving better product mix to Dell Storage offerings and higher margins for value sold in our services, server and networking offerings. As such, we're capturing a growing share in the faster growing segments of the IT profit pool. Today, our Client business has radically improved from where it was 3 years ago when we first moved into retail and began our transition to more contract manufacturing. We're seeing significantly improved probability across our Client, Desktop, and Mobility business that would have not been possible without concerted efforts of our procurement, global operations, product organizations to reduce cost across the value chain and, simplified, improve our product offerings. 
We're also selling a higher value client portfolio and seeing improved sales execution across the company.  These strategic initiatives, coupled with our focus on intellectual property, product innovation and differentiation are driving our business results. Our gross margins and operating income margins have improved across our lines of business in each of the 4 customer segments. We're pleased with our progress in this strategy, but recognize that we still have a lot of work to do. We think our first quarter results again demonstrate the profound changes we're driving in the company as we execute on our long-term value creation commitments. 
So let's review our first quarter results.  Key performance metrics are provided for your reference on Pages 5 and 6 in the web deck. Revenue in the first quarter was $15 billion, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business grew 5% to $4.4 billion. While we did see strong growth in several key areas this quarter like the Small and Medium Business, Asia-Pacific, Japan, and our Server business, our overall revenue was slightly weaker than our outlook as we saw slower growth from our Consumer business and some budget-related timing weakness in the Public sector. 
We gained or held revenue and profit share in most of our key customer segments and product verticals, maintaining a healthy balance of profitable revenue growth across the business. And we continue to believe that profit share is more important than unit share.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.2 billion or 8.1% of revenue, and we delivered earnings per share of $0.49. Earnings per share was up 188% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 
For the rest of the call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We delivered 23.4% gross margins driven by continued solid supply chain execution, a shift of our product mix to Dell IP and higher value products, and continued component cost declines. Pricing discipline also remains key for us, as we continue to prune and eliminate lower margin business that's not accretive to the company. OpEx was $2.1 billion or 14.2% of revenue. We continue to invest in all the areas that will benefit Dell for the long-term and shift to a more specialized sales force. Enterprise Product specialists now make up nearly 30% of our sales spend. Moreover, our R&D spend has shifted dramatically over the past 2 years to favor Enterprise Solutions and Services versus client R&D. 
Operating income grew 67% to $1.4 billion or 9.2% of revenue. We continue to focus on areas with accretive margins and make appropriate trade-offs to trim lower margin business in places like S&P and our Storage portfolio. All of our segments showed improved operating leverage in the quarter.
The Commercial segment as a whole delivered an 11.1% operating income, representing a 340 basis point increase from the previous year. And we achieved our second quarter in a row of record operating profit in our Large Enterprise and Small and Medium Businesses.
Interest and other expenses were $42 million, driven by approximately $60 million in quarterly interest and offset by investment income. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.3%, driven by an increase in earnings attributable to lower tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share increased 83% year-over-year to $0.55 per share. 
In the quarter, we generated $465 million in cash flow from operations, and have now delivered $4.2 billion in the trailing 4 quarters. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 31 days, working capital and our cash conversion cycle were adversely impacted by a reduction in our days payable, which is driven by a slight shift in production in procurement linearity and seasonal buying patterns. Days inventory increased by 1 day due to strategic purchases of commodities.  We expect our cash conversion cycle should move back to mid-negative 30s over the course of the year.
We ended the quarter with $15.2 billion in cash and investments and in the quarter, we repurchased $450 million worth of stock. 
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find on Pages 11 through 15 in the deck. Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 5% to $4.4 billion driven by solid performance in Servers and Services. Server and Networking revenue grew 11% with Commercial services revenue increasing 6%. Demand for blades and networking was up 23% and 32% respectively. This quarter, we also launched our vStart offering to provide customers with fully configured virtual machines.
Our Storage business declined 13% year-over-year, mainly due to declining revenue of EMC products. However, Dell owned intellectual property, which now includes Compellent, EqualLogic, PowerVault and DX Optic Storage grew 11% in the quarter. We're pleased with our acquisition of Compellent and the strong pipeline it's developed in the 2.5 months that we've owned the business. Our Fibre Channel opportunity with Compellent is now larger than where we were a year ago with EMC, and we're confident in the growth plans that we have for this business.
Dell Services revenue grew 5% to $2 billion. Transactional Support revenue grew 5% and was mostly attributable to our tax-based services sold to our Commercial customers. Outsourcing revenue grew 3%. The total contract value of new contracts signed over the past 12 months was $1 billion. Following a year of elongated sales cycles, we're now beginning to see a progression in our sales pipeline and a greater number of deals coming to closure.
Project and consulting revenue grew by 13%, with infrastructure, applications and business process projects all delivering double-digit growth. Our Services backlog is now $14.1 billion and is split between $6.9 billion in deferred services revenue and $7.2 billion in contracted services backlog.
Turning to Client, we continue to see the corporate refresh play out as expected, with Client revenue and Large Enterprise up 7% while S&P grew 1%. Overall, Client hardware revenues fell 2% to $8  billion, driven by weakness in Public and Consumer, which were down 10% and 5% respectively. 
Software and peripherals grew 3% to $2.6 billion and represent 17% of our revenue now. We have significantly improved the profitability in our S&P business over the past few quarters and continue to exit portions of this business where margin rates and returns are unacceptable.
Geographically, revenue in APJ and EMEA grew 15% and 1% respectively, while revenue in the Americas was down 3%. Taking a further look between growth markets in developed countries, growth markets outside the U.S. and Canada, Western Europe and Japan now account for 27% of our revenue, and they grew 17% over the previous year. BRIC countries grew 18%, with India up 28% and China up 22%. 
Turning to our segment level performance on Pages 16 through 20, in our Large Enterprise Public and S&P segments combined, revenue grew 3% to $12 billion. The combination of these segments delivered $1.3 billion in operating income or 11.1% of revenue, and was up 340 basis points from the previous year. Our Small and Medium Business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 7% to the highest level in 2 years, driven by strong demand across all product lines.  Servers and Storage revenue were up 19% and 7% respectively, while our client hardware grew revenue up 1%. We delivered operating income of $463 million or 12.3% of revenue.  
As we moved through the quarter Consumer demand was weaker than we had anticipated. For the quarter, Consumer revenue was down 7% to $3.0 billion, and down 8% sequentially. Even as revenue decelerated, our profit improved significantly, and we delivered $136 million in operating income and a 4.5% operating profit rate. Keys to the progress included new, simplified brand strategy in improved products, a shift to higher value products, a better mix of profitable retail and structural and component cost improvements in our supply chain. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paul Bell to discuss our Public and Large Enterprise performance.",1566
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4015.0,129937.0,8480526.0,Presenter Speech,Paul Bell,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Brian. I'll start by echoing Brian's comments on our strategy. As we continue to innovate and bring differentiated IP to our portfolio, our business is more solutions-focused than ever before. Our solutions feature designs that are open, capable and affordable, all attributes that provide customers with tangible benefits around efficiency and flexibility. This is important because our dialogue with customers these days is especially focused on productivity and efficiency of IT. 
For instance in our Public business, budget cuts dampened spend on the client refresh. However, the same budget issues are having the opposite effect on server consolidation, virtualization, efficient IT services, anything that can drive structural cost reduction for customers given the budget challenges they're facing. Simply put, customers everywhere are looking to do more with less money, while at the same time capturing resources to focus on innovation for their users and their customers. This is where Dell's new solutions begin to resonate with customers in an overall cost level. 
When we say Compellent requires nearly 50% less disk capacity versus traditional SANs, or security can be managed as a service via SecureWorks or we offer multi-vendor support and can do so remotely, then customers really begin to listen. They've known Dell for open, capable and affordable offerings and hardware systems for over 2 decades now and they're very receptive when they see the same value proposition brought to bear in their core Enterprise infrastructure. 
Second, none of our Enterprise expansion will be possible without the investments we're making to enhance our sales and solutions delivery capabilities. Over the past year we've added more than 5,000 growth resources, a 50-50 split between additional sales resources and engineers dedicated to the development of Enterprise Solutions and Services. Third, we're sustaining our flow of organic and inorganic investments following a string of Enterprise acquisitions. We've announced last month our expansion organic rate into building out new customer data centers and solution centers. 
Our multi-quarter initiatives are evident to our customers. They know our commitment is real, they know we're going to sustain it, and they're giving us the right to play as we design new products and services for them. 
Turning back to our business unit results in Q1, we maintained pricing discipline and drove a strong mix of Enterprise and Services business, resulting in year-on-year operating income growth of 24% in Public and 78% in Large Enterprise.
Our Public revenue is down 2% to $3.8 billion. We continue to see a mixed demand environment here with budget challenges both in the U.S. and in Western Europe but with strong growth in Asia. Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue was up 3% while total client was down 10%. Overall, Public operating income was $370 million and improved 210 basis points to 9.8% of revenue. In Large Enterprise, segment revenue was up 5% to $4.5 billion, led by an ongoing hardware refresh. Client revenue was up 7% and server growth was up 6%. Op inc as a percentage of revenue improved 460 basis points to $504 million or 11.3% of revenue. 
Overall, the Public and Large Enterprise business represents about 55% of Dell's revenue, and about 60% of the companies operating income. As our solution focus gathers momentum, we have a big opportunity to drive an even larger contribution in future quarters. 
Now let me turn it back over to Brian.",560
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4015.0,129937.0,8480527.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,6,"Thanks, Paul. So let's turn to our outlook. As we think about revenue for the second quarter, our Public business will benefit from stronger spending among state and local governments and education as they close out their fiscal years. We also see our SMB and Consumer businesses experiencing above average seasonality due to solid demand for Dell's Sandy Bridge based offerings, which are now widely available, good consumer back-to-school spending, and a refreshed portfolio of XPS products. 
In total, we expect mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the second quarter, which is slightly above normal sequential growth of 2% to 3%. On the cost side, as we've been saying, the component cost environment is moderated, and the overall rate of deflation is slowing as we move into the second and third quarters. Despite this inflection point, we're confident in our sustainability of strong margins as we head into this environment.
On a quarterly basis, we anticipate interest and other to be around $70 million in expense. On tax, we continue to experience a higher proportion of our earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, and we now expect our full year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%. 
The commitment to our strategy is working. We continue to innovate and own Dell intellectual property. And our teams are motivated to grow revenue, sustain pricing discipline and operating income growth and deliver cash earnings. As we move through fiscal year '12, we expect improving demand dynamics in the markets that are critical for us. Our strong commercial client business, with continued refresh tailwind, coupled with our expanding Enterprise mix, with strong demand for our Dell-branded Storage and Services and our significantly better positioned Consumer business all give us confidence that we can deliver on our revenue outlook of 5% to 9% growth. 
In our outlook for the rest of the year, we're very excited about the ramp of Compellent and our growing services pipeline, and believe Dell-owned Storage and Dell Services are positioned for above average industry growth. And in Servers, we continue to execute a move to more differentiated and higher value products that should continue to drive above market revenue and strong margin performance. 
As you recall, our operating income growth outlook for the year was for 6% to 12% growth versus last year. Our strong first quarter earnings results are a great start to the year, and we're now raising our total year operating income growth outlook to 12% to 18%. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",419

We're off to a solid start in FY '12. Our substantial profit increase demonstrates that our strategy is working and our execution is improving. As Brian said, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy to drive efficient and flexible Enterprise solutions for the Virtual Era. We're moving much more into the core of IT and into the data center increasingly with our own intellectual property. 
We fine-tuned our focus on 3 key solution domains: Next-generation computing solutions and intelligent data management; services, security and cloud; and end-user computing. Each of these solution domains represents key areas where Dell has to win. As a design principle, we're creating solutions that are open, capable and affordable. This is an increasingly differentiated position that customers love. 
We built a significant leadership position in Servers, having sold around 15 million of them during the past decade. Now, we're extending that strength further into Storage and Networking. In Servers, this quarter, we launched vStart, which combines servers, storage and networking and management software to provide customers with hundreds of virtual machines that are preconfigured and ready to run. 
In Storage, we're really excited about our Compellent acquisition and the tremendous ramp and customer enthusiasm we're seeing for our newest SAN solution. This quarter we also launched our first NAS product, based on our Exanet architecture we acquired a year ago. Combined with our number one position in iSCSI Storage, we're quickly becoming a technology leader in intelligent data management. With our own IP, we expect this will continue to be a source of expanding margins and profits.
In Services, Steve Schuckenbrock has refined our strategy, and you'll see we're focused on winning business where Dell can lower the overall cost of service delivery. To get there, we're building out capabilities in multi-vendor support and remote infrastructure management, security, and application management for the data center. 
We also launched an initiative to invest $1 billion to add solutions-focus resources to build out data centers and solution centers to help our customers as they begin to migrate to private and public clouds. As our results demonstrate, our strategy is working well. We have the strongest IT solutions in our history, and we appreciate the trust and confidence our millions of customers place in Dell  each day.  
We'll have more to share with you about our strategy and the IT solutions we're creating at our meeting in June. We look forward to updating you all then more on our progress. With that, let's open it up for questions.",423

Is there a way to quantify how much of the upside was the component pricing environment versus the structural changes you've made? And then my second question is on visibility on these larger contracts. Is it right to assume that the rollouts happen over multiple quarters so you do have some recurring nature to them? And if so, any sense of what percentage of your Enterprise refresh revenue might be viewed as recurring?",97

This is a similar conversation we had last quarter. I mean, we continue to be focused on driving operating income as the priority. Again, we've seen pretty good improvement over the past 3 quarters, and in general, we're exceeding the long-term value creation op inc target that we talked about over the last 2 quarters. We're updating our outlook in terms of the operating income growth for the year to 12% to 18%, which we think is pretty good progress. So there is some sustainability and a track record here. We're focused on operating income. And again this target is a 7% GAAP number. I mean, we've been leaning on profitable growth as the priority and we've done that over the last few quarters. The teams are focused on balancing that growth, again, with operating income and probability and cash flow. So we're not going to provide gross margin or OpEx guidance, and I don't intend to parse the individual elements of that performance. But we've talked about progress and things like driving to higher value products and services with stronger intellectual property. We've got simplification and cost activities going on the product lines that we talked about for multiple quarters. And I would tell you that we feel pretty good about the progress in the Supply Chain there. We're pruning and eliminating business that we're saying isn't strategic for the company. And then we've been managing our pricing fairly well in terms of optimizing growth, but also clearly leaning on profitability. So a lot of things that I would argue are sustainable. At the same time, it has been a good component environment. And we're prepared for the change and the inflection point in terms of what component dynamics are going on right now. So that's sort of the view on margins. I'll let Paul talk about...",325

And clearly, that would be recurring revenue and we think about it in terms of how we stage that and execute that over multiple periods. But you have everything from that extreme down to pretty large refreshes that might be down as one chunk in a quarter. So a lot of our large business is the kind that we can plan out for overtly like that. There's others where we have contracts that give us the right to go sell over a period of time and we're pretty confident on our win rates these days. So yes, there's a lot we have to help us plan.",147

Your 12% to 18% growth target though for non-GAAP operating income implies the deceleration back to zero or negative growth in operating income during the back half of the year. And I just wanted to get a sense of if that is indeed the way you're viewing the progression of the year or whether you view the 12% to 18% number as duly conservative for the year?",79

We've sustained pretty strong operating income levels for the past few quarters. And again, we're taking up the outlook for the year. We're focused on driving to the 7% GAAP operating income target. Our outlook for the year implies pretty dramatic improvement year-over-year for the total year towards these commitments. And we continue to focus on balancing profitability with growth and cash flow as kind of the priority. So I what I would say it's early in the year. It's one quarter into it. We clearly have some uncertainty in the demand and commodity cost environments and we'll continue to monitor the environment and work to optimize within the framework that we see in the environment. So in that context, we're still driving to these long term value creation sort of targets.",150

Is the bigger factor going to be the component environment or is it going to be a conscious decision on your part to reinvest some of this margin that's above your longer-term target back into higher growth rates?",87

We would -- the targets we've given you clearly implies stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year. We're trying to balance that equation, deliver strong profitability again the 7% target is something we're focused on. And managing to get to the 5% to 9% growth is clearly a priority as well. So I think we're going to manage that as an equation. It's not as simple as commodity deflation or pricing. It's sort of all one big equation around how we manage the business.",104

We've been saying for a while that the shape of the P&L is going to change over time as we move to become more solutions-oriented Enterprise products and services become more central to the company. The investments that we're making are the things we've been talking about: Enterprise, R&D, sales specialists, sales resources to drive the growth. I would say things like G&A we're working hard to basically hold those essentially flat as we move forward. So again, we're focused on operating income growth. And with the margin improvements that we've seen, it's allowed us to really fund the strategic initiatives that are longer-term and focused on the profitability targets that were talking about.

Regarding your revenue guidance, as you mentioned, Brian, you're expecting a pretty dramatic acceleration in the second half. If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, it's 7%. I get your second half revenue growing 12.5% over your first half. You haven't done that in 8 years, that kind of growth rate. So can you talk a little bit about what you see as unique factors in the second half? You highlighted Compellent, but it's simply not big enough quite frankly. So what is it that you see either about Dell's initiatives or about the market environment that leads you to, at least recently, a pretty unprecedented acceleration in revenue growth in the second half? And I have a follow-up.",129
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4015.0,129937.0,8480546.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,25,"Tony, I think as you think about 5% to 9%, clearly in that it has to be a stronger second half. We expect that in general, the market should improve over the course of the year. We also believe, and we have a differentiated view around how we expect to exceed the market forecast for demand growth and that's not just around client. Clearly the Client business is weighted more towards Commercial versus Consumer where the growth is stronger. And clearly pricing and margins are stronger. The Consumer business, we think is in very good shape and well-positioned to grow. And grow faster than the market. And particularly a higher value segment to that market with higher revenue. We're gaining revenue and profit share in key growth countries, which we think are growing in double digits, clearly, around the world. There's investments that are going in and have been going in now for multiple quarters around adding sales resources on the Enterprise side of the business, and we, again, think we can grow at above market rates there with more capacity on the sales side. The Server growth is driven by good position in blades, DCS, and moving to higher value offerings and a higher revenue per box in the server space is good progress. Storage is a bit of a mixed bag. Clearly we have pressure versus given the EMC deterioration of revenue, but again, as you know, the Dell-owned IP is growing -- should grow faster than the market and is going to be higher margins for us as well. And then services, we've talked about this in the past, but it has the benefit of the dynamic with a growing deferred balance that's sort of accelerating here. And that will affect the Support services and the pipeline and outsourcing services looks pretty good. So I think it's important that you kind of put a different lens on the company as you think about revenue growth and recognize that the portfolio is increasingly more diverse, and that we have several places that we think we can grow faster than the market and impact the overall revenue growth rate for the year.",363

We're still prioritizing investments, organic and inorganic investments, that are in-line with the strategy that we've been talking about clearly M&A is an important part of that. CapEx is up this year, as you know. Those are things that are prioritized. We've said I think that we would use between 10% and 30% of our free cash flow for buyback activities.

But your Enterprise Solutions mix only increased to 30% from 20% -- 28%, I think, year-over-year which isn't that dramatic.

So, this isn't just about the volume of units that we sell to each customer, it's how we add the most value. And there's a mix shift within. Even in a client business, we've seen a faster growth in our revenue and units as we have really delivered with our latest generation some real competitively differentiated client products. So we're moving to the higher end of price range and getting more value-added out of that and that is playing out across other types of products and services. So it's more with mix within the lines of business than you describe rather than across the lines of business.",154

So it's clearly the area that -- Yes, it's up 5% on a revenue basis across the business in the quarter. So it is clearly differentiated versus the Consumer space. And we continue to feel good about the refresh as we look out over the course of the next multiple quarters. Maybe, Paul, refresh?",67

We had very pronounced growth in Commercial last year as people were recovering from the depth of the recession and starting to execute on the projects that they knew would have a good ROI. So when we see mid-single-digits growth, and we can see that as sustainable, that saying that we're in a pretty solid environment. And it allows us to work with our customers and pick the right deals, the ones where we can apply the pricing discipline, where we can add real value. That isn't just selling them the hardware, but it's, say, a whole Win 7 migration or helping them implement applications that are going to be important for them for their next generation of their products. That picking and choosing allows us to ride what is a solid refresh cycle and make sure we're driving strong margins.",161

Our total client business was up 5% year-over-year. If you actually look at within the Commercial and Public businesses, I don't want to break down every single one of those businesses. But for example, in our Large Enterprise business, notebooks were up 16% year-on-year. If you look at the Public businesses, as you know, there were some timing-related items there that we talked about on the call. So we did have negative in both desktops and notebooks in the Public business. But then in SMB both desktops and notebooks did grow year-over-year. So you you've got a little bit of a mix going on there, Public versus Commercial in there. But you're definitely still seeing some signs of a refresh. Although clearly, we're coming down off of some pretty phenomenal rates 2 or 3 quarters ago off of some very, very easy compares. So I think Paul mentioned this earlier, we're back to somewhat of a more normalized refresh cycle as opposed to the accelerated refresh cycle that we were seeing 2 to 3 quarters ago.",188

First, when you look on a year-over-year basis from a revenue perspective, Brian, how much of the Consumer weakness is from, say, end demand versus you guys still getting rid of some lower profitable business or pruning business, however you want to phrase it. And then on the operating profit, where are we in the improvement cycle in the Consumer business? You've obviously done an awesome job in the last 2 quarters, massive improvements. But where do you guys feel you are with the whole getting the standardized products and going to more boat versus air, et cetera?",104

There's still refocusing the portfolio. There's still a mix shift between regions around the world. There's clearly growth. We're seeing growth in the emerging countries, and that's a place that we're focused on and we'll see continued growth. There are other places where we're continuing to prune and focus our energy around the higher margin, higher value products. So there's still quite a bit of that going on. As we did say, the market itself is weaker than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. And that's just -- we've been talking about that for a year in terms of that general demand dynamic. From a cost standpoint, from a prioritization of activities within the portfolio, there's still work there to do and as you think about how much we've got on the water, as you think about product launches that we've got coming over the course of the summer that will refresh much of the portfolio within Consumer, a lot of that's going to be at higher margins, improved focus on the higher price points and higher value products in that portfolio. So I think we've still got quite a bit to do there and we're encouraged by the progress to be at this level of profitability, with still that much opportunity in front of us. I think it's encouraging. And it allows us to appropriately manage that balance between growth and margins as we move forward hopefully.",248

Based on my math, your outlook kind of implies 7% operating margin for the remaining quarters on average. I guess my question is what is sustainable about the improvements that you've done? If you could just reiterate those again. And also what isn't? Is there something maybe with sea shipping that maybe wears off? Is there something that you saw in the quarter, was there anything with certain accruals or anything that's not sustainable? Just to account for the sequential drop-off, but also to offset that. What are the positives that keep it only at that rate?",112

Clearly the environment externally is something we have to continue to watch and manage as you think about commodity pricing, which is clearly moderating, as you look at how the markets play out in terms of overall demand and as you look at pricing behavior in the marketplace. So the things that we've talked about in terms of differentiated products and the new launches that are coming, a clear focus and move to higher value products within and across the portfolio. Execution that we've driven around contract manufacturing, moving to more fixed configurations, continued to increase the number of fixed configuration Client Products sold, ocean shipments still is a big opportunity and frankly it's a bigger opportunity with higher oil prices today. And we continue to focus there. So clearly those elements are generally repeatable. And the reality that, as you know, is continued focus on expanding that Services business, focusing on driving more server growth in Storage and those elements will continue to mix up the company.",190

We're engaged with a number of customers on the services side, helping them deal with tablets from a security standpoint, manageability standpoint, and clearly that's a near-term opportunity for us. We see the ecosystems coming together, probably taking a little longer than we would've liked. But as that comes together there'll be some nice opportunities there. Anecdotally, I think what we're seeing is that, can't really find a lot of companies that are going to have 3 devices for all of their users. Yet the tablet, in almost all the instances we found, is a third device. So it's not exactly clear how many units are going to be sold. I think it'll be a lot of units. Gardner says it will be 2 billion PCs in 2014. I think there have been 10 or so million tablets sold in the last 6 months. So put it in perspective, we're very focused on creating the solutions and as the ecosystems come together, having a very strong offering that kind of intersects with when this is relevant, when there are applications, when security is in place and real deployments are occurring. But I'm not seeing this replacing either the smartphone or the PC in large numbers of organizations.",210

It's good execution and we're pleased with that. And over the past couple of quarters, I think you've seen this progress, and there's a lot of things that Steve Felice talked about last year at the analyst meeting and when we had him in the call in, I think, the third quarter. So a lot of good execution. We're not going to provide targets for individual business segments, and again, I think what we said was we weren't satisfied with the profitability when it was below 2%. And again, we've seen nice improvements. We did talk about the fact that this is sort of the level of profitability that we'd ultimately like to see in this business and that's pretty consistent with what we said even a year ago over a longer term [indiscernible].

We're focused so much on having deeper relationships with customers where we're working across the whole span of their IT infrastructure that we're just not getting in that as much. I think that has probably contributed to a more benign price environment because we're not doing that. And that will, of course, applies to the larger Commercial space. And we have more to come to the table with, with our new acquisitions, our Enterprise portfolio, we talk about fundamental transitions of their IT capabilities, and it just makes the whole discussion about what we're going to price the client devices at a less critical path. So I'd say that market is sort of average, maybe trending towards benign, but you can still get in some fights if you choose to. We're just trying to really focus on what is value for customers.",179

We're not going to continue to break that down. I think as you think about the second half of the year, we're one quarter into it. And as you think about the uncertainty we may have here in the demand environment, in the competitive environment and commodity costs, we're just going to kind of manage through that. And I think as you think about the framework that you've got, we're going to drive these elements that we've highlighted here that we think will generate positive results and react to what the market will give us.

Pretty consistently for the last 2 years, we've been very focused on operating income results, cash earnings performance. And regardless of the environment that we found ourselves in, and it has been a fairly varied environment over the last 6 or 7 quarters, we fairly consistently delivered, in fact, I would say consistently delivered on our operating income commitment. That's really the focus of the company and I think that if you look at the ability to balance the different factors, whether it was a very difficult component cost environment, say a year or so ago, to a more favorable component and cost environment now, then layering in the investments that we've made, the sales force, the specialists, there's been a lot of work that's been done here and we've done that all with an eye towards operating income, dollar growth, and frankly, it's been pretty consistent.

The revenue, to be honest, was slightly less than we anticipated, and we did incur some logistics and supply chain pressure and incremental cost picture that we delivered on customer commitments. But I would tell you it's pretty immaterial overall to the results, and we're not even calling it out. The good news is that demand is returning to more normalized levels. In some cases, there could even be upside as it relates to a restructuring base kind of a reconstructing kinds of activities in Japan. We continue to watch components. But in general, we feel like the supply chain's pretty solid. Though we will incur some, probably, some incremental cost in the second quarter around that Supply Chain. Again, I would call it immaterial to the overall. So we'll just continue to monitor it. But we're optimistic that we're kind of through this from our standpoint.",163

But you've got others that we've been really working hard at and we're in the third, fourth, fifth generation of the products. So you really have to look offer by offer to see where we are. But really, the important thing is that we're really leveraging the direct relationships we've had with these accounts. We know them. We, unlike many of our competitors, have one account executive whose job it is to represent all of Dell, know everything they can about that account and their challenges. And so that's how I think we accelerate the demand in our solutions.",206

We've put much more focus on margins as we drive more high margin products. We also, in some businesses that had not gone through it yet, we extended the quota cycle.

Some of this has been touched on, but if you kind of look at what you guys reported on Storage, it was pretty weak overall. Even the 11%, you guys reported for the high IP businesses was down, fairly substantial deceleration you've been doing in those types of businesses for the last year or so. And it was well below -- not well below, but below what NetApp and EMC were doing. You kind of seem to be implying that, that business is going to accelerate. So I kind of want to just get some more basis for why we should think that's going to accelerate going forward. And then also maybe a comment on when this EMC and maybe legacy PowerVault business, it's such a small number here. We're really seeing short growth from that higher IP stuff.",149

As you think about it, we're in a quarter where we're continuing to build out the portfolio and a pretty dramatic shift in the focus. Obviously a lot going on with the close of the Compellent transaction. And the EMC dynamics in the quarter, we've added significantly to the Storage specialist population. As you think about that, just a lot going on in terms of distraction amongst the team. But again, as margins continue to expand overall, even within the quarter, the pipeline looks very good, very optimistic about that. And we expect to see strong growth there. The lead times and this close cycles of some of these transactions is actually longer especially on the PLE or the Public and Large Enterprise side. And we begin to see that some of those deals begin to flow through the pipeline as we move forward, especially on things like Compellent. In our SMB business for instance, we have fundamentally almost completely replaced the EMC revenue with Compellent revenue quarter on quarter. And so those has a much shorter kind of close cycle and the impact of that is much more dramatic in a quicker time frame so very encouraged about that. We do expect this will accelerate pretty aggressively as we move throughout the year as we get past the first quarter.",229

I think Windows really starts to become relevant in the Windows 8 timeframe. There was a lot of activity around our microprocessors, obviously in tablets to get the thin and low-power lightweight characteristics. So those are really the attributes. When you go to the Enterprise, customers are looking at security, they're looking at applications, they're looking at kind of a robust set of offerings. Those are still being formed. And we're very much active with a number of partners to kind of create those and form them. And as that all comes together, I think you'll see us be very present in that market. So it's Android Honeycomb on the tablet side, and I think we're still seeing earlier release versions that needs to get a bit more mature.",141

The second quarter is another proof point that we're executing well against our strategy. We've put a big focus on accelerating revenue growth in our Enterprise Solutions and Services business, and we refined our strategy to focus on 3 solutions domains. The first domain is next generation computing solutions and intelligent data management. Second domain is services, security and cloud. And the third domain is end user computing. 
A key point of differentiation in our strategy is our mid-market design focus, which provides open systems that are highly capable, affordable and flexible enough to scale and meet the needs of large enterprises, public institutions, and midsized businesses.  We're making significant and thoughtful investments to develop and acquire industry-leading intellectual property in systems management, storage, security and networking. Good proof points thus far are the accelerated growth in KACE Systems Management, the broader adoption of EqualLogic and Compellent Storage solutions and SecureWorks Managed Security's success.
And now we're very excited about adding Force10 Networks to our business. We're also significantly increasing investment levels in our sales and go-to-market capabilities across the business. These investments are substantial, and are now contributing to our growth, shifting our mix and improving our operating income.  At its core, our strategy builds on Dell's unique ability to deliver a set of competitively differentiated mid-market solutions. 
Our first half results clearly demonstrate our ability to execute our strategy and win in the marketplace. We delivered very good financial results with first half revenue up 1% and non-GAAP operating income up 59% year-over-year. As part of our strategy, we continue to make deliberate decisions to eliminate low value-added revenue from the portfolio and focus on key strategic areas for growth. There's no question that our revenue growth is being impacted by our strategy, but that's a trade-off we're willing to make.
Our core business remains healthy and we continue to see solid demand for our Server, Dell Storage and Services business.  As we continued to execute on our cost initiatives across the business and focus on higher value products with Dell-owned intellectual property throughout our business, our product margins remain strong and contributed to outstanding operating income and excellent cash flow generation this quarter.
Let's review our second quarter results. The key performance metrics are provided for your reference on Pages 5 and 6 in the web deck. Consistent with our outlook provided in May, revenue in the second quarter was $15.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business grew 4% to $4.6 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.3% of revenue. We delivered earnings per share of $0.48, and earnings per share was up 71% year-over-year. 
For the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We delivered 23.2% gross margins driven by continued strong product cost execution, disciplined pricing and an ongoing shift to higher value Dell technologies. We continue to eliminate lower margin business that's not strategic to the company long term. Specific examples of this include exiting lower value reseller business in both Storage and Software, as well as unfavorable retail and reverse option deals in our client business.
OpEx was $2.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was driven by a shift in mix of the products in our business. We are selling more Dell technologies that bring higher margins, but also require higher levels of R&D and higher selling costs. These spending increases are deliberate and well aligned with our transformation. We've been pretty transparent of our intent to make these investments in the Enterprise, and we'll continue to do so while at the same time tightly managing G&A and discretionary costs elsewhere in the business.
Additionally, OpEx is also higher due to incentive-based compensation associated with the strong profit performance we've experienced through the first half of the year. Operating income grew 52% to $1.3 billion or 8.5% of revenue. The Commercial segment as a whole delivered 10.5% operating income, representing a 280 basis point increase from the previous year. Interest and other expenses were $55 million, driven by approximately $70 million in quarterly interest, offset by investment income. 
For the quarter our tax rate was 21%, consistent with our outlook and consistent with prior quarter. Earnings per share increased 69% year-over-year to $0.54 per share. In the quarter, vendor settlements resulted in approximately a $70 million benefit that increased gross margins 50 basis points and earnings per share by $0.04. 
In the second quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative 34 days. Days payable improved 5 days, driven by linearity and increased contract manufacturing volumes, offset by a typically seasonal increase of 2 days in days sales outstanding, while days inventory remained flat. There's no change in our view that our cash conversion cycle will remain in the mid-negative 30s over the course of the year.
Finally, a real highlight for the quarter is the record $2.4 billion we generated in cash flow from operations. And we've now delivered $5.2 billion for the trailing 4 quarters. And we ended the quarter with $16.2 billion in cash and investments, as well as repurchasing $1.1 billion worth of stock as we called out at the analyst meeting in June.
Now let's take a look at the lines of business and regional performance which you'll find detailed on Pages 11 through 15 of the web deck. Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 4% to $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in Servers, Dell Storage and Services. Brad will discuss Server and Storage businesses in just a moment. Dell Services revenue grew 6% to $2 billion. We saw very good growth from new signings in the quarter that will lead to future top and bottom line results. The total contract value of new contracts signed in the last quarter was $1 billion, and was $1.3 billion for the first half. As you know, new signings in this business tend to put initial pressure on the P&L, but later generate sustained profit over the life of the contract.  In addition, we continue to see increased demand for our SecureWorks Managed Security offerings and added 200 new customers this quarter. 
Our Services backlog is now $15.4 billion, up 11% from a year ago, and this is split between $6.8 billion in deferred extended warranty and $8.6 billion in contracted services backlog.
Our Client business continues to be strong. We have significantly improved gross margins and operating margins, even while managing through a significantly lower cost deflation environment in the quarter. We've now sustained client op inc above 5% for the last 3 quarters and believe we can maintain this level of profitability on a sustainable basis. In our second quarter, client revenue was up sequentially 6% and down 1% year-over-year to $8.5 billion, driven by our Public business where client revenue increased 34% sequentially.
We're seeing similar profitability improvement in our Software and Peripherals business, where gross margins have improved over 400 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially. S&P grew 1% to $2.6 billion as we focus on significant pruning activities and now represent 16% of our revenue. This is a good example of an area where we're exiting portions of the business where margin rates and returns are low and products are not strategic to our solutions focus. For example, we've reduced and eliminated a large number of Consumer electronics offerings. Also reselling of third party software is an area where we would selectively eliminate low value and low margin offerings.
Growth markets continue to be strong. We define growth markets as markets outside the U.S. and Canada, Western Europe and Japan. These geographies now account for 28% of Dell's revenue and revenue was up 14% over the previous year. Specifically, India and China were up 21% and 20% respectively. Regionally, revenue at APJ and EMEA grew 17% and 1% respectively, while revenue in the Americas was down 4%. In APJ, Enterprise Solutions did well, with profitability up nicely there.
Turning to our segment level performance, which is detailed on Pages 16 through 20 on the web deck, Large Enterprise revenue was up 1% to $4.6 billion led by strong demand for Servers and Services. Server growth was 5% and Services growth was 11%. Op inc, as a percentage of revenue, improved 350 basis points to 9.8% of revenue and it generated $448 million of operating income. 
Our Public business achieved record profitability in the quarter. Overall, Public op inc was $484 million and improved 290 basis points to 10.9% of revenue. Public revenue was down 3% year-over-year, but up 18% sequentially to $4.5 billion. Consistent with our outlook, Public saw a typical seasonal uptick in revenue that was most notably in our Client business, which increased 34% sequentially. We experienced strong second quarter sequential demand for Servers, Storage and Services, but see continued weakness in Europe and the U.S. Federal business. We're keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal spend through its fiscal year end ramp on September 30.  The pipeline of opportunities focused on government productivity is actually very good, but will still depend on how quickly these opportunities close over the course of the quarter. 
Small and Medium Business revenue grew 5% to $3.7 billion. In the second quarter Server, Storage and Services grew year-over-year, and most of the remaining EMC Storage business has now transitioned to Dell Technologies. Overall in the second quarter, we delivered operating income of $404 million or 10.9% of revenue, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year.
Consumer revenue was up 1% to $2.9 billion, driven by strong growth in EMEA and APJ, whereas Americas revenue declined. We're actively managing this business and moving our product portfolio to higher value products while exiting lower margin products in Retail business. We're gaining share among midrange and high value products consistent with our strategy. We saw some softness during the last month of Q2 and moving into the third quarter. And specifically, U.S. Consumer has been weaker than we expected. We will continue to monitor demand dynamics closely in light of the current macro environment. Overall, Consumer delivered $73 million in operating income or 2.5% of revenue in the quarter. For the first half of the year, Consumer delivered 3.5% operating income, which is good, consistent performance; about where we would expect to see profitability in the business at this time.
Now I'll turn it over to Brad Anderson to discuss results in our Enterprise Solutions business.",1753
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3742.0,159581.0,10104428.0,Presenter Speech,Brad Anderson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. At the analyst meeting in June, we discussed in detail of the strategic reshaping of our Enterprise portfolio and the investments we are making to enhance our solutions, capabilities and core processes. 
Our differentiated strategy has 2 key areas of focus. First is next generation computing solutions and architectures that address key customer needs, solutions that are easy to implement and manage that address physical and virtual management holistically and expanded options for key technologies by packaging the right functionality and intelligence to drive ease of use. 
The second key area of focus is intelligent data management, which is developing an architecture that unifies storage subsystems, both block and file, and offers advanced functionalities that can be used across them across the data's life cycle. By coupling our unified architecture with the intelligent policy engine, we can dramatically simplify and automate data movement and access while optimizing cost.
We are both developing and acquiring IP capabilities to execute our Strategic Enterprise objectives, position ourselves in the high growth areas of the business and enhancing our Enterprise profitability. Some recent announced Solutions and Services include the Dell OpenStack Cloud Solution, which is the first available cloud solution offering based on the OpenStack platform. We are now the first vendor to warrant servers in working environments with temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, unfortunately like what we're seeing in Texas these days, and we announced a partnership with Cloudera to provide solutions that reduce the complexity and costs associated with the Hadoop Systems that processes large amounts of data.
With respect to acquisitions, the acquisition of Force10 will accelerate our next generation computing intelligent data management strategies and greatly enhance the breadth of solutions we can provide for our data center customers. The Force10 products and IP are very well positioned in the fastest growing segment of the data center networking. Force10's history of product innovation and technology leadership in data center networking is very complementary and very much aligned to our Enterprise and Network division which we are calling the Virtual Network Services infrastructure or VNSI for short. VNSI enables change to happen at the speed of the business and specifically addresses a simpler, more open network environment that is easier to view, manage and control and one that can scale for today's requirements as well as into the future.
A few of the Force10 solutions that exemplify the innovation and technology leadership include the C-series family of switches which is redefining the economics of price performance in switching to a dense high-performance switches that operate at lower power consumption and total cost. This platform is particularly appealing to the mid-market segment.  The innovative N-Series family of Top-of-Rack switches which can host third party applications and enhanced network services at state-of-the-art low latencies for the most demanding applications. And finally, the E-Series chassis which supports mission-critical applications and increased networking availability and efficiency, again at very much reduced power and cooling cost.  We are on track because of the discipline and integration approach. We are targeting to close this within the next 2 to 3 weeks.
Now let me say something about the rest of the business. The benefits of our mid-market design focus are clearly evident in the success of EqualLogic that continues to be a highly profitable line of storage and remains the leader in the iSCSI market. The launch of the Dell EqualLogic FS7500 during the quarter brings the first scale out NAS in unified storage capabilities to the Dell EqualLogic platform. The FS7500 provides up to 10 times more file share scalability than the legacy unified storage offerings in the marketplace today. It is the industry's only scale out solution optimized for midsized and smaller deployments. 
Dell also announced its next generation Dell EqualLogic software which includes enhanced Enterprise-class storage capabilities and automated load balancing. This is the second solution we have introduced utilizing IP from the Exanet acquisition and is another excellent example of our ability to effectively integrate acquired technologies into our portfolio.
Similar to the early results we saw in EqualLogic, we are already seeing very promising results for Compellent. Customers are clearly attracted to the fluid data architecture as evident by our Q2 results. In its first full quarter after being acquired, revenue was up 97% sequentially. Our global sales team and partners have delivered a significant expansion across the regions as we sold Compellent in 47 countries in Q2 compared to only 30 in Q1. 
In Q2 our total Storage revenue declined 20%, the growth in Dell-owned IP continued to show strength, up 15% led by the SMB segment growing at 27% year-over-year. This ongoing change in mix of our Storage portfolio to more Dell IP continues to benefit margins as gross margin percent has increased approximately 800 bps over the past 12 months. And the trailing 12-month margin dollars are up over 16% year-over-year.
The Server and Networking business continues to benefit from a corporate refresh and mid-market focus. Our Server and Networking revenue for the quarter increased 9% with SMB up 17% year-over-year. Much of the strength overall is driven by the continued push to virtualization. This continues to be a very important trend for our business as it has created more opportunities in Services and Storage as our customers are looking for end-to-end solutions to support their virtualized environments. 
While we are pleased with the progress we've made and the results from this quarter, we have more to do and are even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
Now, let me turn it back over to Brian.",935

Let's turn to the outlook. We're focused on delivering efficient IP solutions that provide both efficiency and flexibility for our customers and value for our shareholders. We believe this will align our business with large and faster growing markets, create a broader base of recurring revenue streams with higher profit potential and reshape the P&L for the company. We've made significant progress during the last 18 months and we are absolutely committed to our strategy which is delivering growth in revenue, operating income and cash flow, consistent with our long-term value creation framework.
In addition, we've made great strides in optimizing our supply chain and that has helped make our core business more healthy, profitable and competitive globally. As a result of these combined efforts, we're raising our operating income growth expectations for FY '12 to 17% to 23% year-over-year versus our previous view of 12% to 18%. This total year outlook would be on top of last year's non-GAAP operating income growth of 40%, and would likely put our profitability performance in line with our long-term value creation targets. 
On the revenue side, when we combine the strategic decisions to redirect resources from lower to higher value solutions with the demand environment that's become more uncertain, particularly in light of recent macroeconomic news, we're revising our FY '12 revenue outlook to 1% to 5% growth versus our previous view of 5% to 9%.  For the third quarter, we see revenue roughly flat relative to our second quarter, which is in line with seasonality we've seen over the last 2 years. 
As you've heard from us on many occasions, we're managing the business for the long-term. This is particularly relevant during periods of increased short-term volatility in the demand environment. Assuming global IT spending that's approximately 1.5x GDP, we're committed to making the best decisions for our customers and shareholders over time versus managing to a more variable short-term environment as the global economy heads towards a more sustained recovery. 
We anticipate interest and other to be around $70 million in expense, and we expect our full year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%.
We're executing well on our strategy in an increasingly mixed demand environment, and we will continue to manage the business for operating income expansion while investing in our business for the long term.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",399

We're pleased with our results in the first half, especially in Enterprise Solutions and Services. Our sustained strong growth in operating profits, earnings per share and cash flow demonstrate that our strategy is working well. Customers are validating our approach and continue to turn to Dell for productivity solutions regardless of the economic backdrop. And you will see us continue to identify opportunities in a disciplined way that will generate profitable growth. 
We're excited about our pending acquisition of Force10 Networks but we know the value's created not by acquiring companies, but rather by successfully integrating them, along with continued investments in research and development and sales capabilities. It's early, but we're building a strong track record of successful integrations. 
Both our organic and inorganic investments are being made with a mid-market design focus. This emphasis is driving more innovative thinking across our entire company and aligns with the largest engines of growth, innovation and thought leadership in our industry. When you think about iSCSI, industry-standard servers, virtualization, social computing and new collaboration tools, it all starts in the mid-market. This expansion of our capabilities and solutions is opening up a broader base of the nearly $3 trillion IT market. These are exciting times for our team and our customers, and we look forward to continuing to update you on our strategic progress. 
With that, let's now open it up for questions and answers.",236

I would also say that the U.S. Federal buying right now is a bit -- we see a lot of push outs of opportunities there. While the pipeline itself looks pretty good, the ability to close those has sort of slipped month-to-month as we move throughout the year. The second element, obviously, is really our continuing work around deemphasizing lower value business, and I think that clearly is contributing and results in a lower revenue growth for the company. I think that's net-net a good thing for us, obviously, contributing to profitably and it's something that will continue as we work through the portfolio and mixing the business to higher value products.",153

Clearly had 5% year-over-year growth in revenue, relatively stable margin environment for SMB, continued to mix the business up. And it's clearly a space where you would see us making investments and higher OpEx in the short term ahead of some of the growth with some of the new solutions and mid-market focused product and services. So that's the fundamental dynamic, a place where we're making some investments and that's affecting the operating income in the short term.",94

Again, we say it all the time; we're focused on operating income. You're going to see a change in the shape of the P&L as we mix more and more to higher value solutions and services. That's going to be a macro trend that we think will continue. We clearly have seen good execution in the team in terms of overall margins. I think a lot of the things we've been talking about for a long time with the supply chain, the product portfolio, sales execution around pricing, good pricing environment are still -- continue to be elements that drive the performance here. The client, the component cost environment we saw in the quarter was relatively flat sequentially, which is clearly, significantly less deflation than what we've seen over the last few quarters. I think the fact that margins continue to be relatively robust in the business in that environment, we feel pretty good about that. We think it's a good proof point around their ability to sustain those margins and drive the mix of the business as we move forward. As it relates to vendor settlements, I'm not going to get into specific details there. There's a couple of specific items there that we would have these from time to time, and in this case, it's material enough that we called it out in the quarter. But there's not anything specific we'll provide there.",237

The ongoing growth rate is well below what you have talked about long term for your target where you get significantly in the double-digit range. How long of a ramp until we get there? I know you have to anniversary out the EMC revenue, but it looked like the core Dell IP slowed a bit, too, during the quarter. So how long until we get to the growth rate in Storage that you've been talking about in your Analyst Day?",86

We're already seeing the double digits obviously in the Dell-branded IP, but we just got to work through the tail of EMC and so we continue to be on a path that by end of year, we should be positive Storage growth overall and continue to be in double digits for Dell IP.",90

I certainly appreciate the incremental investment that it takes to sell your own IP, some of the front loading and sales and service, but the magnitude of the operating expense increase over the last year is really significant. I mean, your year-over-year revenues this quarter were up $124 million. Your Enterprise revenues, which I appreciate may be driving that extended OpEx, were up about $250 million. Yet your OpEx was up $500 million. So for $500 million incremental OpEx, you're getting net for the company an extra $100 plus million of revenue and $250 plus million in Enterprise. That certainly doesn't sound like a good short-term trade. So perhaps you can explain a little bit about whether there's anything onetime. How much of the increased OpEx is related to the higher compensation level is on a year-over-year bases, and when we can expect this to flatten out as a percentage of revenue or decline as a percentage of revenue? And I have a follow-up.",173
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3742.0,159581.0,10104444.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,19,"Toni, I think your comment -- we're not thinking about it as a short-term dynamic here. These are clearly longer-term investments that we're making to reshape the business. I think -- we're focused on operating income. We've talked about the fact that operating expense as a percentage of revenue is going to rise in the business. All of the things that we're investing in, all of the acquisitions we're making are clearly in areas where OpEx is going to be a significantly higher percentage of revenue. And therefore, we've got to see gross margin expansion that to go with that, but that's going to be a dynamic that will ultimately continue in the business. Recognize, and we spent a lot of time talking about the revenue environment and what that means, and you may see us, in some areas, make some decisions to slow down investment, strategic investments as we look at the environment, but we're committed to the long-term transformation. Some of the things I'll highlight that really contribute to the growth, we've talked about sales specialists around Enterprise products. They now represent around 30% of our selling costs. We added, in this quarter alone, over 2,000 growth-oriented resources that are focused on R&D as well as selling these kinds of products and solutions. I'd also highlight the fact that G&A is generally down in the business, and we continue to manage this pretty tightly. There's one other thing I'd call out. Obviously, as you think about the profit that we've delivered in the first half of the year, we would also have relatively significant sequential impact from higher incentive based compensation; so the bonus plan in the business that's tied to higher profitability that we've seen in the first half of the year. So those are kind of the dynamics. It's a deliberate set of investments that we're driving, and it's a long-term transformation that ultimately we're enabling here.",321

Perhaps you can quantify the year-over-year impact of the incentive-based comp and whether you think that will continue in the second half. And then where on that path are you? Because certainly, you've front-loaded the expense. And so should we continue to expect that second half OpEx expense will continue to increase from levels seen in Q2?",66

And I think as we look at that and specifically execute on these longer-term investments, there are some places where we'll maybe slow down and clearly make some decisions to manage through some of that short-term dynamic. I think -- the simple answer is we're going to continue to make the long-term investments. And I think you'll see us, as we look at that second half operating income outlook that we've provided to you, make the appropriate trade-offs there between cost, based on the revenue environment that we see.

I think that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years in terms of sequential dynamics. I would say that we saw some weakening in parts of the market in the second half of the quarter, that I would say we've seen continue. That would be the things we highlighted. The U.S. Consumer market clearly, the Federal business is, again, there's some opportunities there, but I think the question is how much of that gets closed out before the end of the fiscal year within the federal government. So it's clearly been a bit softer in the last few weeks. And obviously, we're monitoring that as we move throughout the quarter.",123

I think given the dynamics we're seeing from a demand standpoint in the marketplace, we're relooking at some of the timelines around some of those investments.

Have the hires you've made over the last 12 months generated the productivity results that you expected?

And I think one of the things that I think is new and different is really having dedicated resources that are aligned with specific solutions, and therefore our ability to track closely the progress we're making and the productivity were getting from those incremental resources. I would tell you without providing obviously a lot of data there that we feel good about that. In many cases, we have gates and the ability to modulate the pace at which we hire based on how that productivity's playing out and how the solutions are growing. And it's absolutely clear that there are many cases where we're investing this OpEx ahead of the revenue and margin that's going to come with it. I mean, one of the dynamics as you look at some of the areas where we're growing quickly today, whether you look at KACE, whether you look at Compellent, whether you look at EqualLogic, these are all areas that have significant services attached and very high margin attached services that ends up in deferred revenue. So that ends up being a nice annuity for the business as we move forward; and it looks like in the short term, like a big OpEx investment without a lot of a pay off. So I think you'd see that's one of the key elements that drives an 11% increase. And the deferred balances, a lot of these acquisitions, new technologies are ultimately contributing to that.",251

There are specific areas we can highlight whether it's, obviously, the EMC wind down, whether it's specific software reseller agreements that we've walked away from as a result of margin. Those are much easier to quantify, and those are significant. Obviously, we can put numbers on that, over $1 billion clearly associated with those activities. And then there's the more subjective area where you have transactions and deals that you're choosing not to participate in, which is incremental to that.

I think in general, prices have been relatively -- pricing's been relatively benign around the Client business, and that's continued for a few quarters now.

As we've said, there's really 2 areas that we're monitoring closely that will have a big impact there to the Consumer business and how that plays out. That would be a typical driver of seasonal pick up, third quarter to fourth quarter for us.

And there's always therefore the impact on margins of those upfront investments you need to make to get those contracts up and running. So I think in general, I wouldn't call that out as a pressure that we're going to say we have in the next few quarters here. We're going to have other contracts that we signed 2 years ago that are hitting their stride and improving in terms of the margins.

We saw the Services business at 6%. So there are clearly some areas where we're seeing relatively strong growth. I would also highlight the growth markets, and specifically India and China continue to be growing at greater than 20% in the quarter and we expect that to continue. As you look at overall dynamics of the P&L, those are clearly important areas where we're making investments, but we're seeing very strong margins that come with that. As you think about the second half, we would expect those to continue, and I think that's where we say there's relatively good stability. And I was just saying that specifically, client refresh activity in the corporate environment continues. So those are areas that we're counting on to be relatively stable.

I know you talked about client revenue being up 34% sequentially, but I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of what drove the Public outperformance in terms of operating margin whereas the other segments were down sequentially in operating margin.

We saw nice overall revenue growth in that part of the business tied to the U.S. federal or the state, local kind of timing. We saw good, solid growth in both education and healthcare.

Clearly India and China continue to be for us relatively strong. And we would expect that, that will continue. I think there are a couple of other places where you're seeing a little bit tougher compares and maybe less growth. Brazil is an example where you probably, you saw mid single digit growth in the quarter, and we think that still has -- it's still a great market that has lots of growth potential.

We still see EqualLogic still is the iSCSI leader. And we still see strong demand for the Dell IP. What we did see in the quarter was we had a little bit of headwind where we had to recall a vendor, a second-tier supplier. So we had a little bit of Supply Chain hiccup. We've done that. So that kind of provided a little bit of headwind. And probably the other headwind was we just announced and we are starting to ship actually this week the next generation EqualLogic Controller and new software. And so I think we saw a little bit of waiting for the brand new hardware to come out this week. So I think the combination of those 2 things probably dampened it a little bit. Of course, those that are now completely behind us and so the supply chain thing has been completely rectified and we are now in a position to ship the new products. So I see us being a little bit more balanced going into Q3.",177

So I think we're still seeing kind of the server refresh cycle continue. This is, I think, the seventh quarter of positive growth. We're still seeing those configurations being rich which is really helping the ASPs. In fact, the ASPs continue to trend up year-over-year where the historical trend's always been down. I think this is, again, probably the fifth or sixth period where we've had trending up ASPs.

I think clearly, lots of proof points in the financial performance and really even when you look at it over the last year around our strategy and the investments that we're making. When you look at it over the last 4 quarters, we've delivered $2.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is up 83%. Over the same period, we've delivered a GAAP operating income level of 7.3%, which is actually over our long-term value creation framework. We have improved gross margins by 600 basis points from a year ago and held them relatively steady over some different component environments. We've also added over 300 basis points of OpEx as we've discussed on the call here. And we would say that all of that's delivered in critical strategic areas that we've been incredibly transparent about. So the P&L has changed pretty dramatically, consistent with really what we said we were going to do. And on top of that, we generated $5.2 billion of cash flow from operations over the last year. So a lot of great proof points in terms of the progress we're making, and we look forward to continuing to do that.",203

We're pleased with our results in Q3 and year-to-date. This is a new Dell, and we are much better equipped to give our customers a clear path to productivity-enhancing solutions. We're growing Enterprise Solutions and Services, including developing and acquiring key IP and sales capability, and the result is growing earnings and cash flow.
In Q3, our enterprise solutions and service business grew 8% to a record high $4.7 billion and increased 13% excluding third-party storage hardware. Enterprise solutions and storage now account for 46% of our gross margin dollars.
Our improved profitability and cash flow have enabled us to move forward with strategic investments, both organic and inorganic. Innovation in both hardware and software is fueling our new product pipeline. We're now investing in R&D at an annual run rate approaching $1 billion. Dell now has 5,000 patents granted or pending around the world and has over 20 R&D labs globally. We've made 5 acquisitions since the beginning of this year. This is enhancing our capability as an enterprise solutions provider with a focus on servers, storage, networking and security.
This year, we've also increased the number of sales resources focused on Enterprise Solutions and Services by about 30%. This, along with our approximately $1 billion commitment to deliver enterprise solutions and cost-based delivery options, is making a real impact on our business.
Finally, we delivered revenue of $15.4 billion for the quarter. We're choosing not to participate in low-value opportunities which have put short-term pressure on revenue growth but have been a real driver of our expanded margins and growing earnings. We continue to believe that increasing our share of industry profits is the right strategy. Our year-to-date GAAP operating income is 7.6% of revenues, and our year-to-date GAAP EPS has increased 16%.
Now Brian and Jeff will provide more details on all of this.",309
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3412.0,193289.0,11688700.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Michael. I'm pleased with the progress we're making this year on our financial and strategic priorities. Our year-to-date results are a strong indicator of our progress towards our stated goals, especially in a tougher economic environment. We've clearly made progress in driving to more consistent profitability and expanding our cash flow generation.
For the third quarter, our GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.4% of revenue, and we delivered EPS of $0.49, which was up 17%. Consolidated revenue was flat at $15.4 billion and down slightly versus the second quarter. This was below our view heading into the third quarter, but I'm pleased with the trade-offs that we made in the quarter. We grew in the right places, specifically in Enterprise Solutions and Services, while continuing to migrate away from lower value-added segments of the client in S&P businesses.
As we expected, the pricing environment was slightly more aggressive in the third quarter, but our teams executed well to maximize our profitability. In addition, we faced challenging demand dynamics in certain parts of our business, namely Consumer in developed countries, U.S. Federal and our Public business in Western Europe.
Let's take a closer look at the third quarter P&L. Our key performance metrics are provided for your reference on Pages 6 and 7 in the web deck, and as a reminder, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures for the balance of the call. We delivered 23.1% gross margins, up 310 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially after normalizing for the favorable vendor settlement included in the second quarter. OpEx was 14.7% of revenue, up 230 basis points and flat sequentially. On a dollar basis, OpEx was down $39 million sequentially or 2%, which was in line with our revenue decline.
Given the more uncertain macro economic backdrop, we reduced discretionary spending and reduced general and administrative expenses across the business. We continue to make investments in sales, marketing and R&D, and we're comfortable with our investment trajectory in these areas.
Going forward, we'll be closely monitoring productivity to be sure our investments here are delivering on our return expectations. You can count on us to be prudent with additional investments until we see improvement in the broader economic environment.
Operating income was up 80 basis points to 8.4%, with OpInc dollars up 10% to $1.3 billion. Interest and other expenses were $70 million. Our tax rate was 19.3% and was driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. And earnings per share increased 20% to $0.54 per share. 
Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 31 days. Inventory increased 1 day relative to the second quarter. Days payable decreased 2 days from the second quarter, driven by linearity within the quarter and quarterly seasonality. Days receivable was flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we generated $851 million in cash flow from operations and have now generated $5.2 billion for the trailing 4 quarters. We ended the quarter with $16 billion in cash and investments, and we repurchased $600 million in stock in the third quarter and now have repurchased $2.2 billion or 142 million shares year-to-date. As we close the year, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, balancing cash needed for key organic and inorganic investments with repurchase activities.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find detailed on Pages 11 through 14 of our web deck. As I've mentioned previously, we've had record revenue in our Enterprise Solutions and Services business. Server and Networking revenue increased 13%, with accretive margins and rising average selling prices. There continues to be a lot of momentum in server virtualization. Customers are partnering with Dell to provide mission-critical services and solutions around the server, resulting in competitive differentiation, richer configurations and continued strong profitability. This is particularly evident in our small and medium business, which had Server and Networking growth of 18%.
Total Storage declined 15% while Dell-owned IP storage increased 23% to $388 million, led by a refreshed EqualLogic solution suite and our Compellent Fiber Channel SANs. The favorable mix shift in our Storage business continues to drive significantly improved profitability and this will continue.
Dell Services revenue grew 10% to $2.1 billion and now represents 14% of our business. Our transactional services business increased 10% as we saw very strong attach rates of Dell premium services. The outsourcing business grew 9% and our projects increased 15%.
Total value of new services contracts signed is $1.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Services backlog increased 11% to $15.5 billion, led by contracted services backlog growth of 12%. These leading indicators continue to position us well for strong services, long-term growth going forward.
Our Desktop revenue was down 6% while our notebook revenue was down 2%. Client gross margin dollars are up over 20%, driven by a focus on high-value products and solutions.
Our Software and Peripherals business continues to be an example of an area where we're enhancing our profitability by exiting portions of the business where the solutions are not strategic or are lower value-added. Revenue for the quarter declined 2% to $2.5 billion. However, gross margin dollars increased double-digits. Our focus on disciplined pricing is also evident in this space.
A good proof [ph] point for this is our Displays business where we saw revenue increased 5% with gross margin dollars increased 46%. Growth markets continue to be key driver for the company. Revenue for these geographies grew 11% in the third quarter and is up 14% year-to-date.
Turning to our segment level performance, which is detailed on Pages 16 through 19 of the web deck. Large Enterprise revenue was up 4% to $4.5 billion, led by Enterprise Solutions and Services growth of 11%. Services revenue increased 14% as we continue to expand our vertical expertise and develop solutions relevant to our customers' business needs.
We remain focused on strategic business opportunities and are not chasing those that are non-strategic with price. Operating income as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points to 9.8% of revenue, and we delivered $441 million of operating income in the quarter.
Our Public business delivered revenue of $4.4 billion, which was down 2%. The primary drivers are continued weakness in U.S. Federal and Western Europe. For U.S. Federal, we experienced the normal end of the fiscal year revenue ramp in September. However, in October, which is the first month of the Federal fiscal year, we saw slower spending pattern that was softer than historical norms.
The pipeline of opportunities focused on government productivity continues to be good, but deals are not closing at the rate that we've seen in previous years. Despite the overall revenue decline, Services revenue increased 7% to a record level for the business, and Dell IP Storage revenue was up 35%. Both of these are good examples of this productivity focus. Operating income was $463 million or 10.6% of revenue, which is up 40 basis points from the previous year.
Small and Medium business revenue grew 1% to $3.7 billion. Client growth was lower than expected as we saw muted spending in medium businesses in both the U.S. and Western Europe. There continue to be industry-based channel inventory challenges, particularly in Europe as competitors aggressively move product out of the channel, we did not match the level of pricing aggression in most cases. SMB had a very strong quarter and Enterprise Solutions and Services with revenue of $1.1 billion, an all-time high and up 18%.
The improved mix is resulting in continued strong operating income performance. SMB delivered $386 million in operating income or 10.4% of revenue. Despite facing growth challenges, the Consumer business expanded margins both sequentially and year-over-year and reduced OpEx spend from the second quarter to deliver $76 million of operating income or 2.7% of revenue. Consumer revenue declined 6% to $2.8 billion as the Consumer European business stabilized, Asia-Pacific had very strong growth but the Americas business had a decline as we continue to exit low-value segments of the Consumer space that aren't profitable.
The migration to higher-value products has proven to be effective. Our high-end Consumer notebook line, XPS, grew revenue 207% overall and is now approaching 20% of our total Consumer notebook revenue and 30% of our Consumer notebook margins. Through 3 quarters, the Consumer business has delivered operating income of 3.3% compared to negative operating income for the first 3 quarters of last year.
Our global commercial channel business grew revenue in the third quarter, and we now have close to 100,000 partners in our partner program, with over 2,000 of them at the preferred and premier levels. This has proven to expand the reach of our solutions to the broadest set of customers and provides them with more choice and flexibility. We continue to build a very strong reputation in the channel, exemplified by receiving CRN's award for Best Midrange Servers for the second consecutive year.
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff Clarke to discuss the End-User Computing business and operations.",1508
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3412.0,193289.0,11688701.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Brian. In June, we shared 3 initiatives that are primary focus for End-User Computing team. First, strength in our core. We have massively simplified our offerings with a dramatic reduction in configurations, simplified our supply chains, enhanced our online ordering process and achieved more than a 30% reduction in supply chain cost since the end of fiscal 2009. We have grown our pre-configuration offerings from 19% of client shipments at the beginning of FY '11 to approximately 40% today. We are now shipping 60% of eligible units on the ocean in Consumer, Small and Medium business on our way to a 70% exit rate by year end, and systems going through contract manufacturing have averaged greater than 70% this year, up from 53% at the beginning of fiscal '11.
Second, we are also delivering a broad range of solutions and services. In addition, we have deliberately reduced our exposure to low end of the client business, redirecting those resources on OpEx to higher value opportunities. For example, the revenue mix of Services and S&P tied to the system is up 50 basis points. We have exited over $2 billion of low-value clients across our business and premium products gain share year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. These 2 initiatives have allowed us to maintain operating margins well above 5% throughout the year.
Third, over the coming year, we will closely work with key partners like Microsoft, Intel, Google and ARM suppliers to introduce new and innovative solutions that will resonate with our core commercial and prosumer customer base. 
Turning to the topic of hard drives. We want to express our concern for those affected by the tragic flooding in Thailand. As all of you know, the flooding has significantly impacted the hard drive supply chain but the complexity of the issue and the current state of affairs in Thailand where the floodwaters are still receding, makes it very difficult for the industry to pinpoint the magnitude or duration of shortages, so that puts the industry and allocation environment at least through Q1. 
Last month, we made strategic purchases of inventory and pulled in supply from our hubs. This drove an increase in our end-of-quarter DSI. We also have teams working with the impacted suppliers to manage our hard drive supply chain and qualify new sources of supply. Our goal is to mitigate any impact to our customers in Dell, and our teams will be working throughout the quarter to do just that. We have worked through various forms of industry supply shortages in the past, and each brings different variables into play but we have found our operating model has proven to be very adaptable and effective at managing through these situations in an optimized manner.
With that, I will turn it back over to Brian to provide the business outlook.",472

Let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to remind you that every 6 years, we have a 14th week in the fourth quarter to effectively align our calendar and fiscal years. For this fourth quarter, we believe the 14th week will be worth approximately 3 percentage points of revenue growth, driven primarily by the transactional businesses. Our relationship-driven businesses have historically shown little benefit from these dynamics.
We're pleased with our year-to-date non-GAAP operating income performance as we've delivered $4 billion of operating income, which represents growth of 39% year-over-year. We're committed to the strategy we communicated at the Analyst Meeting in June, and we're trending above our outlook of 17% to 23% full year non-GAAP operating income growth. The teams are aligned and incentivized to sustained pricing discipline and maximize operating income and cash flow.
Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the complexity in working through the hard drive issue, we are trending to the bottom of the range of our revenue outlook of 1% to 5% full year growth. We'll continue to be very diligent in managing operating expenses. We've invested significantly over the past several quarters in key strategic areas of the business, and we've tightly managed less strategic spending to enable this.
Given the scale of these investments and the weaker demand environment, you can expect that we'll moderate incremental investments and focus on driving productivity from our recently added resources as we head into FY '13. We anticipate interest and other to be around $70 million in expense in the fourth quarter, and we expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be between 17% and 19% on a non-GAAP basis.
We're on track for another outstanding year. With our third quarter results, we have delivered $8.9 billion in operating income over the past 2 years. And for this fiscal year, we're on track to exceed the long-term value creation operating income target of 7% on a GAAP basis.
We've made significant progress in building a more diversified and competitive set of enterprise-focused businesses that now represent almost 50% of the margin of the company. We look forward to providing you with an updated outlook for FY '13 in February and continuing to update you on the progress that we're making.

We've had strategic partnerships in place with long-term agreements with our key partners. We've managed this as a strategic commodity. It's clearly an important area given our Storage and Enterprise business as well as our Client business. We've committed to those partnerships over the long run, in these times of crisis, they tend to pay a dividend. With specific to the crisis at hand, we've acted, I think, very decisively and promptly, within 24 of being notified of a potential flood situation, we pulled in all inventory from our hubs into Dell, our warehouses in Dell locations. So we moved within 24 hours. The potential of this occurring into the strategic inventory that Brian made reference to earlier on the impact to our DSI for the quarter. Within 48 hours, we actually had a risk management team in place that began the process of how we manage our business. The ability to manage business continuity was the solid processes and skills that we've developed over the years, we've put in place. Matching supply with customer needs, understanding how to shape demand, understanding the availability of the parts coming in with the pending needs of our customers and balancing that cut in the supply with the needs of our different business units. That's how we responded, we continue to do that today, and I'm optimistic that our team is working through the situation at hand, which is, it's a difficult one of that. But we're in a position where we think we can mitigate the impact to our customers for the quarter.",273

And certainly, we're indexing our solutions activity around those things where there is a strong appetite. If you look at our business, the Enterprise segment is growing very nicely. Services are growing very nicely. Servers and Networking, we had a 13% increase in the quarter. Very strong growth at Networking, 43% without Force10 acquisition and EE3 mid-servers, which is very core part of our business is up 12% and Services was up 10%.

Now I fully understand your desire to focus on profitability and not participate in low-value segments and I heard when Jeff said that you appear to walk away from $2 billion in business in the client area. But I guess the question is how much more unattractive business do you have in your portfolio that you actually want to deemphasize going forward because that's going to continue to put a drag on your revenue growth? So how do we think about how much more unattractive business you have? And how long until you're kind of through that and we can see you growing at a market rate or better?",151

I mean, it's clients but there are other areas too. One of the areas that we'll continue to work through is third-party software. I think that's an area that we have a fair amount of revenue today with relatively unattractive margins, and we'll work through that over the next several quarters. I think low- [indiscernible] client continues to be a place that I don't think we're going to be very aggressive. There may be some selected opportunities there where we can see strategic benefits but I think it's going to continue.

But the implication on the top line is we should be expecting you to grow below margin, is that correct -- below market, excuse me.",77

Well, I think you got to look at the individual pieces. I think there clearly are areas where we're going to see above-market growth, and if the business mix is up and that Enterprise Solutions and Services portion of the business becomes bigger, as we grow share in the higher-priced, higher-value areas client space. I think those are all places we should grow faster than the market.

It changes every day. The floodwaters haven't receded yet. Our risk management team is in looking at the Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply base from base plates, motors, actuators, bearings, top covers, et cetera. And we're also working with each of our partners to understand what our recovery plans look like or their recovery plans look like from building to equipment overhaul, to reinstall, to requalification. It's a very dynamic world out there and with this hard drive situation. Our view is given the nature of our fast we acted, how promptly we pulled in inventory, how we manage our business, which you very well know, but from everybody else, 70% of our business is still direct. We can manage lead time availability. We know what customers have an urgent deployment and an urgent need and match up that supply so we don't miss key customer deliverables. That's how we're managing through the current situation. We prioritize our businesses. We prioritize our customers, all the things that you'd expect us to do to mitigate the impact to our end users. I know that's not answering your specific question of how we're positioned. The team, we believe, we're in good shape to mitigate the impact our customers for the quarter.

First of all on the server business, I appreciate you grew year-on-year but if you look over the last 4 quarters, it really hasn't grown sequentially, so we are clearly concerned, difficult comps. Can you speak about how much, first of all, is in the revenue growth outlook, how you think about that over the next year or so? And in addition, I think you've been exiting some of the lower end server business as well, and how much more potential margin improvement there, there is. And then for Brian, just a specific question. You mentioned kind of a sensible caution, let's say, on OpEx going forward. Could SG&A go for example, back down to levels we saw close to 11% or is this going to be just a very minor adjustment depending upon the environment? Any kind of clarity there would be helpful.",148

I think we continue to invest. In the quarter, we made incremental investments in selling, in R&D, in many cases, aligned with some of the acquisitions and new technologies that we're developing internally. That will continue. I think we've done a good job of basically managing effectively G&A and managing discretionary spending in this environment, and in some cases moderating some of those investments in line with what we're seeing in the demand. So I think that's how we're going to continue to manage it quarter-over-quarter. We'll continue to make progress in making these investments, and I think that's the disciplined approach, to take the OpEx spending in this environment.",131

If you look at our revenue growth, it's been pretty consistently -- it's actually been double-digits every quarter for the last 5 quarters, except for the second quarter where it was 9%. So we're then 20%, 16%, 11%, 9%, 13%. With respect to units, we talked earlier about in the client business how we are prioritizing profit share over unit share. I would say in servers, this is even more true, and I would tell you that the unit measurements are almost to the point being irrelevant. And the reason is that there are many different types of servers. There are $500 servers, there are $5,000 servers, there are $50,000 servers. And if you want to sell a lot of units, you sell a lot of $500, that's not how the way you grow profits and earnings, that's what we're not focused on. We're focused on how do we capture the value which are the higher revenue, higher-margin and more intense workloads.",163

As we talked about, we completed the majority of the integration work with Perot Systems and Dell Services over the last couple of quarters. I think the team has made some nice progress. We've had very strong new services contract signings over the course of the -- over the course of the last 12 months, we talked about $1.9 billion. I think the teams has also done a nice job improving profitability, and we saw a sequential nice improvement in overall profitability of the Services businesses. Our backlog, I think, quarter-on-quarter was up $100 million and it was up 11% year-over-year. The deferred balance on the transactional services side continues to move up, I think, double digits in the quarter. So overall, I think the services again was a highlight of the quarter.",146

The desktop numbers continue to lag in terms of year-over-year growth in revenues, and I was just wondering how you could comment or if you could comment, rather, on, are you seeing inflections in terms of the upgrade cycle that companies are interested in because the economic cycles?

So when we look at the deployment of Windows 7 in corporate and where it is relative to the installed base, I believe last month was the first month we've seen Windows 7 outpace Windows XP in our deployments out of our factories. It showed that there's continued movement and the refresh is well underway. Most estimates have the refresh of Windows 7 in the installed base in corporate less than 50%. I think our estimate is somewhere right around 40%, so there's still quite a bit of corporate refresh on the desktop and the notebook in business to migrate to the newest operating system, which is Windows 7. Then we have Windows 8 coming out next year, which we think is a tremendous upgrade opportunity around the touch interface. When I look at the opportunities of our XPS products, potentially new mobile products that will be out by the Windows 8 timeframe, there's an expansion opportunity that Windows 8 enables around the touch interface enclosing the competitive GAAP that exist today.",176

And should we assume because of that, when you say you're tracking ahead of your Op income guide, should we be thinking about 10s of basis points rather than 100-plus basis points or, say, greater expansion, margin expansion, gross margin expansion opportunity in product next quarter?",85

As you know, in the second quarter, we talked about the benefit from a supplier settlement that affected our margins. I think obviously that's one of the elements moving around. I think we've driven very consistent to sustained margins for the last year on the product side and in total. And again, part of that is making cuts, trade-offs around growth versus margins, and I think we'll continue to balance that. So I think you can expect, you know what I'm saying, that's really how we're going to manage it, and I think, as you think about fourth quarter heading into next year, that continues to be a priority to focus on net profit and not necessarily focus as much off the unit shares.",149

And in particular, typically Consumer mix is a negative for you in the fourth quarter but I thought you might be diverting a little bit more HDD supply to your more profitable businesses. I'd also be interested to get some commentary on the net impact on your building materials from the HDD issue because on the one hand, drive prices go up but every other component probably comes down at an accelerated rate. And then also some comments on competitive pricing, as well, impact on gross margin.",122

Again, I think, again, we've done a pretty good job of managing a lot of these elements over the course of the last year or a year -- more longer. I think as you look at the fourth quarter, you did hit some of the points. We've highlighted the fact that the pricing environment has tended to be slightly more aggressive than what we've seeing over the last few quarters. I think that will -- obviously, we're watching that and we're trying to make sure that we manage for profit. There are places where we haven't necessarily jumped into some of those aggressive pricing dynamics. I think when we look at component prices, clearly we would expect the price per drive on the hard disk side to go up. We're seeing that, and I think the reality is that when you look at the overall aggregate component cost for the quarter, there's enough other inflation in other components that's going to more than offset that, is our current view. So we should see that deflation, albeit relatively small, within the quarter. That's how we're thinking about it right now. Consumer mix has traditionally been a bit of a headwind in the fourth quarter. I think given how we've been managing the Consumer business and the kind of business that we're taking in Consumer, I'm not sure that's going to be the biggest challenge we have. So a lot of sustainable improvements in the supply chain, that Jeff talked about, that will continue to contribute. And you put all these things together, and again, we're trying to manage consistently and sustain high margins and that's, I think, what you can expect in the fourth quarter.",292

I think we did more than that the first half, by really higher cash flow generation and our ability to raise capital at favorable terms at the time.

Or was the price aggression more broad across the Enterprise segment as well? And then also was it specific to any geographies?",61

I mean, clearly, the challenge in Europe, there were some challenges in terms of moving inventory through that channel, and I think we concluded we weren't going to match pricing in that space, and that affected our growth. I think that there were other areas. As you look at, for instance, midrange storage, as you look at, as Michael highlighted, higher volume server opportunities, those are all places we've seen more aggressive pricing.",84

But do you think we can actually see OpEx continue to come down sequentially, understanding that fourth quarter has the extra week and so there will be a little bit of a blip in 4Q but beyond that, do you think that you can bring operating expense down sequentially as you rationalize some of those projects?",84

I think we continue to make investments, and I think you're going to see some areas where we increase OpEx and other areas where we continue to reduce and take costs out of less strategic areas. So it will be a bit of a mix. Clearly, you have the 14th week that will put pressure in the fourth quarter, no question on that.",69

We're feeling really great about the Networking business, we had 43% growth without Force10 and 83% with the addition of Force10. And the real play here for us, of course, is changing the conversation from a server conversation to server, storage, networking and orchestration software in the whole data center. And given the number of servers that we sell, there's a lot of pull that we can drive in our Networking business and certainly our ambition is to go beyond switching and you'll have to stay tuned for future announcements.",91

What sort of impact will that have on OpEx and EPS line in the Jan quarter?,28

That's recognizing that the transactional business likely will provide incremental revenue during that period. We don't expect a big impact from the relationship business. There are some other dynamics obviously playing out. One would be the Chinese New Year timing and that impact on the supply chain as well as Asian customer demand during really the 13th week of our quarter, we think also has some impact. I'm not going to provide any real input in terms of the OpEx dynamics and what we're going to see in other parts of the P&L.",123
