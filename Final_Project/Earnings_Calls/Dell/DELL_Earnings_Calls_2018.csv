Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.
We posted our fourth quarter press release and web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Full year fiscal 2018 financial results will be filed on Form 10-K on Thursday, March 29. I'd like to highlight a few items related to this quarter's results. 
Beginning in Q4, we now have fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results. So unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change. Please note that Q4 of fiscal 2017 was a 14-week quarter as compared to this year's 13-week quarter in Q4. Also note that all financial results reported today are based on our historical revenue standard, ASC 605, and do not reflect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. We intend to hold a separate call for investors in late April to walk through the impact of ASC 606 adoption and provide restated financial information. 
During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in the supplemental material in our web deck and the tables accompanying our press release. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes -- excuse me, excludes approximately $2.4 billion of adjustments, and our full year non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $10.2 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. There will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the non-GAAP noncash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 21 for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. 
I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Finally, before I turn it over to Tom, I want to address the amended 13D we filed on February 2, disclosing that the Dell Technologies' Board of Directors is evaluating a number of potential business opportunities. This is part of our ongoing multiyear strategic planning, and we are doing this from a position of strength. We are leaders in 21 of the top market share categories, and we have leadership in 13 Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. 
As Tom will discuss in his remarks, we're in solid financial condition with the strong cash flow generation, and we have made significant progress on paying down debt. With that said, we will not address the filing any further or take questions related to this topic. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom.",537

I was pleased with our results for fiscal 2018 as we have made significant progress in a number of areas. We drove strong top line velocity, delivering revenue of $80 billion for the year, and we saw revenue and profit momentum improve as we move through the year, all while navigating through one of the toughest component cost environments we've seen. 
We delivered strong operating cash flow of $6.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 billion, allowing us to make good progress on delevering, paying down $10 billion of gross debt since the closing of the EMC transaction. The teams did a good job on integration, and we're seeing strong coordination across the entire Dell Technologies family. This collaboration is paying off with better-than-expected revenue synergies and strong customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. 
We increased our global coverage by investing significantly in our sales team and channel program, and we've made changes in the Infrastructure Solutions Group that Jeff will discuss in more detail. 
Now let me turn to results for the fourth quarter. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $21.9 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $320 million. Non-GAAP revenue was up 8% to $22.2 billion, with strong top line velocity for client, servers and VMware, along with improving demand for storage. Gross margin was $7 billion, up 6% and was 31.6% of revenue, which was down 40 basis points, driven by mixed dynamics within ISG given the strength we've seen in servers. 
OpEx was $4.9 billion, up 3% and was 22.1% of revenue, which was down 100 basis points as we continue to drive OpEx discipline across the business even as we selectively invest in growth opportunities. Operating income was up 15% to $2.1 billion or 9.5% of revenue, up 50 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 13% to $2.5 billion or 11.1% of revenue. Please see Slide 22 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. 
Deferred revenue was $22.2 billion, up $3.6 billion year-over-year and up $2.2 billion, sequentially, driven by growth in maintenance, flexible consumption models, and extended warranty. Specific to flexible consumption models, we continued to respond to customers' request for choice in how they procure and utilize our solutions. Though the revenue and margin is not immediately recognized, these arrangements will provide a more predictable long-term recurring revenue and profit stream. 
Before I jump into segment results, let me make a couple of additional comments. First, as we've seen in prior years, Q1 is typically down sequentially given the seasonal patterns of the business. We also see a use of cash in the first quarter given historical seasonal patterns. Looking at historical trends, we then build momentum through the remainder of the year. 
Second, I also want to touch on tax reform. As you know, a comprehensive tax reform bill was passed in December. We view tax reform as a positive for the overall U.S. economy and IT spending. Due to the complex nature of the tax reform bill, it requires extensive tax analysis, and the government continues to issue guidance and clarifications. Today, I will provide our estimates of the impact that are based on our current analysis of the new tax rules. 
During the fourth quarter, we recorded a benefit of $316 million for the net impact of tax reform driven by a benefit of $1.3 billion related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset, in part, by current and future income tax expenses of approximately $1 billion related to the transition tax. The cash tax impact to the repatriation toll charge will be substantially offset by other tax attributes. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform on our effective tax rate. Given what we know today, our expectation is that tax reform will not materially change our effective tax rate as the positive impact should roughly offset the negative impacts when fully interpreted and implemented. 
Now let me give you a summary view of the financial performance of our business segments for the fourth quarter. Revenue for our Infrastructure Solutions Group was $8.8 billion, up 5%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by servers and networking, which were up 27% to $4.6 billion. Servers delivered its third consecutive quarter of record revenue, with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers as we continue to see strong demand for PowerEdge servers along with ongoing expansion of our server average selling prices. 
Storage revenue was $4.2 billion and was down 11%. But for the first time since the transaction closed, storage demand grew year-over-year. One of the drivers behind the variance between demand and reported results is due to deferred revenue primarily related to maintenance and our flexible consumption models. We are encouraged that we exited the quarter with better storage velocity on a demand basis, and we expect a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as the actions and investments we put in place this year gain traction. 
Operating income for ISG was $748 million or 8.5% of revenue, which is a 350 basis point decline over the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of servers and, to a lesser extent, higher component costs. We are focused on improving the overall profitability of the business, balancing velocity and profitability in servers while growing storage and data protection. 
Revenue for our Client Solutions Group was $10.6 billion, up 8%, driven by higher average selling prices across both commercial and consumer and double-digit growth in client, software and peripherals. 
Commercial revenue grew 9% due to average selling price expansion for notebooks and workstations as well as double-digit revenue growth in displays. Consumer revenue was up 6%, driven by growth in average selling prices for both notebooks and XPS products. CSG operating income was up 70% to $581 million, which is a -- which was 5.5% of revenue, as the team did a good job of offsetting component cost headwinds through repricing and also focused on attaching higher-margin services in SMP. 
VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue for the VMware segment was up 20% to $2.3 billion and operating income was $834 million or 35.8% of revenue. Revenue from our other businesses, which include SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $492 million, which was up 3%. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We had strong cash flow generation in Q4 as cash from operations was $3.1 billion, predominantly due to improved overall profitability and the seasonal increase in maintenance and services contracts, which are paid upfront. Our cash and investments balance was $20.3 billion, up approximately $2.3 billion versus the prior quarter. 
On the debt side, since closing the transaction, we've paid down $10 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS debt, and remained fully committed to delevering the balance sheet. During Q4, we paid down approximately $300 million in debt, ending the quarter with $52.7 billion in total debt. Total debt is $200 million higher than the prior quarter due to an increase of approximately $450 million in DFS debt. 
Core debt ended the quarter at $39.9 billion, down from $48.8 billion at the time we closed the EMC transaction. As a reminder, core debt excludes DFS-related debt, unrestricted subsidiary debt and the margin loan and is aligned with how we present the capital structure to the rating agencies for leverage discussions. For additional detail on what is included or excluded in our debt balances, please see Slide 9 of the web deck. 
Demand for financial services is strong across the Dell Technologies family. In Q4, DFS originations were approximately $1.9 billion, up 23%. As of the end of fiscal 2018, financing receivables now stand at $7.6 billion, up 30%. As we've discussed on prior calls, the growth in financing receivables drives an increase in our DFS debt as we continue to fund the business. 
Now let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG.",1335
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395714.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom. We ended the year on a high note, with improved performance across the business in the fourth quarter. Client, servers, hyperconverged infrastructure and our all-flash products have continued the strong growth trajectory we've seen in prior quarters, and we saw improvement in the traditional storage demand as we exited the year. 
Since we last spoke in December, we've already made changes that set us up for success moving forward. We simplified the ISG organization, aligning leaders and product categories more effectively for improved speed and accountability. We've already started to simplify our product offerings in how to go to market. For example, we will be aligning our software-defined storage strategy to VSAN, offering VxRail and VxRack SDDC. 
We started shipping the enhanced midrange storage products we announced in November and expanded the Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program to all of our storage products shortly after it launched. 
Lastly, we've increased collaboration across our strategically aligned businesses to leverage our collective strength and to build better solutions for things like cloud, software-defined storage, software-defined data center, infrastructure as a service and hyperconverged infrastructure. A simpler organization with simpler portfolios and targeted solutions means faster decisions and faster innovation. It also promotes faster go to -- it also promotes a faster go-to-market engine, benefiting both businesses and our customers. 
Looking at the full fiscal year 2018 results for ISG and CSG, they were solid overall with a few areas that we are addressing. External feedback has been positive, with a survey conducted by IDC finding that 91% of customers say that Dell and EMC have delivered on our premerger promises. It's clear the Dell Technologies' value proposition of leading the digital, IT, security and workforce transformation is resonating with customers, partners and industry analysts. We recognize that we have some areas that need focus, and we are working to improve as we move into FY '19. Let me touch on some of the highlights. 
For the full year, CSG delivered excellent results, reporting revenue of $39.5 billion, which was up 7%. Operating income of $2.2 billion was up 19% and was 5.6% of revenue. We had a record holiday season in consumer, and the investments we've made in clients are paying off as premium notebooks, including workstations, latitudes and XPS, all grew double digits in FY '18, and we saw double-digit growth in demand for gaming and rugged notebooks. 
We received a record-high 87 awards at CES this year, which was our fourth year in a row of setting a record. In calendar Q4, we delivered our 20th straight quarter of year-over-year worldwide PC unit share gains. That said, our growth premium has slowed the past 2 quarters. So we're focused on driving higher relative unit growth and consolidating market while maintaining profitability in FY '19. As Tom mentioned, client SMP saw a good growth this year, driven by double-digit growth in displays and also in peripherals, which includes items like docking stations. 
Dell continues to be the #1 display provider in the world and gained 110 basis points of unit share on a year-over-year basis based on calendar Q3 from display search. 
ISG performance was mixed this past year. Revenue for the fiscal year was $30.7 billion and above our expectations, while operating income was $2.2 billion or 7.1% of revenue, which was below our expectations. 
Servers and networking revenue was $15.4 billion, up 20%. FY '18 was a record year for servers for revenue and units. It was the second time we've shipped 2 million servers in a year. Q4 marked the third consecutive quarter of record revenue, and we continue to see strong unit growth for both PowerEdge and cloud servers. We saw higher ASPs for servers as we continued to see more richly configured servers, the ramped up 14th generation PowerEdge server, and we've effectively managed pricing to partially mitigate the ongoing memory cost inflation. 
In Q3, we became the worldwide leader for x86 servers based on both units and revenue, and we finished the calendar year at the #1 spot for both categories for x86 according to IDC. This is the first time since we've entered the server market that we've been the undisputed market leader. 
Moving to storage. Revenue was $15.3 billion for the full year. Our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio saw triple-digit demand growth with strength in VxRail, while demand for our Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays grew double digits over the year. Our all-flash business exited the year at a demand rate of nearly $5 billion, and we remain the undisputed leader in all-flash arrays with nearly 1/3 of the worldwide revenue market share. 
As we've discussed on previous calls, traditional storage and data protection were challenged, both on a financial results and market share, and we are laser-focused on improving this business. We made investments and have implemented action plans over the past few months to improve storage growth, particularly in midrange, and we expect the benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year. 
Looking forward, we want to build on the momentum and velocity we've seen while we continue to drive hard against the operational improvements. Our priorities for FY '19 are to: continue to deliver world-class quality and service; reduce the complexity of the portfolio -- or excuse me, reduce complexity across the portfolio; accelerate storage and data protection velocity; maintain server velocity while improving profitability; ramp sales productivity, which will be a multiquarter journey; and accelerate client unit velocity with market consolidation while maintaining profitability.
The technology and market trends plays directly into our hands, and we're positioned to win. We have the right strategy, the right team and an unmatched portfolio to lead our customers on this journey through their digital future.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.",967

We made solid progress and leaned in to some challenges in fiscal '18. Overall, we feel good about our performance against the 4 strategic goals we laid out at the April Analyst Meeting. We made strides to drive client, server and services velocity and grew at or above market in multiple areas of the business. And the team navigated through some tough component cost headwinds. We generated strong cash flow and successfully delivered working capital efficiencies, allowing us to make great progress on delevering the balance sheet. We are well into the integration efforts, but we still have more work to do related to product positioning and solutions as well as systems and tools. 
Finally, we brought the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to customers in a more comprehensive and seamless experience, and this is resonating with our customers. As we move forward into fiscal '19, we want to continue to execute our strategy in order to fully embrace the opportunities we see. We believe the macroenvironment and the IT market are setting up to be stronger as global economic sentiment has improved and GDP expectations have grown.
The U.S. tax reform changes has had -- have had a positive impact on expectations for capital expenditures, and customers are being driven towards digital transformation, which requires more compute from the edge to the core to the cloud and requires more capacity, storage, data protection and security, all of which are good for our business. We must improve a few areas of the business to strengthen our position and take advantage of these factors. With that in mind, let me outline our 4 strategic areas of focus for fiscal '19. 
The first 2 haven't changed that much from fiscal '18. We want to continue growing above the market and drive share gains, with particular focus on storage and client. And we have to continue to generate strong cash flows and delever the balance sheet. The third goal is capturing the priorities that Jeff outlined during his remarks. We need to drive profitability in ISG as we balance server velocity and profitability and accelerate storage and data protection velocity. The last goal is to continue to delight customers by listening to and addressing their needs for their digital transformation journey through our full range of capabilities. 
In closing, we believe we have the right strategy, and given the market trends, we feel good about our position headed into fiscal '19, as we focus on executing the business model and serving our customers.

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395724.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,13,"Well, let me start and then Jeff will probably give you some more insights. So as we think about the business for the coming year in the market segment, so look, I mean, if you think about PCs, for instance, right, you would -- IDC would say that the marketing calendar '18 is roughly a minus 1.5, 1.7, although commercial client -- commercial will be up marginally. So pretty much sort of that status quo, if you think about what's been going on in the market of late. On the server market, particularly in the mainstream servers, IDC says 2.1% growth for next year, which is slightly down from where it is -- where it ended in the fourth quarter, or I guess, it's flat with the fourth quarter. In terms of where we are, in terms of those cycles -- and I'll get to storage in a second -- so look, we feel pretty good about the velocity in the server business right now. I mean, there's clearly a -- we believe that the industry dynamics and trends are coming our way around more compute-centric platforms. Also feel really good about where we are with our PC offerings and our commercial client offerings. And as Jeff mentioned, the thin and light, the gaming capabilities, the XPS products and the new latitude lines, and so we feel like we're pretty well covered there. The market looks relatively stable. The macros look relatively stable. So we'll have to see how that progresses. In the storage market, and maybe Jeff can add some insight there for us, is it's forecasted to be about a flat market, although you're supposed to -- IDC would say there's growth in the midrange and continued softness on the high-end although not as soft in the high end as it was this year. So that's clearly an area of focus for us as we position and think our way through how do we drive storage velocity and data protection velocity, so.",334

We would look at PC growth to be in the low negative single digits; consumer, more negative; the commercial, slightly positive, commercial notebooks being the shining spot of the PC business, which we have tremendous focus on. I look at the x86 business to be -- x86 server business to be in the low single digits of positive growth. The storage market, as Tom said, is roughly flat. So our external storage marketplace is there. Within that, I think there's clearly the midrange that Tom called out and also the all-flash growth opportunity, which we are a market leader in that category. And then the hyperconverged category continues to grow in low double digits.",124

But what I'd like to do is ask you a little bit about prioritization, how you think about prioritization, where you want your cash flows to go given the status quo. You've got -- the bulk of the cash is at VMware today. The bulk of the cash from operations is being generated by VMware today. And you've got some debt coming due, and you've also got the tracking stock, which looks pretty attractive because it's selling at such a discount. Then you probably got some changes in how you have to pay taxes given some of the changes in the tax laws and repatriation of some of that cash. So could you just sort of give us a holistic view, Tom, of how you're prioritizing debt repaydown, buying of tracker, paying taxes and where you think you're going to be able to get that cash from to do all of those things.",163
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395728.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,17,"Tom, let me -- I'm happy to address that, and let me just start with this. We think about our cash flow from operations, which was roughly about $6.8 billion this last year. $3.2 billion of that was VMware. So roughly $3.4 billion was the core Dell, Dell EMC. We do expect, and we don't give guidance, but we do expect that, that will continue to expand as we continue to execute on our storage strategy and as we continue to execute on some of the priorities that we laid out in the call. As we think about our priorities, they really haven't changed, which is it's not just cash flow from operations that have helped us. We've also driven great efficiency off our balance sheet from the working capital initiatives that we've driven. And as we think about priorities, it's going to continue to be primarily a delevering priority. So I don't really think there's a big change in strategy from what we've been doing over the last 18 months or so. I will tell you that as we analyze it today, the tax impact -- the tax reform impact from a cash perspective is relatively minimal and very manageable. And so that, at present time, is not a significant driver or causing us to change or rethink our strategy. So we have about $8.5 billion of cash and investments at our core Dell, Dell EMC if you exclude the VMware cash and investments. That's more than enough to help us manage our way through current maturities, continue delevering, even as we think about how we drive future cash flows from operations. So I'd really think my priorities are relatively unchanged, that we're committed to delevering the balance sheet, we're committed to getting to -- back to sort of investment-grade-like metrics. We'll do that over the right period of time even as we invest back into the business. And so that's sort of our current thinking. And maybe I'll ask Tyler to comment on, if he's got any other insights or -- anything you would add to that, Tyler.",350

I think you really said it all. I mean, Tom, the same thing we've been saying since, really, the beginning following the EMC transaction that we're going to delever. We've paid down $10 billion. Tom talked about the $8.5 billion that we have on the balance here or where we ended the balance sheet in Q4, which is excluding the VMware cash, which puts us in a very healthy position as we kind of go into next year and with the roughly $4.5 billion that we're planning on paying down. We've talked about that, that we're going to use cash in the balance sheet. We might have to dip into our revolver a little bit, but that would be only for short term to manage some gaps in timing. And so it was a strong cash flow quarter in Q4. I feel really good where we ended up. And as it relates to tracker, I mean, look, we'll continue to be opportunistic around that as we have in the past, but deleveraging really continues to be our focus.",179

That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, on storage. The turnaround in demand seems to me to be a pretty important point because it's been sort of the thorn in your side since you've done the EMC deal. And I wondered if you could just give us -- can you give us a little bit of color about some parts of it? But if you're saying that demand is up year-over-year for the first time, that strikes me as being pretty important. Could you talk a little bit about maybe -- just give us a little color around on that, like what total demand was, how you're measuring demand. Is it dollars? And then what the -- maybe the deferred revenue increase was Because, obviously, we can't see it in the GAAP revenue.",134

Look, Tom, I will probably ham and egg this one. Look, it is encouraging when you look at our orders demand in Q4, the exit velocity. I would use the word encouraging. We haven't set a trend yet. But we think the hard work that we put in place, the fact that we've added capacity, that we've improved our product competitiveness, that we've increased the speed in our decision, the customer loyalty program that we put in place at the very end of last year is beginning to pay dividend. So we're encouraged. You saw with Q4 market share data we have work to do. It is, without question, something Tom and I have tremendous focus on in the organization to change the performance of our storage business. And again, we've exited the fiscal year with a bit of encouragement. We saw good performance in our HCI business. We saw good performance on our all-flash business, and that encourages us to where we think where we're -- again, have expectations of a better year. We've built our plan in FY '19 as a take-share plan, as a growth plan. And we've set the tone in the organization that we are expecting to grow in the external storage business and take share.

I mean, in the comment around the fact that we set our plan around a take-share plan is consistent with how we think about, generally, our business in the other LOBs, for instance, right. I mean, in some of these markets, which are consolidating markets, you have to take share. You have to grow, and Jeff has been very focused with his ISG team on how does he position both the product and the offer and the selling motion to be aligned to take share. We also have to think about the fact that our selling models are changing a little bit or the types of consumption models are changing a little bit around things like flexible consumption. We're now offering customers more choice in how they contractually work with us, and a lot of them are wanting more flexibility. And typically, when you provide flexibility in some of these contractual arrangements that you end up deferring revenue. And so we did see pretty strong growth in our -- really strong growth in our deferred revenue, and that was mostly storage related as it relates to the ISG side of the business. And so that's why for the first time, I think you saw us talk a little bit more around deferred revenue and talking points just because I'd like to sensitize you guys to the fact that the models are changing some right now. It's not going to happen overnight, and we'll see what the natural sort of framework looks like in terms of how big some of these offerings get. But between flexible consumption models, utility models as a service-type models, there are some dynamics out there in the industry that -- and with the customer environment, I should say, that are changing. That doesn't get counted in IDC share, but it does sort of count in some of the order demand data that Jeff is talking about. So let me just finish with, I'll echo Jeff, ""we are encouraged."" We're not confused about what we have left to do. There's a lot of work left to do. We have work to do ensuring that we, one quarter -- this instance becomes a trend over time. And Jeff's done a lot of work particularly in the midrange offering. We've got more work to do there. That's growth area for us that we need to attack and ensure that we're taking our fair share of that marketplace. So that's the work we have in front of us. It connects back to your first question, which is we're very focused on storage. It's a strong margin profile for us, so it drives good cash. And we need to get it growing and going in the right direction.",463

I think you'd agree with this, and we talked about it in the last call. As we head into FY '19, we've really honed in the compensation plan for our sales force to focus on storage in FY '19.

As you look into the next fiscal year, some of the puts and takes, I mean, the $2 billion cost-savings program I think you had said that will be done fiscal 2Q. You're also reinvesting, which is somewhat of an offset. And then you have some mix challenges across the business with better servers. And then on computing, it seemed to be the last 2 quarters trending solidly above your prior margin targets. So maybe just an overall discussion on margin puts and takes and outlook.",95

Let me start and then I'll let Jeff jump in here as well. So look, I mean, we obviously don't give guidance around margin. So let me start with that. But as we think about the environment, let me give you a couple of thoughts. First, as we've talked about, fiscal '18 was a pretty tough component cost environment. And I think I'm publicly on record as saying that the absolute swing from FY '17, which was a deflationary environment, to an inflationary environment in FY '18 was roughly about a $2.5 billion swing that we had to go adjust pricing for or somehow navigate our way through, so. And what you saw as we think about our fiscal '18 results from the first half to second half, as you saw us in the first half dealing with a lot of that inflation plus the go-to-market implementation. And then you saw the business accelerate as we went through the year to the point where we felt reasonably good, not around some of our exit velocity as we got through the Q4. So component costs will not be as big of -- as we understand it right now, will not be as big of a headwind as it was the last year, and perhaps, it's even a slight tailwind. We'll have to see how we -- that progresses through the year. We think that's helpful from a pricing perspective, from pricing medical perspective. So that's a positive from margin perspective. Look, it's competitive out there from pricing perspective. So we're always going to be competitive and make sure that our -- we've got the price point set properly. From a mix dynamic, if we go execute our plan, if we go execute our plan, you would think that you would see some margin help there from the storage and data protection because that's high-margin products and solutions, and so that's a focus area for us as well. Servers is going to be an area that we said on our talk track that, while we're extraordinarily happy with the velocity of servers, we've got a little bit of work to do around improving some of their gross margin dollar contribution there. And so that's a focus area for us. So look, if anything, it's about how we go execute next year. And so I think margins have an opportunity to be better, but there's work to do to make sure that we go execute around that model. So Jeff, I don't know what you would add.",427
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395738.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,27,"Maybe a couple of points though. One on -- we'll start with CSG. We're going to try to maintain the profitability that you see while increasing the unit velocity. While we did achieve 20 straight quarters of year-over-year share gain, our unit velocity slowed in the second half of the year, and that's a priority of the organization to pick up the unit velocity while maintaining the same level of profitability. And we believe we can do that with our bias towards commercial and our attach motion where we can drag peripherals, services and financing with each purchase. We have a unique ability to do that, so I'm encouraged there. I'm also encouraged where we're winning, which is as I mentioned earlier, in some of the premium price bands, the premium categories, Latitude, commercial notebooks, precision workstations, XPS, rugged notebooks and our gaming categories. Displays is a great business for us there, and we continue to be the market leader. And we are working to expand that position as we head into this fiscal year. On servers, I don't want to slow down. Our mix issue in ISG is not an issue, servers grew too fast or mix issues didn't grow storage enough. So we want to continue to grow servers and take advantage of the opportunity of access to new customers that we did not have before. The benefit of the EMC acquisition has given us access to enterprise customers that we did not grow in, and we want to continue to do that. And then at the end of the day, I have to drive storage growth. Storage growth will change the fundamental composition of the ISG profitability. In terse terms, I guess, I need to sell a lot more 60% gross margin and things than we are today, and by doing so, we'll lift the aggregate ISG portfolio. Does that make sense?",315

That was very helpful. And my follow-up would be just on the free cash flow. The core Dell free cash flow of about $2 billion was very strong in the quarter, well above what we were modeling. I'm just wondering if -- are there are any unusual -- I know there's seasonal benefits. Any unusual timing issues of some of these kind of permanent changes you've made in your processes? And then just to follow up on that. The flexible consumption models, how do you see them -- the shift to that, how do you see them impacting cash flow over the next year or 2?",108
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395740.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,29,"I'll start and then Tyler can probably answer it more intelligently than I can. So look, there really wasn't -- as we think about free cash flow other than the -- some of the standard working capital dynamics you get out of a strong -- stronger demand and shipment quarter, there really wasn't anything unusual in that other than the one comment I would give you is we were pleased with the deferred revenue growth, right. And in many respects, that deferred revenue growth drives from whether it's -- from whether prepaid maintenance or some of the flexible consumption models drove -- drives cash upfront, and -- but it all comes down to we -- when we drive velocity through the business model, whether that's through PCs, servers and as we continue to build velocity in storage, we get the effects of our a very effective and efficient use of working capital. So nothing unusual other than deferred revenue. As it relates to flexible consumption models, look, we're going to get a -- it's a careful balance, right, because we like the flexible consumption models in the context of they're typically multiyear arrangements, they typically build a better and stronger and deeper customer relationship, they're generally quite profitable over time. But the opposite has some short-term P&L dynamics as you work your way through that even in some instances, particularly with some of our licensing arrangements where we get the cash upfront. Utility models are something different where we get the cash, obviously, on a subscription basis per se over time. So they're going to continue to grow. In many respects, we want them to grow. We just want to make sure that we have the right balance in terms of the mix of our business to properly manage both our cash, our P&L commitments and our relationship with our customers. And we also have some new and emerging businesses that are continuing to grow quite fast, like I think about a Pivotal, a Boomi, an RSA, where their business models, in many respects, are subscription-based models. And so we'll continue to see some elements of deferred revenue growth coming from some of those new -- some of our new and emerging businesses. Would you add anything to that?",380

Okay. I will follow-up with one financial question, and that is we are in a rising interest rate environment, and I don't think your financial results disclose necessarily an interest expense.

And if there's any color you can offer in terms of exposure to rising interest rates, maybe there's a rule of thumb that might help us on the modeling front.",81

I mean, look, the -- we look at our capital structure, really, kind of from a broad perspective, right. So I actually do have a target around floating rate debt. I think the floating rate debt over time actually outperforms fixed-rate debt, and our floating rate debt now is roughly about 27%. Because if you go back and look at what we've been paying down since the close of the transaction, it really has been floating rate. I probably target somewhere between 25% to 40% floating. So we're actually at the lower end of that range. So I feel very comfortable about that position. And yes, even though the LIBOR is higher and that piece of interest expense is higher, if you take into account the debt we've paid down, the repricings that we've gone through, we've more than compensated. So our actual overall annualized interest expense is lower than where we closed the deal, and that will continue to be driven down. I mean, once again, we're looking for, to this year to paying down, call it, $4.5 billion to $5 billion. And so we'll continue to take interest expense out of the balance sheet.",199

I guess, I just wanted to focus again on the revenue growth and specifically, the ASPs. I think you said they were higher, but can you give us any more granularity specifically maybe in kind of how to think about storage versus servers versus PCs and, really, what the component is related to the higher component costs with regards to how you guys are passing that on versus what you're seeing sort of more broadly across the business as well?",81
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2018",2018-03-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3600.0,1415528.0,56395749.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,38,"Let me start, and maybe Jeff can add some comments. And look, I mean, we did talk about the fact that a lot of -- no, some amount of the revenue growth was driven from ASP or [ TRU ]expansion. And principally, that's a result, as you know, of -- particularly in PCs and servers, we had a higher input cost in terms of the component cost environment. So we generally try -- obviously, try to price our way through that to ensure we cover it all. But I also -- while I won't give you exact percentages, I also want to echo what Jeff said around as we think about our revenue velocity in PCs and servers in particular, while we're overall very pleased with it, we are careful of as we think our way through much was ASP driven versus how much was unit driven. And so, for instance, in servers where revenue growth was roughly about 22%, if you think about how we ship -- the unit shipments, over half of that revenue growth was driven by [ TRU ] expansion versus unit. And that's what we want to think our way through in terms of how do we balance that. In PCs, it's much the same if you think about our PC business being up 7% from a revenue basis and units being up roughly 2% to 3% or something like that. So we know that we've got ASP expansion there. The question is, can you hold onto it as the component costs change? And that will be a function of the competitive environment as we go forward. So it's a dynamic we watch pretty carefully. ASPs within the storage business is a, really, sort of a different thought process, right. We don't really think about it like that because the configurations are so different and couldn't buy any offerings in the software or software that's embedded in it. So ASPs are a little less -- we don't think about velocity in the same way as it relates to ASPs in the storage business. And Jeff, did I miss anything? Or would you highlight anything?",359

The dynamics of our revenue growth are a combination of, you hit them, pricing efficiency, mix, exposure to commercial, exposure to notebooks, exposure to premium notebooks. So mix helps us as well as our attach motion of attaching more financing services and peripherals to each opportunity, so that helps us on the CSG side, and I think that's sustainable. On the server side, we are in the longest protracted DRAM price increase that we've seen in the last 25 years, combine that with that we're putting more DRAM in a server today than we were last quarter than we were a year ago, and you have a compounding effect. So that is some part of our revenue increase on the server side. For me, it's encouraging that the average amount of DRAM going in our servers and, the SSDs, the average SSD size go into our services increasing tells me a we are selling higher in the enterprise workload. We are selling more higher-value solutions inside our customers, penetrating deeper configurations than we had in the past. And I believe that is sustainable in time. Does that help?",200

And then, I guess, just the -- a second follow-up on the tax comments that you made earlier in the call. So I think you said a net impact of about $300 million, which was a function of $1.3 billion of benefit related to the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by a $1 billion of future transition tax. And how should I think about that future transition tax? Is that -- number one, is that specifically related to the repatriation provisions? And then secondly, is there any sort of granularity you can give us with regards to thinking about it on the Dell EMC side versus the VMware side?",115

Look, so let me try and give you some thoughts around that, and let me first start and say, hey, look, we're obviously big supporters of tax reform and the move to territorial. It's good for the economy. We're reasonably optimistic that some of the immediate expensing around the CapEx will have a helpful impact on our business as we go through the year. So as we thought about -- but it's obviously very complex calculation. And as we thought about the piece parts, right, so the $1 billion of transition tax is how we think about the overall impact to the Dell Technologies family. Some of that is clearly coming out of VMware, but I'm not going to parse it for you per se. But we think it's very manageable in the sense of the cash impact to that if it's really -- it's going to be substantially less from a -- some -- all positions that we have. So look, I think it's very manageable. I think it's -- we're continuing to evaluate it because the environment and the regulatory guidance just continues to get issued, so. But I'm reasonably optimistic around the go-forward positions and the go-forward impacts as we do the tax work.",211

Look, I'm pretty happy actually with the work that's been done on the synergy front in terms of revenue synergies. I think the teams have worked well together. I think we working effectively as a big family of Dell Technologies. We've exceeded -- we have some -- we had first-year synergy targets that we've exceeded as a result of the work that's been done by the collective teams. We think there's more to do. As we think about the position and where technology trends are headed and we think about things like ReadyNode's PC and ReadyNodes that we're driving, some of the software-defined movements that are more server-oriented, so we think there's better -- continued opportunity to doing more holistic integration with some of our hardware products with the VMware offerings. So we think this is going to continue to ramp as we go through FY '19. We think it's beneficial both for our customers and clearly for the -- for Dell Technologies and for VMware. And so we're very optimistic about the opportunities. It doesn't mean we have -- we still have work to do in some of these areas as we think to continue to align our go-to-market positioning, coordination and efficiency at a customer level, ensuring that we present one face to the customer. So there's some work to do in that area. But overall, pretty optimistic about -- and pleased, I would say, with where we are to date on the revenue synergy side.",249

We had a strong first quarter with balanced growth across all business units, regions and customer segments. Our broad set of capabilities and ""better together"" philosophy drove top line momentum and improved profitability. We generated seasonally strong operating cash flow and continued to pay down debt even as we drove improved profitability. The velocity in server client and VMware that we saw building last year has continued into FY '19, and we're making progress in storage. 
In addition to the broad strength across the business during Q1, we hosted 14,000 customers, partners and industry analysts at Dell Technologies World and introduced a new slate of solutions, which Jeff will touch on more in a moment. We rolled out the Dell Technologies Advantage framework that provides tools and incentives to help channel partners sell solutions and services across our entire portfolio of brands. We launched the initial public offering for Pivotal Software, raising approximately $540 million that will stay at the Pivotal level for their general corporate needs and to fund future growth initiatives. And the cross-selling between our families of companies continues to be strong. These points are all positive indications that we are better together as we continue to drive market-leading integration of our software, software-defined data center and hardware capabilities to drive innovative solutions for our customers in this digital era. 
Now let me provide more details on the results for the first quarter. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $21.4 billion, up 19%, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $153 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $21.5 billion, up 17%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in commercial client, servers, storage and VMware. We are seeing better market conditions driven by improved global macroeconomic sentiment and improving IT demand driven by digital transformation. We are also benefiting from the investments we have made in our go-to-market and solution capabilities. 
Gross margin was up 19% to $6.9 billion and was 32.1% of revenue, which was up 50 basis points, driven by improved gross margin in client solutions and a higher mix of ISG revenue. While component costs were slightly deflationary in aggregate for the quarter, they remained a headwind for servers due to DRAM cost increases. Along with the rest of the industry, we continue to face a cost environment where DRAM costs continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the prior year. We expect DRAM costs, particularly server DRAM, to remain a headwind through much of the year, but we are expecting some offsets in other commodities to mitigate the overall inflationary impact. 
OpEx was $4.9 billion, up 12% and was 22.7% of revenue, which was down 110 basis points as OpEx scaled at a slower rate than revenue growth. Operating income was 42 -- was up 42% to $2 billion or 9.4% of revenue, up 160 basis points. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 33% to $2.4 billion or 11.1% of revenue. Please see Slide 22 on the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. 
Turning to the business segments. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was $8.7 billion, up 25%. The increase was driven by a 41% growth in servers and networking to $4.6 billion and 10% growth in storage to $4.1 billion. We continue to see extraordinary demand for PowerEdge servers, coupled with ongoing expansion of our average selling prices, both of which drove our sixth consecutive quarter of server revenue growth, with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers. 
Customers continue to look for more memory and storage content in servers given the shifting workloads, focused on running big data analytics and software-defined solutions. We exited last year with better storage velocity on a demand basis, leading to double-digit revenue growth in Q1. We were encouraged by the improved demand in the commercial midrange portion of the storage market, where we've been making go-to-market investments and enhancements to our solutions offerings. Operating income for ISG was $939 million or 10.8% of revenue, which is a 350 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily due to improved storage performance and operating expense leverage. 
Revenue for our client solutions group was up 14% to $10.3 billion, with broad strength across the portfolio. Commercial revenue grew 16% to $7.4 billion, with double-digit unit growth and higher average selling prices for notebooks, workstations and thin client. Consumer revenue was $2.9 billion, up 7%, primarily driven by mix shifts to XPS products and personal notebooks. CSG operating income was $533 million, up 64% and was 5.2% of revenue. We benefited from a higher mix of commercial, and the team continues to execute our attach motion with higher-margin services in S&P. 
The VMware segment had another strong quarter, delivering $2 billion of revenue, which was up 12%. Operating income was $613 million or 30.2% of revenue. Based on VMware stand-alone results reported last Thursday, the company saw double-digit license bookings growth in compute management, end-user computing, NSX and VSAN/VxRail. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes RSA, Pivotal, SecureWorks, Virtustream and Boomi, was $579 million, which was up 9%. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. Deferred revenue was $21 billion, up approximately $140 million from the fourth quarter and up $3.3 billion year-over-year, driven by an increase in software and hardware maintenance given the growth we're seeing across the business as well as growth in our flexible consumption models. We believe this growth is a positive indication that our business model is evolving as we offer more software and services solutions across the family of businesses. 
Our cash and investments balance was approximately $21.7 billion, growing sequentially by $1.4 billion. In Q1, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion. Our first quarter tends to be our weakest in regards to cash generation, but this quarter's cash flow benefited from better profitability and strong working capital management. 
Our customers continue to benefit from Dell Financial Services and the flexibility it provides through a variety of financing solutions, including flexible consumption models. We fund this business predominantly through a combination of securitization, syndication and loans, all collateralized by high-quality financing receivables. Since closing the EMC transaction, originations were up 50%, financing receivables are up $2.6 billion or 51% and related DFS debt has increased $2.3 billion, including allocated debt. 
During Q1, we paid down approximately $600 million of core debt, bringing our core debt balance to $39.8 billion. Total debt was $52.7 billion, which did not materially change compared to the prior quarter due to an increase of approximately $600 million in DFS debt. For additional detail on what is included or excluded in our debt balances, please see Slide 20 of the web deck. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments, excluding VMware and Pivotal, ended the quarter at $31.7 billion. 
As you know, we grew our cash balances ahead of $3.1 billion of scheduled debt maturities due in the first half of this year. Last week, we repaid $2.5 billion of the legacy EMC investment-grade notes. Including this maturity, we've now paid down approximately $13 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS and subsidiary debt since the closing of the transaction. 
I am pleased with the progress we've made on debt repayment while continuing to invest in the business. We're financially strong and comfortable with our ability to pay down $5 billion in total debt this year. This is as planned. We were on track, and we are using our existing cash-generation vehicles. 
Now let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights for ISG and CSG.",1278
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2018",2018-06-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3615.0,1483234.0,58816747.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we had a strong first quarter. We successfully balanced growth and profitability, delivering double-digit revenue growth and share gain across ISG and CSG while growing operating income faster than revenue. 
ISG had a good quarter. The momentum we saw for server revenue and units in the second half of FY '18 continued into the first quarter, where we saw double-digit growth for both. Server ASPs continue to expand due to compute requirements and more richly configured servers associated with software-defined data center solutions and mission-critical activities and workloads such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over the last 5 quarters, memory content in servers has increased nearly 30% and storage capacity has increased 11%. Our strong server performance has helped us become the worldwide leader for x86 servers based on units and revenue. 
Storage had a solid quarter as a portion of the Q4 demand we told you about on the March call shift in Q1. Following positive demand growth in our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to gain share year-over-year in storage when the first quarter industry share numbers are final. This will be our first quarter of storage share gains since we closed the EMC transaction. 
For Q1, overall storage demand was lower, but Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter as we build through the rest of the year. We did see strong demand for our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio and other software-defined offers customers are -- as customers are looking to modernize their data center, including triple-digit growth in both our VxRail and VxRack offerings. We also saw positive demand in our commercial customer segment with positive growth in midrange storage. 
Hyperconverged, software-defined and midrange are areas where we have made significant investments over the past year, including several hundred million dollars on sales capacity and R&D around hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined data center. As most of you know, we have taken several steps over the past few months to improve storage, which include launching our new PowerMax storage solution, aligning our software-defined storage strategy to VSAN and releasing product updates for Unity, SC and XtremIO X2. We also launched our Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program covering our storage portfolio. 
This quarter's results are an indicator that our actions are having a positive impact. We continue to be focused on improving storage velocity and acknowledge that results may be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. That said, our FY '19 storage plan is built on revenue growth and deliver share gain over the full year. 
Turning to CSG. Growth was driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks and workstations, high single-digit growth in commercial desktops and continued strength in software and peripherals. This was on the back of better-than-expected industry commercial growth worldwide for IDC. In total, we gained 100 basis points of worldwide PC unit share, marking our 21st straight quarter of share gains. 
Our year-over-year unit growth was above the industry and was the best of the top 5 vendors. Total workstation units for the industry grew nearly 10% worldwide in calendar Q1, with growth in all regions. Dell grew above the industry with 11% growth and is the industry-leading provider of workstations worldwide with 41% share. 
Client software and peripherals continues to be strong, and we saw another quarter of double-digit growth in displays and client peripherals. Based on Q4 data from DisplaySearch, Dell gained 110 basis points of unit share, marking the 19th consecutive quarter of being #1 worldwide. 
At Dell Technologies World, we emphasize the 5 biggest technology trends driving IT transformation needs for our customers globally and our products and solution strategies. These include immersive and collaborative computing such as edge computing, augmented reality and virtual reality, Internet of Things or IoT, hybrid or multi-cloud, software-defined data center and artificial intelligence or AI and machine learning. We are focusing our immense IP portfolio and significant engineering capability to deliver innovative products and services that are cloud-first enabled and maximize the opportunity our customers have in AI and machine learning as part of driving better business outcomes through data intelligence. 
Also at Dell Technologies World, we launched several new solutions, including the PowerMax, the future of enterprise-class storage and our new high-end storage line featuring end-to-end NVMe aimed at next-generation use cases like real-time analytics, genomics, AI, machine learning and IoT; the PowerEdge R940xa, built for high-performance AI and machine learning workload, supporting up to 8 pre-programmable gate arrays; the PowerEdge R840, built for real-time data analytics that can support up to 24 direct-attached NVMe drives; and the PowerEdge MX, available later this year, modular in nature and built for the emerging data workloads. It's worth noting that all of these PowerEdge innovations are NVMe and NVMe over Fabrics ready as part of a holistic data center solution. In addition, we launched enhancements to our XtremIO X2, including native replications; and our VxRail and VxRack, which are now on our 14th generation servers and offer a clear path to adopt VMware-based multi-clouds. 
Next, I wanted to provide an update on the ISG organization and storage road map. I shared with you on the last call we've simplified the ISG organization, aligning leaders and product categories more effectively for improved speed and accountability. Since then, we have started simplifying the portfolio into a road map squarely directed at meeting customer needs and winning in the market. 
We will offer a single industry-leading solution for every segment in which we compete, including entry level, midrange, high end and unstructured. Those solutions will pull forward the best features and innovation from our current portfolio, plus new innovations to ensure we are offering the industry's best solutions. PowerMax is a perfect example of the product simplification we want to achieve. 
Those efforts are all designed to drive more efficient R&D and accelerate innovation to better capture the power of our intellectual property, marketing engine and sales force. And let me be clear, we are not exiting any market and all of the products on our current road map will continue to be supported over their life cycle. Customers can rely on our future-proof loyalty program to ensure anything they buy will be supported and that we will provide a seamless transition to our next-generation products. 
In closing, we are the market leader in all IT infrastructure categories in which we compete in. We are better together, and we are the trusted partner in the data center with our world-class sales force and focus on innovation. For Dell Technologies, we spend more than $4 billion on R&D each year and more than 80% of our engineers are focused on software. Going forward, we are focused on driving a road map that showcases our differentiated portfolio with the integration of our solutions and value of our industry-leading software, services and multi-cloud capabilities. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.",1149

Roughly 20 months since the EMC transaction, we have many things going well, including client and server velocity, VMware's growth and our strong cash flow performance. We saw broad-based revenue growth, market share gains and improved profitability across the business. 
And while we're pleased with Q1 storage revenue results, we still have work to do to expand the storage customer base and ensure the market understands our solutions, architectures and road map. 
We're taking the right long-term steps, but we expect progress to be a multiyear journey. We're simplifying the road map over time and backing all of our products by the best-in-class future-proof customer loyalty program that ensures investment protection in a seamless, nondisruptive path to the simplified portfolio of the future. 
We've also made significant investments in expanding our go-to-market coverage as we've hired several hundred new storage sales specialists. 
Across to the Dell Technologies family, we have approximately 40,000 sellers plus an industry-leading channel program designed to drive coverage across 180 countries. 
As we head into the remainder of the year, the setup continues to look favorable as the macroeconomic and IT spending environment seem promising and overall commodity cost increases are starting to abate. Based on our latest analysis, tax reform does not appear to have a material impact on our cash tax rates. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are confident in our plans to continue driving cash flow and debt reduction. 
We believe we are well positioned heading into the rest of FY '19. We will look to keep up the momentum we've seen and continue to execute our strategic areas of focus for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, these areas include: growing above the market and driving share gains, which you saw in Q1 with share gains for PCs and servers and expected share gains in storage when the data is released; generating strong cash flow and delevering the balance sheet, where you saw us deliver above seasonal cash flow this quarter and made progress on debt pay down with $3.1 billion of gross debt payments made this year; executing on ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins, where we've made some positive strides in Q1; and last but certainly our most important area of focus, we will delight customers by listening to and adjusting their needs for their digital transformation journey through our full range of capabilities.

Can you talk first with servers, just the acceleration of revenue growth there? How much of that is market driven? How much of that is execution and share gains? And then, in storage, with revenues up 10%, a big turnaround there. How much of that was the flexible consumption model benefit you received? You mentioned orders were down a little bit. Maybe go through where you are on all these initiatives to achieve your goal of revenue growth on storage this year.",87

Let me start, and then maybe Jeff Clarke can jump in here in a few minutes. But look, on servers, I think we're clearly pleased with the velocity we're seeing in that piece of the business. It's -- obviously, the macro is strong. And we've talked about this before, Jeff, that as you think about what's happening in the data center and some of the trends that we're seeing, there's clearly a trend towards a compute-centric platform, whether that software-defined or hyperconverged. We're also seeing the benefit of some of the workload migration with big data analytics and those types of capabilities that customers are clearly valuing. So we have the strongest compute platform in the industry, so we continue to turbocharge that business. We've invested in it. The 14G capabilities that we've rolled out are quite strong. And so look, we're pleased with where we are. We're going to continue to focus on the velocity of that business even as we balance margin. So I tend to think that we're benefiting from both the market, but I also think that we're executing reasonably well in that space. And there's all these things we can do better, but feeling pretty good about the trends in the business that we're seeing. As it relates to storage, we did have a good, strong storage revenue quarter, so it was up 10% on a shipped basis. As a reminder, if you just think about historical patterns in the business, the legacy EMC business tended to ramp velocity and revenues as it went through the year. So Q4 seasonally was always their strongest quarter, and that's clearly what we saw last year with the storage demand. And then it steps down in Q1. And so that's why you heard us talk about on -- within our conversation that back -- seasonally, Q1 is the lightest quarter, then it continues to build from there. So we're optimistic about storage for the year. We expect to -- we have a take-share plan, a grow-revenue plan for the year. It will be, I think, a bit variable as we go through the quarters. And as it relates to flexible consumption model, it was a pretty light quarter for flexible consumption model. It's down significantly from Q4, which isn't unexpected, given that these have a long cycle -- they're a long sales cycle activity. And again, I think what we'll see is we'll expect those to build as we go through the year. I don't know, Jeff, if you would add anything there.",428

When I look at servers, we talked about content being up, the mix is up, our 14G mix is up, the resulting ASP is up, software-defined, the different mission-critical workloads that we're taking on as we're selling deeper into the data center, data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads being driven into the business. I think the one that maybe, Tom, that you didn't mention which I'm excited by is the synergies of the combination continue to work for us. The doors being open in the largest account for our server business continues to be an accelerant for the business. And then, on the other side, you talked about storage. You hit the enterprise phasing. We mentioned in the remarks our commercial orders growth for the quarter was up, which, to us, is beginning to show signs of the investment that we made in selling capacity in the second half of last year is beginning to show positive signs, and we're encouraged by that as well. Does that help, Jeff?",176

And just on margins, you said overall commodity costs were deflationary in the quarter. Maybe just talk generally about -- obviously, you've seen significant revenue growth. But when we look at EBITDA margin, some of the puts and takes, it looks like -- I mean, you should be about completed with the cost-reduction program you talked about. You've been reinvesting in the business in various areas, and then you talked about commodities. So how do we look at that?",82

We're going to see some pressure in deep server DRAM as we go through the year just given the demand that's out there for that commodity. But the other basket of commodities, I think we're expecting that to be slightly deflationary. So overall, I don't think we see significant headwinds in the commodity cost area. We'll have to see how this evolves as we go through the year. But I think, clearly, a better environment than what we were in, in the previous year in terms of trying to manage our way through the commodity cost upticks that we saw a year ago. Let me also hit on the EBITDA margins, right? Because clear -- if you think about our historical pattern, Q1 should be our seasonally low EBITDA margin, and then it should build from there. And so I'm actually pretty pleased with what I saw from an EBITDA perspective and -- with 11.1% margin versus a 9.8% a year ago, so 130 basis point expansion. And I would expect, as the business continues to perform, that we'll see expansion in that. The other interesting stat that I've been looking at, if you look at our trailing 12-month EBITDA, I mean, we're now sitting at $9.7 billion, which I'm pleased with the progress that we've made there. So look, there's always work to do, Jeff. And we're going to continue to try and optimize the business as we talked about in terms of making sure that even as we drive server velocity, we're balancing margin growth -- margin dollar growth. We're very focused on storage and data protection velocity, and we'll continue to work on growing at a premium to market. So we are trying to balance a number of levers here as we work our way through, through the remainder of the year.",329

DRAM is going to be a pressure, up. That's going to be inflationary, although we think that, that's a -- that rate of increase is at a slower rate than a year ago. So it's slowing, but it's -- there is pressure on that commodity. And then the other basket of commodity should be deflationary enough to sort of offset most, if not all, of that DRAM pressure. So that's how we see it right now. Now we'll see how it evolves as we go through the year, but that's based upon our latest view. On the EBITDA, my point was as follows, right? If you look at our pattern on EBITDA over the last year, Q1 was seasonally our weakest quarter and then it builds. So my point was, on a percentage basis, I expect to see EBITDA percentages -- margins to continue to build from Q1. Tyler, would you say that differently? Or do you have a different perspective on that?",168

Yes, that's great color. And then on the prior call, you talked about kind of the demand growth that you were seeing in the storage business and how that turned positive. How should we think about those trends that you saw in Q1? And maybe in early Q2, have those accelerated even further?",54
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2018",2018-06-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3615.0,1483234.0,58816763.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,19,"Well, look, we always -- our expectation was Q1 was going to be seasonally weaker than Q4 just given the historical seasonal patterns, and we did see that. So I -- although we had a strong ship quarter, storage demand was down from where it was in Q4. Now we do expect that it will continue to build from here as the investments that we've been talking about with the go-to-market and what we've been doing with the portfolio we'll continue to begin to realize benefit from that as we go through the year. So that's why you heard us talk and frame the year like this, which is we expect to grow and take share for storage for the entire year. But I do think it's not going to be linear and to the right, it's going to be a little lumpy. And so our expectation is, is that we are very focused on driving velocity of that business and ensuring that we get that business back to a share gain position. Jeff, would you add anything to that?",180

We're encouraged that has put the right focus on storage. We know the lumpiness of our demand that you mentioned, Tom, so I think we have compensation heading the right way in how we incent our sales force. And then we have -- we're building out capacity and coverage, and we'll build productivity over the year. And again, as we mentioned, what we saw in the commercial business is encouraging. I would also say we have one data point on a curve, if you will, or the beginning of a line. We need a second data point and a third data point to draw a trend. And that's certainly what we intend to do in Q2, get the second data point.",135

So revenue growth was obviously up nicely, 14% year-over-year, and you guys gave a couple of data points around gaining 100 basis points of worldwide unit share. But when I think about just the broad math around getting to the 14% growth, can you help us think about volume versus growth and especially in the context of how to think about the broader sort of global PC market? I think Gartner reported it was down around 1.4% in 1Q. So how do we just make the math work in terms of looking at your growth and thinking about ASPs versus volumes and share growth?",114

So look, I mean, from our perspective -- and we tend to look at IDC. The IDC market came in at minus 0.2% versus a forecast of minus 1.5%... So the market was a bit better than how we had -- was originally planned. But if you think about the drivers of our growth, I would tell you that our commercial units were up 12% year-over-year. Our ASPs were relatively flat in the PC space from Q4 to Q1, which I actually think is a win given some of the mix dynamics. And so look, it's a unit velocity. We're very focused, as we've talked about in the past, on commercial client. That is where we want to make sure that we're continuing to drive and take share, which we did in Q1. Don't forget also that we have a very strong S&P, software and peripheral, business. And so one of the things we've talked about over the years is the fact that, with our direct selling model, our ability to attach is a differentiated selling model from our competitors. And again, you saw things like -- I think we're now #1 in displays again for the 19th consecutive quarter. And so again, we're focused on unit growth, expanding the customer base, ensuring that we're attaching where we can attach and improving overall profitability of that business even as we continue to drive velocity. And so I'm pretty happy with the unit velocity in commercial. I think it shows the right focus and the right balance. And we're going to continue to drive the business. Jeff?",278

Our commercial unit growth was strong, and then it was strong in areas that carry higher ASPs. So Latitude notebooks, Precision Workstations both grew double digits. Those carry higher revenue per unit, higher margin per unit, and that's certainly what we're seeing in the business. You hit the other high point, Tom, our attach motion of selling services, financing and peripherals. We had double-digit growth in both display -- or in our S&P business, in accessories particularly, and the attach motion. That's the recipe of our CSG business, to take each and every opportunity and attach something to it. And we're doing a quite -- we're doing that quite nicely.",117

So -- but I think all of those businesses give us access and our interesting areas of what we see with the technology market in terms of whether it's security with RSA and SecureWorks, Pivotal with the cloud-native application development platform, Boomi with the ability to -- the IaaS sort of platform so -- on the Virtustream with this -- for these mission-critical workloads that want to be in the cloud. So they're all interesting areas of what -- of certain aspects of some of the technology market. And so we're focused generally on nurturing those businesses, growing those businesses, investing in those businesses. And so our strategy is going to continue to put capital towards them, where appropriate, to help drive velocity. So -- and what's interesting is that they benefit from the overall reach of Dell Technologies, right? If you think about our 40,000 sellers, our ability to cross-sell across the platform, our ability to introduce some of these interesting technologies and capabilities to our broader set of customers, it's a huge advantage for us from a leverage perspective, and we're going to continue to focus on that.",229

I would basically start with we're still in the early innings. We are, I think, encouraged by the results. Clearly, we talked about our Q4 exit velocity. We talked about -- you saw the performance of our 10% revenue growth and our shipments in the fiscal quarter, so we're pleased with that. We're pleased with the commercial growth in demand. We talked about the lumpiness of a big buildup of our enterprise business and its seasonal -- or seasonality going into Q1. We're working through that. And then it's about focus. We're focusing the organization. We have -- Tom and I have spent a lot of time with the team on driving capacity and coverage. We're continuing to invest in capacity and coverage. We fully intend to grow the storage business and have a lot of focus on that. We've aligned a sales compensation system beginning February 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, that emphasizes selling storage. One quarter in, I think Tom and I would reflect and go, ""Good progress."" Clearly, the enterprise business builds over the entire fiscal year. So we have work to do in the next 3 quarters, but we're encouraged. We put a lot of focus in the marketing side. If you've watched some of the, I think, tightening of our marketing programs and our marketing message leading to Dell Technologies World and what we've talked about at Dell Tech World and what we're doing in storage and the broader enterprise and infrastructure, I think you're seeing a concise message there. We're clearly front and center with the cloud and how our infrastructure is going to be used in the cloud and what we're doing in regards to our infrastructure to be more cloud-friendly. I spent a lot of time on the product side, focusing the product organization. I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made in the first 8.5 months. We have the organization very focused. You've, I'm sure, read a lot about us simplifying the road map. It's been the focus of the organization. We're at a point now where we've defined our [ .nxt ] products. And the reception from our partners and our customers has been overwhelmingly positive. Again, when I talk to customers and I said, ""Would you rather buy 4 midrange products or one, the right one with all of our best IP?"" The answer is overwhelmingly positive, to the degree of 100%, ""We prefer to buy one product that's the right product with all of the Dell EMC technology and IP in it."" That's exactly what we're going to go build and are building while providing our customers the transition from their current products to the new products. So we've said in this, despite what may be being said by others, our products on the road map today are supported throughout their lifetime, period. And we will provide a nondisruptive migration from the old product to the new product. We're encouraged by that. Every time we trial that by our partners and customers, ""Basically, Jeff, we can buy what we're buying today and when you have the new thing ready, we can seamlessly migrate to the new thing?"" ""Yes, sir, that's correct."" It's received very, very positively. And then, although I struggled with it earlier on our call, our loyalty program is winning the hearts and minds of our customers. We are protecting our customers going into the future with a series of programs that help our customers, again, choose Dell EMC and feel confident with that decision. So that combination of things, again, early innings, encouraged, a tremendous amount of focus on the storage portfolio, the storage business. Tom and I talk about this at least a couple of times a day, and that's where our focus is. Does that help?",639

And so I think, over time, you'll see the origination growth sort of begin to mirror more the overall growth of the core business and the various businesses. We're clearly benefiting from putting Dell EMC together. In fact, EMC did not have a captive finance subsidiary. And so tapping into that sales motion at VMware and the legacy EMC customers and [ nxt ], optimizing the opportunity to provide financing services to them is what we've been doing over the last year. And you can see some of the statistics, right? So origination's up 52% year-over-year in the first quarter; and financing receivables, up almost 30% since -- year-over-year; our managed asset base, almost -- a little over $8 billion now. And so it's clearly grown pretty rapidly. But I do think, over time, we'll begin to settle back in a more sort of growth that is a bit more mirroring of what the core business growth looks like. But I'm pleased with the performance there. It's a good profit contribution for us. It's a good enabler for our business that provides our ability to have flexible consumption models and do some of the Flex On Demand and some of those types of cloud-like economic financing models that we've been talking about and are driving. And the other dynamic you've got to think about is that, as that business comes back into more sort of normal growth profile, I think our -- the growth in the related DFS debt will settle down and be more in that range as well. So Tyler, I don't know if you would add anything from a DFS perspective that I -- maybe I missed.",305

I'm focused on our customers and our opportunities and, certainly, the agenda that we've put in front of you. I look at the server business and what we're doing there and the customers and partners I talk to, they're very encouraged in what we're doing, and we seem to be differentiating ourselves in the marketplace. Our execution, our performance, the portfolio of our product, the ability to sell an end-to-end story from the edge to the core to the cloud, the leadership technology that we have in our 14G products and what we'll do in the next generation, the products that we just announced at Dell Technologies World have been received very, very well. Leadership position in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I feel pretty encouraged about that. On the storage side, again, I talked to a lot of customers, I spent a lot of time with customers at Dell Technologies World and partners and talked about our road map. And certainly, what's resonating very well with them is the road map decisions that we have made are all customer driven. The intersection of what our customers need to what we see as the upcoming technology road map and opportunities, they respond well to taking the complexity out of our road map, that we're listening to how they deploy infrastructure, the fact that we're standing behind those products, nothing is going away. And probably, the more overwhelming reaction I get -- or I get an overwhelming reaction to this comment, is we're bringing the entire DNA of our products and people in a more focused way to drive innovation and put new technology in their hands. They get real excited about that. To be honest, I don't spend time thinking about how my competitors are responding to that. We know what we need to do. We're very, very focused. We have a wealth of riches in this organization, a tremendous amount of IP. A large number of engineers have been doing this a very long time. They are more focused than they've been.

I would tell you from a pricing and overall sort of competitive market perspective, look, I mean, as you know, the markets we -- and the businesses that we compete in are clearly always competitive. But I would say that the pricing environment is generally unchanged from Q4, relatively benign, meaning it's always competitive but it's -- I don't see anything abnormal out there. I don't see any abnormal responses or out-of-the-ordinary responses, at least what we can see in the marketplace. Now there's always pockets around the globe where you see some form of aggressiveness. But overall, look, I think the industry has had to digest a pretty tough commodity cost environment, particularly in client and in servers over the last year. I think we're coming through that. And then it gets down to feature set capabilities and competitive positioning and what customers need in terms of the storage solution portfolio that we're driving. So overall, we'll focus on what we do, and we'll leave our competitors to focus on what they're trying to get done, so...",199

And then, I guess, one of the questions that we get from a lot of the investors out there is basically sustainability of some of these growth rates, not just for Dell but probably for the industry as well in terms of client improvement and then also on the server side. I understand some of the pricing is obviously -- which is good and probably sustainable, more richer configs. And then you had some pricing up for DRAM and, obviously, unit growth. So I guess, as you look over your portfolio, how -- it's a good problem to have, but how do you feel about the ability to sustain at least reasonable growth for the next several quarters?",119
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2018",2018-06-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3615.0,1483234.0,58816787.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,43,"Well, look, Shannon, I mean, we're obviously benefiting, as the industry is, around -- there are some broader favorable macroeconomic themes and trends out there, right, GDP expansion across the major economies; an inflation environment that is relatively contained and controlled; an interest rate environment that is, although slightly rising, still, on a historical basis, extraordinarily favorable. So we are benefiting from the macro. I think in terms of broad themes, and we talked about a lot in terms of what's fueling some of the growth rates we're seeing, I'd offer a couple of data points for you. First, I think that -- when you think about the client space, and we're in the midst of a Win 7 to Win 10 transition, you -- there is still several quarters of opportunity there, at least as we see it, as we move forward. And so we're optimistic about that, although we'll have to keep our eye on it clearly. And from a server perspective, as we've talked about, workloads and customers are migrating towards, at many times, solutions and capabilities that are compute-centric. And we're the revenue leader and unit leader in x86 mainstream, and so that plays to our strength. Jeff mentioned some -- the new 14G capabilities that are rolling and some of the feature sets that we're driving. So again, how we manage the business -- so let me be clear about this, right? So we manage for a growth premium to market. So wherever market moves to, we're trying to grow at a premium to the market. So I'm not smart enough to predict where the market's going to be 6 quarters from now. All I will tell you is that our philosophy about managing the business won't change. We want to grow at a premium to market. We want to continue to take share. And whatever that market is, we'll set our growth expectations appropriately, and then we'll modify and adjust the business model as we need to in reaction to some of those market trends that we'll see. So I do think that, absent some macro political shock or something to that effect, we're optimistic about the year, but there's work to do. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. And we've talked about the storage business. We had a good quarter, but it's one data point. We need to put a number of points on the board, and we'll see if we can build a trend. But that's clearly what we're focused on, and we'll continue to execute in the commercial client and in the server space. So we're going to stay focused on what we do and try and drive the business appropriately and balance growth and margin-dollar generation.",459

I don't know enough yet to call that. We're just going to continue to execute, Tom. So Jeff, I don't know if there's anything from your perspective.",104

And I know it's a point of discontinuity, but we've become the unquestioned server leader for the first time in 22.5 years. We plan on continuing to perform at a premium to the marketplace and to continue to grow our share position in the server business and doing it in a reasonable and responsible way. I mentioned synergies, the number of doors that have been opened and our revenue synergies as part of the acquisition. We're going to continue to win business there. We are the technology leader in this category. We're going to continue to be the technology leader in x86 servers, and things are going the x86 server way. Tom talked about it probably 3 or 4 times, software-defined as the new type of technology and modernization of infrastructure. So between hyperconverged where we're the market leader, x86 where we're the market leader, the leader in software-defined, I think it bodes pretty well for the types of trends that we'll see out of our x86 server business and in the additional workloads that are coming to the x86 server. Plus IoT and the number -- the amount of data that's coming and the compute that has to be done on that data particularly around machine learning and artificial intelligence, I think the server business is a good business. It's been very, very good to us. We're absolutely committed to it.",236

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is: our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our second quarter press release and our web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our Q2 10-Q will be filed on Tuesday, September 11. 
As many of you know, on July 2, we announced that we had completed our strategic review and reached an agreement with the Dell Technologies Special Committee of Independent Directors to exchange, subject to Class V common stockholder approval, the outstanding Class V common stock of Dell Technologies for Class C common stock of Dell Technologies or, at the holder's election, cash. We filed our preliminary Form S-4 with the SEC on August 6 and amended S-4 yesterday. We plan to file a definitive S-4 in the coming weeks, at which time we will set a date for the special meeting. 
We will be hosting an Analyst Meeting in New York on September 18. And we'll hold a series of roadshow meetings in the weeks following to meet with investors in one-on-one and group settings across multiple cities. Today's call is intended to discuss the results for our second fiscal quarter. And as such, we will not address nor will we take questions related to the Class V transaction. It's important that we allow the process to play out over the coming weeks. And we look forward to further engagement with DVMT stockholders on this topic. 
Before I turn it over to Tom, I'd like to remind you of a few highlights. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release.
Our Q2 non-GAAP operating income excludes $2.1 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please refer to the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 21 for details on our non-GAAP adjustments. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Now I'll turn it over to Tom.",452
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659833.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. We are at the beginning of a technology-led investment cycle driven by digital transformation. IDC projects worldwide information and communications technology spending will grow at roughly 2x GDP over the next 4 years. We have created Dell Technologies to meet this opportunity head-on. We operate our complementary family of businesses in close coordination to enable our platform to seamlessly deliver differentiated IT solutions, which is driving revenue, synergies and growth that are increasingly reflected in our company performance. 
The results for the second quarter exemplify this point. We delivered another strong quarter of top line velocity, and we hit a number of company records across the business with double-digit revenue growth for all 3 of our reportable segments. We generated strong operating cash flow and made progress paying down core debt. The momentum in server, client and VMware that started building last year has extended into fiscal '19 and we're seeing positive progress in storage. 
GAAP revenue for the quarter was $22.9 billion, up 18% with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $13 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $23.1 billion, up 16%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in servers, storage, commercial and consumer client and VMware. Gross margin was up 13% to $7.1 billion and was 30.6% of revenue, which was down 90 basis points as we saw foreign currency impacts, primarily in emerging markets, and mix dynamics within ISG as server growth continued above 25% for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
Operating expense was $5 billion, up 13% and was 21.4% of revenue, which was down 70 basis points as OpEx grew at a slower rate than revenue. Operating income was up 13% to $2.1 billion or 9.1% of revenue, down 30 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 13% to $2.5 billion or 10.6% of revenue. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion.
Turning to the business segments. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was a record $9.2 billion, up 24%. The increase was driven by a 13% growth in storage to $4.2 billion and a 34% growth in servers and networking to $5.1 billion. We are encouraged by the positive signs we've seen in storage as it delivered its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. And we performed well relative to the rest of the industry. Jeff will discuss this in more detail later in this dialogue. 
We continue to see strong demand for PowerEdge servers, coupled with ongoing expansion of our average selling prices, as customers look for higher compute requirements and more richly configured servers associated with software-defined data center solutions and mission-critical activities and workloads, such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Operating income for ISG was $1 billion or 11% of revenue, which is a 230 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily due to improved storage performance and operating expense leverage. 
Revenue for our Client Solutions Group was up 13% to $11.1 billion, with double-digit growth across both commercial and consumer. Strong revenue growth in commercial notebooks and workstations helped drive commercial revenue up 13% to a record $8.1 billion. Consumer revenue was $3 billion, up 14% as we saw double-digit revenue growth across all of our consumer notebooks and desktops.
CSG operating income was $425 million, down 20% and was 3.8% of revenue. This was lower than our expectations as the team worked through some intra-quarter foreign currency impacts, principally in the emerging market economies. As a reminder, in Q2 last year, CSG operating income benefited from a vendor settlement of approximately $70 million, which improved the operating margin rate by 70 basis points. Normalized for that item, operating income was down approximately 8%. We are pleased with the business trajectory and relative performance. Our long-term operating margin targets have not changed. And we will continue to execute on our profitable growth strategy.
The VMware segment had another strong quarter, delivering $2.2 billion of revenue, which was up 11%. Operating income was $736 million or 33.5% of revenue. Based on VMware's standalone results reported August 23, the company saw broad-based strength across its product portfolio with double-digit license bookings growth year-over-year in compute, management, end-user computing, NSX and vSAN, VxRail. Their software-defined data center strategy in cloud, mobility, networking and security solutions form a powerful digital foundation for delivering the apps that drive business innovation and business success. 
We continue to see strong cross-sell opportunities as we leverage both the Dell Technologies and VMware sales forces. VMware expects to realize an estimated $700 million of incremental annual bookings in fiscal '19 working with Dell Technologies. Revenue from our other businesses, which include Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security, Virtustream and Boomi, was $574 million, up 6%.  
Now turning to cash flow, the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, driven primarily by business momentum and working capital discipline. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion. Excluding the impact of financing receivables, our cash flow from operations would have been $3.1 billion and $10.3 billion for Q2 and the trailing 12 months, respectively. As a reminder, we initially fund DFS financing receivables with cash on hand, so the growth in DFS impacts our cash flow from operations. This impact is offset in cash flow from financing when we subsequently fund it through third-party financing.
Our cash and investments balance was approximately $21.5 billion. Deferred revenue was $21.7 billion, up approximately $3.2 billion year-over-year and growing slightly faster than top line revenue. Deferred revenue growth benefited from increased software and hardware maintenance and continued interest in our flexible consumption models. We believe this growth is a positive indication that our strategy is working as we offer more software and service solutions across the family of businesses.
During Q2, we repaid $2.5 billion of a legacy EMC investment-grade note, as mentioned on the June earnings call, plus another $100 million of amortization, bringing our core debt balance to $37.1 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments, excluding VMware and Pivotal, ended the quarter at $29.9 billion. Total debt was $50.3 billion, down approximately $2.4 billion compared to the prior quarter due to our repayment of the EMC note, partially offset by an increase of approximately $200 million in DFS debt. 
In addition, earlier this week, we prepaid $600 million of our term loan A-3 that matures in December of this year. We intend on repaying the remaining $600 million of the term loan A-3 at maturity using cash from the balance sheet. We are executing on our strategy of paying down core debt. And I am pleased with the steady progress. Since closing the EMC transaction, we've paid down approximately $13.7 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS-related and subsidiary debt, while continuing to make appropriate and timely business investments.
Dell Financial Services had a very strong quarter with record originations of $1.9 billion, which was up 18%. We fund this business predominantly through a combination of securitization, syndication and loans, all collateralized by high-quality financing receivables. We finished Q2 with financing receivables of $8.2 billion, which is up $1.5 billion or 22% compared to Q2 of last year. 
We remain confident around our capital structure. We are comfortable with our cash balances and strong cash flow generation. With our net core debt balance now below $30 billion, we will continue to focus on paying down debt to return to investment grade.
Now let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights for ISG and CSG.",1260
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659834.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter and first half of FY '19. We saw sustained top line momentum across ISG and CSG, where we delivered double-digit revenue growth in each of these segments. 
From the edge to the core to the cloud, digital transformation is now at the forefront of our customers' IT agenda. IDC states that 67% of Global 2000 enterprises now have digital transformation at the center of their corporate strategy. And Dell Technologies is helping our customers navigate the journey and capturing synergy opportunities along the way.
A perfect example of this is with a major tech-forward consumer retailer. During Q2, we completed one of the largest VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure deals in our history, implementing a 1,200-store data center refresh. It was another great win across our teams for Dell and VMware. We also saw a deal with a U.S.-based supermarket chain to replace a competitor when building out a new data center using PowerMax. The company already had Tier 1 applications running VMware workloads, so a great example of the cross-sell opportunities we can drive. These are both great proof points of the synergies we are realizing across the Dell Technologies portfolio and how we're differentiated in what we can offer our customers. 
We are pleased with the progress we've seen in ISG as storage had its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and servers and networking delivered its seventh quarter of year-over-year revenue growth to hit an all-time high of $5.1 billion. We are also pleased with the growth in operating income for ISG, which increased 56% to $1 billion in Q2. 
Storage revenue was up 13% in the quarter. Demand was up in file-based arrays, high-end Storage and Data Protection offerings. Our focus remains on driving velocity in the mid-range as this is a key area of growth in the array segment. We are also seeing ongoing strong demand for our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio and other software-defined offers. Our VxRail and VxRack offerings saw triple-digit growth again this quarter on a demand basis. And VxRail now is above a $1 billion annualized run rate. 
From an industry standpoint, IDC predicted external storage would grow 5.5% on a revenue basis in calendar Q2. IDC Storage Tracker is scheduled to be released later this afternoon. And we expect we will outperform the industry and gain share for the second consecutive quarter when the data is released. Demand for servers remained strong. We became a worldwide leader for x86 servers based on units and revenue in calendar Q3 of last year according to IDC. And based on the results released yesterday for calendar Q2, we again gained share and extended our lead for x86 servers worldwide as our growth outpaced the industry's.
We are advancing our strategy in ISG. Specifically, innovation is accelerating as we simplify the portfolio and focus our investments across fewer solutions to better serve our customers, notably as they look to modernize their IT infrastructure to drive better business outcomes through data-driven artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. We spoke last -- when we spoke last quarter about major product launches at Dell Technology World, including our end-to-end NVMe PowerMax storage solution and new PowerEdge servers built for AI and machine learning workloads. Our innovation engine is driving new solutions and feature enhancements across the portfolio. 
We recently released updates to the Dell EMC Unity and SC Series, enabling customers to easily upgrade their Dell EMC Unity and SC Series All-Flash and Hybrid storage arrays to improve workload performance, storage capacity, data protection and availability. The new Unity Operating Environment boosts file-based replication, data mobility and security capabilities for file and block workloads. And our Unity portfolio now includes CloudIQ, a native cloud-based application that uses predictive analytics and machine learning to proactively provide a comprehensive health score for each array, which helps customers identify, understand and address potential issues in their storage environment. 
We also introduced the Integrated Data Protection Appliance, the DP4400, that brings enterprise-class backup, deduplication, replication and recovery and built-in cloud readiness with disaster recovery and long-term data retention to the cloud. It's simple, powerful data protection for mid-sized organizations with incredible scale on-premise and in the cloud without additional hardware, again all aimed at enabling our customers to make their modern data center transformation a reality in the ways that work for their business today and tomorrow as their data needs grow. 
And we launched the PowerEdge MX, the first modular server designed for the emerging category of disaggregated data center infrastructure. The PowerEdge MX supports a combination of dense virtualization, software-defined storage, software-defined networking, artificial intelligence and big data projects and its unique no mid-plane design enables it to support multiple generations of technology releases, so customers can grow for years to come. The benefits of this system include flexibility to dynamically respond to the changing needs as it leverages a shared pool of compute, storage and networking assets; increases efficiency by creating policies and workflows; and automating them via software tools. It helps companies protect infrastructure and life cycle investments for improved ROI and greater overall business impact.
Turning to CSG. We shipped a record number of units in our second quarter. We saw expansion of average selling prices overall, leading to another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to see strength in our commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations, along with software and peripherals, specifically displays and client peripherals. 
As Tom mentioned, operating income for CSG was lower in the quarter as the team adjusted prices to mitigate foreign currency impacts in certain countries and regions but were unable to offset all of the impacts, especially late in the quarter. From an industry perspective, we outperformed the PC industry in calendar Q2 as we grew 9% compared to the industry at 2.3%. In total, we gained 110 basis points of PC unit share worldwide, marking the 22nd straight quarter of share gains. 
We gained share in notebooks, desktops worldwide as well as in commercial and consumer, which allowed us to reach our highest share positions to date for a total worldwide share of 18.2% and for commercial, where we hit 22.8%. Worldwide workstation units for the industry continued to see strong growth in calendar Q2 with growth in all regions and form factors. We grew 13% and remain the industry-leading provider of workstations with 41% share. 
As the leader in this category, we continue to invest in innovative solutions in this space. In Q2, we announced the world's most powerful one-unit rack workstation and several new tower workstations designed to make it possible for companies of all sizes and budgets to access powerful, affordable and compact industry-leading workstations. 
As I've mentioned on the last couple of calls, client software and peripherals continues to be an area of strength in our business. In Q2, we saw another quarter of double-digit growth in displays and client peripherals. According to DisplaySearch for calendar Q1, we gained 150 basis points of share to hit our 20th consecutive quarter of being the #1 provider of flat-panel displays worldwide. 
Last week, we made several announcements in conjunction with VMworld that are great examples of how we leverage the innovation across Dell Technologies and our position to win from the edge to the core to the cloud. These new solutions and enhanced integrations provide our customers with a unified, seamless experience across PC and mobile devices, software-defined data centers, hyperconverged infrastructures and multi-cloud platforms. The early feedback we've heard from customers and partners has been overwhelmingly positive. 
At the edge, we announced enhancements to the Dell provisioning for VMware Workspace ONE service that enables automatic device setup and extends the efficiencies of cloud management to configuration and deployment. We have simplified PC life cycle management with expanded PC-as-a-Service offerings. And we're improving the scalability and stability for customers from the edge to the core to the cloud with new Dell Internet of Things solutions for surveillance. 
To the core, we're increasing workload capacity, performance scalability and control with the new Dell EMC VxRail G560, which delivers greater density in a 2U form factor. We synchronized Dell EMC VxRail appliance and VMware vSAN update releases, so customers get the latest technology features as quickly as possible to address their rapidly changing business needs. We extended vSAN ReadyNode support to the new Dell EMC PowerEdge MX, which provides a high, flexible platform for vSAN ReadyNodes as HCI building blocks. 
For the cloud, we announced 10 new product enhancements to our cloud portfolio, including the VxRack software-defined data center, pre-integrated and constructed to deliver the latest technology from VMware Cloud Foundation to offer the ultimate infrastructure foundation for realizing a VMware multi-cloud. And finally, we launched a new Dell EMC Cloud Marketplace, bringing the power of the Dell Technologies family together in one place, offering customers a choice of cloud platforms, cloud-enabled infrastructure capabilities, cloud consulting and technology services and cloud consumption models in a self-service portal. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the performance across the business, notably as the strategic decisions we've made in ISG are driving improvement in the business. We have been clear that we still have work to do. And we are continuing to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We look forward to talking more about this at the Analyst Meeting in a couple of weeks.

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659835.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Jeff. Today, we are well positioned as an integrated end-to-end technology provider to better serve our customers. We have many things going well. We are leaders in most of the key segments in which we compete. And we've had good cross-selling momentum and coordinated innovation across the family of businesses. 
We are pleased with our relative performance versus our competitors. Our growth is above the industry in most segments and are encouraged by the first half performance in storage. We've seen great velocity in client, servers, hyperconverged infrastructure and VMware, which has helped drive strong cash flow performance and allowed us to make progress on debt repayment. We've seen improvement in the storage business. And we're pleased with the revenue growth we've seen in storage in the first half of this fiscal year. We still have work to do. But we are confident that the decisions in investments we made are the right ones for the long term. And we're optimistic about our progress to date. 
As we look to the second half of fiscal '19, we want to sustain the growth trajectory even as we fine-tune our business model. We will also continue executing on our strategic areas of focus, which include growing above the market and driving share gains; generating strong cash flow and delevering the balance sheet; executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins; and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities. 
As most of you know, we have not provided guidance since the go-private transaction. And it is not our intention to provide guidance in the future. However, in conjunction with the July second Class V transaction announcement, we thought it was important to provide a framework for performance expectations for this fiscal year. For fiscal '19, given the momentum we've seen year-to-date, we are adjusting the ranges provided on July 2. We now expect non-GAAP revenue between $90.5 billion and $92 billion for the full fiscal year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $8.4 billion and $8.8 billion and non-GAAP net income between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion. 
There are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind. We started seeing signs of momentum beginning in the third quarter of last year. So we will face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the second half of fiscal '19. And we also continue to invest in the business in areas such as sales, R&D and our strategically aligned businesses with these investments layering in during the second half of this fiscal year. We are making these decisions with a disciplined approach and for long-term growth of the company. We are committed to our approach of value creation over the mid- to long term and are not running the company to optimize any particular quarter. 
We are focused on driving improved operating leverage, and we expect sales productivity will continue to ramp beyond fiscal '19, given the investments we've made in our sales force this year. We're confident in how we're managing the business. And we're focused on execution and driving returns on the investments that we've made across the segments. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",546

Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Regina, can you introduce the first question?",15
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659837.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,6,Our first question will come from the line of Thomas Egan with JPMorgan.,13

And I don't think it's a big surprise that you're taking share on the CSG side because you've been doing that for a while. But the share gains that you've been making on the ISG side are something that you hadn't been doing in the past. So I guess, when you talk to your sales force and when you talk to your customers, what exactly is it that they're telling you the reasons that they're switching either from your competitors to you or that you're getting a bigger piece of the pie than everybody else? You threw out a whole bunch of stuff at us today, Tom, Jeff, in products. You talked about flexible pricing. You talked about better service. I just wondered, what is the main driver outside of what -- the tech lift of all boats, what is driving the share gains that you're seeing in storage and servers?",170
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659839.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,8,"Tom, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think there's a one thing. Look, you have a spend environment that's favorable today. You have IT spend that is strong and we continue to see that going forward. The market pundits have certainly suggested that it's going to continue to grow twice GDP over the next handful of years. So you have a favorable spend environment. For us in that favorable spending environment, we have a unique value proposition. Our unique value proposition is from the edge to the core to the cloud that we are a one-stop shop that we can provide a full set of solutions for our customers. That's particularly important as our customers are transforming their business. We talk a lot about this, the digital transformation. Companies are understanding the value of information, turning that information into better business outcomes. And we're providing solutions that help customers navigate from where they've been to being able to work in this, if you will, new way of doing business. And when you think about the combination of our edge devices to our core infrastructure devices and then the solution ability that we've put around that and the power of Dell Technologies and the entire portfolio, it's a very differentiated set of capabilities that our customers can get from us. And we're seeing that across the board. The synergies, whether it be our leadership position in virtualization, primary storage, data protection, CI, HCI, now the undisputed leader in servers for 4 consecutive quarters, the position that we've had on the PC side, again I think it's about our offers, the differentiated solution, our go-to-market ability to talk to and cover many customers. That package together, I think, is certainly leading to why we're distancing ourselves collectively in the industry. You know we've made a lot of changes in our storage or primary storage business over the past year. The product line is certainly far more competitive today. The innovation engine is accelerating with a number of product announcements. We're openly embracing the cloud. Tom and I have referenced, I think, in the 4 calls that I've been on the investments we've made in coverage and capacity. So our go-to-market model continues to be very, very robust and we're investing. I think that combination -- Tom, anything you'd add to that?",393

I think you've done -- look, there's work to do. So nobody's declaring victory here, by the way. But I think we've seen good progress. There's obviously things that we're focused on improving. But I would point back to since the EMC transaction, we have done a series of investments, whether it's in product capability, solution capability, the go-to-market coverage models that we're building out. I think those are key differentiators as we are able to reach the customer base in a more precise and targeted way. So look, Tom, there's more work to do here, so -- but I think we're generally pleased with the progress we're making.",115

And then for my follow-up, I know you don't want to talk about the transaction and all, but you left the door open a little bit when you said that you're looking forward to engaging with DVMT shareholders. So I wondered outside of the Analyst Day that you've got coming up, is there a formal process? Or are you just talking about normal course of business?",67

Yes, we'll have the Analyst Meeting on the 18th. And then we will be on the road on the following week, the week of the 24th and then the week of the 1st of October. We'll be in multiple cities meeting one-on-one and in group meetings with shareholders, DVMT shareholders. In addition to that, as we move towards a definitive proxy filing and past the definitive proxy filing, I do expect that there will be ongoing conversations that will be in person and by the phone across the spectrum of the special committee and management team talking and engaging with DVMT shareholders. So we do expect that we'll have multiple opportunities over the course of the next, call it, 6 weeks or so or more. And we do want to make sure that we let the process play out appropriately and give everyone an opportunity to be heard and for the company to also make its case for Dell Technologies and core Dell Technologies. And we'll do that at the Analyst Meeting.",177

Do you think is being driven by some of the movements? And sort of where you think you are within the plan, are you on track? Or do you think you'd maybe expand it a bit? Then I have a follow-up.",89

Tom will add to this, I'm certain. I think if you evaluate 2 quarters in, we're pleased where we've seen the momentum on our storage business. As we have referenced before, we made comp plans targeting the sales force to be more -- or to emphasize our higher-margin products. I think we're pleased that it's working that way. I think our performance this quarter is indicative of that. We expect later this afternoon for a very positive sign from share gains in the external storage marketplace. So again, I think encouraged, pleased that it's beginning to work, particularly given our exit rate last year. We'll continue to tweak it, making sure that we get the right performance across all geographies and all segments in the business. But I think if we reflect on the velocity that we've built in the first half of the year, certainly given our previous performance, we're in the ballpark of where we want to be. We've consistently said that we want to outperform the segment. As reported this afternoon, we're pretty positive that will be 2 in a row. So it's working as planned but more tweaking to do, I think.",197

I would echo that. I do think it's reasonable progress. I think Jeff has done a nice job working with the ISG team around product launch, solution capability, feature functionality. And he's continuing to drive that pretty hard with the innovation that he's pushing. I do expect that we'll continue to invest in the coverage model as it relates to storage though. And I think some of the conversations we've had, I think we have been pretty transparent about that. We'll continue to build out our investment, particularly in the go-to-market capability, so that we're covering the customers in the coverage ratios that we want and that we're working with the appropriate sort of lineup of specialty sales capability as well. So again, I am reasonably happy with how it's gone to date. There's stuff that we're clearly working on. But I think what you're hearing us say now is that we'll continue to fine-tune it and work towards continuing to build acceleration.",167

There's been a tremendous amount of improvement in the capability of our performance over the last year. I'm pretty excited about our ability to compete in the external storage marketplace. You couple that with the leadership position we have in servers, HCI and CI, it bodes well. If I link it back to the first question from Tom, this notion of digital transformation and customers wanting to buy a total solution from one partner, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the spending trends going forward.",168

That was helpful. And then on the client side, you've had several quarters of strong performance. Can you just give us an idea of where you think we are in terms of some of the Windows 10 upgrade cycle or share gains? I think our expectation is that will continue for a while. But just beyond that, what are some of the trends you're seeing in the PC market? And how sustainable is it, the growth rates that we've seen?",81
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 06, 2018",2018-09-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3925.0,1562902.0,61659849.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,18,"Well, I think, first and foremost, it is a market that consolidates. It will continue to consolidate and we've been a consolidator. The top 3 manufacturers, if memory serves me right, is roughly 64% share of the industry. We've been a huge benefactor of that over the past 5-plus years, culminating into what are some pretty impressive numbers for us this quarter, record shipments, record revenue, the highest share position we've had at 18.2%. Overall, the highest share position we've had in commercial PCs at 22.8%. There's a lot of momentum behind that. And you know with our model, when we're selling commercial PCs, there's a lot of drag around that with financing, software and peripherals and our services attached, attached, attached, which is uniquely something that we do, I think, over our competition. So I like that backdrop. I see the industry continuing to operate roughly where it's been. So let's call it a flat industry. It's going to consolidate. And we're going to continue to grow in that marketplace and outperform. We were the fastest-growing of the top 3 in Q1 and in Q2. I think we can continue to drive that momentum. And I think we still have a bit of a tailwind of Windows 10 for the next 1.5 years. It's hard for me to tell you exactly where we are in terms of Windows 10 conversion. But I suspect our data suggests we're about halfway through with halfway to go, which is 6 quarters. And that's about right.",253

It's under the mantra of how do we modernize the PC experience. And our recent announcement with Workspace ONE, being able to do deployment of product, configuration of product in a very modern way with our collaboration VMware is very healthy. We extended that with PC-as-a-Service and building the offerings that we have there. I'm optimistic, Shannon, that we can continue to grow this business, continue to be a consolidator. We would also tell you not all share is equivalent. You know where we focus our business. We're biased towards the commercial PC side. We love the gaming sector. We love the high-end consumer sector. Those are important to us.",112

Let me take the first part of that and then I'll have Jeff maybe address the gaming comment or question that you also asked. So from a long-term framework of how we think about the financial framework, I think what we've been saying is that we want to run the CSG business roughly in an operating margin percentage somewhere between 4.8% to 5.2%. Obviously, if you look at the results for this quarter, we're below that. We've been above it -- on it or above it in the prior quarters. As we mentioned in the talking points, we did see some currency dynamics, particularly in Brazil, China in the third -- or in the second quarter that we priced through -- we took pricing actions but couldn't catch it fast enough, so -- but it doesn't change our point of view on ultimately where we were going to run this business and how we think about the business. So that's how we're framed and we'll continue to drive the business forward and make sure we take the appropriate actions to get -- to bring us back into alignment, where we want to be. And then Jeff, on the gaming, maybe you want to try...",208

But those last changes just make it difficult to catch within period. Switching to gaming, as the leader in the sector, I haven't seen a pull-ahead. Our business is performing quite well. We're outperforming the overall segment, great adoption of our Alienware platform and our Inspiron gaming platforms. We continue to see -- and we're going to continue to refresh those platforms and see strong demand globally for gaming.",76

And then for my follow-up question, I wondered if you could talk about the potential effect from the next round of tariffs that's currently being contemplated, how much of that you think you could either pass through or other ways you can mitigate the impact?

Look, we've had a sense of where the tariffs are going to be. Our financial plan contemplates that. There is no change in our guidance.

So back to the original question of tariffs, clearly we're in the camp of pro-free trade. That's important to us. That said, we successfully mitigated the first 2 lists. Our supply chain has been unbelievably resilient. And as we have gone through the third list, that resiliency of our supply chain that's global in nature gives us tremendous flexibility. We do a lot of work planning around business continuity and role-playing different scenarios that would have us change where we build our products. And that planning is serving us quite well now. We've repositioned material. We've repositioned products. And we're taking advantage of our North America footprint. That's what we need to do. That's what the third list is requiring us to migrate to. So the North America capacity and capability we have today, we've made decisions a little while ago to make sure that we are timely implementation of when we think the list will go into effect. And we see minimal impact to our business. That said, there are some costs that we won't be able to mitigate, and we'll see some change in pricing for some classes of products over time.",195

As we look at that and as we plan our way through that, I would expect that we perhaps could see some growth in inventory as a result of that as we reposition product and parts.

It's a great question, but our level of visibility in terms of where the infrastructure is going varies depending upon selling motion and channel. So we don't have good data on that other than the relative trends that we see as we talk with our customers around their investment, whether it's modernizing their classic data center or modernizing for AI/ML, big data analytic-type capabilities. So I don't have data that would -- I'd feel comfortable sharing, just given I would guess the softness of the trends. But I will tell you that there's clearly, as Jeff highlighted, interest and customer demand for the type of capabilities and solutions we're driving, given the business model evolutions that are happening with our customers. And so we do feel bullish in the long run about the spend environment. And we would look to the IDC data as reinforcement of that. But for real detailed trends on what percentage of the spend -- of the revenue is going into specific applications or workloads, Jeff, I don't -- we don't have that data at that level.",184

We see the average CPU, the average memory, the average SSD that we put in a server is greater today that it was a year ago, which for us tells that we're selling deeper into the data center and up the workload stack. And workloads like artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving richer servers. So I know that's a loose correlation. But in our view, when we see the ASP increase that we've seen and the types of customers that are deploying this or buying these servers, it's certainly an indicator to us that we're selling deeper into the data center and into these new, richer workloads.",114

And then as a follow-up, is there anything that we should read into the fact that the fiscal '19 revenue guidance increase largely just flowed through the 2Q beat and not necessary a lot of upside over the next couple of quarters? Are tougher comps, currency, some of those factors playing into that? Or is there just some conservatism as you look into the remainder of the year?",70

Look, I think we feel reasonably comfortable about the velocity in the business right now. Obviously, there are tougher comps, as I called out, in the back half of the year as you look -- as we saw where the acceleration really started in the third quarter of fiscal '18. Look, I think we feel good about the state of the business. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of the business velocity. And look, it's still a very competitive and dynamic market, and there's -- but I think overall, we feel pretty comfortable about it. So I would just tell you that we'll see how the business progresses as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. But on an annual basis, when you look at just the overall growth of a company of this size, I think it's a pretty good number. And so we'll continue to drive it forward and then we'll see how it progresses.",169

Are you still introducing new products that you think will drive share gains? Or is it where it needs to be?",66

The PowerMax that we introduced in May, the PowerMax 2000 that we've recently introduced, bringing NVMe to price bands 7 and 8 are very important steps for us to have the most competitive portfolio on the marketplace. What we're doing in HCI and the new announcements we've made there, taking cloud capabilities and doing cloud data migration, cloud, if you will, management of our arrays, doing additions of our arrays in the cloud, those are all important attributes of what our customers are asking for and increasing the competitiveness of our portfolio. It's a journey. It's a journey that we've accelerated. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made to date. There's more to do. I've been very clear in these calls that we still have more mid-range products than we'd like long term. It takes a while to develop a new mid-range product in which we are focused on and committed to have next year. And in the interim, we're going to fight with the portfolio we have and increasingly make it more and more competitive, which is what we're doing. So I like the steps there. I like the steps that we've made to simplify it. Behind the curtain, so to speak, there are more developers today working on new technologies and innovating as one single team than we had a year ago. Something I think I've mentioned several times on these calls about the benefits of simplification and focus is getting the very best storage engineers in the industry all focused, working together, driving differentiation and innovation in future products. We're going to continue to do that. As I mentioned moments ago, I think, with Shannon, we'll make another introduction of a new product next week, hint, hint. We're going to continue to do this. We are going to be competitive in the primary storage space. The same is true in data protection. We've recently introduced the DP4400, our Integrated Data Protection Appliance. We just continue to improve the hyperconverged offering with the new VxRail that we just launched. So I guess, that's my long-winded way is we're committed to innovation, committed to building the best products. I think we have the engine now working in a way that's going to do that at a very accelerated rate. And I'm very encouraged.",421

So one of the areas as we diagnosed the business challenges 18 months ago was we didn't have enough coverage. And so even as Jeff's cleaned up and is driving a product simplification, innovation story, we are still looking at coverage models. We've improved them in the commercial selling organization tremendously. We're mid-range through an investment cycle in the enterprise, selling organization in terms of storage coverage. And we're going to continue to add to that as we get to what we believe are the right coverage ratios to ensure that we're telling our story as effectively as we can and getting it in front of the customers in a way that's appropriate. We're also making investments in our channel go-to-market storage programs to ensure that with our valued channel partners that we're reaching the customer base that we want to reach. So it's sort of a multipronged effort, product, coverage, marketing positioning, compensation programs, all designed to drive the storage framework forward.",191

If memory serves me right, we grew 10% in storage in Q1, 13% this quarter. We took share in Q1. I expect when the data comes out this afternoon that we'll have taken share in Q2. To me, those are encouraging signs that we're -- again, Tom said it, we're investing in capacity, improving the competitiveness of the portfolio, have some products like the PowerMax that is the unquestioned leader in the marketplace. And the indicators are good. Typical, without saying, we're pleased but not satisfied.",94

And just my follow-up, Tom, just on the margin outlook. And I know you provided the guidance. When we look at sort of the puts and takes, I mean, you talked before about commodity costs potentially being modestly deflationary this year. How do you see that now with the environment with NAND and DRAM? And what are some of the other dynamics? Clearly, you're investing in the channel and other areas. But I know that 4Q is a very strong quarter typically. And you get a lot of operating leverage there. So just wondering with the solid revenue growth in ISG, what kind of leverage there might be.",109

Hey, look, Jeff, I mean, I think if we step back and think about the guidance we gave you relative to, say, first half performance and last year, I think it denotes a couple of things. One is that we do see a bit tougher comparison in the back half. So obviously, the revenue trajectory on a year-over-year growth basis, back half to back half, is a little bit lighter than what you saw in the first half. But I think that's, I think, where we are with the visibility that we have right now. We are going to layer in some investments in the back half of the year in selling as we've talked about and in some of the product capability. So there is a bit of increased cost coming in. Offsetting that, I do think that commodity costs are going to be flat to slightly deflationary as we look at the back half of the year. Particularly, DRAM has started to come back a little bit for us. So we're working through that dynamic as well. And that's not going to be the headwind that we had a year ago. So Q4 historically has been a strong quarter. We'll have to see how it plays out this year. But I think we're reasonably optimistic about how the year is setting up. I don't want to declare victory. There's still a lot of things that we've got to go do and execute to. But I think the overall framework we gave you is one of -- one that denotes growth, denotes that while profitability may be slow in the back half relative to the first half, we're going to grow operating margin dollars year-over-year, even while we're investing for the long term. So that's the frame that we're running. And I feel, I think, pretty good about where we are at this point in time.",318

So the average SSD, the average amount of memory that we put in the server, specific CPU that we put in a server today is either higher-performing or more capacity, depending on which one of those technologies that I'm talking about. That bodes well as a, I think, marker for us being able to hold our business in this area. Do I think we're going to continue to see the ASP expansion that we've seen over the past handful of quarters? No. Because as you know, there's some of that, that's driven by the commodity increase. But what is sustainable is selling deeper into the data center, taking on bigger workloads with our server portfolio and ultimately driving a richer, a more richer config product in the marketplace. So I'm pretty bullish on our ability to continue to do that.",177

We'll see how the market reports this afternoon. But we certainly grew all-flash. We are the all-flash leader. I think that will continue to be the case when this afternoon's numbers are posted. So I'm encouraged what we're doing there. And it's an important category. And you'll continue to see us invest the PowerMax 2000 allows us to continue to drive demand in all-flash, particularly in those 2 price bands that we hadn't been covering before with the PowerMax. So I think that's a good sign. We did see in the quarter, I think we didn't note it, good performance in the high end, good performance in the unstructured category and our storage business and certainly the data protection business.

Good afternoon and evening, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our third quarter press release and web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our third quarter 10-Q will be filed on Monday, December 10.
Let me take a moment to address the pending class V transaction. Following extensive outreach and engagement, on November 15, we announced amendments to the proposed Class V common stock transaction. We filed a supplemental to our definitive Form S-4 on November 26, and we are scheduled to hold a special meeting and stockholder vote on Tuesday, December 11 at 8:00 a.m. Central time. We expect to announce stockholder approval of the transaction on December 11. So today, November 29, would be the first day of the 17-day measurement period for the determination of the volume weighted average price of the Class V common stock. This volume-weighted average price will be used to determine the final exchange ratio to be used in connection with the Class V transaction. In this scenario, we expect the transaction to close in this calendar year with the projected close date and first day of trading for the Class C common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol DELL on December 28.
Before I turn it over to Tom, I'd like to remind you of a few items. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release.
Our Q3 non-GAAP operating income includes $2.4 billion of adjustment. A large portion of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please refer to the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 22 for details of our non-GAAP adjustments. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year unless otherwise specified.
Finally, I would like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

Today, Dell Technologies has assembled a broad set of capabilities that are differentiated within the industries and drive an attractive financial model. We are running the business in a disciplined way for the long term, with our primary focus on relative growth and share gain and the optimization of cash flow. Our capital structure is efficient, drives flexibility, and we continue to focus our capital allocation framework on debt reduction. We are in the midst of a technology-led investment cycle driven by digital transformation and the enormous amount of data that is getting created every day. Our focus and investments are centered on data and the enablement through our technologies to help our customers digitally transform and drive their businesses forward. We are investing for long-term growth. We believe we have a differentiated portfolio in its breadth and capability, and our customers increasingly see us as a key partner to meet their needs from the edge to the core to the cloud, which is showing up in our results. We delivered another strong quarter of top line velocity as all 3 of our reportable segments delivered double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
GAAP revenue for the quarter was $22.5 billion, up 15%, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $356 million. As Rob mentioned in his introductory comments, there are many adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results. I do want to call out a $190 million goodwill impairment related to Virtustream due to a reset of the long-term business model as we streamline the product portfolio.
Non-GAAP revenue was $22.7 billion, up 14%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in servers, commercial client and VMware. Gross margin was up 8% to $7 billion and was 30.9% of revenue, which was down 170 basis points due to mix dynamics within ISG as server results continue to be strong and foreign exchange impacts and supply chain headwinds within CSG.
Operating expense was $4.9 billion, up 13% and was 21.8% of revenue as our investments layered in, which is consistent with our comments on the Q2 call regarding the back half of this year. As a reminder, these investments are principally focused on go-to-market coverage expansion. Operating income was down 2% to $2.1 billion or 9.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.4 billion or 10.7% of revenue. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion.
Turning to the business segments. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was $8.9 billion, up 19%. The increase was driven by a 30% growth in servers and networking to $5.1 billion and 6% growth in storage to $3.9 billion. This marked the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth for storage as we continue to make progress. Quite frankly, we would have liked to have seen higher growth in storage this quarter, but we do believe we have taken the right actions to drive meaningful long-term improvements in the storage business. We are pleased with the overall server velocity. We continue to see strong demand for our PowerEdge server products and significant increases in server average selling prices, driven by increased acceptance of our 14th generation products and increases in memory and storage content.
Operating income for ISG was $935 million or 10.5% of revenue which is down 100 basis points. Similar to the past few quarters, we continue to see a mix shift within ISG to the strength in servers which impacted our overall ISG operating margin percentage.
Revenue for the Client Solutions Group was up 11% to $10.9 billion. Commercial revenue grew 12% to $7.6 billion, driven by balanced double-digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $3.3 billion, up 8% primarily due to strength in notebooks. 
CSG operating income was $447 million or 4.1% of revenue. Operating income was down 29% against a stronger prior period. And though an improvement from Q2, it was still lower than our expectations as the team navigated through foreign exchange and supply chain headwinds. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the business trajectory and relative performance, and we'll continue to focus on relative growth and improving profitability through pricing and go-to-market execution around product mix and attach. 
The VMware segment had another strong quarter, delivering $2.2 billion of revenue which was up 15%. Operating income was $768 million or 34.5% of revenue. Based on VMware standalone results reported earlier today, the company had license revenue growth of 17%, driven by broad portfolio strength with license bookings growth up double digits for NSX, in VC and in VxRail and up high single digits for end-user computing and core software-defined data center. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security, Virtustream and Boomi, was $583 million, up 5%.
Now I'll turn it over to Tyler to walk you through our capital structure.",805

In the third quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $833 million. It is typical that cash flow was lower in Q3 due to the seasonal decline in revenue, and this follows a strong cash performance we saw in Q2. In addition, Q3 cash flow was impacted by higher inventory as a result of overall business growth, holiday seasonality and supply chain dynamics. We expect these working capital dynamics to be temporary, but the impacts could last a few more quarters.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $7.7 billion, and we ended Q3 with a cash and investments balance of approximately $20.4 billion. Deferred revenue was $22.1 billion, up approximately $3.3 billion year-over-year and growing slightly faster than top line revenue. Deferred revenue growth reflects higher hardware and software maintenance from growth in the business.
During Q3, we repaid $1.2 billion of debt, which included prepaying the outstanding balance of our term loan A3 scheduled to mature in December of this year, plus another approximately $100 million of amortization. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $36.2 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments, excluding unrestricted subsidiaries, ended the quarter at $30.2 billion. Total debt decreased to $49.4 billion, down approximately $940 million compared to the prior quarter due to our debt repayment, partially offset by an increase of approximately $350 million in DFS debt. Dell Financial Services originations were $1.6 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as the business begins to normalize after the EMC integration. We finished the third quarter with financing receivables of $8.1 billion, which was up $1.1 billion or 16% compared to Q3 of last year. These receivables are funded by $7.1 billion of noncore debt, mainly through securitization.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, let me touch on a couple of points related to the Class V transaction and capital allocation. Assuming investors elect the maximum cash option, our overall cash and investments balance will decline approximately $11 billion in Q4 due to the VMware special dividend paid to stockholders. In addition, as disclosed in our November 15 press release announcing the revised Class B transaction, we have received commitments for up to $5 billion of bridge financing, so our debt balance will increase when we close the transaction, assuming investors elect the maximum cash option. Regarding the permanent financing related to the bridge, we will take a prudent approach minimizing our cost of capital while maintaining a manageable maturity profile.
We remain committed to deleveraging and achieving investment grade ratings from the rating agencies, but we acknowledge that timing may now be delayed. We believe the incremental debt associated with this unique transaction is appropriate. Hoping to further align economic and the equity interest within Dell Technologies as we look at the long-term framework of the company. We will continue to run the same financial model built around free cash flow generation which has enabled a significant amount of deleveraging to date. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with the majority being used to reduce debt. Since closing the EMC transaction, we've paid down approximately $14.4 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS-related and subsidiary debt, while continuing to make appropriate and timely business investments.
As we look forward to FY '20, our intent is to pay down the full $4.8 billion coming due using a combination of free cash flow generation, balance sheet cash and short-term revolver draw. We will also continue to evaluate refinancing opportunities as we optimize our capital structure.
With that, let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss the operational highlights for ISG and CSG.",610
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2018",2018-11-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3395.0,1621967.0,63885945.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tyler, and good evening, everyone. At our Analyst Day in September, you heard us talk about the data era, and that -- and how that data is creating new opportunities and trends in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and edge computing. The data era is creating a new set of IT requirements in how that data is managed, stored, analyzed, secured and protected, presenting an exciting opportunity for Dell Technologies. We are seeing this opportunity translate into our businesses, adding more than 75,000 new buyers year-to-date across our commercial enterprise sales organizations.
Moving to the businesses. We are pleased with the results for the ISG segment, which delivered its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Storage had its third straight quarter of positive growth and servers and networking delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of growth. ISG operating income grew 7% to $935 million, which was slower than revenue growth but consistent with the server, storage and mix dynamics within ISG.
Storage revenue was up 6% in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in demand for high-end, file-based and all-flash storage. As Tom said, we would have liked to have seen our storage business grow faster. We continue to focus on accelerating the velocity and midrange storage through significant investments in our go-to-market engine to increase capacity and coverage, focused innovation to increase the competitiveness of the portfolio and working towards a new midrange product that is expected to be available by the end of next year.
We continue to see strong demand for our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio and other software-defined offers. Our VxRail offering saw triple-digit growth again this quarter -- of this quarter on a demand basis, and now is well above a $1 million -- $1 billion run rate. For servers, we are pleased with the continued strength of our business. We saw double-digit growth in both server units and the average selling prices. IDC is forecasting continued growth and TAM expansion as their expected revenue growth of 24% from mainstream servers for calendar year 2018.
We are advancing our multi-cloud strategy with a broad portfolio of solutions and services supporting hybrid, on- and off-premise private and public cloud offerings, and Dell is -- Dell EMC is the #1 IT infrastructure provider in the world, offering a wide variety of cloud platforms, cloud-enabled infrastructure, consumption models and services all from one place.
Shifting to CSG. We had another strong quarter of a double-digit revenue growth in our commercial notebooks, desktops, workstations and our high-end consumer notebooks. Client software and peripherals continue to be a highlight with double-digit revenue growth in displays and high single-digit growth in client peripherals. Operating income from CSG continues to be a focus area as we focus -- or as we focus on balanced growth and profitability while managing through a few external headwinds, including foreign exchange fluctuation and supply chain challenges.
We are pleased to see CSG profitability improve quarter-over-quarter, and we are able -- excuse me, as we are able to successfully manage some of the macro headwinds already discussed through repricing, and we saw a slight deflationary cost environment that helped us.
Looking at the broader PC industry. Unit growth was 0.2% for calendar Q3, according to IDC. Dell significantly outperformed the worldwide industry growing units 5.8% in calendar Q3, delivering above-industry growth in desktops, notebooks and in total commercial PCs. We increased our global PC share on a year-over-year basis for the 23rd consecutive quarter as we gained 90 basis points of unit share gain -- or unit share worldwide.
We continue to believe the industry is in a Windows 10 refresh cycle. We are the industry leader on workstations and displays worldwide. In calendar Q3, according to IDC, Dell outgrew the industry workstation units with 13% growth. We saw positive year-over-year growth in every region and double-digit growth in both fixed and mobile workstation form factors. For displays, Dell outgrew the industry in calendar Q3 based on display search data to maintain its #1 ranking for the 22nd consecutive quarter.
We are focused on modernizing IT through innovation to drive better business outcomes using data-driven artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies. We offer massively scalable, easily managed, high-performance systems that can support both traditional and data intensive emerging workflows for multiple use cases and verticals, including automotive, financial services, manufacturing and health care. And we do this in a landscape that continues to evolve with more and more data being generated at the edge. Our end-to-end portfolio positions us and our customers well to take on these opportunities in the data era.
We continue to collaborate with VMware and have aligned our development teams around 6 key innovation areas to bring higher value software to our customers. The areas include: compute; software-defined storage; software-defined networking, hyperconverged, cloud and Workspace ONE. Earlier this month, at VMworld Europe, we announced enhancements to the VxRail and the VxBlock System 1000 designed to help customers further automate their operations of their operations in the modern data center in their hybrid cloud environments. This collaboration, along with the work that we are doing with SecureWorks, Boomi and RSA, is a clear example how we are truly Better Together, deliver best-in-class solutions for our customers.
In closing, earlier this month, we met with industry analysts in Chicago and the response to our strategy and custom positioning was very positive. We are pleased with the performance in the business so far this year and remain focused on executing our strategy as we finish out FY '19 and look ahead to FY '20. We made the right decisions for long-term growth and are confident we have the broadest and most advanced portfolio to help customers with their digital transformations.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.",963
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2018",2018-11-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3395.0,1621967.0,63885946.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Jeff. Looking forward, we are confident in the business. Customer receptivity to the Dell Technologies set of solutions is strong. And the global macroeconomic environment is still positive, albeit with headwinds as we look around the globe. Overall, we're optimistic about the market opportunity, and we will continue executing our strategic areas of focus. As a reminder, these include: growing above the market and driving share gains; generating strong cash flow and delevering the balance sheet; executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth, margins; and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities.
As we look to close out fiscal '19, our guidance for the full year is unchanged: we expect non-GAAP revenue of between $90.5 billion and $92 billion; non-GAAP operating income between $8.4 billion and $8.8 billion; and non-GAAP net income between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion. While still very early in the quarter, for the full year, we are trending slightly below the midpoint of the range for revenue and slightly above the midpoint of the range for operating income.
Given the pending Class V transaction, I want to touch on fiscal '20 and beyond. The long-term financial framework that we provided at the September analyst meeting remains the same. We expect to update our fiscal '20 framework during our earnings call in March. However, here are some early thoughts that I'd like you to consider.
First, we will have an accounting change related to the new leasing standard beginning in Q1. The standard will result in more of the leases Dell originates being accounted for as operating leases, with the associated hardware revenue recognized over time versus upfront in a capital-leased transaction. The leasing standard is prospective, not retroactive for this change, and the impacts will depend upon the mix of the business and other factors.
Our current FY '20 estimate for this new standard will reduce revenue by between $500 million and $1.5 billion and reduce operating income by between $150 million to $250 million. There's no impact on cash, and EBITDA is expected to be marginally higher given the new depreciation will be slightly more than the gross margin reduction in fiscal '20. The P&L impact should normalize over a 3-year period.
Second, we continue to invest in the business in areas such as sales, R&D and our strategically aligned businesses, with these investments layering in during the second half of the current fiscal year and the first part of fiscal '20. We are making these decisions with a disciplined approach and for the -- and for long-term growth of the company, and we expect to start seeing the return on these investments, particularly in sales productivity, as the year progresses.
Third, given the size of our Dell Technologies Capital ventures portfolio, we could experience variability quarter-to-quarter in financing and other due to the mark-to-market accounting rules that went into effect this year. Lastly, pending the continued issuance of regulatory guidance on tax reform, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.
In closing, we look forward to the stockholder vote on December 11. We believe that the Class V transaction will afford Class B stockholders the opportunity to participate in the future value creation of Dell Technologies through ownership of the Class C common stock. We have made significant investments to position our company to achieve sustainable, long-term growth by creating a leading global end-to-end technology provider with significant scale and comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and services -- service solutions.
As we have communicated in the past, we are managing and running the business for the long term, and we'll make the appropriate investments to ensure we are well positioned for future growth as we enable our customers to meet their business needs of tomorrow.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",653

But I think the -- I think this is the first time we've seen the 14% operating margin guidance for the ISG segment. Could you talk a little bit about expectations for -- I know growing storage is probably your primary growth objective at this point. But how much does it have to outgrow servers and networking to get to that 14% margin over time?",85

This is Tom. Good question. Look, the way we think about it is we have P&L framework as we think about the various pieces of our business and the various aspects of our business. And so long term, we have a North Star P&L construct for the ISG business that migrates profitability up as we've highlighted in that guidance. And the 2 key drivers around that guidance are going to be the continued growth of storage that we've -- we've had 3 straight quarters now of year-over-year growth in storage. And the longer-term frameworks says that we have to roughly recapture about 60% to 70% of the share loss that we experienced over that -- the previous, I guess, almost 4 years before we started turning the corner this year. And so there is a growth dynamic there within the storage space. The other dynamic around that quite frankly is around -- continuing to migrate up server profitability over time as we talked about in the past. And the actions that we have underway around that as we continue to make sure that our server business is positioned, not only for today, but for the 2021, 2023 time frame.",201

So as Tom said, we lost a share, the business had been declining 15 of the 16 previous quarters. We now have 3 quarters in a row of revenue growth: 10% in Q1, 13% in Q2, 6% in Q3, which at 330 basis points of share in Q1, 100 basis points of share in Q2, we expect, based on what we know, to be able to take share in Q3. We have a trend. In my words and Tom and I often have this conversation, we've stabilized the business that was in decline. We have work to do to continue to grow, and we've talked about this the last several calls. Part of the growth plan is investing in sales capacity and coverage to grow the buyer base. We are committed to grow the buyer base. We need more storage buyers and we are putting in the capacity in both our enterprise and commercial sales organizations to do so. The second linchpin of that was to improve the overall competitiveness of the product. We have done that over the last 14 months increasingly improving the wide, our broad portfolio starting with the refresh of the PowerMax product, the high-end -- highest-performing storage array in the marketplace today and a number of performance improvements along the -- over the years. That is the foundation for us to grow as we move through this framework. The other part of our ISG operating income improvement needs to be continued server improvement. We've talked about this as well, moving up to the higher workloads for the higher margins. We have an internal program that we call server business transformation, which is fundamentally getting us to fit to fight, making our business model more competitive and allowing us to move into the higher value workloads that are emerging today that carry better margins. That's what we're working on.",322

I think there were -- or several questions in there. If you think about the framework that we've communicated publicly about our PC business, it's a framework of outperforming the relative -- on a relative basis, outperforming the industry. Roughly 115 basis points. If you look at that as fundamentally how do we perform relative to the rest of the industry, we put that framework in place, you know we're driving this business and the consolidation that is occurring in the PC industry that we are driving it for profit, driving it for scale and driving it for cash flow. Those are the strategic tenets of the business, with a strong influence of innovation to drive differentiation across our various platforms. We do have some headwinds. You named the 3 of them. That's certainly -- I called out there's some supply chain headwinds in the quarter, there's some foreign currency headwinds in the quarter. And clearly, we didn't call out tariffs. There's certainly uncertainty with the tariff picture, but we've successfully, with our supply chain, the optionality that we have, have navigated the current list for tariffs quite successfully. You may not know most of our desktops are already built in North America anyway, so we didn't have a bunch of hurdles to jump through. And where we have incurred in higher cost with tariffs, we have passed that through to end users. Interestingly, we haven't seen an impact or no apparent impact to demand as we've done that. Does that help?",253

It's the performance in the midrange of our portfolio. I believe I've called out we had double-digit performance in high end, and our unstructured portfolio and our all-flash portfolio. It is the midrange portfolio that didn't grow to the degree that we would've liked. It's where we put the most effort in innovation to close the competitive gaps that we would have had over the past year. We feel very good where the portfolio is today as we head into next year. And we think that, combined with this increased capacity and coverage and a focus on increasing the buyer base, is how we're going to drive and grow the storage business into next year. Mind you, it still grew 6%. And given our relative comparison over the last 4 years, I put this into the pleased but certainly not satisfied category. But again, we've stabilized the business with 3 consecutive quarters of growth.",166

Just -- because, look, I'm not smart enough -- or we're not smart enough to call the market what it looks like in FY '20 or '21 or '22, per se. We use IDC and some other third-party industry analysts to help us frame the market opportunity. But then -- but our vision is whatever the market is, we want to grow at a premium to that. Having said that, look, I mean, we continue to think there's some continued efficiency in the cost structure that needs to happen. And I think I've talked about that in the past in the context of, one, we made significant investments back into the business, particularly around go-to-market selling capacity. And so that capacity needs to come up the productivity curve that was in the business case that were presented to us that we approved, which drove the investment. Now to date, as we tracked out those cohorts that have come in from a sales capacity perspective, they are on that productivity curve. But it's early, and that's why you heard me talk about in my framework around FY '20, some thoughts around, hey, look, we knew the back half of this year and early next year was going to be -- we'll have some cost dynamics there as that investment ramps, and we expect that to improve as we go through the year. So we will continue to look for cost efficiencies and drive cost efficiencies. And if you know our history, we have a history of taking out appropriate cost when we need to and making sure that P&L works the way we wanted to work. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities as we move forward. But we do believe, by and large, as it relates to storage in particular, that the opportunity there is growth. And that we need to get back on a consistent, premium-to-market growth trajectory that will allow us to recapture some -- a fair amount of the share loss that we experienced over the last number of years. So that's the playbook that we're running right now.",368

The first part on global economic environment and headwinds. The reality is to date, not really -- other than a few concentrated spots, where perhaps there's been a slight investment pause in certain classes of customers, and a good example of that is U.K. public, given the Brexit dynamic. But in general, not yet. Why I said it the way I said it, though, was because as we look into next year, one, if you flash back 9 months ago, the environment was uniformly positive, right. And there wasn't a lot of chatter around interest rate dynamics, Brexit, although Brexit was clearly there but given the looming time line, it's become more prominent. Some of the macroeconomics or the tariff conversation wasn't in swing then. So there is more noise in the environment is the way I would say it. And what we're concerned about, although we haven't seen it yet, is does that have a cumulative effect on business confidence, right. And we haven't seen it yet, but it's just something we're keeping our eye on as we plan next year, and as we think about where we want to position the business. So look, I was trying to be relatively transparent with you guys just about as we think about the macro, it's still positive. Global growth is forecasted to be mid- to upper 2.5, 2.8 something in that range depending upon which forecast you believe. Now that's down from this year but still positive and still healthy in a relative sense. But it's just something we're keeping our eye on.",286

I think on the VMware call, they talked about 2020 revenues being -- growing 12%. And that included the additional revenue and bookings they expect to get because of that. I know Dell has sort of -- it's sort of a mixed thing for you. You get the upside of VMware and potentially get another competitor in servers and networking. So maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how you're viewing that going into next year. Is that a plus for Dell on the whole? Is it a push? Is it potentially a negative?",141

What I can tell you from our side, it wasn't unexpected. It -- I think from my point of view, it really is a validation of what we've been saying as the world is really a multi-cloud, hybrid world. Not everything is going to go to a handful of public clouds. We think there's multi-cloud hybrid world is certainly where business is going. We are seeing workloads repatriate to on-prem for cost reasons, security reasons and performance reasons. And we think Dell Technologies is positioned quite nicely in this world. If you think about it with Pivotal and our ability to be sort of the tip of the spear of this platform with cloud-native application, in container methodologies to allow our customers to modernize their software stack. You think about Boomi and data integration and our ability to bring that to the platform, all around VMware that we view as a control plane in an operational hub. And this operational hub can expand and extend into private, into public, into [bare metal] deployment. And then if you think about the solutions that we built today around VxRail, VxBlock and VxRack and our ability to take VMware's VCF platform, VNC and the broader VCPP ecosystem, we think we're already doing this work. We can help customers work in a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud world. And you can have this operational hub extend from the edge to the core to the cloud all for one platform from Dell Technologies. So we think we're in a pretty good position of where the technology's moving to. Did that help?",285

And then for my follow-up, Tyler, I think that Dell is looking to pay down $4.8 billion coming due in the coming year. And I think you gave a whole bunch of ways you could do it. Free cash flow, refinancing, the revolver. I guess the question I have is how much of that do you think will be free cash flow? In other words, how much would truly be a paydown of debt instead of refinancing somehow? And would you use free cash flow from VMware to take some of that down? Kind of like you used free cash flow from VMware to take down DVMT?",110

This is Tyler. So I apologize, maybe it wasn't clear in terms of my talking points. But really, I guess the way we're thinking about it is, look, our intent is to pay that down and not refinance it. Now you saw a portion of that will come from -- the majority of that will come from free cash flow generation, a portion with a cash that we have on our balance sheet. And then if you remember last year, you'll see the same trend where in Q4, we'll start to build cash and we'll keep that cash and hold it for those June maturities. And then look, because of the timing of cash flow, my expectation is we'll use a little bit of our revolver. And so there's probably -- my expectation is that we'll have some of that revolver outstanding at the end of Q2. And that really depends on where our cash does come in over the course of the next few quarters. But then over the course of Q3 and Q4, we'll pay that revolver back. So I really wouldn't view that or think about that as the refinancing. It's -- we're going to pay that debt down. And as it relates to VMware, I think, look, nothing has really changed in terms of how we operate with VMware. And we want to make sure that, that they're growing their business appropriately. And so there is no intent or plan, I'm not modeling getting any cash from VMware.",253

It's -- the numbers I gave you were for a full year estimate, right, so for all of fiscal '20. The seasonality will follow the seasonality of the business because it will depend upon within the revenue streams that are coming in, what part of that is financed through DFS and then what part of those will fall into a lease construct that was previously a capital lease but will now be -- have to be accounted for as an operating lease. Let me do highlight, though, there is no impact on cash. This is a financial statement presentation perspective and that EBITDA will actually be slightly higher as we think about the full year. But I was trying to make sure that you guys as you begin to think about building models for what will we assume will be at some point of publicly traded Class C that the guidance framework that we put out earlier in the year, which gave you those sort of long-term frameworks, did not have in it the impact of the leasing standard change.

There's no doubt. There's no denial that there is tightness in CPUs. And we have seen that, and we've seen that across a range of SKUs. We are working real time as you expect us to do. We believe, with our direct model, we have a lot of ability to be able to shape demand. We haven't built this stuff months in advance, and we're stuck with what was coming, so we had the ability to dynamically shape with our direct model and sell configurations that we can build. We are doing that. We are changing lead time. We are adjusting price to throttle demand in areas where we're short. And certainly, pricing where we have parts, so we can create demand there. We've incurred cost to do that, particularly what happens is we are having to airfreight and expedite in the supply chain, which is the reference I made about the added cost in our model or in our business of being able to build flexibility. We see that. I see it today. I see it through Q4. It will be a challenge throughout the quarter. We believe we have positioned ourselves appropriately. I don't see any apparent impact to demand, and we're going to continue to help with our -- or help deliver to our customers when they give us the luxury of taking their order. So we're working through it. Is that a challenge? Of course, it is. We, again, are literally dynamically working this every single day. If you go to the website, we are changing lead time, we are changing price, we're changing configuration based on what we're expecting to have comped, and we're going to continue to do that. I don't know if that helped answer your question.",326

So in the quarter, you mentioned the pressure, the size of seasonal. It sounds like the biggest one was really inventory as you grapple with and trying to deal with the supply chain issues. And if we do exclude VMware kind of deconsolidate that, and the Dell mothership free cash flow, I think it was negative in the quarter.

And look, we'll work through it. I mean so I think what you'll see is it'll probably take us a few quarters. I mean, the build in inventory was for good reason, and we want to make sure we're in the right position for our customers.

And then just to follow up on that then, So I'm having a little bit of trouble sort of reconciling the answer that you gave to Tom Egan on the ability to repay over $4 billion of debt from free cash flow because without VMware's -- I mean that's not where you guys are tracking. I think last year, the Dell classic business was -- had low $2 billion of free cash flow. That's kind of where you're tracking on a pro rata basis this year.

Q1 tends to be a weaker quarter, and then that's followed by a good Q2. And as I mentioned, we've got over $3 billion, $3.3 billion revolver, which is undrawn and we -- my expectation is we will dip on that, dip into that. It's purely bridging, right. So it's bridging me into that part of the year next year when we do start to generate good cash flow, we typically generate a bit more into the second half of the year.
