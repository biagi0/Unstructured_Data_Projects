266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2010",2010-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4020.0,50677.0,3857056.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Rob. First, we saw a solid growth return to the business in the quarter. We're encouraged by the underlying demand strength we're seeing across the business. And particularly, our Commercial businesses where we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in both unit shipments and revenue. The market demand improvements we saw in our third quarter accelerated into our fourth quarter. And we're cautiously optimistic with how our new fiscal year is starting up as well.We're also beginning to see some pretty fundamental shift in the company's capabilities and in our financial framework. We continue to invest to grow our Enterprise business. We're seeing solid growth in servers, storage and services. And with the addition of Perot Systems, our new Dell Services business now represents 13% of our total company revenue. We've also made outstanding progress in improving our cost position over the past two years, and we think we're well-positioned to benefit from improving demand trends.While our gross margins are very solid in the Commercial business units, we did see some weakness in our overall margin rates due to the strong seasonal growth of our Consumer business, which also suffered from relatively weak margins during the quarter. For the full year, we delivered 18.2% gross margins on a non-GAAP basis. And we made fundamental improvements in our COGS structure and our OpEx structure, which we believe positions us well for the future. We generated nearly $4 billion of operating cash flow, which is twice the cash we delivered last year.As we look forward, we're very confident our Commercial businesses are poised for earnings growth as demand returns. And that our strategy to expand in a higher margin and recurring revenue streams in businesses like servers, storage, software and service solutions is progressing well. With that, let's move to the fourth quarter P&L and the key performance metrics, which you'll find on Pages 6 and 7 of the posted web deck.Including our acquisition of Perot Systems, revenue in the fourth quarter was $14.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Ex Perot, total revenue improved in Large Enterprise and SMB both year-over-year and sequentially. Also without Perot, our Public business experienced a normal seasonal sequential decline, but it was still up year-over-year.On a GAAP basis, our gross margins were 16.6%, our OpEx was 13.2% and our operating income was 3.4%. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.17 per share. For the remainder of this discussion, I will be speaking to non-GAAP financial measures.Beginning with gross margin, the non-GAAP result was 17.4%, driven primarily by the typically heavy mix of consumer revenue in the quarter. Additionally, as we discussed coming into the quarter, we also saw component cost pressures specifically DRAM across the business and we felt this most in our Consumer business where we were locked in to holiday retail deals in some cases with fixed pricing.OpEx was 12.1% of revenue and SG&A was below 11%. Our total OpEx has improved as a percentage of revenue, but it was up sequentially on an absolute basis as the revenue growth returned and correspondingly, we increased sales compensation for our commercial sales force who executed well in the quarter. We also invested incremental OpEx dollars to fund key growth programs as we've discussed over the course of the last couple of quarters. Operating income was $798 million or 5.4% of revenue and on the same basis, was $3 billion and 5.6% of revenue for the fiscal year. Our financing and other expenses were $41 million in the quarter, and our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1%, which was within the range we've provided last quarter.Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.28 per share. Expense related to our broad performance-based long-term compensation plan, which is primarily equity was $107 million in the quarter, split roughly 18% in COGS and 82% in OpEx. We had another strong operating cash quarter. Referring to Slide 8 in the web deck, we generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations, which largely a function of our strong sequential growth and negative cash conversion cycle. There was lots of great work and strong execution here by the teams across the business. Our working capital performance continues to be world class. Our cash conversion cycle remains at negative 36 days as we absorbed the impact of our acquisition of Perot in this measure. You'll remember that during our December 16 call, we said Perot would likely impact cash conversion cycle by two to three days. So we are pleased to hold our cash conversion cycle flat given that dynamic. Both receivables and payables decreased two days to 38 days and 82 days, respectively, while inventory remain flat at eight days. Our days to pay are now up 15 days from last year, while receivables are down four days from their peak two quarters ago. Overall for the year, our cash conversion cycle improved by 11 days, which we are very pleased with. Going forward, we expect our cash conversion cycle to remain in the mid-30s through the next fiscal year.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. On November 3, we used $4 billion to close the Perot transaction and we ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments. Finally, as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure and manage cash liquidity, we will continue to monitor the credit markets for possible favorable entry points. Referring to Slide 11, Dell Financial Services generated $1.1 billion in new originations during the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter originations and penetration rates primarily reflect the seasonality of the U.S. Consumer business. Losses in our managed portfolio were up slightly at 8.2%. And we remain cautious about the credit environment in fiscal year 2011. However, we are see stabilization in Consumer and SMB delinquency and losses. Funding costs for financial assets are improving, and we've launched new conduits that will be held on the balance sheet. As a reminder, in our upcoming first quarter of fiscal year '11, we will be consolidating our two non-consolidated fixed conduits in accordance with the recent U.S. GAAP changes.Now let's turn to our operating business results for the quarter and for the full year.I'll remind you that fourth quarter results now include a full quarter of Perot Systems. The business unit results can be found on Pages 14 through 17 of the web deck. First, let's review our Commercial businesses, which include Large Enterprise, Public and SMB businesses. For the full year, these businesses were hit the hardest by the slowdown in the economy. Collectively, we shipped nearly $5 million fewer units in these businesses this year than we did a year ago. Revenue in these three businesses fell 15% year-over-year, yet total aggregate revenue per unit on the product ship is flat though at some cases increasing. And the combined gross margins for these businesses actually improved from the prior year. This improved performance comes partially from focused efforts on shifting our product mix to higher-margin storage services and services. And this is particularly true with our EqualLogic business, which grew from less than $200 million in run rate revenue two years ago to more than $0.5 billion run rate in business today. Additionally during this challenging cycle, these businesses reduce their OpEx by 13% from a year ago. So with solid margins and good OpEx leverage, we expect to see improving profitably from the Commercial businesses as demand returns. This dynamic is evident for the Large Enterprise business in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw an unusually strong pickup in demand. Large Enterprise revenue grew 23% sequentially to $4.2 billion, with units improving 14% versus the third quarter. The business delivered operating income of $281 million, which is 6.7% of revenue or 160 basis point improvement over the previous quarter.The revenue outside the Large Enterprise represents two quarters of sequential growth and the third quarter in a row of improving growth rates. We're optimistic about improved demand environment for this business, but we do believe that we did see some year-end budget-related activity in the fourth quarter, and then it will be difficult to repeat going in to the first half of the year.In Public, we see a story similar to LE. Demand for the year was much more stable with revenue only down 6% for the year. Here too, gross margins remains stable and operating income was up 8% for the full year. In fact, this year's operating income of $1.4 billion is the best profitably performance in the history of our Public business. Public's fourth quarter includes the impact of Perot, who's customers are primarily in the Public segment. For fourth quarter, revenue was $3.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. As I mentioned before without Perot, Public experienced a normal seasonal sequential decline but it was still up year-over-year. Operating income for Public was $333 million and the rate was 8.7% of revenue.The Small and Medium Business revenue was $3.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year, representing two successive quarters of sequential growth. Storage servers and client products all experienced double-digit sequential growth. Operating income was $282 million, up 18% year-over-year and flat sequentially.Turning to our Consumer business. Q4 revenue was $3.5 billion, up 25% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Consumer has done a phenomenal job building a nearly $6 billion retail business with 56,000 stores and broad global distribution over the last two years. In addition, we now have the strongest and most exciting product portfolio in our history, including Alienware, Domino, XPS, Studio and mainstream Inspiron desktops and notebooks. Operating income for the quarter was a disappointing $9 million or 0.2% of revenue. For the full year, Consumer generated $107 million in operating income or 0.9% of revenue. Consumer margins were disappointing in the quarter due to aggressive market pricing dynamics and the fact that we also experienced component cost pressure early in the fourth quarter when we were committed to orders for the holiday with some locked-in pricing. I'd like to re-emphasize our strategic commitment to the Consumer business. Just for context, for the full year, Consumer shipped over $2 million more units than last year, up almost 20%. These unit volume helps to drive scales with our supply base and with our cash conversion cycle, contributes a lot of cash to the company. Additionally, we're taking actions to improve our Consumer business profitability. In the fourth quarter, we consolidated our Consumer and small-business organizations under a single leadership team, including the product development teams. With this combination, we see opportunities to reduce costs in G&A and product development and in customer support, while maintaining the focus and energy we need here on customers.We'll still need to continue to run these businesses separately and report them separately as well. We're also embarking on a broad effort to simplify our client-product offerings, which will provide the next level of cost out in the products. We still believe our 1% to 2% operating income target is achievable in the near term and then we can get margins higher than that over time.Now let me quickly discuss Perot. We're very pleased with the launch of our new Dell Services business. Our performance there was very much in line with expectations, and signings in the fourth quarter have improved significantly. More importantly, customers on both sides of the Dell and Perot relationships have embraced the acquisition and the integration is tracking well from a customer retention, financial metric and growth perspective. Our sales teams are targeting new opportunities and are very excited about taking new capabilities to a broader set of customers. From a go-to-market synergy perspective, there are approximately and specifically 200 growth synergy opportunities that we're working on, which range in size from very small server monitoring engagements to data center outsourcing engagements. The biggest challenge in the near term comes from narrowing our focus to a targeted few opportunities where we can deliver high customer value. We've already seen some significant wins where customers who were either all Dell or all Perot have given us opportunities to bid on a broader set of products and services, that we couldn't do before and this is just going to continue.On a regional basis, revenue in the Americas was up 12% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. In EMEA, revenue was up 24% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. In APJ, revenue was up 16% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. Our total revenue from BRIC countries was up 13% sequentially, but up 72% year-over-year, with China and Brazil both experiencing very strong double-digit sequential growth, around 70% to 80% growth year-over-year as well. The BRIC made up 11% of our total revenue in the quarter and revenue from outside of the U.S was 48% of our total mix. Moving briefly to product highlights. In the client space, our mobility units were up 12% sequentially and revenue was up 11% due to increased demand in all segments, while year-over-year revenue improved 16%. Mobility average selling prices declined by 1% sequentially. Desktop units were up 10% sequentially and revenue improved 14% sequentially and was down 3% year-over-year.Turning to Enterprise products and services. Our server revenue was up 17% sequentially on a unit increase of 10%, while revenue and units were up 26% and 17% year-over-year, respectively. The trough in server revenue was the first quarter of this past year. And we now have three consecutive quarters of server growth.Our Data Center Solutions business where we sell servers in the very large cloud computing infrastructure customers was up over 250% year-over-year and up 75% sequentially. Server revenue in Large Enterprise was up 47% year-over-year. Our storage revenue while down 15% on a year-over-year basis was up 18% sequentially driven by strong growth in our Dell/EMC and EqualLogic storage arrays. EqualLogic revenue was up 44% year-over-year. We continue to mix our storage revenue to higher margin offerings and storage is now a solid driver of Dell's operating income and contribution margins, both of which are expanding year-over-year. Dell Services now includes Perot Systems. Total revenue was $1.9 billion, including approximately $600 million from Perot. Our deferred revenue balance is now $6.1 billion, up 6.4% versus prior year. As I've said, Services now represents 13% of Dell's consolidated revenue versus 9% a year ago. Software and peripherals revenue grew 3% sequentially and was flat year-over-year driven by intentional decisions to prioritize LCD panels for system applications.As I review with you our progress on our $4 billion cost target, I want to quickly summarize some of the progress we've made in transforming the business. Over the past two years, we've spent over $750 million on severance and facility actions costs to sell, close and consolidate our facility and manufacturing footprint and reduce our G&A spend. Prior to our closing of the Austin TMC facility, we operated 11 manufacturing facilities versus only six today, and have reduced our internal manufacturing capability by about 60%.This massive operational effort has taken a bulk of two years to realize and today, nearly 53% of our products flow through our contract manufacturers. And the capability is in place to move this percent significantly higher. Our headcount, ex Perot, has come down from a peak of 92,000 in fiscal year 2008 to about 72,000 today, a 22% reduction in three years. With Perot, we added back 24,000. In total, we've reduced our OpEx by $1.5 billion from our fiscal year 2008 baseline with a lot more opportunity here. On the COGS side, nearly 90% of our Consumer platforms and more than 65% of our Business Client platforms have gone through our cost optimization framework. In fiscal year 2009, we saved over $600 million and in fiscal year '10, we saved an additional of $1.8 billion related to our design-to-value plain sheet procurement and supply chain efforts. Both the OpEx and COGS reduction efforts have led to successfully improving gross and operating margins in our Commercial businesses for the full year. In Consumer, our cost reduction efforts were partially offset by inflationary component cost pressure in the back half of the year, and it's clear to us that we must continue to drive more cost out.As you sum up these results, you can see we've reduced total cost by $3.9 billion. And we're already ramping the next phase of our ongoing cost initiatives. This journey does not end. This has been really tough work the during most difficult economic environment in the history of the company, particularly in our core commercial business. While it's a good start, we still know there's a lot to do to make our business more competitive. Ongoing competitive pressure and economic realities never stop and we can't either.As I described before, we have consolidated our product development activities and global operations function under Jeff Clarke. As part of our efforts around client reinvention, his focus on taking us to the next level of lean manufacturing, improving our logistics, supply chain and reducing complexity.We will limit the number of configuration choices where appropriate, and move more of our products to a low touch fixed configuration and ocean [ph] (38:03) ship model. Over the years, these changes will further cost optimize our model and lower G&A and support costs.Turning to the outlook. We're moving into the next phase of our transformation. We'll be taking less severance and facilities expense going forward, but we'll stay focused on cost initiatives and growth. You've seen us be more acquisitive and this is part of the plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting to increase the mix of higher margin and recurring revenue streams. We're retooling our sales team to be more solution-oriented. And we'll continue to make investments to develop IP and deploy resources against improving the value and connections we provide our customers.You'll see us allocating new OpEx dollars to important growth programs. We'll continue to invest OpEx in periods of revenue growth that are committed to scaling this investment to our revenue. We remain intent on driving improvements in our core business that will particularly affect our Consumer business and structurally change our sales, manufacturing and delivery of products. We will continue to balance liquidity, profitability and growth as our framework to drive long-term value creation. As you see, we generated very strong cash flow this quarter and for the full year. For the first quarter specifically, the overall PC and server industry is typically down 10% in units sequentially. We expect to do better than industry norms, but still believe our revenue will be down sequentially in the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate continued tightness in supply. Suppliers have been reluctant to add additional capacity until the demand environment, among commercial customers and broadly, is as robust as it has been over the last few quarters. For instance, panel pricing bottomed in January and market prices have begun to increase again in conjunction with strong demand for TVs in Asia and anticipated PC demand in memory pricing, particularly for DDR3, could be up again in the first quarter.We delivered greater than 18% gross margins for the full year. There will be seasonal volatility and we saw some of that in the fourth quarter. As we move into the first quarter, you should anticipate our revenue mix working back towards a more balanced dynamic. Our tax rate came in between the 28% and 29%, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Given the continued globalization of our business, we would expect this tax rate to decline modestly. We'll continue to examine our tax structure as the business changes, including the effects of acquisitions.Again, our long-term value creation framework is focused on delivering 5% to 7% topline growth. And returning our operating margins to 7% plus on a GAAP basis over time. Cash flow growth is our true focus and we expect to deliver through a combination of growing our revenue, expanding our gross margins modestly and continuing to manage and optimize our cost structure with a constant focus on great working capital efficiency.We are confident in our ability to deliver the right technology to commercial customers and to participate in a meaningful commercial upgrade cycle. Our Commercial businesses are well-managed, that we're positioned for further operating leverage as demand returns in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",3400

This past year, demand started off quite slow and gradually improved as the year progressed. Towards the latter part of the year as the economy was stabilizing, we saw a broad increases in demand across all of our businesses, and that has continued. The drivers include strong return on investment, especially for server and storage solutions, an aging installed base and Windows 7. And we're seeing a continuation of the favorable demand trend this year. And we're focused on and seeing significant strength with our Enterprise solutions. Our 11G servers, Dell/EMC and EqualLogic storage and the expanded Dell Services capabilities enhanced with the acquisition of Perot Systems. On the client side, we are seeing the beginnings of a refresh driven by Windows 7 and increased mobility. The age of the installed base is significant and customer see the refresh as a productivity enabler, and we think the refresh takes time and stretches well into 2011. IT is the engine of productivity for our customers. And we are well-positioned with solutions that deliver total cost of ownership leadership and an expanding recurring revenue and profits and cash flow stream for our shareholders. This year we are very focused on and you're going to see us invest in delivering best IT solutions that are simultaneously open, capable and affordable, and create significant value in the key IT architectural transitions. You'll also see us further reducing our product complexity, simplifying our supply chain and providing our customers with choices they value, while improving profitability in the process. And significantly enhancing our online capability with dell.com and related online properties to improve customer experience, build loyalty and raise margins.You'll also see us continue to make inorganic investments adding new capability as we have done with Perot Systems and Services and last week, with KACE Networks and Systems Management. All of these investments are part of a consistent strategy aimed at delivering technology solutions that enable people everywhere to grow and thrive.

I know you're attributing a lot to consumer in that mix, but the fact is despite the fact that all four of your business units had meaningful sequential revenue growth, three of the four actually had a decline sequentially in operating margin percentage. So you're actually getting negative leverage in the quarter. Can you help us beyond Consumer, understand what was happening? I know you talked about component prices but it actually looks like your ASPs were slightly up sequentially, so you were able to offset some of that by passing it on to customers.",112

I think when you look at the gross margins in total, I mean you can mathematically from a consumer mix standpoint, there's at least 30 to 40 basis points of quarter-on-quarter pressure there. The Consumer margins separately in terms of their own gross margins we're also challenged. Those are the two things we isolated. I think when you look at, even gross margins within the Commercial business, we saw strength and improvement there. So the teams did a nice job really offsetting component price increases in the commercial side of the business. You do see some incremental Opex going into the business as we see in some cases sales compensation that goes with the growth, in some cases we made R&D and strategic investments that have taken up the OpEx. But I think those are smart investments and we'll try to do that in a way that's consistent with the growth that we're seeing in the marketplace. So I do think in the commercial side of the business, you will see some good leverage as we move forward with this growth.",183

But still on two of the three, the operating margins were down despite a pretty significant sequential improvement in volumes. So as we look out to 2011, how should investors think about gross margins and operating margins given the cost cutting, I mean if I take what you're saying qualitatively, which is you're going to continue to work on the cost side, hopefully, the mix will kind of more normalized, you're going to get some volume leverage. The natural inference is to believe that you should have higher, if not materially higher gross and operating margins in 2011. Is that a reasonable expectations? Or what caveat should we put against that?",134

I look at -- we had I would say pretty strong operating income rates within the SMB business, within the Public business in the quarter, and then Public throughout the year. I think there's room for us to gain leverage and improve the operating income levels in the LE business as we get some leverage there. And I would expect that to look more like the Public business from a profitability standpoint. And then we've talked about Consumer. I think as we look at that at 0.9% of OpEx for the year, we think should be at least double that and obviously, we think we can improve beyond that over a period of time. Our gross margins, I think you got to look at overall longer period of time. It's been relatively stable, and that would be our intent. As we mix the business up to higher margin enterprise products in more services and things like that, I think you'll see that move up. But there will be some volatility there.",182

So we've sat down with the leading companies in the kind of supply chain and saying, ""Okay, here's what we think we're going to need in the next six quarters, 10 quarters."" And let's talk about the capacity investments. Because I think a number of these folks didn't have the capacity, and as we look at our business and the expected demand, there's investments that are needed. We're starting to see those go in. We were able to get, I would say, pretty good response on the upside request that we had, because we didn't anticipate that demand would be as strong as it was. So that's a pretty good characterization of it.",123

And I think we've been pleasantly surprised at how strong it has stayed. And then you sort of take this on a week-by-week basis, but there's a lot of refresh and a lot of spending that we're seeing, and it's fair to say that the signs are quite encouraging in the day-to-day orders that we see from that business. So I would say there is clearly some end of year effect in that business as customers had confidence that their budget wasn't going to change as they got into the end of the year and they said, ""Hey, what if we want to spend?"" And what do we want to spend that on, it was infrastructure, it was servers and storage, and we captured quite a bit of that. But I think the budgets are in place for this year, and they have a lot of client refreshing, they have a lot of server virtualization, they have a lot of storage virtualization, and we're well-positioned to go capture that. And I think customers are spending with a lot more conviction that at this point in the year than they were certainly this time last year.",214

With 90% of the Consumer platforms cost optimized, volumes up double digits your competitors talking about.

I think first I'd say, we're disappointed with the margins. I think we've done a lot on cost. There is -- from a product redesigned standpoint, we've done a lot of the efforts there. There's still work we have to do with the supply chain, and that's a lot of the efforts that you hear when we talk about client reinvention and really continuing to get cost out on overhead, out of manufacturing. Those are important steps for us to continue to take cost out of the products. I think the reality is, there's just -- it's challenging. I think there's more work to do there. And as we look at some of the structural things we're trying to do here, we've got some plans in place that I think will continue to make us more competitive in Consumer. We like the growth. We've seen very strong unit growth, that's been important to us from a scale standpoint. But the reality is, we're disappointed in the profitability, so more work to do there.",175

Presumably, you could've exceeded some revenue outside this quarter to preserve gross margins that you did for all of last year. Should we view the gross margin performance as a sign or at least a partial sign that you're shifting your focus at least back towards market share preservation now that the economy is recovering and you're potentially entering a commercial refresh?",81

I think about the commercial side of the business, margin rates were good and solid, and I think we just saw a very good demand. I think the challenges we said was really on the Consumer side. And one of the specific issues, as we said, was some of the component pricing early in the quarter, and some of the retail deals that we had there that were a bit locked in to pricing. So again focus around margins really has to be a Consumer discussion. And then that's what we'll go work on.",112

And I think, if you look at the history of recent transactions, it gives you a reasonably good roadmap for the kinds of things that to look for. I wouldn't expect a lot of, kind of larger transactions. But we're finding lots of opportunities. And I think, if one looks at what we've done with EqualLogic, we think there are many candidate companies that fit a similar profile where our customer access and distribution can dramatically expand the opportunity.

You originally talked about the opportunity being international, but it sounds like you're also seeing some benefits here in the U.S. from a synergy perspective. Can you just talk about the international strategy for Perot, whether that's changed? And I'm wondering if there are people on the ground you have today internationally where you can leverage the Perot platform? Or do you think you have to make some upfront investments or acquisitions before we start to see the revenues start to ramp there?",148

I think one of the things that we're seeing is an increased win rate in a number of parts of the business as our solutions capability, both real and perceived, have had substantially increased here. And so, in terms of building that internationally, we do have some footprint and capability that can be leveraged, but there's a lot to do here, both organically and inorganically to extend the platform. Some of these services can be delivered in a remote fashion, some can be delivered as SKUs that are attached to products, which is a great engine for us, and it's where you see this deferred services balance continue to grow, and that's quite healthy margins for us. We've also integrated our own IT organization into Dell services, and that gives us a global platform of capability that we're going to extend rapidly out to customers. So as we look at Brazil, China, India, there are significant opportunities to take those Dell services and capabilities and extend them globally.",174

In the quarter, we had a total of $86 million, $40 million of that was really the existing Dell, and then there was $46 million related to the Perot. I think that's the breakdown.

We were 16% sequentially -- the growth and double digit on units. Our competitors were single digit on revenue. One was double digits on units but another was single digit on units. So we outgrew certainly on revenue. And we were also playing this a little bit differently on the average selling price side. We're not participating in some of the less-than-profitable units.",89

I'm not implying that you do that at all, but we're really focused on driving revenue share growth in the IT spend. And I think, while one quarter doesn't make a trend, and maybe we've got some encouraging signs here, and we need to watch this for a few quarters and see that it lines up and starts to repeat itself over time. But if you look at the commercial businesses, there were some pretty healthy growth there on a sequential basis. And even when you back out the effect of Perot, we had some pretty strong growth. So again, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think we're pointed on a right direction there.",146

If you look at walking from a third quarter or 18-plus gross margin, really 30 to 40 basis points is driven by just incremental Consumer mix. And the rest of it really is weaker margins within Consumer given to some of the retail transactions we've talked about. So we've isolated to that, there's really no other services. When you think about Perot really came into the portfolio and consolidated it with a very similar gross margin rate, 18% or so.",95

Just given the Nehalem-led refresh, it seems to be driving a richer content sale out there for a lot of folks and almost kind of a mini gold rush, if you will. In terms of server refresh, it's beginning a lot of other type of IT investments, at least the early stages. How should investors think about the upper pressure there because that's starting offset some of the other challenges in Consumer or is that more a wait-and-see type thing?",106

And if you look at our business, we had 26% year-over-year growth. I think as you go to Nehalem-EX, the ROIs just get higher, and this becomes extremely compelling. You have the opportunity for faster refresh cycle because as customers look at the Nehalem-EX and say ""I can virtualize more machines."" It's even more compelling to go and replace. We also created this Data Center Custom Solutions business. It's been growing very, very fast. You're going to see some more announcements from us next month as we kind of take those capabilities to a broader set of customers. And I think it's fair to say we've been  winning the lion share of the opportunities with the largest kind of web-driven firms in the world. And what's interesting to see here is that there is a continual shift to x86. Of course, all of this we're working really hard to tie storage into it with our EqualLogic platform, with our Dell EMC platform, and we have other storage platforms, clustered cloud system type platforms, and you will see us continue to grow those out over time.",204

And we will make it attempt to scale in a quarter-on-quarter sequential decline. We think we'll be relatively modest in the first quarter, so we'll continue to manage that tightly and invest as we see the growth coming. So I guess, I would expect to be slightly up going in to the first quarter as we invest. And then, as we see growth in front of us, we'll continue to make the important investments for the future.",93

Again, going back to the operating margin, it was down about 100 basis points, and yet as I look at it, mix seemed to be richer in SMB with Servers and Storage outperforming the other parts of the business.

I think that's one of the dynamics. I think there's also some sales comp from an OpEx standpoint in the quarter that may impact the update quarter. But we're pleased with the profitability of that business, very strong gross margins and good operating income, and it's good to see the growth back.",80

But we're really trying to manage it across the broad business as a portfolio. So we're going to see that from time to time in these businesses just like Public. I mean Public was down this quarter. This is the quarter when their business is seasonally down and they've still got that OpEx they're carrying through the slowest quarter of the year.",134

And then lastly, when you consider the Public pipeline, is there any negative implications from maybe municipal and federal deficits, maybe slowing down growth there?",57

Both of the pipelines feel pretty good. And I think we're feeling good about our kind of Enterprise and Services opportunities in those. In terms of Public, you're right to point those out. There are some stakes at are in a state of distress, if you will. I think the interesting question here is, if you look in the history of mankind, Public organizations generally do not reduce their spending. So if they do reduce their spending, it will be the first time it's ever happened. So that'll be interesting to actually see what happens. But I think the other thing that we're finding is that, many of these organizations have not adopted, what I would call, commercial best practices. And so, if you think about, for example, universities that have a decentralized IT structure, and now the provost university is saying, ""well, how am I going to meet this budget challenge?"" Well, ""hey, we know how to do that, it's called server virtualization."" And so actually, I think some of the budget pressures in this Public organizations may create opportunities for IT. We find that the Public organizations tend to be some of the ones that have least taken advantage of the newest technologies. So all of the things we talked about earlier in terms of high ROIs, with server virtualization, we actually don't find nearly as many of those in public organizations as we would all like to see. So I think the budget pressures may create more opportunities there. But you're right to highlight those potential risks.",277

And I think within the EMC relationship, we have been moving at more toward the real value-add products and less of the pass-through products. And so that's definitely putting some pressure on the top line. But it is improving the margins there and I think putting us in kind of the kinds of business that we really want to be in. But the operating margins, the margin dollars in storage are definitely improving and we've got a significant platform there. I think we've added about 15,000 new EqualLogic customers since the acquisition, and we're adding about 2,000 a quarter. And so this is a platform, it's very, very strong. We're integrating a lot of new partners, for example, I think if you look closely, you'll see a lot of work going on with Brocade and many others as this kind of becomes a real platform. I also think that as we talk to customers, there's a lot of momentum around 10-gig ethernet in data center. And as we bring 10 gig to the server, 10 gig to the storage, there's an enormous opportunity to kind of create the efficient data center structure here with our core kind of the crown jewels right at the center of it.",213

With me today are Michael Dell; Brian Gladden our CFO; and Brad Anderson, who leads our Servers, Storage and Networking Solutions group. Brian and Brad will review our first quarter results, then Michael will follow with his perspective on our growth strategy. 
We just posted information on Q1 results and a Vlog [video log] with Brian and Brad on our IR site at dell.com. I encourage you to review these materials. Our upcoming investor relations activities include the Bernstein CEO Conference on June 3 and our Analyst Meeting here in Austin on June 23 and 24. 
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events, including statements about Dell's future financial and operating performance, expected component pricing, global currency volatility and anticipated customer demand are forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. 
Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP growth margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at dell.com and our 8-K file today, which we encourage you to review.

266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-20-2010",2010-05-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3117.0,62484.0,4677011.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. We had a solid first quarter in an improving global environment. Demand has picked up, especially with our commercial customers who make up approximately 78% of our revenue. We had solid unit and revenue growth in the quarter, Solutions revenue, which includes Enterprise Servers and Networking Storage and our Services business was up 38% to $4.2 billion. Aided by the acquisition of Perot Systems. We also saw a very strong demand in the emerging countries around the world.
Our entire Commercial business continues to benefit from improved demand and the hard work we've done to improve our cost structure and the critical investments we're making to build out our Enterprise business. Our nearly $50 billion Commercial business is performing well. And this validates our strategy to expand our investments in servers, storage, software and services. Given the strategic importance of our Enterprise business, we've asked Brad Anderson to share his view on the progress we're making in Enterprise Solutions, and discuss some of the underlying growth we're seeing there.
But first, let's look at the first quarter P&L and the key performance metrics, which are laid out on Charts 5 and 6 in the web deck. Revenue in the first quarter was $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year and flat sequentially. This is slightly better than our typical historical seasonality. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $619 million or 4.2% of revenue, and earnings per share was $0.22, which is up 47% year-over-year. On the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating income grew 29% to $824 million or 5.5% of revenue. Sequentially, gross margins improved slightly to 17.6%, and our OpEx was 12% of revenue. We continue to focus on improving operating income, while making key investments in products, and in sales and services resources.
Net income and earnings per share were both up 20% year-over-year. Net income was $584 million, while earnings per share was $0.30 per share. Our financing and other expenses were $68 million, up versus prior quarter driven primarily by currency evaluation of certain balance sheet items due to a strengthening U.S. dollar. Our tax rate was 22.8%. That reflects the net benefit of certain effectively settled foreign tax audits. For the year, we do expect our tax rate to be in the 27% range, consistent with our previous outlook. We generated $238 million in cash flow from operations and $400 million in free cash flow in the quarter. Over the past four quarters, we've generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow.
As you know, the first quarter is typically our weakest cash flow quarter as we make year-end bonus payments during the quarter. We also used about $130 million of cash to build some strategic inventory given the current component environment. Our working capital performance continues to be solid. Our days receivable were flat with a one-day increase in inventory days, offset by a one-day improvement in days payable, keeping our cash conversion cycle at negative 36 days. We do expect our cash conversion cycle to remain consistently in the negative mid-30s throughout the year. We ended the quarter with $11.6 billion in cash and investments. During the quarter, we reinitiated our stock buyback program with a buyback of $200 million.
We've been saying that we'd like to restart the program as we've gotten more comfortable with the credit markets, our business performance and other strategic cash usage requirements. We expect to continue a modest buyback program for the rest of the year. As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure and our U.S. liquidity, we're also monitoring the credit markets for possible favorable entry points.
Dell Financial Services generated almost $1 billion in new originations, up 11%. We saw strong leasing demand in Large Enterprise and in the U.S. in general. The loss rates for our managed portfolio for the quarter was 7.6%, which is down 130 basis points from last year, as overall portfolio quality continues to improve. 
At the beginning of the quarter, we consolidated two Commercial based conduits in accordance with recent changes in U.S. GAAP, resulting in a net increase to financing receivables and debt of $609 million and $624 million respectively, with minimal changes to retained earnings. This accounting change has no impact on our P&L or cash flow for the quarter.
Turning to our Global business unit performance. Our Commercial business grew 22% to $11.6 billion with op inc [operating income] up 25% to $894 million. We are beginning to see some leverage here, despite the fact that we're making significant strategic investments in this part of the company.
These results represent the best growth rates we've seen in Commercial in the past two years. Large Enterprise grew 25% to $4.2 billion. Op inc in this business was up 47% to $283 million and improved to 6.7% of revenue. These results were driven by very strong server revenue growth of 61% in the quarter and good OpEx leverage, which we've been counting on as the growth returns. Client demand is also very strong, with desktops and mobility growing 22% and 14% respectively.
Our Public business grew 22% to $3.9 billion, benefiting from the Perot Systems acquisition year-over-year impact. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of Perot, we saw muted demand in U.S. Federal and our EMEA business. Op inc was up 2% to $298 million or 7.7% of revenue, driven by stronger demand in state and local governments and emerging countries.
Servers were up 17% in the quarter. Based on 2009 revenue, Gartner recently ranked Dell as the number one healthcare information technology services provider in the world. And we're beginning to see more synergy wins than we projected in this area. Our Small and Medium Business revenue was up 19% to $3.5 billion. Op inc grew 36% to $313 million and 48.9% of revenue. Our Server, Storage and Client business has all delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter for Small and Medium Business.
Our Consumer business revenue was up 16% to $3.2 billion. Op inc was $17 million as we're just beginning to see some of the cost benefits from consolidating this business with our SMB business. Our goal continues to be to improve operating margins to 1% to 2% by the end of the year. 
Regionally, we saw solid revenue growth in the Americas and APJ, which were up 23% and 33% respectively; while Europe, EMEA, grew by 6% in the quarter. Emerging countries continue to grow very quickly with our total revenue from BRIC countries up 60%, and now representing nearly 12% of our total revenue in the company.
Moving briefly to a few key product highlights. On top of the strong Enterprise growth that Brad will talk about, we saw strong return to growth in our Commercial Client business. Revenue in mobility and desktops grew 18% and 13% respectively. Mobility units were up 27%, while desktop units were up 12%. 
Turning to Enterprise, let me turn it over to Brad Anderson to discuss some of the success we are seeing in Servers, Storage and Services.",1182
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-20-2010",2010-05-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3117.0,62484.0,4677012.0,Presenter Speech,Brad Anderson,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Brian. We had a strong Enterprise solutions quarter. Our combined Server, Networking Storage Services solutions grew 38% to $4.2 billion. A year ago we said we're going to shift our portfolio to higher-margin and recurring revenue and that's exactly what we're doing. 
Let me give you some specifics. In Servers, we were tying the market on Westmere and Nehalem-EX, beating several key competitors to market. We launched a full range of Westmere blade, rack and power servers. Nehalem-EX blade and rack-based servers as well as the only scalable two-socket server capable of supporting a half a terabyte of memory, which is really ideal for databases and virtualization. 
Additionally, we shift the industry's first portfolio cloud optimize servers, our PowerEdge C Series, leveraging our unique learnings from our Data Center Custom Solutions business. All these provide significant return on investments as customers consolidate, virtualize and scale their data centers.
As a result, we're seeing a surge in server upgrades at higher ASPs. Server revenue was up 39% to $1.8 billion with units up 30% and ASPs up roughly 7%. In Storage, we're focused on the full information lifecycle for data access, data management and data tiering. We expanded our intelligent data management offerings by launching the Dell DX Object Storage Solutions for healthcare and archiving. And we are expanding our partnership with EMC with the introduction of our Dell/EMC deduplication and NX Unified Storage Solutions. 
As a whole, our storage revenue was up 4% to $554 million. EqualLogic and PowerVault led our revenue growth, up 78% and 21% respectively. More importantly our Storage product mix delivered better contribution margins. On acquisitions, the integration of Exanet and KACE are going well. Exanet provides us key file storage technology for our Unified Storage platform and KACE gives us a nice, easy to use system management platform for the mid-market.
And in Networking, we launched our first set of Brocade products. And next quarter we'll add Juniper to our networking mix. Finally, our Dell Services grew 53% to $1.9 billion. The integration of Perot is progressing well. We are in target with all the key work streams, including cost and revenue synergies. As a combined organization, we're competitively strong and are beginning to win business previously entrenched with the competition. We are effectively competing for a broader array of services contracts. We have identified now more than 300 synergy sales opportunities that are now progressing through the sales process.
In addition, both discretionary and outsourcing contract flows are gaining momentum as customers continue to focus on increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and gaining access to more utility based computing technologies. 
As you can see, we're committed to the Enterprise business. We're seeing very strong acceptance for our strategy; open, capable and affordable solutions. We look forward to discussing our approach with you in much more detail in June at the Analyst Meeting. Now let me turn it back to Brian.",487

Before we hear from Michael, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the quarter and our views on demand going forward.
As Brad described, we're experiencing very strong server growth on the heels of launching Nehalem-EX servers before our competitors. As we indicated last quarter, we're also in the early stages of a large corporate client refresh, and we believe demand will continue to be relatively strong here.
We're primarily a commercial and increasingly an enterprise company. While we suffered during the past 18 months of weak commercial demand, we stand to benefit in this cycle. Based on the first quarter reported IDC results, we also fared better in the share metrics than we have in a while. 
As we said, we saw resurgence in commercial desktop and mobility demand in the first quarter, and that should continue for the next several quarters. We look forward to the growth here as it drives scale, operating leverage and pulls through higher margin services and S&P business. Even though it may pressure gross margins for us. 
For the second quarter, we expect seasonal improvements from our state and local government, Consumer and Education businesses. But it's also important to note that the second quarter, and the first part of the third quarter are generally periods where we see slower demand from larger Commercial customers in the U.S. and especially Europe.
Net for Dell, we expect the normal seasonal pickup in the low-single digits into the next quarter. We expect some components to remain in tight supply, with limited deflation for the next couple of quarters, and global currencies to remain somewhat volatile, especially the euro. We continue to manage OpEx in a disciplined way with lower spending in G&A and our Client business, offset by key investments in our Solutions business, focused on products, IT sales and services.
We'll be disciplined here, but we are committed to making these investments, while the environment allows it. Finally, we're committed to growing operating income dollars, while maintaining disciplined execution on working capital and our cost structure. With that, let me turn it over to Michael.",354

We're really excited about the growth in our Commercial businesses right now and had strong showings across all of our Enterprise solutions businesses: Servers, Networking, Storage and Services. Our Solutions revenue is on a $17 billion run rate, delivers gross margins in the low-30s and now contributes more than 50% of the company's gross margin dollars.
In our Commercial business, Solutions revenue grew 41% from a year ago and represents 35% of the revenue. This is a five-point mix shift from a year ago and an eight-point shift from two years ago. These solutions are resonating with customers and we're winning. Enterprise is a big part of our growth strategy and we plan to fully participate year. 
While this growth is important to our long-term success, we're also the front end of a powerful refresh in the Corporate and Public Client business. We estimate that less than 5% of large Commercial customers worldwide have made the transition to Windows 7 and Office 2010. We're also seeing Server and Storage refresh rates accelerate, as customers virtualize their data centers and transition to the latest technology. Both of these trends will be powerful catalyst for Dell's growth to help fund current and future investments. With that, let me now open the operator for questions.",214

At the analyst day last July you talked about 7% plus operating margins in a period of strong growth, driven by the higher margin corporate revenues. And this is the first quarter that we've seen that significant mix shift away from Consumer towards SMB and Enterprise. I wonder if you can just comment on whether the operating leverage in the model was as you expected? And if that 7% operating margin target is still a good stretch goal to think about for the back half of this year, 2011?",93

That's still our target and we talk about that as more of a longer-term target that we're driving towards. I think as we've talked about it, there is nice leverage in our business when we see the Commercial business demand come back, and we're seeing that. I mean, look at the results in the Commercial businesses, in LE and SMB even Public ultimately, nice leverage with the demand coming back. But we've also said that we're going to make some pretty significant investments in shifting the business and building out our Enterprise business. And I think that's a balance that we're trying to work through as we move forward. But the leverage is clearly there and we are still targeting the 7%.",124

It's, as you saw, in the results of that business before we acquired it, I mean, it's 7% plus sort of operating income business. The pressure we've seen in Public was really the softness in the U.S. Federal business and EMEA, and I would call out specifically the U.K. Government business was pretty weak. Those are businesses that are typically pretty high Enterprise mix, and therefore, pretty high margin. So that's the short-term dynamic we're managing through in the Public business. But still like the profitability there, still like the growth prospects and well-positioned to go forward.",117

I know you managed the business to the operating margin line. But I think the Street had perhaps expected a little bit more of a gross margin rebound, given the more favorable customer mix you had in the quarter. I suspect you're going to talk about things like component pricing and I don't know maybe even a mix shift to the channel. Can you talk about whether those are the right things to think about? Or was there also competitive pressure in the quarter? And is mid-17s sort of the new level to be thinking about? Or do you still think that gross margins can get back to the 18% level or better in coming quarters?",126

I mean were focused on driving operating income, dollar growth and we feel good about the progress we've made in the quarter. We did improve margin rates by about 20 basis points versus where we were in the fourth quarter. We said we were going to move it forward. We did see the favorable mix impact of the Consumer business being seasonally down. But this was -- as you look at the dynamics on the Commercial side of the business, it was offset by strong growth in the Client business within Commercial, which obviously within Commercial is at lower rates. So those dynamics more or less offset each other but we also saw negative mix from the very strong growth in APJ and some of the emerging countries. Maybe in China, obviously, contributed to that. So those are some fundamental dynamics we're facing. The reality is we're focused on continuing to drive operating margins back up and you'll see that progress.",169

One factor that you highlighted last quarter was you had gotten caught in a series of retail commitments and then faced a big spike, unexpected spike in DRAM pricing in the middle of the quarter, which hurt you. Extensively, that didn't repeat itself and so again I'm kind of surprised that there wasn't more gross margin leverage as well. Can you talk about what happened in terms of components in the quarter, and how that may or may not have impacted margins? And then given the strategic inventory purchases, which I gather are component pre-buys, can you talk about how you think components may or may not impact you in Q2?",130

So to your point, that's not something that we're at all calling out in the quarter, and it's something that I think we've managed pretty well. I would say that components continue to be relatively tight. Memory has been a bit of a challenge. I think from our perspective and I think from the markets perspective, what you would hear is that, that will continue to be a challenge for the next couple of quarters. What we've done is lock-in supply to the point where we're generally feeling pretty good about our capability to meet our needs. On the supply-side, I would say that the reality is that there's going to be continued pricing pressure there. Components are not going to be seeing the typical deflation that we've seen. So we're continuing to manage through that. I think we've done a better job this quarter in terms of passing that through and pricing in the marketplace, and that's something we've just got to continue to do.",197

Of the $98 million, how do you break those out between the two segments, because making some assumptions based on your previous acquisitions, it looks like you might actually be seeing some lower or pressure on your services gross margin. Can you just tell me how that splits out and if that's correct?",71

But at the op inc line, it's basically about the same operating income or slightly better than the company. So as a service asset, clearly an important asset for us. But you will see some dilution in the services gross margin over time because of that.",80

I think that the signal you take from the buyback would really be around our comfort that the business continues to perform well, that the credit issues that we were troubled with a year and half ago are really behind us. And then I think we've gotten comfortable with what it is we need to accomplish in that plan in terms of strategic other uses. So I think that's how I would read it again. I would say we expect to have a relatively modest repurchase plan for the rest of the year, and as we said before, I think we said it last quarter, we would expect to be somewhat balanced and like to do both of those things make strategic investments but also do buyback.",148

And as we announced in the last quarter, we had consolidated the Consumer business with the SMB business. That creates for us some nice leverages on the cost structure, there's businesses we've just begun to sort of realize, some of those benefits and I would also say that we continue to work aggressively to reduce the COGS and the cost of our Consumer products.

In the quarter reported, should we think about that then as maybe the offsetting, a lower margin contribution from the Client business that ramps? And what happens longer-term if the clients starts to really see a refresh cycle pickup? Will that overcome or offset these better margins in the Server business?",88

That for us creates obviously scale. It obviously creates opportunities to attach and sell other products that are very high margin. And that's just a dynamic we're going to face into and the reality it's going to drive more operating income dollars for the company. It may create, in the Commercial business, some pressure on gross margins. And I think that's okay. I think that's for the long term -- the direction we're driving and continuing to grow our Enterprise business at 38%. I mean that's a big measure of success in terms of our transformation and I think it's important that we make progress there to.",142

Could you talk about your Consumer segment gross margin trends here in the context of getting back to your 7% kind of targeted overall corporate operating margin level?",62

You would see operating income of the Consumer business. And again, I think that's been relatively consistent in the something under 1% from the last year, with the exception of the second quarter last year I think. I think the context and the framework we've created for the 7% operating income would count on the Consumer business than the 2% plus sort of range, and I think we can get there with that. So again, the Consumer business is important for us from a scale standpoint, but we think it can generate 2% plus kind of operating income.",113

Your closest peer reported something of I think it was a 4% sequential growth.

I think typical seasonality is down quarter-over-quarter. In fact, we were essentially flat I think maybe at around to minus one here. But no, we didn't see a pause throughout that period. The Nehalem-EX -- for both Westmere and Nehalem-EX and then -- and Nehalem-EX sensors goes on four sockets. You're seeing now the start of the qualification and validation for that. So I think you're going to see continued pick up on the Nehalem-EX as now people get past their own internal qualification processes and move more into a production buying pattern.",96

I wouldn't expect a dramatic change in that, reserve the right given the component kind of environment to maybe do something there. But I think the other dynamic that's going on obviously as we see the growth of the Retail business, as we see the ability to put more product on the water, those are things that are obviously putting pressure on the inventory.

And we are seeing a good pipeline and some nice return to growth there.

Clearly, inventory was used this quarter. But then more importantly, sort of as we go through the year, can you give us an idea of how we should think about operating cash flow sort of quarterly in things just to keep in mind from a seasonality standpoint?",68

Obviously one of the things we do is have our bonus payout that was a driver in the quarter. Working capital, we've said we expect to continue to keep that in the mid-30s, negative mid-30s. So not a dramatic move one way or another. I mean you may see a couple of days here and there but that's generally pretty solid. We've generated $4.3 billion of free cash flow for the last four quarters on a rolling basis, and something similar we would expect this year. So there may be some seasonality as it relates to linearity in our revenue growth that affects working capital. But I think about it on a rolling 12 months kind of basis, and that's the way I think about it.",142

Can you talk about how you -- I know you've talked about it before, but how do you see this rolling out? More importantly, how we should think about ASPs and given what's going on at comment side and what's required for Win 7. Just anything you can give us, because again there's a lot of used equipment out there clearly that people can kind of pull it and replace it. Some kind of a different time, so anything you can give us there that would be helpful?",133

And there wasn't really a catalyst or series of catalyst to upgrade and now we believe there is, and we're seeing significant projects and conviction among customers. What I'd also tell you is that there's a real shift toward more of a data center based client model in the various forms whether it's client virtualization. So there's a shift in where that spend is going to more Servers, Storage with our PowerEdge, EqualLogic platforms. So far, the dynamic that Brian described I think you're going to see that play out here a bit where we have increased operating income firm growth in the client business, but that obviously pressures gross margins somewhat. Operating income growth is kind of what we're focused on here. I do think you'll see the Server and Storage businesses continue to grow faster. Services as well.",163

I'm just curious I guess if we're rebounding from an awfully weak several quarters, why the Q2 outlook calling for seasonally slower large corporate demand. I mean is there if we were really rebounding and refreshing, wouldn't we be able to have sort of a better than seasonal corporate outlook in the second quarter?",100

We talked about a bit of a budget flush, and we saw basically almost counter seasonal growth or flat revenue into the first quarter. I think it's been a little bit better than we've expected and better than we anticipated and talked about. But I do think you will see the typical slowdown in terms of large corporate transactions during the course of the summer and especially in Europe. I mean that's just the dynamic that you face.

When you talk about Europe, clearly when you look at currency, sort of moving through the system over a period of time depending upon sort of hedged windows and time frames, for anybody, for any of the competitors to protect margins there they're going to have U.S dollar exposure and selling into a euro market. They're going to have to raise prices ultimately so. I mean I think that's just the reality that we're going to see and over the next couple of months if you see the U.S. dollar and euro continuing the current relationship, I think that's just a reality and it probably will ultimately impact demand.",152

And I think Michael alluded earlier where -- most globally, the largest data centers moving kind of this hyper scale cloud computing model is deploying on those platforms and then we're winning more than our fair share of that volume and are now kind of leading in providing those class of solutions. And that business continues to be very strong and is particularly strong this quarter. And it's kind of built -- improved quarter-over-quarter for the last several quarters. What we've done this quarter in addition to that is that there's a lot of unique learnings from that offering, and we have now taken those learnings and created a more standard line-up of product called the PowerEdge Series C to take those -- to be able to kind of transfer those learnings into a tailored offering for more of the Fortune 500 type of accounts that are looking at putting in their own private cloud. So we think that's going to be really strong lineup, and we just launched that mid-March. So we think that's some upside going forward.",195

With me today are Michael Dell, Brian Gladden and Steve Schuckenbrock, Head of our Large Enterprise business. Brian and Steve will review our second quarter results, then Michael will follow with some brief comments. 
We posted our web deck on dell.com and we released a VLog on DellShares. I encourage you to review these materials for additional perspective. Some of our upcoming Investor Relations activities include the Citi Technology Conference on September 8, and the Deutsche Bank conference on September 15. Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements, made during this call that relate to future results and events, are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations.
Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at dell.com and our 8-K filed today, which we encourage you to review. Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress. Now I'll turn it over to Brian.",254

We had another solid quarter when you look at our revenue growth operating, income growth and our strong cash flow generation. The key to our results continues to be strong global commercial demand, especially in Servers and Networking, Storage and Services. 
These revenues were up 43% to $4.3 billion with strength across the board. And also aided by the integration of Perot. We had another strong quarter in emerging countries as well with 52% growth in the BRIC countries. While we had solid performance at the operating income line, we continue to see challenging dynamics in our supply chain cost, which pressured our gross margins and consumer profitability.
We continue to have confidence that we'll improve gross margins in the second half as we see a better cost component environment and we execute operational improvements in our Consumer business. Given our enterprise focus, today we've asked Steve Schuckenbrock to share his view on the progress in our Large Enterprise business, as well as the overall trends in Enterprise Solutions.
But first, let's look at the second quarter P&L and key performance metrics, which are provided on Pages 5 and 6 of the web deck. Revenue in the second quarter was $15.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. This is slightly above our typical historical seasonality as we saw a better demand in all the Commercial businesses than the typical second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $745 million or 4.8% of revenue, and EPS was $0.28, which is up 17% year-over-year. On the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Operating income grew 9% to $872 million or 5.6% of revenue. Consistent with our views from the first quarter call and the Analyst Meeting, we saw improved client product demand from Commercial customers and sequential commodity component inflation. 
These dynamics resulted in a sequential gross margin decline of about 40 basis points. Given this margin pressure, we managed OpEx to 11.6% of revenue, while still making key investments in Enterprise Solutions, R&D and sales-related resources. 
Our financing and other expenses were $49 million, which is down modestly versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect F&O [financing and other] to trend in the $50 million-plus range. Our tax rate was 23.6%, reflects some discrete items along with increased profits and lower tax jurisdictions. For the year, we expect our tax rate to be in the 25% to 26% range, which is slightly lower than our previous outlook. 
Net income was up 9% to $629 million, while EPS increased 10% year-over-year to $0.32 per share. We generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. In addition, we delivered $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $4.4 billion of free cash flow for the last four quarters. 
Our working capital performance continues to be solid. Days receivable were up three days, along with a one-day increase in inventory, offset by a four-day improvement in days payable, with our overall cash conversion cycle flat at negative 36 days.
We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain in the negative mid-30s throughout the year. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion in cash and investments. During the quarter, we again repurchased shares worth $200 million and expect to maintain a modest buyback program for the rest of the year. As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure and manage our U.S. liquidity, we're also monitoring the credit markets for potentially favorable entry points.
Turning to our global business unit performance. Our combined Commercial businesses grew revenue 28% to $12.7 billion with op inc up 22%. Strong demand trends continue within Commercial. 
Steve will talk more to the Large Enterprise business along with our overall Enterprise results in a moment. Our Public business revenue was up 21% to $4.6 billion, benefiting from the Perot integration year-over-year. 
We saw strength in the Healthcare space with initiatives like our Medical Archiving Solution, while state and local government revenue was relatively flat. Operating income was down 4% to $369 million, but remained a healthy 8% of revenue.
Server and Networking revenue was up 12% in the quarter. Our Small and Medium Business had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 25% to $3.5 billion, and operating income grew 32% to $323 million or 9.1% of revenue.
Our Server, Storage and Client businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, as a result of improving demand and solid execution across the business. Our Consumer business revenue was flat at $2.9 billion and generated a $21 million operating income loss. 
As we discussed at our recent analyst day meetings, we're confident we can improve our Consumer business operating margins to the 2% level in the near term. We've been repositioning the business, which involves targeting our efforts to the right geographies, products and customer subsegments. 
We have a solid product portfolio lining up for the holidays, and we're making progress in simplifying our product portfolio on increasing our ocean shipments and in growing our FastTrack capabilities, and we do have line of sight to additional G&A savings that will help the business. 
Regionally, we saw revenue growth across all regions. APJ delivered 38% growth, while the Americas and EMEA were up 17% and 24%, respectively. 
I wanted to briefly cover some other key product highlights before I turn it over to Steve to talk about Enterprise. The corporate refresh cycle is continuing, and we've seen Commercial client revenue growth of 14% and 25% over the past two quarters. In our second quarter, total revenue in Mobility and Desktops grew 21% and 17%, respectively. 
Mobility units were up 21%, while Desktop units were up 12%. We saw a particular strength in Large Enterprise and Small and Medium Business here. Software & Peripherals remains an important business for us growing revenues of 6% driven by strong performance from displays and electronics and peripheral. 
Servers & Networking Storage and Services accounted for 34% of Commercial revenue in the second quarter, up from 30% a year ago. Now let me turn it over to Steve Schuckenbrock to discuss some of the successes we're seeing in Enterprise Solutions and the Large Enterprise segment.",1032
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-19-2010",2010-08-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3230.0,75755.0,5506817.0,Presenter Speech,Stephen Schuckenbrock,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. At our June Analyst Meeting, we mentioned a number of initiatives to drive growth in our Enterprise Solutions business, including investments in sales and solutions resources. We're investing in training and the acquisition of key assets to fill gaps and address customer needs. I'll talk more about all of these in just a moment. However, I'd like to start with Large Enterprise. 
We had a good quarter as we saw broad-based demand across verticals and double-digit growth in all geographies. Large Enterprise grew revenue 38% to $4.5 billion, which represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and brings us closer to the pre-recession demand levels in fiscal 2009.
Operating income dollars were up 68% to $288 million or 6.3% of revenue. Operating income was driven by increased scale and strong Enterprise Solutions growth. While we encountered some pressure from the commodity costs and an increase in client revenues, overall, the performance was good. 
From a business line perspective, we saw a number of positive trends. Server growth led all categories, except Services with a revenue increase of 54%, driven by customers taking advantage of positive ROI projects, along with another strong quarter in our Data Center Solutions business. 
Storage was up 14%, and we had a significantly improved profitability as customers continue to adopt our EqualLogic solutions. As Brian mentioned, we are seeing continued evidence of a corporate refresh cycle as Notebooks and Desktop revenue were up 51% and 35%, respectively. With a significantly aged installed base and a relatively low Windows 7 migration, we expect these general trends to continue well into the next few quarters. Now let me turn to a few highlights on Dell's overall Enterprise Solutions.
Let me state that Dell has not been this integrated and aligned around how to drive solutions ever in its history. It is exciting to see this comprehensive approach and the thousands of employees in the company that support and execute on solutions everyday. And it is also important that our customers recognize us as one team and that's happening. 
We had another strong Enterprise Solutions quarter. Our combined Commercial Server, Networking, Storage and Services revenue grew 43% to $4.3 billion. In Services, we continue to make solid progress with respect to the integration. Commercial Dell Services grew 68% to $1.8 billion, driven by the integration of Perot.
We are on track for our cost synergies and sales targets, and industry demand conditions are improving as customers gain greater visibility into their businesses. The outsourcing pipeline is expanding, which should position us well for the second half of the year. 
In addition, we benefited from a stronger discretionary environment during the first half as project revenue grew double digits during the quarter. In Servers, revenue grew 35% fueled by the strength in Blades, with a growth of 35%, as well as our Data Center Solutions business. Dell now powers 21 of the top 25 most heavily trafficked websites in the world. 
As a whole, our Storage revenue was up 13% to $624 million. More importantly, our Storage product mix continues to drive improved operating margins. EqualLogic and PowerVault led revenue growth, up 63% and 14%, respectively. We continue to see adoption of EqualLogic across a wide array of customers, small, medium and large. And EqualLogic scales very well through all of those needs. 
Let me turn to acquisitions and alliances. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Scalent and Ocarina. Scalent is a company that provides technology used in the Dell Advanced Infrastructure Manager, a key building block for Dell's virtual integrated solutions. 
Ocarina is the leader in online storage optimization solutions, including compression and deduplication and brings significant value as network utilization and storage utilization are dramatically increased. With the addition of key IP and technology from companies like Ocarina and Exanet, we will continue to enhance our product offerings as we seek to provide customers greater choice and value in storage and data management solutions. 
In addition, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our KACE integration and have seen strong growth in the early stages. We are really excited about this growing set of assets and capabilities, and we'll continue to make targeted additions in areas such as storage, software and services.
We are also very pleased about our plans to acquire 3PAR, which we announced earlier this week. This acquisition brings together 3PAR's architecturally advantaged technology for the cloud with Dell's ability to deploy, scale and grow it. And 3PAR fits perfectly with Dell's commitment to open, capable and affordable solutions that deliver value and lower total cost of ownership. You might say that 3PAR represents in the Fiber Channel space what EqualLogic is in the iSCSI space. 
Now let me turn this back over to Brian.",797

Let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, we're pleased with our year-to-date revenue and operating income results, along with the very strong cash flow generation. 
Our priorities remain to increase operating income through the back half of the year through aggressive Enterprise Solutions growth as we continue to make targeted investments and prudently manage our costs. As we've said for the past three quarters, we're seeing a broad corporate client refresh, and we believe this solid demand will extend through the next several quarters. We're well positioned to benefit from this growth as our Commercial businesses make up 81% of our revenue.
For our third quarter, we expect the typical seasonal improvements from our Federal, Government and Commercial businesses. Overall, we expect to see a pickup in the low single digits in the third quarter. 
Component pricing is improving. And we expect to see a return to modest cost reductions in the third and fourth quarters. Currency volatility is also a concern, though our hedge programs do provide stability for us. As you see in our second quarter results, we continue to manage OpEx in a disciplined way, with lower spending in G&A and in our Client business. 
We also are seeing some of the impacts from the consolidation of our Consumer and SMB businesses. Despite the impressive OpEx performance for the quarter, we do expect OpEx to trend upward and expect gross margins to increase as we'll manage operating income and those dynamics while we make the right Enterprise and sales investments for the company.
Finally, with the solid Commercial demand and improving commodity price environment we're seeing, we expect revenue growth for the year to be in the 14% to 19% range. We also are confident that our operating income growth will be in the 18% to 23% growth range. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",317

Our progress in the first half shows that we're executing to a clear and consistent strategy. Demand trends continue to be favorable with our stronger weighting towards Commercial. In the Client business, we're seeing the corporate refresh cycle continue as both Notebooks and Desktops demonstrated strong revenue and unit growth. 
According to IDC [International Data Corporation], approximately 65% of enterprises have already begun or will begin their migration to Windows 7 within the next six months. And 89% of companies have definitive plans to begin their migration to Windows 7 within a 24-month period. 
I'm also very encouraged by the progress in our Enterprise business. Customers are increasingly choosing Dell Servers, which grew 35% in Q2. Today, two out of every five in United States and one out of every three Servers sold worldwide are Dell. We feel great about the progress we're making also with Blades and Cloud revenues. 
In storage, EqualLogic continues to gain momentum and experience wider adoption, delivering over $1 billion in revenue since the acquisition and about $800 million this year. And we're continuing to build our Enterprise portfolio with our planned addition of 3PAR. Overall, we feel good about this demand environment and the evolution of our Enterprise business and the expansion of our IT portfolio in the data center. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Rob.",226

And related to that, I think your Consumer business lost more money this quarter than any quarter since you began reporting it separately. So could you explain in more detail the profit performance there in Consumer? And what surprised you in the quarter? Brian, I think you mentioned supply chain cost pressures. So what specifically gives you confidence that this business will generate 1% to 2% operating margins in the near term? Is it component costs becoming more favorable? Is it specific initiatives to drive profitability, which ones are important and which ones are you accelerating?",115

That affected the entire business, Commercial as well as Consumer. Consumer margins, within the Consumer business, I would say weren't necessarily down. And frankly, as we laid out at the Analyst Meeting, we've got some pretty dramatic and significant actions underway to improve profitability in the business, especially in the Retail business. And I would tell you that we've seen some progress there. Though as you've mentioned and the P&L shows, it's not quite evident yet. I would say for Consumer, we did see some demand weakening during the quarter, during the latter parts of the quarter. But I would also remind you that the Consumer industry has been very strong for more than two years and we've grown faster than the market during that period of time. I'll also remind you that the Consumer is 19% of the business. So we'll continue to watch that demand. But we would say we're still committed to driving to a 2% operating income target as we look out over the next couple of quarters.",187

And if you look on a Q-on-Q basis, I think we saw an accelerated client refresh underway with our customers, and Michael referenced that in his comments as well. When you combine that and the margin rate associated with the Client business relative to the rest of our business, it certainly puts some pressure on the gross margin line. We have very specific plans in place, especially now that we have the E1 to E2 transition in the laptop under our belt for how we can get the client margins back up, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that in the coming quarters.",126

We saw, as we were together in June, that was sort of the very early start of seeing some of these declines. We did do some strategic buys, as you see our inventory balance in the quarter, we put some more strategic inventory on the books. And I think we are starting to see more dramatic declines. I do have some concern in some cases that there'll be some capacity that comes out and those prices will stabilize in the short term or on the medium term. So we continue to watch it. I think we did not see a lot of benefit in the P&L in the second quarter of declines at all in the second half of the quarter. We do expect to see some of that as we move into the third, and we'll watch it. I mean, I think it's, as you know, I mean across the board, memory, LCDs, hard disks we're seeing prices come down. But I think it remains to be seen how that plays out beyond the September timeframe.",179

Your fiscal Q4 hasn't really exhibited a normal seasonality over the last five or six years. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about that? If we assume even flat for Q4, you're going to be close to the high end of your revenue guidance range, probably somewhere around 18%. So a, how we think of seasonality for Q4, what is kind of normal and we can calibrate against that? And then secondly, why shouldn't we be looking at the high end of your revenue guidance at this point? Is there anything you're anxious about?",106

I think there is, as I called out in my comments and in the answer to the first question, I think there is some -- we're watching the Consumer demand and as you look at our historical fourth quarter performance, it would typically be driven by a pretty dramatic increase in the Consumer business around the holidays. I think that's the biggest question we have right now as we look at the second half of the year how that might play out. So I would hesitate to call that. I would suggest that if we saw a typical seasonality we would see a sequential pickup driven by Consumer, and your conclusion is probably right. But again, a little bit of hesitancy just given what we've just recently seen with Consumer demand. So we'll continue to watch that.",144

And I think as we're heading towards the end of that period, it's mostly done. And I think as we think about inventory in the system, as you know, our business model generally is pretty light on that in terms of our model serving the customers. So I mean it's not necessarily an issue for us. But we would have, as you know, our inventory balance is up, and there are investments we've made in strategic inventory as we've moved to ODM [Original Design Manufacturers] and as we've talked about, we are putting more material into the system, into the supply chain and some of that's on the water in terms of a transportation model that allows us to get some cost out of being competitive. So there would be more inventory in the system for us than there otherwise typically historically would.

I mean, there is very strong demand in the Enterprise side of the business. That helps, obviously. If component prices stabilize at lower levels which we're seeing now, I mean, we should make progress in terms of gross margin improvements. I think what we showed in the quarter is that even with pressure on that gross margin, managing the cost level, OpEx in the business, we are trying to drive operating income and operating income dollar commitments. And that's sort of the way we're thinking about it, Katy. I hate to size the gross margin improvement, given the uncertainty around component prices right now.",123

You've obviously made a couple of big moves there with EqualLogic and now with 3PAR, but you also have a big EMC business reselling. So how do you foresee the relationship there playing out? And are you interested in adding some more, let's call it, competing lines with EMC over longer term?",67

If you look at the changes in the Storage business, I think one of the most remarkable ones is the increase in gross margin dollars in this business. Certainly, that comes from having more and more of our own IP. We had a great success with EqualLogic, the EMC relationship continues and as we pointed out earlier this week, about 80% of the Dell/EMC relationship fits into the lower end CLARiiON CX120 product, the AX product, the NAS [network-attached storage] product and data domain, which are really products that we, today, do not have similar offerings for. And so there's a strong relationship there that I think will continue for some time. Certainly, there'll be places where we choose the partner and places where we choose to compete. But we also see with this proposed 3PAR acquisition a great opportunity to grow the high end of our Storage portfolio and continue to make this rapidly growing part of Dell's overall business.",162

Brian, I'll defer to you in terms of the numbers. The thing that we're doing relative to this with Dave Johnson's leadership is really putting a world-class team up against every one of these acquisitions and ensuring that every aspect of integration that needs to be contemplated is getting done, and it gets the highest possible priority in the business. From a sales force standpoint, I can tell you that the fact that our intention to acquire 3PAR actually resonates exceptionally well with our sales force. One is, as you've seen with our Server numbers, more and more were right in the heart of the data center. And number two is, is that the value proposition from 3PAR has an awful lot of analog to the value proposition with our EqualLogic in manageability and thin provisioning in terms of all of those type of characteristics, the ease of installation and management of that platform is phenomenal. And so the value proposition will resonate well. Our challenge is to scale, and so we will clearly be scaling our specialist capability in the Storage space to represent not only our intended acquisition of 3PAR, but to continue growth of our EMC business in the mid-range that Michael referenced and continuing the significant growth we've seen around PowerVault and EqualLogic, so I'm quite confident. And when you look at the software acquisitions we've made with Ocarina, with Scalent and with Exanet, those fit beautifully inside that strategy. So we happen to have a couple thousand of our sales folks in town this week for training, and I can tell you that the energy and enthusiasm couldn't be any better.",311

As we look at component prices moving, clearly, that could be a catalyst in terms of overall market pricing. But I think we'll have to see.

Is the main one now still components and where that's going to go? And you did mention on the call that you thought that you'd recover some on the gross margin line. I guess most of us were modeling 17.7% or 17.8% gross margin. Do you think we're going to get there next quarter?",92

I mean, if you look year-over-year, components still continue to be a pretty dramatic headwind. I think if you look sequentially, we'll probably see some relief and, as we said, some modest improvement in terms of component pricing. There is still pressure from an FX standpoint on the business as you look at where the euro is versus hedges that we've had over the last couple of quarters. And that's something that the teams are very, very focused on in the marketplace to try and recover. I think, look, with component prices moving down and to the extent that they can continue to moderate or soften a bit, that should be a catalyst that allows margin rates to move back up. And we'll manage that throughout the year and as we showed in this quarter, I think we'll look at the cost line as well in terms of trying to manage the operating income commitments.",166

We have some new products launching in the second half of the year for the holiday season, which we think we feel very, very good about. We have continued activities that help us improve supply chain costs. Component cost should also help. So most of those would be really demand independent and would help us improve the profitability in that business, and we'll continue to manage OpEx as well.

The question is, is that if I compare that to what the third-party research firm had estimated at kind of a mid-30% growth rate, it seems like there's a little bit of a disconnect with those estimates relative to what you reported.

That strength was seen across all of our Commercial businesses. All three businesses were up double digits in the Server space, and that's with a healthy DCS, our Data Center Solutions business.

We talked about where we are in the cycle. I think, certainly the virtualization wave is still well and bloom and there's a lot of that activity. But we're also seeing a continued migration of what I would call networking-related activities moving into the Server domain. You see this in a couple of forms. One is the specialized networking companies moving onto an x86 platform. That's relevant because of Dell's OEM business for those companies. But at the same time, you see those companies creating a virtual version of their application, which is easily put into a large complex of Dell servers in the form of one of our large blades or other architecture.

I mean the teams are very, very well aligned in the field. I think the customers have received this as a component of Dell's business very, very well. We've closed a number of good deals. We've got a very healthy pipeline as we look to the second half of the year. We are not trying to hurry these signings into the current quarter. We're taking the signings as they come and in fact, as we start the third quarter, are already off to a very healthy start. And so when I look at the Outsourcing business overall, I think demand is pretty strong. I think Dell has the opportunity to capitalize maybe a little better than some of the others, because there is a fair amount of white space for us in certain geographies, EMEA and APJ specifically, and across our entire Commercial business.

It would probably be a lot more comforting if you could say that on a sequential basis. Any color that you can provide there?,45

And I think without getting into specifics on the second half of the year, I mean, our call for the total year stands and I think you would see nice leverage as well in the second half of the year as we've seen in the first half. I think if you look at the first half of the year, we did see leverage in the business, especially when you look -- in the second quarter, for instance, if you adjust results from prior year for -- last year, if you recall, we called out a one-time vendor transaction, which represented about a $69 million benefit for us. If you adjust for that from last year, I mean, we see in the first half of the year operating income growing at 24%, while revenues growing at 21% year-to-date, so you are seeing leverage. And that's sort of the overall outlook we've called for the entire year is pretty consistent with that.",189

But EqualLogic is doing really well, but the total Storage business at least in a trailing 12-month basis is down over the last couple of years. So can you just talk about the dynamic there? And are we expecting any cannibalization with the 3PAR acquisition?",60

I mean, about a year ago, we really changed the focus in our Storage business from being a pure reseller to being a real Storage business that brings not only our own IP, but IP from our partner EMC through an OEM lens, as opposed to just as a pure reseller. And so that's impacted the revenue line. But what you're seeing is a significant increase in the overall margin execution in our business. And so what you're seeing on a year-over-year basis from a growth standpoint is that SIM is now getting out of the number entirely, but it's still overlapping with the SIM business last year.",113

I guess I'm just curious. Well, two things: One is, how much of that do you think is Windows 7 refresh versus just kind of macro GDP corporate profitability improvement? And then I guess taking that further, I mean, is that something that you think is peaking soon, or are we early in that if you could ballpark? I mean, you said now in the release, it's well underway. But I don't know, I'm sure you won't say it. But if you had to pick an inning, which would you pick?",117

And in Large Enterprise, I think, what we've seen is that came a little bit faster than we might have expected, but it's terrific. It's terrific demand that we are capitalizing on that demand, I think, quite well. When you consider more broadly where are we in this overall demand environment and what are the key drivers of it, and the clients base is certainly at Win 7 and it's the age of the assets. And the fact that replacing the assets with new technology saves company's money as it reduces maintenance cost, reduces power and pooling costs, et cetera. As they are deploying Win 7 anyway, it gives them a great Windows to deploy the new technology. In the Server space and in the Storage space, we continue to see customers driving down the total cost of ownership in the infrastructure arena. And they're continuing to standardize on x86 servers, they're continuing to virtualize all of their infrastructure and they're consolidating their storage footprints to better tiering up that storage and better utilization of that storage, and all of that is behind what's driving the demand. I won't predict an inning, but I can tell you that there's plenty of headroom for savings in companies and their IT infrastructure, and I think that's what's fueling this.",255

There was some pretty broad-based strength in Europe. Germany was up 31%, France was up 22%, U.K. was probably the weak spot at up 6%. And I think we would say Europe, I mean, there's the normal slowing that you would see in the back half of the second quarter, but I wouldn't call it unusual. We didn't see dramatic slowdowns in Europe, and I would call that relatively steady. If you look at Asia, it was driven by China. China was up for us over 50%, India was up over 75%, Japan was probably the slowest growing country at 5% growth and ANZ for us was up over 30%. And I would say the same thing, we did not see a dramatic slowdown in APJ towards the end of the quarter. It was pretty steady throughout the quarter. And we're expecting continued relatively strong demand there.",161

I'm just curious if you think the declines in pricing for components are coming more from a lower demand, so basically, the vendors are just ordering to your components, or if it's more that the manufacturers have actually increased capacity?

I would tell you that what we're seeing now is more driven by short-term demand, and that's sort of what's driving the current commodity environment that we see. That capacity is still out there. I'm just not sure they're going to -- it depends on what happens obviously with demand as to whether or not they'll need that in the second half of the year.

I'd like to start by saying that we had a good third quarter with solid revenue and profitability growth and good cash flow. Highlights for the quarter include an improvement in our gross margins, continued expansion in emerging markets and sustained strength in our global commercial customers' demand, as they continue to see value in our products, services and solutions. These accomplishments validate our strategy and demonstrate we're making progress towards our long-term value creation framework. 
Revenue for the quarter grew 19% year-over-year, driven by our Enterprise Solutions and Services business and a strong Commercial client refresh. We believe we're making strategic progress in improving our Consumer business, but we do still have work to do there. And Steve Felice is here today to provide an update on both Consumer and SMB later in the call. 
Execution on pricing and cost initiatives and a favorable component environment lead to the highest operating income we've seen in nearly five years. The profitability in our Commercial businesses was driven by improved product margins in our Enterprise Solutions and Services and Client Hardware businesses. 
Let's take a closer look at the third quarter P&L and key performance metrics, which are provided for your reference on Pages 5 and 6 in the web deck.  Revenue in the third quarter was $15.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions and Services grew 31% to $4.3 billion in revenue. Our Client Product business grew 18% to $8.5 billion, driven by Commercial Client Hardware revenues growth of 23%. Sequentially, consolidated revenue was down 1%, primarily due to a softer than anticipated consumer demand environment. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1 billion or 6.7% of revenue. Earnings per share was $0.42, which was up 147% year-over-year and up 50% sequentially.  Interest and Other benefited from the receipt of a $72 million merger termination fee. 
For the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Operating income grew 58% to $1.17 billion or 7.6% of revenue. All of our Commercial segment showed improved operating leverage in the quarter. The Commercial segments as a whole delivered 10% operating income, representing a 230 basis point increase from the previous quarter. 
We delivered 20% gross margins, driven by better supply chain execution, pricing discipline and broad component cost declines, which affected all of our lines of business from Client Hardware to Services to Software and Peripherals. As these components cost declines work themselves through the industry supply chain, we do expect the industry pricing environment to more fully reflect these changes. 
We continue to manage operating expenses well, while we're making important strategic investments in the company. OpEx of $1.9 billion or 12.4% of revenue was up slightly, primarily driven by increased expense related to our performance-based compensation. As we told you in June, our variable compensation plans are directly tied to revenue growth, operating income growth and cash flow. 
Interest and other expenses were $20 million, with some favorability from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets from the balance sheet. Our tax rate was 23.7%. Earnings per share increased 96% year-over-year to $0.45 per share. We generated $913 million in cash flow from operations and $866 million in free cash flow.  
For the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was $3.8 billion. This quarter, we purchased a portfolio of financing receivables from CIT, which brings in-house the majority of receivables Dell was managing for CIT as part of our previously dissolved joint-venture. There are more details on this transaction in the web deck on Page 10.
Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 32 days. While we saw a one day improvement in days of inventory, payables fell by five days, driven by our deliberate reduction of inventory levels and the linearity of our supply-chain in the quarter which we think will normalize in the fourth quarter. Days receivable was flat sequentially. We expect our cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-negative 30s. 
We ended the quarter with $14 billion in cash investments and issued $1.5 billion in new debt. During the quarter, we repurchased shares worth $200 million. 
Now let's look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you can find detailed on Pages 11 through 15 of our web deck. We had another strong Enterprise Solutions quarter, which is at the heart of where we're driving the strategy. Enterprise Solutions and Services now represent 33% of commercial revenue in our third quarter. 
Servers and Storage grew 20% and 7% respectively. In Servers, our new cloud products contributed to our growth, while demand for blades was up 49%. In Storage, our EqualLogic business grew 66% and we continue to work with EMC to optimize this relationship and drive additional profitable Storage growth. In our Networking business, revenue was up 36% in the quarter.
Dell Services revenue grew 55% to $1.9 billion driven by the combination with Perot. The Services business is detailed on Pages 12 and 13 of our web deck. 
For now, a full year into the integration and ahead of our revenue and cost synergy targets. We're seeing solid growth in the discretionary project and consulting and attach-based transactional services. Transactional and project services grew 5% and 14% respectively. Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We do have a strong outsourcing sales pipeline, but we continue to experience a longer outsourcing sales cycle that does appear to be an industry-wide dynamic.
We continue to believe that the corporate refresh cycle is well underway, and client hardware revenues overall were up 18%, with mobility and desktops up 16% and 21% respectively. In Commercial, client revenue was up 23%, while Consumer growth was weaker at 8%. Software and peripherals grew revenues at 8%, driven by strong performance from displays and electronics and peripherals. 
Geographically, we saw revenue growth across all regions with APJ up 29% and the Americas and EMEA up 18% and 15% respectively. Emerging countries continue to be a key driver. BRIC countries grew at 30% and now represent 13% of our consolidated revenue for the company.
Turning to our segment level performance on Pages 16 through 20 in the web deck, in the three Commercial segments combined, revenue grew 24% to $12.4 billion. Strong demand, pricing execution and a favorable cost environment led to strong double-digit gross margin dollar growth of every line of business. The Commercial segment delivered $1.2 billion in operating income or 10% of revenue. 
First let me start with the Large Enterprise segment. Revenue was up 27% to $4.3 billion, led by an ongoing hardware refresh among our largest corporate accounts. Client revenue was up 38% and server growth was up 16%. Operating income as a percentage of revenue improved nearly 300 basis points sequentially, driven by product margin improvements in servers, storage services and client hardware. Operating income was $400 million or 9.2% of revenue for the Large Enterprise business.
Our Public business revenue was up 20% to $4.4 billion. We continue to see a tougher spending environment in Europe, offset by overall stable demand in the U.S. Server revenue was up 18%, with Client Hardware up 8%. Our state and local government business in the U.S. represents approximately 9% of the Public business and less than 3% of Dell revenue. This business was up 5% in the third quarter. Overall, Public operating income of $451 million or 10.2% of revenue was driven by the higher mix of Enterprise Solutions and Services, tight cost controls and the improved component environment.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Felice to discuss our SMB business and provide some color on the changes that we're making in our Consumer business.",1277

As Brian has already mentioned, our Commercial business really had a good quarter, fueled by our transformation to a solutions provider and strong execution in our Client business. Our sales teams are executing on selling the value embedded in our offerings, particularly Enterprise Services and Solutions. 
Our Small and Medium Business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter. A direct model gives us a unique advantage in the mid-market. We have earned a trusted adviser status with our customers. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 24%, the highest level in two years, driven by strong demand across all product lines. Servers and client hardware were up 28% and 27% respectively. Storage was up 24% and EqualLogic, which continues to resonate with Small and Medium Business customers, was up 84%. We delivered operating income of $391 million or 10.7% of revenue. 
High growth and improved profitability occurred in every region of the world. We are particularly pleased to see EMEA continue a year of share gains and strong profitability, and while Medium business has led us into a recovery, Small businesses are beginning to see signs of strength. Our recently acquired Case Appliance revenues are exceeding forecasts and we're excited about our recent acquisition of Boomi that will allow us to provide an Integration Cloud to our customers and new cloud offerings in the near future. 
Revenue in our Consumer business was $3 billion and we delivered break even operating income. We continue to make great progress in matching our Supply Chain with retail buying seasons. Both our direct and retail businesses were profitable, offset by investments we chose to make in the business. We have been working all year to position the Consumer business for sustained profitable growth. First, we streamlined our Consumer brands to three: Inspiron, XPS and Alienware. In the past few years, we announced an exciting new lineup of great products, including the Inspiron all-in-one, the Inspiron Duo, a unique convertible net book, and three new XPS notebooks with industry-leading sound and video performance. All of this is enabling our strategy of moving back to a mix of higher price band offerings. 
Second, our supply-chain efforts are progressing well and beginning to deliver some important results. We've cut delivery times by one week, improved product quality, lowered our manufacturing cost and enabled ocean shipping for a significant portion of our volume ahead of the holiday season. We should see positive results from these changes as we move into the fourth quarter.
Third, we've been maniacally focused on delivering a superior customer experience, a heritage of Dell. Our progress is excellent with our most recent loyalty scores up significantly to new highs. Finally, we have shifted our merchandising and advertising to emphasize value with a segmented focus on key Consumer buying groups. All of this will lead to sustained profitable growth. 
Now let me turn it back over to Brian.",485

Let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Our year-to-date results are very good, with revenue up 21%, gross margins at 18.3%, OpEx at 12% and our operating income improved to 6.3%. Given the cost challenges at the first half of the year and the muted demand for the Consumer PC business, we feel pretty good about these solid results and the progress we've made towards improving our operating margins consistent with our long-term value creation framework. 
We continue to aggressively expand our enterprise solutions and services capabilities. Commercial profit margins in this area have improved in each of the last three quarters and this provides strong validation of our strategy here. We also continue to see a broad corporate client refresh. 
This growth, coupled with an improving cost environment, provide an opportunity to continue to deliver strong results, while also making the critical investments to further our strategic initiatives.
In the fourth quarter, we would normally expect some Consumer driven seasonal growth heading into the holiday season. Somewhat offset by normal U.S. Federal business seasonality. While we do expect Consumer revenue to be up sequentially, we expect more muted growth in Consumer relative to our previous views. As a result, we expect revenue overall to track in line to slightly up with what saw in the third quarter. 
As we think about margins moving forward, we believe the improved component pricing will work its way through the industry Supply Chain. This effect, coupled with a seasonal mix shift to Consumer client, will likely temper our product margins.
We're managing OpEx in a disciplined way and are comfortable with the level of spending we've had for the business over the last year. For the fourth quarter, we will continue to make investments in enterprise solutions services and sales capabilities. 
We expect interest and other to swing back to approximately a $50 million expense, and we continue to see our tax rate in the 25% to 26% range.
Finally, we expect revenue growth for the full year to track towards the middle of the 14% to 19% growth range we've shared with you in June. As you know, our year-to-date operating income growth is approximately 32%. Given our strong operating results in the quarter and year-to-date, and the continued favorable component environment, we now expect our total year operating income growth to be between 28% and 32%. 
While we don't intend to regularly provide updates to our annual outlook, we're doing so now given the magnitude of the changes in the environment and our improved operating income performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.",438

I believe the third quarter results are beginning to demonstrate that the strategy we've described to you over the past year is the correct one. We have a differentiated strategy around the enterprise for this open, capable and affordable, and this is resonating very well with our customers. We're pleased with the improvement in operating margins in our Commercial business, driven by improving execution and increasing mix of services and data center solutions. 
Over the past few weeks, I've spent a great deal of time with our customers across the U.S., Asia and Europe. More than ever, CIOs are telling us that investing in IT is a driver of strategic advantage and is necessary to enable efficiencies and savings longer-term. 
Our data center and solutions portfolio continues to grow, as does our own field and channel partner capability to deliver these around the world. Our customer engagements are evolving from solely being a supplier of IT hardware to a true provider of IT solutions, with a deep understanding of customer verticals. This change will take time, but we're making progress and we're well on our way.
Fast-growing economies like China, India and Brazil are an area of strength for us and should continue to grow rapidly for many years to come. While we're pleased with the performance during the third quarter, we see great opportunity ahead and have multiple engines of profitable growth and remaining improvements in many areas of our business. 
We believe we're well-positioned to profitably grow in the right areas and navigate the opportunities ahead. It's a great time for Dell and I see this quarter's results as a strong indicator of what's to come.

And then if we do assume that operating expenses are flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, that implies a high 18% gross margin range is that the sustainable level going forward or do you think it will take a couple of quarters for the component cost to work their way in the industry pricing?",91

So, I think your math really does make sense. I would say that as we look at component pricing, we saw what we would call a more normalized commodity deflation environment in the quarter. And as we think about how that trend is going forward, we'll continue to see a similar environment I think as we head into the fourth quarter. We will begin to see, I believe, that deflation really work its way through the Supply Chain and affect pricing over the next couple of quarters. I think that's the way we think about it. As we look at -- I think the way I think about it, Katy, is the year-to-date performance, with revenue up 21% and gross margins around 18.3% for the first three quarters of the year, is a relatively good sort of framework. And I think as we move towards the long-term value creation, commitments, with 7% operating income, it's good progress towards that.",176

I was hoping that you can maybe -- given that some of them are quite interrelated, I was hoping that you could define what you mean by each of those and if you had to mention the 280 basis point improvement in gross margin sequentially, how much might be attributable to each of those factors?",81

And as we talked about coming out of the second quarter earnings call, we did say that we expected gross margin improvement and there were some good external dynamics, component deflation was about what we expected, maybe a little bit better in the quarter and we saw some of that coming out of the second quarter. Again, we think that will continue for at least the next quarter and as we think about Supply Chain and all the things we've been doing on cost, I think that just we saw the benefit of that kind of come through in the quarter. And at the same time, we were also working pricing and pricing discipline as we exited the second quarter had a favorable carryover impact to that and got the benefit of that. But I would also say, Tony, the mix and the strong performance we see on the enterprise side of the business is a big part of the strategy is also a good positive dynamic that's affecting it.",189

Assuming OpEx is going to be relatively flat, I think that you thought Consumer margins, operating margins would be 2% in Q4 so that would be positive to you and you still stand by that and in light of the fact that Consumer looks like it's going to get better on the operating side and hopefully that means also on the gross side, what is accounting for what appears to be a fairly significant deceleration in Q4? Is it really all the pricing kind of rolling through in the industry or is there something else there? It strikes me as being more than one might anticipate.",130

Maybe Steve can talk a little bit about where we see that going. But clearly, the mix of Consumer in general in the fourth quarter will be a bit higher as we see the sort of typical seasonality even though it's a little weaker demand. It will be a bigger piece of our revenue and therefore margin. And I think as we look at the component environment, we expect it to continue to be pretty good. There will be some areas where I think it will bottom out a little bit and maybe LCDs and hard disks as we see those markets play out. And then the third thing obviously is this pricing sort of works its way through, Toni. We would expect to see a little bit more challenging sort of competitive environment.",143

So you're basically saying the pricing playing through may negatively impact things 100 or 150 basis point sequentially. I'm wondering if you have high conviction in that number or you might be conservative, or it's still not entirely intuitive to me.",64

And so you saw some of that this quarter and while the competition is always tough out there, I think we're doing a better job of segmenting the business, the types of offerings, and the customer sets we're going after. And we think that, that will continue to help us as we talked about in the past, in improving margins over the long-term. On the Consumer business, we're certainly seeing competitive juices flowing in different parts of the world. Emerging countries, China has seen some increased pressure but again, we're doing a pretty good job of being selective in how we're growing, our China business was profitable. So I think the competition continues to be strong, but we're doing a better job of picking our fights and knowing where to grow.",150

A lot of our Public business is mid-market and so those dynamics are similar to mid-market in SMB and there's a good case again where the growth is pretty healthy and so if we're selective about where we choose to sell and the solutions we'll be able to hold off the margins pretty well and the pricing has not been as big of a battle as it has in the past.",102

So we used to kind of start the conversation around the box and we're moving the conversation much more to solutions. And so as we get deeper vertical expertise and understanding about customer requirements, that's giving us a much healthier opportunity to drive up the margins stack. And you're seeing that certainly in the Commercial businesses and we continue to add more and more horizontal and vertical solutions into the mix.",89

Public and Large Enterprise were down sequentially. I know you talked about European government, but I'm curious whether you view those two results as normal seasonal. It seems like they're not. And whether you would characterize that as a cooling in the corporate upgrade cycle or, I guess, what's the right way to think about the results in those two areas sequentially?",86

And you see that across many aspects of our different products and geographic segments. So what you saw is that those businesses improved their profitability in absolute dollars and margin percent sequentially while the revenues might have come down.,73

So, if the component cost environment is more favorable than you expected, if pricing may get more competitive but it could take a few quarters so that's not really a big impact right now. You're making strides in the supply chain cost structure. Perot is tracking ahead of plan. Those are all good things. Why wouldn't your op income guidance be going up by more than the Q3 upside we just saw?",142
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3467.0,88805.0,6271638.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,32,"I think the dynamic is that as we expect this component pricing dynamic is going to continue as more normalized we would expect that to bottom out in a couple of places. And as we talked about, I think we're a bit concerned in terms of how it's going to play out in the Supply Chain and what pricing does for the quarter. We also do see a weaker demand in Consumer than we expected coming into the quarter. Those are dynamics that I think dampened the fourth quarter a bit. But again as you said, there is a pretty good external dynamics to drive the business in the fourth quarter.",111

One, I guess, are you prebuying here? And then obviously you've worked down that inventory sometime intra quarter. And I'm curious this next quarter should be getting a full quarter of component pricing benefits. So if you look at that decline in the gross margin, it actually implies a bigger drop maybe in pricing from competitors and typically the industry doesn't cut pricing unless there is some elastic benefit to units and revenue. So, I'm curious if there is just some way of conservatism there or if there is some other dynamics in play there?",104

So, the majority of the benefits, and the declines we saw most of that fell through within the quarter. We got most of the benefit within the third quarter. Again, we're trying to reap forward in terms of how the Supply Chain and how competitive dynamics will play at around pricing.

It was tied to the change in accounting from a sell through to a sell in model. As you accumulate data in a relationship, like this, the accounting basically says you move to ultimately to a sell in model once you have enough information to do that.

So, we'll obviously give you a little bit more clarity as we get to the end of the fourth quarter and provide an outlook for FY '11.

We think the DPL moved back a few days in the positive direction for us as linearity improves and as the inventory changes and is dramatic in the quarter, and as we get back to sequential revenue growth. And we should see strong continued mid-negative 30 kind of cash conversion cycle, and therefore cash flow should be significantly better than net income as we move forward to the next couple of quarters.",105

It's now over $800 million run rate. We continued to invest in that business. You've seen how we have purchased Exanet to add SYS and NFS file system capability. Ocarina to add de-duplication and compression capability. We're going to continue to build out that portfolio. We have a ten-year relationship with EMC. That relationship continues to evolve and I believe that we'll continue to be working with them as well. So when we look at the growth in the gross margins in our Storage business, we're quite pleased with the gross margin as business has roughly doubled over the course of the last two years.

Actually quite close with the U.S. being right about the average. And it take us a few quarters to kind of roll these things out around the world so they have different rates in terms of how fast we can localize the products, that kind of thing.
