266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3259.0,1678085.0,66092591.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Litzler-Hollier,,Executives,1,"Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.
We posted our press release and our web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our fiscal 2019 10-K will be filed on Friday, March 29.
Before I turn it over to Tom, I would like to highlight a few items. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow metrics. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release.
Our fiscal year '19 and Q4 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of certain adjustments such as purchase accounting, amortization of intangibles, transaction-related expenses as well as fair value equity adjustments and discrete tax items. The majority of these adjustments are noncash in nature. Please refer to the supplemental slides, beginning on Slide 23, for more detail.
Our non-GAAP net income now excludes, among other items: fair value or mark-to-market adjustments on equity investments as well as discrete tax items. We re-evaluated the presentation of non-GAAP net income and made these changes to enhance the comparability of current operating performance to past operating performance. Non-GAAP net income for prior periods has been recast to reflect this change.
Given the Class V transaction, our Q4 and fiscal year '19 non-GAAP EPS numbers are not meaningful. We have included an adjusted non-GAAP EPS, which reflects non-GAAP EPS as if the Class V transaction had happened at the beginning of the year. The view is most comparable to equity analyst models for Q4. See Slide 37 in the web deck for more detail.
We will provide annual non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year '20 later on this call. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on Slide 33 in the web deck. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change, unless otherwise specified.
Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Now I'll turn it over to Tom.",429

We are in the midst of a technology-led investment cycle driven by digital transformation and vast amounts of data created daily. Our focus is enabling customers to digitally transform and drive their businesses forward.
We have a unique portfolio in terms of breadth and capability, and our customers increasingly see us as a key partner to meet their needs from the edge to the core to the cloud, which is showing up in our results. An example of this is VxRail, combining Dell EMC compute and storage with VMware software, in an industry-leading HCI solution with an approximate $2 billion annual run rate as of Q4. Recently, we also created a unique endpoint security solution for commercial PCs through a partnership between Dell and SecureWorks. We intend to continue driving broader collaboration across our family of businesses to create new solutions to meet our customers' growing needs.
I am pleased with our strong fiscal 2019 top line velocity and financial performance. Our FY '19 revenue was $91.3 billion, up $11 billion or 14%. We drove strong top line velocity with all 3 of our business units, delivering double-digit revenue growth for the full year. Jeff will talk about our fiscal year business unit results in greater detail.
We delivered operating cash flow of $7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 billion or 11.3% of revenue while investing back in the business, including sales coverage to support storage and buyer base expansion.
Since the close of the EMC transaction, we have now paid down $14.6 billion of gross debt, which excludes DFS-related and subsidiary debt. While we did add $5 billion in debt to close the Class V transaction, I want to emphasize that we are still focused on delevering and getting back to investment-grade ratings.
Shifting to Q4 results. Revenue was $24 billion, up 8%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in servers, VMware and strong performance in commercial clients. Our Q4 deferred revenue was up $1.9 billion sequentially to $24 billion, reflecting higher hardware and software maintenance from growth in the business, particularly storage as we drive our solutions deeper into the data center. Gross margin was up 13% to $8 billion or 33.5% of revenue, 140 basis point increase due to higher gross margins in ISG and CSG resulting from pricing discipline and lower commodity costs. We always saw higher ISG and VMware mix contribution.
Operating expenses were up 13% to $5.4 billion or 22.4% of revenue. As mentioned on prior calls, we have been investing in sales capacity and in other areas supporting the customer experience to position ourselves for future growth. Additionally, variable compensation expense increased given the overall performance of the business. Operating income was up 12% to $2.7 billion or 11.1% of revenue.
Shifting to our BU results for the quarter. ISG revenue was $9.9 billion, up 10%. Within ISG, servers and networking revenue was $5.3 billion, up 14%. Storage revenue was $4.6 billion, up 7%. We are pleased with our server velocity. We continue to see significant increases in average selling prices driven by our 14th generation mix and higher-value workloads requiring more memory and storage content. Storage revenue grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. We have more work to do but believe we have taken the right actions to drive meaningful, long-term improvements in our storage business. ISG operating income was $1.3 billion or 12.8% of revenue. Operating income was up 110 basis points due to better profitability in storage, servers and networking.
CSG revenue was $10.9 billion, up 4%. Within CSG, commercial revenue was $7.8 billion, up 9%, driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks and workstations. Consumer revenue was $3.1 billion, down 6% as we shifted our focus toward high-end notebooks and gaming given supply chain dynamics. CSG operating income was $555 million or 5.1% of revenue. We saw better profitability in CSG this quarter due to our mix, pricing and component cost.
Our VMware business unit revenue was $2.6 billion, up 17%. Operating income was $872 million or 33.1% of revenue. Based on VMware's standalone results reported earlier today, VMware saw broad-based strength across their diverse product portfolio in all 3 geographies. License bookings for the NSX portfolio grew over 50%. And license bookings for vSAN, which includes vSAN within VxRail, were up over 60% in Q4. Our other business revenue, which includes Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA, Virtustream and Boomi, was $593 million, up 5%.
Now let me turn it over to Tyler to update you on cash and our capital structure.",753
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3259.0,1678085.0,66092593.0,Presenter Speech,Tyler Johnson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tom. In the fourth quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $2.4 billion. As a reminder, Q4 is seasonally high cash flow generation quarter, while Q1 is typically lower due to factors such as revenue seasonality and timing of corporate bonus payouts.
During Q4, inclusive of transaction-related fees, we used approximately $500 million to help fund the Class V conversion to the new publicly traded Class C, which impacted both cash performance and ending cash balances. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $7 billion, and we ended the year with a cash and investments balance of approximately $10.7 billion. Our fiscal year '19 free cash flow, when adjusted for growth and financing receivables, is $3.4 billion excluding VMware. We expect that to grow over the coming years as we continue to improve our overall results.
As a reminder, we initially fund DFS financing receivables with cash on hand, so the growth in DFS impacts our cash flow from operations. This impact is offset, and cash flows from financing only subsequently fund DFS receivables through a third party. This metric is an indicator of our cash flow performance, and along with the balance sheet cash, our ability to service debt. Please see Slide 30 in our web deck for the detailed calculation.
Although fiscal year '19 cash flow performance was good, it was lower compared to the prior year, largely due to changes in working capital as well as the transaction fees previously mentioned. As discussed in our Q3 earnings call, supply chain dynamics led to a temporary increase in our inventory. Over FY '20, we expect to see inventory and the associated working capital impact normalize.
Dell Financial Services continue to have record-breaking growth in fiscal year '19 and has now almost doubled its asset base over the last 5 years. Fiscal year '19 originations were $7.3 billion, up 17%, and we finished the year with managed assets of $9.7 billion, growing 18%.
Our core debt balance ended the year at $39.3 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments excluding unrestricted subsidiaries, ended the year at $32.4 billion. Please see Slide 21 in our web deck for the detailed capitalization table.
We will continue to run the same financial model built around free cash flow generation, which has enabled significant debt paydown to date. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We are committed to reducing leverage and achieving investment-grade ratings. For fiscal year '20, we remain on track to repay approximately $4.8 billion of debt using a combination of free cash flow generation, balance sheet cash and temporary revolver draw to bridge timing of cash flows.
In addition, we have already begun the process of reducing our future maturity [ terms ] with an initial focus on 2021. We recently launched the refinancing of our existing $4.1 billion term loan A-2 into a new 5-year term loan [ A-6 ]. With improved credit market conditions, we intend to smooth out our maturity profile over the coming year while optimizing our capital structure.
With that, let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss the operational highlights for our business results.",530
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3259.0,1678085.0,66092594.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Tyler, and good evening, everyone. As I reflect on FY '19, we have made great progress in a number of areas. We delivered profitable share gains across the entire portfolio. We have stabilized ISG and have strengthened the collaboration amongst our family of businesses, including VMware, Pivotal, Boomi and SecureWorks. We've expanded our enterprise and commercial buyer base by more than 100,000 with the investments we have made in our go-to-market engine. As a result, we saw strong FY '19 growth across all 3 business units with ISG, CSG and VMware growing 19%, 10% and 14%, respectively.
Starting with ISG. We are pleased with our performance which included double-digit revenue growth in all 4 quarters. Storage P&L revenue was up 9% for the fiscal year. We grew our storage business all 4 quarters. Server and networking P&L revenue was up 28% for the fiscal year, and we have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. ISG operating income grew 35% to $4.2 billion or 11.2% of revenue, primarily due to operating leverage on profitability improvements in both storage as well as server and networking.
We have had strong ISG share performance throughout the year. In storage, we have now gained share for 3 straight quarters and over 300 basis points, more than anyone else in the marketplace through the first 3 quarters of 2018 according to IDC. During Q1 to Q3 time frame, industry revenue grew $2.5 billion, and we have captured $1.3 billion of that growth. We expect to grow share again in calendar Q4 and for the full year when IDC release its storage share results in March.
We continue to see strong demand for our industry-leading hyperconverged solutions and other software-defined offers. Our VxRail offering grew triple digits again this quarter, and we have increased our industry-leading HCI share 320 basis points year-to-date through calendar year -- or through calendar Q3 of 2018. We've increased our main share -- server revenue share by 140 basis points in 2018 through Q3 and extended our share leadership over our nearest competitor by over 4 points according to IDC. We expect to gain share again in Q4 when IDC releases their results in March.
We remain encouraged by the market opportunity as we think about the evolving impact of multi-cloud and IT spending. We expect the public cloud to continue growing, and our momentum is a clear indicator that a healthy combination of on-prem and off-prem investment is critical in our customer's IT strategy. Organizations are adopting a multi-cloud approach. According to IDC, 93% of organizations today use multi-clouds with an average of 5 or more different cloud architectures.
Customers increasingly need consistency in physical and virtual infrastructure and in their cloud operations. By running workloads in the cloud, in the core and now at the edge, there is significant complexity with disparate tools, data management and SLAs. This provides a big opportunity for us across VMware, Pivotal, Boomi and Dell EMC to deliver solutions for our customers' multi-cloud needs.
Shifting to CSG. Revenue grew 10%. We had a strong year with double-digit revenue growth in our commercial notebooks and workstations, our high-end consumer notebooks and displays as we continue to innovate with differentiated products and solutions such as the XPS 13, the all-new Latitude 7400 2-in-1 and our Alienware portfolio.
At CES last month, we won 144 awards, our most ever and more than any other competitor, indicative of our leadership in PC design and innovation. Operating income for CSG was 4.5% for the year as we managed through external headwinds including foreign exchange fluctuations and supply chain challenges.
We were pleased to see CSG operating margin improve back towards our long-term target in Q4. From an industry perspective, PC units declined 0.4% for the year according to IDC. Dell significantly outperformed the industry, growing 5.6%.
We delivered above-industry growth in the desktop, notebook and workstation form factors and above-industry growth in both commercial and consumer segments. We have now increased our PC share for 24 consecutive quarters and have gained 1 point of unit share worldwide for the year, the best performance of the top 6 competitors as the industry continues to consolidate. We remain the worldwide leader in workstations and displays. According to IDC, Dell outgrew the industry in workstation units with 12% in 2018. Dell grew flat panel monitors 11.9% and increased share by 190 basis points in 2018 according to IDC. We reached the 20% share for the first time and have been the industry leader in flat panel monitors now for 23 consecutive quarters.
I will now shift gears and talk about the increasing collaboration and innovation within our family of businesses as our integration matures. We continue to increase integration and cross-sells between sales teams, most notably between Dell EMC and VMware. You have heard Pat Gelsinger talk about the revenue synergies they are realizing as part of Dell Technologies -- or part of the Dell Technologies family, and there's a lot more to come.
We collaborate with VMware on customer solutions and have aligned our development teams around 6 key areas of innovation to bring higher-value software to customers around compute, software-defined storage, software-defined networking, hyperconverged, the cloud and Workspace ONE. Together with VMware, we will talk about our broad collaboration and our cloud platform in greater detail at Dell Technologies World in late April.
While we have more work to do, we are very well positioned as we head into FY '20. We will continue to focus on storage and data protection growth, server margins via our business transformation initiatives, improving operating leverage from our investments in sales coverage and increasing sales and solutions development and collaboration across the Dell Technologies family.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.",962
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3259.0,1678085.0,66092595.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Jeff. We are confident in our businesses. Customer receptivity to the Dell Technologies set of solutions remained strong. We believe the global macroeconomic environment heading into fiscal year '20 remains positive, but we will need to navigate potential headwinds such as tariffs, IT spending in China and other macro dynamics. We are expecting commodity cost to continue to be deflationary in aggregate through the first half of fiscal year '20.
IDC expects IT spending to grow more than twice GDP over the next few years, and our market opportunity is promising. We will continue executing on our strategic focus areas, which include: growing above the market and driving share gains; generating strong cash flow and delevering the balance sheet; executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins; and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities.
Moving to FY '20. We expect non-GAAP revenue between $93 billion and $96 billion. As a reminder, our guidance factors in an estimated $1 billion reduction due to the new lease accounting standard. We expect non-GAAP operating income between $9 billion and $9.6 billion, factoring in an estimated $250 million reduction due to the new leasing standard and continuing investments in sales and R&D. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points.
We expect diluted non-GAAP EPS attributable to Dell Technologies' common stock to be between $6.05 and $6.70. This range factors in the following: the adjustment to net income from minority ownership interest in VMware, Pivotal and SecureWorks; lower interest income and increased interest expense associated with the Class V transaction; and diluted share count between 750 million and 755 million shares. We have provided more detail on our guidance, including the noncontrolling interest adjustments, on Slide 17 of the web deck.
I'm optimistic as we head into fiscal year '20. There is more work to do, but we have many things going right from an execution perspective: client and server velocity, VMware performance and revenue synergies. We have made progress in storage this year and deepened the solution development and cross-sell collaboration across our family of businesses. We are well positioned with one of the strongest portfolios in the industry, and we believe there's no better partner than Dell Technologies to help our customers realize their digital future. We continue to run our business in a disciplined way, focused on long-term relative growth, share gain and cash flow.
With that, I'll turn it back to Karen to begin Q&A.",429

Let me start. And then, Jeff, you could jump in. Look, I think if you looked and sort of look at our businesses, we were generally pleased with the progress we made in CSG in terms of operating profit expansion. That was a combination of mix if you think about commercial versus -- consumer versus commercial mix, I should say. Also, you should think about the fact that commodity cost did go in our favor this quarter. And so that was clearly helpful. And then within the ISG business, clearly Q4 is a strong storage quarter in general for us. It traditionally has been. It was again this quarter. And obviously, we saw server growth continue to be, I think, in an appropriate range for us. So look, if you step back and think about the components of the P&L, yes, I think we're generally pleased with the expansion in margin Q-on-Q at an aggregate level from 30.9% in Q3 to 33.5% in Q4. And it's a combination of all of those factors that I just mentioned. Plus I think the pricing environment was relatively benign. Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything on the component cost framework itself or any other...",206

Katy, we're in a deflationary environment. You know our model was low inventory gets exposure to the lower-cost components at a reasonably quick rate. That's certainly a benefactor for us. Pricing is relatively benign, as Tom mentioned. And I'll just also focus on Q4 storage growing 7% and our ISG operating income up on a year-over-year basis in Q4 by a little over 20%. That's where the leverage of the P&L came from. That's why it's key for us to continue to grow our storage business.",93

I know you're only providing guidance for the full year. But this is really your first go-forward quarter as a public company. I think historically, you're probably down about 6% to 7% sequentially on the top line. And I'm wondering if that's sort of the right normalized base and whether you can talk about puts and takes on a sequential basis, particularly things like currency, whether you see any change in the demand environment, particularly China, and whether you see any potential change in competition and pricing over the next 90 days.",108
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3259.0,1678085.0,66092603.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,13,"Tony, it's Tom. Let me try and sort of frame how we're thinking about it as we step through to it. And clearly, all of you, I think, are familiar with our seasonal pattern, right? And Q1 is traditionally, if you will, our softest quarter of the year. If you look at sequentials, Q4 to Q1, the historical pattern at an aggregate level, roughly a minus 8% revenue and op income that's sort of minus 35% to minus 40% sort of range. But I think you need to deconstruct that and think about the fact that from a storage perspective, storage is traditionally -- Q1 is traditionally the weakest storage quarter where sequentially, I think revenue is down something like 20% and operating income on the storage side of the business and think about the legacy EMC business as a good example, a good guide on that, being down roughly 50. So look, I mean, sequentially Q1 is our softest quarter. And I expect it to be again this year as we think about the dynamics of the various parts of the P&L. VMware traditionally is roughly down historically like 12% on revenue sequentially and roughly 25% from an op inc perspective. I think the other dynamic I want you guys to think about, and look, we're not going to give specific guidance, but I do think it's important for you to think about it, is we talked a lot about the investments in -- that relates to the P&L to improve some long-term positioning, particularly around about sales capacity, sales coverage models and ensuring that we get to the right North Star ratio. And we've talked on past calls about the fact that we've got continual investments coming in through the -- roughly through the first half of the coming year. So I do want you to think about OpEx frameworks as you go from Q4 to Q1. If you looked a year ago, what you would have seen is OpEx roughly increasing roughly 3% sequentially. While I don't expect that to happen, I do expect OpEx to be slightly down from the Q4 level. So I think you've got to factor that in. And then as we go through the year, what we should see is productivity improvement as we step through the year as the sales investments begin to turn. So that's how I think about just rough framework. From an FX perspective, Tony, I think in Q4, we roughly had about a 200 basis point headwind. I'd expect something similar in Q1 and then I think it moderates after that. You guys know that we traditionally think about FX dynamics on a quarter-on-quarter basis because of the pricing dynamics that you have to work your way through, and on a quarter-on-quarter basis, it's been relatively stable. So I think the present environment around FX should be relatively stable. And then look, I think as we position for the coming year, we feel good about the annual framework guidance that we provided you to give you something to think about. And you are right, we want to make sure you think your way through the year given that we're -- this is the first time that you guys are thinking about the quarterly break in a more detailed level. So we're trying to give you some things to think about.",563

And Jeff, it's Tom, obviously. So look, I think as we think about next year, I think let me ground you on what IDC is calling in terms of a market framework, which is server -- mainstream server, which is the segment of the server market that we're most focused on given that's where the profitability is, it's roughly -- IDC right now is forecasting on a calendar basis roughly about 3.4% of server revenue growth for the year. And they have -- essentially, storage minus 1, call it, flat. Dell was particularly stronger in calendar '18 from a market perspective. Having said that, so I think if you look at the macro dynamics that we see across the globe, look, I mean, I'm not expecting fiscal '20 to be as strong as fiscal '19 from a revenue growth nor have we guided you that way. But I do think it's positive. I mean, CP is still growing the marketing, IT spending, according to IDC, it's still roughly 2x GDP. You think about some of our major markets around the globe with the U.S., that is roughly 2.5% GDP, call it, for the coming year. And China, which is down from 6.6 to 6.2. So I think the macro environment is still healthy for us. Right now, we're going to have to go execute through some -- and navigate probably through some choppy waters at times, but that's the job we have to do. So I think we feel good overall. And then, Jeff, maybe you could chat about just the overall specifics of the investments we've made with storage and servers and how we're thinking about some of the qualitative opportunities.",296

Happy to. I mean, clearly you talked about the market indices and the forecast. In absolute terms, mainstream storage market has $2 billion of incremental revenue. We have taken share and we're going to continue to consolidate share. We think when you look at this big $85-ish billion opportunity, 2/3 of it being in mainstream servers, our share position a little less than 30, there's a fair amount of room for us to consolidate, particularly when you look at high-value workflows or blade or modular where we have generally a much lower market share in those ASP-rich areas. So we think there's room to grow there. I think that continue to be -- at least in my mind, continue to be bolstered by the fact that we still see on-prem, private cloud early build-out. We talked, I think, on the previous call or throughout our series of roadshows, repatriation of workloads coming back to on-prem. We continue to see that. There's been some recent research by IDC that suggests there'll be $120 billion spent on hardware for on-prem private cloud over the next 4 years and another $100 billion of software and services on top of that. We think that bodes well for the environment on a go-forward basis as it's clear we're in a multi-hybrid cloud world. On the storage side, first, I'm really pleased that we have 4 quarters of growth in this business, 3 quarters in a row of share gain, 300 basis points year-to-date, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I expect a fourth quarter in a row. And again, I've talked about a turnaround. We have plenty of work to do, but clearly, we stabilized the business. The investments that we've made in sales capacity and coverage are yielding net new buyers, which is good to see. We continue to tune the sales compensation focused on storage, which is very important to us. The portfolio as we enter FY '20 is in much better shape than it was a year ago. It's highly competitive where we literally have a leadership position in the high end. And while you've heard me talk about the need to simplify and consolidate the midrange, the products we have in the midrange today are more competitive than they were a year ago. And clearly, unstructured space in a high-growth area, and we continue to see good performance out of our unstructured storage area. For me, it's a [indiscernible] way for me to say. We expect and have built a plan to take share in both the mainstream server and the storage marketplaces that we serve today. Does that help?",441

And I know you had commented, Tyler, thanks for that, on your plans to push debt maturities out. But I just wonder how you're feeling about that environment as you look at it right now? Do you feel like there's an opportunity to reduce debt interest cost as you refinance? And then the second thing I wanted to do is just clarify the storage share commentary. I know that in storage, you're partly benefiting from people replacing footprint as your product portfolio has gotten a little bit better and that mathematically caused the share to look better. And then, of course, I'm sure you're taking some share from your competitors as well. But I wonder if you could give us some kind of idea as to whether how much of your share gains are due to just accelerated replacement activity at your existing accounts and how many are due to share that you're taking from competitors.",171

This is Tyler. Yes, look, I think the good news is that interest rates are somewhat stable, right? I mean, we've seen the 10-year come down. I think it had traded as high as like 3.2 or so. It's down back below 3. So look, I think in the end, it obviously depends on what -- the maturity profile that we pick. But I think we'll be in good shape to push some of these maturities out and probably without having a material impact on our interest expense or the weighted average interest rate.",99

But look, I think from our perspective, in terms of any caution or slowdown from the customer set, I would tell you to date, we really haven't seen anything in terms of customers beginning to delay significant activity or to push out investments that they were planning on making. I think what we're -- which I think is in part because of the -- if you think about the IT spend and the IT capability being sort of central to a business model these days that many customers are viewing it as essential. I also think that -- so that's one thing. So the answer is no. Also, remember our direct model, right, in that typically when we see cycles turn, particularly on a downturn, you see it first in the medium and small business. And with our direct model and our interactions with the small businesses and the medium businesses, we haven't really seen that. So to date, well really, no evidence of customer behavior changing at this point in time. So look, we're optimistic about fiscal year '20. I think we're realistic that we'll have to navigate and run the business and execute well. But I think the environment is generally still positive for us. Jeff, I don't know if you'd say anything about the infrastructure side as you think about the back half of the year.",263

What I would add to it is the discussions we're having with customers about digital transformation continue. Digital transformation is real. It's on the agenda of most of the companies from large to medium and down even to small business. And that digital transformation is driving a need to modernize and to drive towards this multi-cloud, hybrid world that I mentioned earlier. So the environment continues to be somewhat optimistic there as the digital transformation continues to be in front of us. And we're in the early innings of it.",100

One is I don't parse margin and OpEx in terms of the guidance we gave you. I do think that we expect operating profit to expand as we -- in FY '20, which is consistent with how we want to run the business.

I would call -- I think Q1 is probably the toughest compare as we think about the year-over-years. That's where we saw the acceleration last year, in particular in some of the storage business.

Can you help us understand, are these offset in sales coverage something that you're going to have ramping up even more as the year progresses? Are we at a run rate now that you're happy? And what do you mean by sales coverage? Because my understanding is Dell does a lot of direct, but you've also been using the using the channel a little bit more in your Client Solutions Group.",118

This is Jeff, and I'm sure Tom will add in as well. But if you think about our previous references to broad sales capacity and coverage, we've talked about in the broad sense across the entire business focusing a lot specifically on the storage side but also just general sales makers to reach more customers direct and to expand our channel reach as well. So the reference is really around we've invested on a year-over-year basis.

So some of that is flowing through these business unit P&Ls as well. So that's the other thing to think about. But I think Jeff hit it well, which is the context of grow capacity. We go both direct and through the channels. Roughly 50% of our business is direct, making sure that we have the right coverage model to expand customers. The net new customers as well as cross-sell into other existing LOBs is key to our long-term success and long-term framework. So that's how we think about the coverage models.",135

Look, it's Tom. Paul, I would think about it like this, which is look, I mean, obviously we -- as you said, as you work your way through the P&L and get below operating income, there are a number of variables that are hitting. And you start with the fact that remember that we did the Class V transaction in Q4, which -- 2 elements to that obviously, right? There was an $11 billion cash dividend up from -- out from VMware. So interest income is going to be lower for the year next year. And we -- as you know, as part of the Class V transaction, we put $5 billion of debt on the balance sheet, and so there's an interest carry on that. And then you get into the tax rate, which I've tried to give you some frameworks to think about. I'm not sure what you're using in your model for tax rate. And then the noncontrolling interest, which can be a bit of a complicated calculation. So we tried to lay that out for everybody in terms of baseline set of assumptions on Slide 17 in the web deck. And so I'd ask you to take a look at that and see how that aligns to how you're thinking. And if you -- we're happy to talk, and so give the IR team a call if you'd like to have a more detailed conversation on that. But that's essentially the walk as we think about it.",252

I know in February, you typically make changes to your sales comp plan. I think this year, you were focusing on margin in VMware.

This is Jeff, and I'll take a stab. And then Tom will -- I'm certain, will pile on as well. As I think I mentioned a little bit earlier, we're taking another tweak, if you will, of the sales compensation plan. I think we've communicated in the past there's basically 3 buckets, if you will. There's the CSG side. And then within the ISG side, there is storage and the non-storage component. And then obviously, there's VMware in the VMware side. Within my business, we continue to bias the compensation plan on the ISG side towards storage. We continue to make tweaks towards that. We're very pleased with the progress we made this past year, and we'll continue to try to optimize that. So it's the continuation of what we've been talking about for the better part of the last 1.5 years. We're pretty excited about what that means on a go-forward basis. And I'm not sure I can add much more to that.",166

Look, the only thing I would add is look, what we've tried not to do with the sales comp plan this year is make broad changes because all that does is tend to cause the sales organization to spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out the new comp plan. So what Jeff said, I think, is a nice sort of elaboration of what we're doing, which is small adjustments to make sure that we get the right focus, the right attention. And we're focused on those valuable solution selling and LOBs that make sense to us and that we want to push. And you've got to think about that both with our direct selling organization as well as with our channel, right? And so we're making refinements to our channel program to incent them to ensure that they're driving the higher-value offerings like storage and attaching services where appropriate. So again, it's a continued refinement, Shannon, as we continue to tune the model. And I think we continue to make progress.",181

You said solution, and clearly, this plan that we built this year drives towards building on the collaboration that we've built with VMware. So if you think about Workspace ONE and Dell, we certainly put incentives in our sales force to work on that solution across the different SABs. If I think about VxRail, vSAN, software-defined data center, VCF, we have clearly put, if you will, some sales compensation incentive behind that. I mentioned cloud in my comments as well. As we think about cloud, and I think I introduced this concept last time around Pivotal, Boomi, VMware and this operational control plane on top of our leading Dell EMC infrastructure products. You can imagine that we packaged some sales compensation of selling that level of integration across our Dell technology properties as well. We'll talk more about that at the Dell Technology World. And I guess it's about 8, 9 weeks away. But Tom prompted that, and I wanted to make sure I communicated that solution selling across the SABs and aligning higher levels of integration and collaboration is clearly where we put more focus this year than last year.",197

I mean, look, I think -- I'm focused on the business driving profitable growth and growing the top line, which is what's going to throw off the most consistent cash, right? So nothing really to talk about in terms of something unique like a divestiture or something like that. The reality is we ended the year with strong cash balances, very well positioned to pay down the approximate $4.8 billion, which I talked about. And if you flash-forward to the end of the year, what you're going to see is that we'll have lower debt balances, and our maturity profile is going to look smoother.

Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to cover 3 topics before Tom goes through the financial results: first, our view on the IT spending environment; second, new solutions we have introduced; and third, the current demand backdrop. We are in the midst of a technology-led investment cycle that is accelerating digital transformation. The latest IDC forecast for IT spending through 2022, excluding telecom, supports this view with projected growth to be more than 2x world GDP. That investment is fueled by exponential increase in data and data-centric workloads that are driving better business outcomes alongside an increasingly diverse and mobile workforce. Our investments in solutions and innovations are pointed directly at this opportunity.
We have a differentiated portfolio that is delivering solutions from the edge to the core to the cloud, and our customers are taking advantage of the value that Dell technology provides. This was all clear earlier this month when we hosted 15,000 customers, partners and industry experts at Dell Technologies World. At this event, we unveiled the Dell Technologies Cloud, a new set of cloud infrastructure solution to make hybrid cloud environment simpler to deploy and manage as customers continue to move towards hybrid cloud environments.
We announced a new Data Center-as-a-Service offering. This fully manned solution brings the simplicity of public cloud service consumption to an on-premise environment. This service can be combined with Dell Technologies' cloud platforms or public cloud on Dell Technologies solutions like VMC on AWS to create a singular and seamless management experience across the edge, core and cloud environments.
In addition, Michael, Satya Nadella and Pat Gelsinger announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to enable our customers to extend our on-premise VMware cloud environments to Azure. And earlier in the quarter, we announced the industry's first jointly engineered hybrid cloud infrastructure stack that brings together VxRail and VMware Cloud Foundation to facilitate compute storage and network virtualization delivering the fastest ramp to the Dell Technologies Cloud. All of these solutions represent breakthroughs in cloud innovation that enables a flexible range of IT and management options with tight integration and a single vendor experience for purchasing, deployment, services and financing. They provide customers an operational hub for their hybrid cloud on-premise with consistent cloud infrastructure across all cloud types.
To advance customers' workforce transformation, we announced Dell Technologies Unified Workspace that helps our customers fundamentally change the way they deploy, secure, manage and support their devices. Unified Workspace provides a full PC life cycle experience and provisioning strategy all powered by the cloud. By integrating VMware's Workspace ONE, which enables customers to access any application on any device anytime, SecureWorks threat intelligence and detection to prevent and detect and respond to potential security issues and Dell provisioning and deployment services on our award-winning commercial PCs. These examples best demonstrate how Dell Technologies is innovating and collaborating across the physical and virtual infrastructure, cloud, PCs, security and services to deliver highly integrated solutions for our customers. And we are just getting started as we build on our leading positions in software-defined data center, enterprise hardware, security and PCs. 
Shifting gears to the current demand environment. Our external storage business is healthy, delivering solid year-over-year orders growth. Our sales teams remain optimistic about our portfolio and positioning as we head into Q2 and beyond. In addition, software-defined data center solutions and HCI continue to grow at a healthy clip, with VxRail growing triple digits again in Q1. 
Turning to servers. The industry saw unprecedented growth last year. We planned for slower growth this year but [indiscernible] demand environment was softer than we and the industry expected. We were consciously more selective on larger server deals during the quarter, particularly in China, and we focused on acquiring new customers and balancing top line and bottom line results across the entire server business. The result, a decline in revenue but with higher profitability.
We have built a business to be successful in any environment. Whether the market expands or contracts, we expect to outperform the industry. And when IDC releases calendar Q1 share data later in Q2, we anticipate gaining share again in servers. You should expect us to continue to balance growth and profitability. We did that in Q1 and you should expect us to focus on balance in Q2.
Switching to our client business. We are seeing continued strength in commercial PCs, driven in part by increased coverage in small and medium business and the Windows 10 refresh. In a growing market, we gained 220 basis points of share according to IDC in calendar Q1. We gained worldwide PC share for the 25th consecutive quarter according to IDC, with share up 80 basis points. Longer term, we remain optimistic about IT spending as organizations continue to invest in software-defined data center as well as IT infrastructure to support their edge and cloud strategies. And no one is better positioned than Dell Technologies to help our customers with these needs. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tom to talk about the Q1 results.",843
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 30, 2019",2019-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3379.0,1755939.0,68751135.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth, with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than the industry and our competitors, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. We executed against these strategic focus areas in Q1 as we balanced revenue and profitability with market conditions.
Revenue was $22 billion, up 2%, and our deferred revenue balance increased to $24.2 billion, up 15%. FX was a headwind this quarter, impacting year-over-year growth rates by approximately 280 basis points. Gross margin was up 7% to $7.4 billion, and was 33.8% of revenue, up 170 basis points, driven by lower component cost and balanced pricing in both servers and PCs.
Operating expenses were $5.2 billion, up 7% primarily due to investments we have made in our sales coverage and were 23.8% of revenue. Operating expenses were down sequentially, consistent with comments on our year-end call. As a reminder, we discussed our expectation that our investments in sales capacity and coverage would add operating expense and that we expect to begin to see the benefit of these investments ramp as we move into the second half of the year. Operating income was up 8% to $2.2 billion or 10% of revenue. Our EPS of $1.45 benefited from strong operating results but also from a lower tax rate in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 11.7% of revenue and $10.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Although Q1 tends to be our lowest cash flow quarter due to revenue seasonality and timing of annual bonus payouts, we generated cash flow from operations of $682 million. Adjusted free cash flow was $116 million. We repaid approximately $400 million of gross debt in the quarter, and we have now paid down $15 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger. We remain on track to repay approximately $4.8 billion of gross debt this year.
Shifting to our business unit results, ISG revenue was $8.2 billion, down 5%. While storage order growth was solid, as Jeff mentioned, storage revenue was down 1% to $4 billion as we built backlog given the timing of when storage orders were received.
Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 9%. Recall that we grew 41% in Q1 of last year. We did plan for slower server growth coming into this year but we did see some slower server growth than we anticipated. This was more pronounced in a few areas, principally China and at certain large enterprise opportunities. We have discussed in the past that we are continuing to focus on expanding the server customer base, and we balanced revenue growth and profitability as we went through the quarter.
ISG operating income was $843 million or 10.3% of revenue. Operating margin percentage was down 50 basis points due to investments in sales coverage, which offset higher gross margins.
Our VMware business unit revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13%. Operating income was $614 million or 26.9% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results reported earlier today, the company generated license bookings growth in all product categories, with NSX up over 40% and vSAN up over 50% year-over-year.
CSG revenue was $10.9 billion, up 6%. Within CSG, commercial revenue was $8.3 billion, up 13%, driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $2.6 billion, down 10% as we prioritized commercial mix in the higher end of consumer PCs. We saw better profitability in CSG this quarter due to component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline. CSG operating income was $793 million or 7.3% of revenue. Going forward, we continue to balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics.
Dell Financial Services originations were $1.7 billion, up 2%.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, we ended the quarter with a cash and investments balance of approximately $9.8 billion. During Q1, we refinanced approximately $6 billion of debt, freeing up fiscal year '20 cash flow to repay longer-dated debt and reduce our larger maturity towers coming due in 2021 and 2023.
Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $38.6 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments excluding unrestricted subsidiaries, ended Q1 at $33.2 billion. Please see Slide 13 in our Web deck for more detail.
We remain committed to maximizing free cash flow, reducing leverage and achieving investment-grade ratings. As we head into Q2, we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment, the IT spending environment and ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China. With the help of our supply chain team, we have navigated the first 3 China tariff list and are well-positioned against the announced tariff increase from 10% to 25%. We have been planning for a potential fourth list, which could impact notebooks and monitors. There's not a firm target date in place but we will adjust our global supply chain as needed to minimize the impact to our customers.
We do expect component cost to continue to decline through at least the next 2 quarters, though at a lower rate than we saw in Q1. Our direct model and associated lower inventory position provides flexibility relative to our competitors. We will continue to be disciplined on pricing as we move through the year but we will also ensure that we adjust as appropriate, given market and competitive dynamics.
Moving to guidance. Based on Q1 results and our current expectations for the balance of the year, we are turning toward the midpoint of the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue ranges for the year, and above the midpoint of our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income ranges. We now expect our GAAP EPS outlook to be better than the high end of the range primarily due to discrete tax and other items. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be above the midpoint of the range for the full year after taking into consideration the EPS adjustment we announced in March for refinancing activity.
In closing, we are well-positioned with one of the strongest portfolios in the industry. We are focused on long-term value creation, and we believe that there is no better partner than Dell Technologies to help our customers realize their digital future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1057

And I appreciate the comment on derisking the business model more broadly from any upcoming tariffs on List 4. But could you give us some color on what specifically Dell is doing to actually circumvent that and be well-prepared in the event that those do transpire.",65
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 30, 2019",2019-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3379.0,1755939.0,68751139.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,7,"Well, as we go talk about the server market that we saw as well as sort of the tariff framework and what we're doing about it, I would remind everybody that as we went through Q1, we did see IDC drop their mainstream revenue forecast for the market for calendar '19, I think, from 3.4% to approximately 1%. We're also -- as we thought about the year this year, we also had expected a slower server market. If you think about the velocity in the business last year with, I think, server and network overall was up 28% last year in fiscal '19, and Q1 last year was up 41%. So we had planned for slower growth. I think what we saw was a softer than anticipated growth even off the lower planning assumption.
And so our philosophy in this environment, and remember what we continue to talk about is that we want to run the business for the long term. We want to grow relative to the market and take share but that share needs to -- that growth needs to be profitable and it needs to drive cash. And so that was the framework we were working our way through as we worked through the quarter.
As we think of what we saw from a server perspective, there were a couple of thoughts I'd provide for you. One was we did see softness in China. And if you guys recall our Q4 conversation, we had talked about the fact that we're going to be adjusting our China model given some of the dynamics we saw in China, and that sort of played out as anticipated. And then, secondly, we also saw some, particularly in the large enterprise space, a handful of deals that, quite frankly, as they -- as we were looking at them, the profitability profile just didn't make sense to us, so we didn't participate in that. And so we balanced as we made our way through the quarter, both from a revenue and profitability perspective, and I think we're pretty disciplined in how we did it. And so, look, I feel given where the market was and given what we saw, I think I feel pretty good about how we navigated the quarter there. And again, there is demand out there if you want to take it, but sometimes the profitability framework doesn't make sense. And so I think that was the balance that we drove there. I don't know, Jeff, if you'd add anything to that.",422

ASPs on a year-over-year basis on our server business were up. I look at our high-value workload, the portion of the high end of the business that we have, it continues to grow. I'd remind everybody, I think we said it in our comments, we took share. We believe when IDC reports its share data later in Q2 on the Q1 calendar, that we will have gained share again in the server business. And I think that backdrop that Tom painted where there was a slowing in demand is correct, and the soft spots that he mentioned around China and large enterprise are very much spot on. We still think there is a long-term outlook that is very positive for servers and we're going to focus on our relative share position adjusting to the market conditions. We're going to continue to grow our customer base, which we did in Q1, and we'll continue to drive the business and look after cash flow as we manage that business on a quarter-by-quarter basis.",183

And maybe if you can just the overall sort of how you did with server about what you're seeing in terms of client in general.",45

I think as we thought of -- as we look at the client business for the quarter, I think I have a couple of thoughts I'd provide to you. We have said in Q4, as we did our Q4 call a few months ago, that the client operating -- or pricing environment was relatively benign, and I would tell you that, that continued on into Q1, principally given some of the industry chip dynamics that we continue to navigate through.
Clearly, as we ran the business this quarter, we mix towards the commercial business that generally pulls a higher profitability profile, if you will. And we obviously had some benefit of the component cost deflation that we saw during the quarter. And so as we think about the business, I think there are a couple of things that we're still working our way through, the navigation of as we walk into the coming quarters is how do we think about the slowing component cost framework relative to what we saw in Q1 and then our pricing actions as a result of that.
And there is sort of some uncertainty around mix and the dynamics of the chips -- of the industry chip shortage that we're going to have to continue to work through. So we'll manage our operating margin appropriately. From a demand perspective, we were clearly pleased with what we saw in the quarter. We're still in -- I think we benefited from the -- clearly from the sales coverage expansion that we've done over the last year, 1.5 years. We also are obviously benefiting from the Win 10 refresh cycle that continues. And so I think we remain optimistic about the client business for the year and we'll manage it appropriately given some of the dynamics and uncertainties I think we'll see as we work our way through the year. I don't know, Jeff, if you would add anything to that.",326

The mix I think is important when we look at the mix of commercial and high-end consumer, we certainly benefited from that. And we saw our direct business grow at a premium to the marketplace, which as you know, carries the attach of S&P services and financing which are margin accretive to us. And we're in a world of favorable dynamics in Q1, no question. 
I do think, as we look at the remaining part of the year, and Tom touched upon this, we have what will become a more consumer second half because we have a consumer mix shift in the second half. We have the possibility of a List 4 in tariffs that we'll have to navigate as we go forward. And we certainly have, as Tom mentioned, the ongoing challenges of managing demand and supply based on part availability. So that's kind of how we look at the year, reinforcing what Tom said and a couple of other points to think about.",172

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 30, 2019",2019-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3379.0,1755939.0,68751147.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,15,"I just wanted to follow up on servers and I was wondering if you could kind of comment around linearity through the quarter. Did you actually feel like the demand environment got progressively worse over the course of the quarter? And part of the reason I asked that is you said that storage was very back-end loaded, which would suggest that demand didn't really get worse for storage. So maybe you can contrast why you think enterprise demand in servers was weakening and not in storage, and whether there were different linearity patterns that you saw in storage versus servers? And then what are you modeling going forward for servers. Do you actually think the demand environment comes back? Or do you think it continues to soften? How -- what is sort of baked into your expectations for Q2 and your reaffirmation of revenue guidance for the year?",148
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 30, 2019",2019-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3379.0,1755939.0,68751148.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,16,"Toni, it's Tom. So from a linearity perspective within the quarter, I would offer this as it relates to server. We saw -- early in the quarter, we saw softness in the server demand velocity, if you will. And that softness lasted maybe the first half of the quarter to something of that effect. We took some pricing actions along the way to ensure that we were in the right price position across the globe. And we did see demand on server begin to pick up as we move through the latter part of the quarter.
I do think that we'll have to continue to watch it in the sense of some of the weaknesses that we called out, I think China continues to be a headwind given the dynamics that we're seeing over there. I will tell you, outside of those couple of soft spots that we called out in general, we saw a reasonable server demand in some of the other areas of the globe. And we're not in the business of forecasting the market growth for servers, and I'd point back to we do think that the server, according to IDC, the server market has softened. And we're going to navigate our way through that. And part of the reaffirmation of the guidance or the mid-range -- midpoint of the guidance, if you will, on revenue is around -- if you look at the broad capabilities and solution sets that we have with the business, to the extent I have softness in certain areas, also have strength in other areas. And so we're balancing our portfolio, managing the business, I think, from the framework that I previously articulated as we move through the year.
And Toni had also a question about relative to storage. I do think that from a linearity standpoint, storage does tend to be more back-end loaded fairly consistently.",315

I mean, to emphasize what Tom said, look, we saw the business decelerate through, as Tom said, the first portion of the quarter and we saw a rebound. We took some pricing actions along the way. We saw the businesses that would respond to list price actions, respond appropriately. We think there's certainly inventory that's being digested in the ecosystem as a whole. Clearly, last year, there was a very high growth for servers, and I think we're seeing some of that being digested through the year. We're seeing some customers waited for Cascade Lake, and now we have Cascade Lake shipping, we're seeing a nice ramp to the new microprocessor technology, so I think that's encouraging. And then, again, you saw in our storage business and what Tom mentioned is they build up towards the end of the quarter, which is historically what we see in our largest accounts and we saw a nice steady state through our commercial business of our storage demand. And VxRail continues to do well as a hyperconverged software-defined storage offer in the marketplace.",183

I'll start. John, this is Jeff. And then I'm sure Tom will layer in as well. We tend to took at the storage market opportunity through the price band. And when I look at our price band performance across our portfolio, I'm quite pleased on an orders basis. I mentioned orders had healthy growth for the year. We grew in the high end. We grew in -- or the high price band, the mid-range price band and the entry-level price band across a variety of our products, whether that's the PowerMax product, our Isilon unstructured product, our Unity product, and we're pleased with that velocity, if you will, of our core storage of array business. I don't look at it as a midrange product or category because, again, it's price bands, we sell the PowerMax 2000 as an example in what some would call midrange price band. Unstructured products are sold in midrange price bands. So we tend to look at our performance across all of the portfolio. And as I said, the order basis was a healthy growth for us.",182

Kind of one of your toughest performances in some time. So can you talk about the drivers of that drag in the quarter? And then just looking for some additional color on some of the prior questions, you talked about servers in China and with large enterprises. Can you just talk about China more holistically, kind of the IT spending environment overall. And then, from the large enterprises, what are you hearing there from large enterprises, is it a sense of more caution related to the tariff and trade war? Any color would be helpful.",115

So yes, I mean, typically, Q1 is our weaker cash quarter. I would tell you that this was pretty much in line with expectations and that's partly why I felt comfortable paying down the $400 million, which quite frankly, was not something I really planned on doing when we started the quarter. 
If you look at the comparison relative to last year, for example, I mean, really, one of the bigger drivers is that we had a pretty large compensation payout this quarter, which was driven by the bonus. So as I look forward and I kind of look at where I am today and I think of my expectations for the rest of the year, I mean, Tom said it during the talking points that I feel good about us paying down the $4.8 billion, so we're on track. I'm happy. But if you think forward by the end of the year and you look at how our debt maturity towers are going to look, it's going to look much different than where we started before we did the refinancing. So feel good about kind of where we're going and so everything is on track.",212

It's our second largest market. I think we, in the past, said it's high single in terms of the revenue mix. In terms of the whole, it's high-single digits. We obviously have, we think, a good relationship and a good business there, but clearly, the U.S.-China trade tensions are a bit of an overhang on the business. We did see more competitiveness in the market, principally in the servers space there this quarter given say than a year ago where part of that is, I think, the component cost framework year-over-year. And what we saw were some of the opportunities there and the pricing around those just didn't make sense from a profit framework that we are driving or are trying to execute to. We also had talked about in the past relative to the China business on servers that we wanted to diversify that buyer base and we've been working on doing that.
So I think we balanced with the business with what we saw in the market and what we thought was made appropriate since. Absent servers though, I mean we're pleased with the commercial client growth there. We're pleased with the storage growth in China. And so again, this is one of the things where we'll have to continue to watch that business as we move forward through the year and adjust as appropriate given what we're seeing in the market and the broader macro dynamics.",272

I'd be happy to talk about the strategy, Steve. Look, we made a big series of announcements at Dell Technologies World a handful of weeks ago and we talked about the Dell Technologies Cloud. And we specifically talked about where you could build your own cloud platforms based on our HCI and CI stacks with VMware's Cloud Foundation. So for those organizations that want to deploy their own on-prem cloud, hybrid cloud and have the consistency of management and automation, we provide the tools with high levels of integration to do that with our VxRail and our VCF product -- or I should say VMware's VCF product, and I think that is very much a differentiated offer. You'll see us continue to build around that. We will add more capability and we talked about extensions of that platform into our primary storage arrays, and you'll continue to see us be able to enable our customers to build edge deployment and core data center deployments around that.
And the other offer that we announced was our Data Center-as-a-Service. So basically, the ability to have a public cloud experience on-prem, so your own private cloud delivered as a service and your own private data center on the edge of your network. Fully managed by us, offered as a subscription by us. It's built on VxRail and VMware cloud foundation. We install it. We manage it and just like any other cloud service that a customer is consuming today.
And then we also extended our cloud strategy with the announcement we made with Microsoft that, essentially, we allow customers who want to use public cloud and public cloud services, VMware software-defined data center running in the cloud including the AWS, which is already into the marketplace today, and then what we announced at Dell Technologies World, VMware services for Azure. We're pretty excited about that. We believe that gives customers a wide range of capabilities in this multi-cloud world. We see customers today deploying on average, 5 different cloud architectures today. They want consistency in management and automation and how to deploy and how to provision. What we announced and what our strategy is to allow VMs and applications and containers to move from the edge to the core data center to the public cloud, all orchestrated by us, specifically the VMware capability, and then building highly integrated infrastructure products in that to help our customers. That's the strategy that we spent the vast part of Monday and Tuesday at Dell Technologies World talking about. Does that help?",426

So one, I thank you for recognizing that we do have a broad portfolio, you're right, and we pivoted and managed the business appropriately given the dynamics we saw in the market, at least in our opinion we did. As it relates to margin, we do think that component cost, we do see deflation happening in the component cost environment over the next couple of quarters, as we highlighted in our talking points. We also think about the fact that the commercial client business will continue, in our opinion, to benefit from the Win 10 refresh cycle that's going on. And given the chip shortage, we'll have to navigate through that. So in terms of, gee, do we get a margin expansion out of that? I would point to back to, as I provided some guidance comments in part of my talking points that we do expect now to be trending towards the above the mid range on operating income and non-GAAP EPS. So I think that's how I would anchor you on that. We'll continue to manage it. The unknowns here, Katy, around the impact of trade and tariffs, if that were to come to fruition and how would that potentially have an impact on demand, I think we feel good about the work that the supply chain team has done in terms of mitigating -- or potentially mitigating the impacts of List 4, but that is a bit of an unknown. And then we'll have to see how the pricing environment behaves as we move through the year. And so again, we tried to give you some perspective, but I would again point you towards look at the operating income framework that we laid out for you as part of the call.",297

And yet it sounds like what you're saying in response to some of the prior questions on linearity is that you saw demand weakness earlier in the quarter and then you made pricing changes and then that seemed to cause demand to perk up late in the quarter, which it almost sounds like demand was weak prior to some of the trade news that went the wrong way. So I just wonder if you could comment on what you think was going on there early in the quarter when demand was weakening. Do you think macro is, I guess, a little bit impaired before this all came up or do you think people are anticipating a negative trade outcome?",153

Let me sort of -- let me frame this a little differently for you. We're talking about a couple of trends here that we saw in the year. I would tell you that our commercial client business was strong throughout the quarter. So that didn't -- that was relatively strong through the quarter and so the trade conversation, if you will, wasn't an influence on that from what we can tell.
The server conversation we had, which is what we said was soft in the first half of the quarter and picked up in the second half. I think you need to separate that a little bit from the trade and tariff conversation, right? What we saw there was a relatively soft February and first half of March in servers. We made a series of a list price moves to try and ensure that we were in the appropriate price position in early to mid-March, and we began to see better velocity in what I would call the transactional run rate server business as we worked our way through the quarter.
I do think we saw -- we did see, as we said, in China and in some large enterprise, some very competitive pricing or some pricing on some of these large deals that didn't make sense to us. Again, I think you've got to separate that from the trade and tariff conversations. So what we're trying to articulate and maybe not doing a great job on is to say the server market clearly was softer than what we expected it to be. And so we spent the quarter on servers sort of managing the balance of where do you push on revenue, where do you not push on revenue because the margin framework just didn't make sense. And at the end of the day, we opted towards a little less revenue and the profitability framework that we delivered.
So that's how the quarter is set up. And then storage velocity which is typically has a more back-ended linearity sort of followed that same linearity through the quarter. So the overhang here, the macro dynamic around trade and tariff is one we're watching just because you think about the impact on business confidence, consumer confidence, you think about the impact on our domestic China business. Those are the dynamics that we're also keeping our eye on. Our domestic China business, the server impact there, we were soft in servers in the China business. Some of that by design as we stepped away from these large deals that didn't make sense to us from a profitability perspective. However, on the other hand, we saw a reasonable demand growth and revenue growth in client and storage in China. So China was a little bit -- the domestic business in China was a little bit of a mixed bag.
So hopefully that helps you frame this a little bit better as we think about -- as we thought about the dynamics that we managed our way through during the quarter.",510

We started -- and I think we mentioned it in our Q4 call about China servers and the slowing of our China server business. So we saw that coming into the quarter. And again, it's very separated from the tariff conversation that we've been having in and out of the conversation today.

I think Tom mentioned earlier, in the other parts of our server business, we had growth, but it was isolated to our China business and those handful of large enterprise opportunities where Tom mentioned about the economics of those and the aggressive pricing in the marketplace for those opportunities was below our profit threshold.",125

If we think about List 4, we have strategies in place given our global supply chain and our flexible supply chain. We have over 25 manufacturing facilities around the globe that we believe will be able to mitigate a substantial majority of that impact.
So if we couple that with the guidance framework and ranges that we provided, we feel comfortable that we'll be able to navigate our way through these -- through the tariff conversation. Absent that one comment I made earlier, which is I do think if you were to see these tariffs enacted, we'll have to see what the overall effect is on consumer and business confidence relative to the demand environment. That's the one thing that's a little hard to model right now. But in terms of our cost base and what we should be able to do, I think we'll be able to mitigate the vast majority of the impact.",198

So besides the trade and tariff conversation we've been having, you've got a Brexit overhang, you've got political dynamics going on, but step back and think about the underlying IT technology investment trends, right, that there is an investment cycle happening. And if you believe the sort of the IDC framework, it's 2x GDP over the next number of years. And if you look at the IDC forecast, you would see that the IDC technology investment cycle is they look -- is they calendarized it by year. Actually, the technology spend IDC forecasted to dip slightly this year, which is essentially, I think, what we're seeing is a little bit of softening in the environment. I think that's undeniable.
What we're trying to convey is as we manage the business and the broad set of capabilities and solutions that we have, we're pulling various levers as we go through the quarter around managing for both growth where we think growth is there to get that makes sense that generates profitable growth, that generates cash versus do I push on growth and go buy revenue with no margin or negative margin, which you can do in this businesses in some of the areas. 
So what you're hearing us articulate is we grew on a non-GAAP basis revenue 2%. We built deferred revenue balances. We had a very strong client quarter, storage demand was good. Yes, there was softness in the server environment. That's just something we'll have to continue to navigate through, principally contained in China and in some of those large enterprise -- handful of large enterprise opportunities. And so I think our job as the leadership team and the management team is to execute our way through those dynamics, and that's what we'll continue to do as we move into Q2.
So look, we'll have to see how the year unfolds. You obviously heard that we still like the year -- the framework that we laid out at the beginning of the year. We pointed you toward the midpoint of revenue -- of that revenue range from a revenue framework perspective to think about, and we pointed you above the midpoint of the operating income and EPS. So obviously, we'll keep our eye on this and adjust as appropriate as we go through the year. But we remain optimistic about the opportunities that we have and our positioning in the market. So.",426

Since we launched Dell Technologies, we have been consistent about our long-term view on global technology investment and what we have to do to realize this unprecedented opportunity. We have to innovate and integrate across the full Dell Technologies portfolio.
Doing this creates the next generation of technology infrastructure that enables digital organizations operating in the data economy. We have to continue innovating within our business units to win the consolidation and generate cash. And of course, we have to do this with an eye towards the inevitable fluctuations in near-term demand. Today, I would like to touch on each of these areas and share some of the progress we have made executing against our strategic priorities.
To begin, let me emphasize the long-term drivers for our business remain intact. We are in the early stages of a technology-led investment cycle that is accelerating digital transformation. That investment cycle is fueled by the exponential increase in data and data-centric workloads that drive better business outcomes alongside an increasingly diverse and mobile workforce.
But to realize these outcomes, customers are grappling with increasing complexity across their operating environments and infrastructure, including data proliferation, multi-cloud management, security, new software architectures, application, artificial intelligence and machine learning, all the while defining their approach to cloud and increasingly, the edge and IoT.
Take hybrid cloud as an example. Companies deploying hybrid cloud strategies want seamless compatibility, consistent infrastructure and operations across private clouds, public clouds and the edge. We are optimistic about IT spending because customers need a partner to help them address these challenges, one who is innovating and delivering a comprehensive end-to-end IT strategy. In fact, the latest IDC forecast for IT spending through 2023, excluding telco, backs up our optimistic view. IDC projects growth will be more than 2x world GDP or about 4.3% per year on average. So as I said, we believe the long-term drivers of our business are intact.
This brings me to my second point. Dell Technologies is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this enormous opportunity. We have been hard at work innovating and integrating across the portfolio to deliver the future of technology infrastructure with solutions that dramatically simplify IT management. 
Last quarter, we made major progress with the announcement of Dell Technologies Cloud and Unified Workspace. Interest remains high in our Dell Technologies Cloud platform, the easiest and fastest way to a consistent hybrid cloud experience. It brings together Dell EMC's VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure with VMware's Cloud Foundation software stack, offering customers a single, consistent platform for both traditional and cloud native workloads with full automation and integration for hybrid and multi-cloud environments with consistent SLAs, tools, services and management from VMware and Dell EMC.
The customer pays subscription fees for as long as they use it the same way they pay for public cloud infrastructure. CapEx becomes OpEx. Earlier this week at VMworld, we announced several other enhancements to our Dell Technologies Cloud offerings, including new validated designs for storage arrays and servers, initial availability of the industry's first fully managed on-premise Data Center-as-a-Service offering and general availability of new ""pay for what you use"" flexible consumption models.
In addition, we announced Dell Technologies Cloud platforms now support VMware Pivotal Container Service. And with VMware's recent announcement of its intent to acquire Pivotal, our solutions and speed to market get even stronger. Pivotal further extends VMware's Kubernetes capabilities for building, running, managing modern applications on any cloud.
Another powerful example of how we're innovating across Dell Technologies is Unified Workspace. This solution integrates capabilities across Dell devices and services, VMware and SecureWorks and now includes Dell ProManage, managed services that integrate Dell's highly skilled experts as part of a customer's IT teams. Think about the IT investment cycle I mentioned earlier and the needs of the growing diverse and mobile workforce. 
Unified Workspace is an intelligent solution that tells you the specific devices and applications your workforce needs on their specific usage. Then it delivers those personalized devices directly to the end user, preconfigured and preloaded with all the applications and security features they need. IT never has to touch the device. With VMware's acquisition of Carbon Black, Unified Workspace will only improve with a comprehensive intrinsic security portfolio for the multi-cloud world and for modern applications and devices. 
As you can see, we are delivering on our promise to innovate across Dell Technologies to create the future of technology infrastructure from the cloud to the edge while dramatically simplifying the customer experience.
And this brings me to our next strategic priority, which is all about what we are creating in our business units to drive and win in the consolidation, generate cash flow and fuel innovation. We have the strongest solution set in our history with businesses that are consistently outperforming their competitors.
In the data center, we are seeing significant traction from our new Unity XT mid-range storage solution. And the strong acceptance of XT in the market gives us confidence as we ramp the solution and prepare to bring our next-generation mid-range storage offering to the market.
We are also seeing strong receptivity of our PowerProtect X400 and PowerProtect Software. The X400 delivers next-generation data management and protection in a software-defined scale-out appliance. It is highly complemented by our PowerProtect Software offering that delivers data protection, deduplication, operation agility, self-service and IT governance.
In Q2, VxRail orders grew 77% as organizations continue to benefit from its simple integration with VMware Cloud Foundation to enable hybrid cloud environments. It's just another example how we are collaborating with VMware to bring another first and best solution to the marketplace.
In client solutions, we introduced new XPS products with leading design and user experience, including more powerful processing and applications matched with thinner and lighter designs like our new XPS 13 2-in-1. And our Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 continues to receive incredible praise from the media and customers alike with PCWorld deeming it, ""A nearly perfect combination of power and battery life."" It is the first commercial laptop with built-in sensing technology.
Our teams are turning out the industry's best products and solutions, executing on our priority to win the consolidation and generate cash flow, which brings me to my final point. As we invest and innovate to capture on the enormous opportunity in front of us, we must remain disciplined and mindful of the near-term environment in which we operate in. So before I turn it over to Tom, let me shift gears to the current demand environment and our view on component cost.
Our core Dell orders were up 4%, excluding China, and we are seeing a clear split between enterprise infrastructure and PC spending globally. In enterprise infrastructure, the market is softer than we and the industry anticipated. We expect it to remain soft through the balance of the year, particularly in China. We feel really good about our ISG execution in Q2 given the market context. 
In the first half, we acquired approximately 21,000 ISG customers, up 11% from the prior year. And more of our ISG customers are purchasing multiple lines of businesses. Our storage business remains healthy in Q2 with orders up 1% and first half orders up 4%. Our sales team remain optimistic about our portfolio and positioning as we head into the second half of the year.
Turning to servers. The industry saw unprecedented growth last year, and many customers are still digesting their CapEx investments. We are balancing revenue and profitability as we navigate through the current server dynamics. Our Q2 server revenue declined, but we realized higher margin dollars as we were consciously more selective on large low-margin deals in all geographies.
Outside of China, our server orders were up 1%, and we expect to gain share this quarter in North America and EMEA when IDC publish its results next week. Our server ASPs remain strong, up high single digits as customers are increasingly buying higher-end systems to support their high-value workloads. 
In Q2, CSG delivered record performance driven by strong execution, the Win 10 refresh and a declining component cost environment. Longer term, we expect to continue to drive share gains through innovation and execution as the industry continues to consolidate among the top vendors. We will continue to focus on commercial, high-end consumer and gaming as well as increasing our attach of services, financing and software and peripherals.
In the supply chain, we expect the component cost environment to remain deflationary in aggregate through at least the end of the year, though it's important to note we expect the decline to significantly slowdown in the second half measured against the first half. This quarter, we clearly benefited from the strength of our broad IT solutions portfolio, which helped us deliver strong results amid short-term market volatility. While we saw soft spending in pockets of the marketplace, our overall performance in Q2 reflected our competitive advantage. In the second half, you should expect us to continue to balance growth and profitability but with a slightly higher bias towards maintaining growth at the portfolio level.
We have built a business to be successful in any environment. We are differentiated by our broad portfolio in the industry with leading solutions, our direct model including services and financing, and our world-class supply chain with its size and scale. Whether the market expands or declines, we expect to outperform the industry.
So to recap, we believe strongly that our long-term growth drivers are intact. We are innovating across the portfolio to create the infrastructure for the digital future. We are investing and innovating to win the consolidation. And we are mindful of the near-term environment, and we are confident we can outperform. Ultimately, it's all about the customer, and no one is better positioned than Dell Technologies to be our customer's best, most trusted partner on their digital transformation journey. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about our Q2 results.",1668
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 29, 2019",2019-08-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3723.0,1814722.0,71044840.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than competitors in the industry, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. We executed well against these priorities again in Q2 as we balanced revenue and profitability with market conditions.
While we saw a softer enterprise IT market this quarter, we continued to benefit from having the industry's broadest portfolio of solutions. Revenue was $23.5 billion, up 1% with core orders revenue up 4% excluding China. And our deferred revenue balance increased to $25.3 billion, up 17%. FX remained a headwind this quarter, impacting year-over-year growth rates by approximately 150 basis points. Gross margin was up 13% to $8 billion and was 34% of revenue, up 340 basis points driven by lower component cost and pricing discipline.
Operating expenses were $5.2 billion, up 6% due in part to investments we have made in sales coverage to expand our buyer base. In the quarter, new enterprise and commercial customer acquisitions were up over 10% from the prior year. And over the last 6 quarters, approximately 80% of our top 30,000 customers have purchased 4 or more lines of business from us. 
We are pleased with our operating income, which was up 30% to $2.7 billion or 11.7% of revenue. Our EPS was $2.15, benefiting from strong operating profitability and a lower tax rate in the quarter due to revenue mix. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue and $11.2 billion on a trailing 12-month basis.
We had a record cash flow quarter generating $3.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow driven by strong profitability and working capital discipline. Some of our working capital benefit came from reduced inventory as we are working through the supply chain dynamics that impacted cash flow last year. 
We also saw deferred revenue increase 17% to $25.3 billion with recurring revenue now making up 20% to 25% of our revenue each quarter. Our services and software businesses continue to grow as we expand the portfolios, adding revenue and cash flow stability and predictability.
We repaid approximately $2 billion of gross debt in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date, and we are well positioned to repay approximately $5 billion of gross debt in total in fiscal year '20. We have now paid down $17 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger.
Shifting to our business unit results. ISG revenue was $8.6 billion, down 7%. Storage revenue was flat at $4.2 billion. As Jeff mentioned, orders were up 1% driven by strength in Isilon and our industry-leading HCI solutions. We are seeing strong receptivity for our new Unity XT solution in the midrange, and we continue to press on growth levers within the broadest and most diverse portfolio in the industry.
Servers and networking revenue was $4.4 billion, down 12%. The global server market remains softer than anticipated coming into the year and has affected our server growth. The impact to our business was most pronounced in China again this quarter, where we were more selective on larger deals and focused on building sustainable, long-term customer relationships.
ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.2% of revenue. Operating income percentage was up 120 basis points largely due to our business and geography mix as well as pricing discipline.
Our VMware business unit had another good quarter with revenue of $2.5 billion, up 12%. Operating income was $762 million or 30.9% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results reported last week, VMware's growth in total revenue plus the sequential change in total unearned revenue was 17%. Core software-defined data center license bookings grew in the high single digits. NSX license bookings were up over 30% and vSAN license bookings grew over 45%.
CSG delivered record revenue and units with strong profitability in Q2. Revenue was $11.7 billion, up 6%. Within CSG, commercial revenue was $9.1 billion, up 12%, driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $2.7 billion, down 12% as we continued to prioritize commercial mix and the higher end of consumer PCs.
We saw strong profitability in CSG this quarter due to component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline. CSG operating income was $982 million or 8.4% of revenue. Going forward, you will continue to see us balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics.
Dell Financial Services originations were $2 billion, up 3%. We did record a noncash charge of $619 million or $524 million, net of tax benefits, after a strategic review of our Virtustream business. We remain committed to serving our customers as we reposition the business.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure. We grew cash and investments in the quarter to approximately $10 billion even after the Q2 debt paydown of $2 billion. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $36.4 billion, down over $12 billion since the EMC acquisition. And net core debt ended Q2 at $30.5 billion. Please see Slide 14 in our web deck for more details.
We are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We are committed to reducing leverage and achieving investment-grade ratings. Given our recent debt paydown and refinancing activity, we have only $2.3 billion due in the next 18 months, excluding VMware and we will continue to look for additional opportunities to smooth our debt maturity profile and optimize our capital structure.
We will maintain pricing discipline as we move into the back half of the year while adjusting as appropriate given market and competitive dynamics. We are still monitoring the macroeconomic and IT spending environments as well as ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.
Moving to guidance. Based on Q2 results and our current expectations for the balance of the year and excluding the impact of VMware's Pivotal and Carbon Black acquisitions, we now expect fiscal year '20 GAAP revenue of $92.7 billion to $94.2 billion, operating income of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion and EPS of $5.45 to $5.90. 
We are narrowing our non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year to $93 billion to $94.5 billion. Due to our strong profitability in the first half of the year, we are increasing our non-GAAP operating income guidance range to $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion and increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $6.95 to $7.40. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 100 basis points.
In closing, we are well positioned. We are innovating to drive growth and future value, and we are driving the [ core ] for share again and cash flow. We have one of the industry's strongest and most comprehensive portfolios, its largest direct sales force and a world-class supply chain with size and scale and we are focused on enabling our customers' digital future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1167

So look, I mean what we were trying to signal there is that as we think about the business and the business velocity, which we like the ramp in business velocity during the quarter, we are starting to -- as we think about cost trends and the deflationary cycle that we're seeing, which we -- is slowing, we do expect that we'll pass -- particularly in some of the server space, probably have to pass more of those cost declines through. And in fact, we are seeing a little bit more aggressiveness in some of those large enterprise and large deals that we -- that we mentioned in the first quarter.
So the bias towards growth was really directed at trying to make sure -- we're a company that drives on scale. We're going to be balanced in the back half of the year. But I do think that from the dynamics that we're seeing right now that I would expect that we're going to see a bit more pricing aggressiveness in the back half. And I would probably point towards servers. I think we feel good about where the client business is and the storage business is from a pricing perspective, but I think servers may have some pressure points.",214

We've certainly spent much of the first half of the year in servers keeping our product line and our traditional price position. And we're going to continue to price the product lines going forward to do that. And as Tom said, that's going to be our bias towards growth. And I think the other thing that we're signaling and we mentioned a couple of times is the fuel of that will be commodity deflation substantially slows in the second half, so we have to watch that. But we're going to have a slight bias towards growth, keeping our eye on profitability in both of the businesses.",111

When we look at other companies that have reported enterprise, we've seen a pattern of weakness in large enterprises that seems to develop in, let's say, the June time frame. And so I'm wondering whether that has been the same for you and whether you've seen that continue to weaken or you think it's stabilized. And then I'd also love to get a comment on small and medium businesses. Those seem to be -- have been more stable, and I'm wondering if you could just confirm that, that's also what you're seeing.",112

When I look at the server business, in particular, the softness that we have seen, and we actually talked about it last quarter as well, is in large bids and in China. So those large enterprise bids that you mentioned, we continue to see softness there as well as in China. In fact, if you were to look at our server business excluding China, we were actually -- had growth. Our business was up 1% in orders. We continue to see that pressure in the second half of the year. Tom alluded to just moments ago about the price aggressiveness that we think is turning up in the second half in those large orders, those large enterprise accounts. So I think that's consistent with what you've seen.
And then on [ MB and SB ], we continue to see that business perform. We don't break out the segment performance of the businesses, but it's been an area of growth for us and we'll continue, I think, to see that going forward.",175

Let me start and then I'll let Tyler talk a little bit about our debt plans. And look, I mean the guidance we gave clearly upped the range around operating income given the overperformance in the first half. We are -- we did end the quarter at $10 billion of cash, of which $6 billion of that you should think about as core. So look, I mean I think we're going to have some flexibility of all things go like we think it does to take a look at that as we go through the year. Right now as we look at the maturity stacks that we're planning on addressing, I think we feel good about the $5 billion. We'll have to see what -- where we -- how the rest of the year unfolds and whether we would submit to doing even more than that. Tyler, I don't know if you would add anything.",158

I mean the debt pay-down remains a priority, so we'll continue to focus on that.

And if I could just sneak in another one. I missed a couple of minutes because I got disconnected on the call, so I apologize if you addressed this during that period. But you seem to suggest that you see more incremental price aggression in servers but are pretty confident on the PC side. Are you suggesting that sort of the more normalized PC operating margin, which is more than 300 basis points above, currently above your prior indicated range that we should be thinking, a, about sustainability in the mid- to high single digit or high single digits for PC operating margins at least for a few more quarters? Or how much do you think the falling component prices has boosted PC op margins above a normalized rate?",130

So let me start and maybe Jeff can chime in here as well. As we think about our guidance -- as we think of the guidances we gave, which was $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion, which was a raise of roughly about $700 million midpoint to midpoint, as we think about the back half of the year, it's clear as we look -- we see that the PC op margins benefited from a couple of things, 1 being the significant cost decline, of which we have probably priced through about 60% of that cost, and we've also let some of that cost fall through the bottom. 
The other piece of the dynamic there has been the commercial client mix, and we're up about 4% year-on-year from 69% to 73% of mix. And so that's been beneficial as we navigated through the first half. I think as we step through the back half, I think we're going to see PC margins gradually normalize back towards the historic norms. We'll have to see how that unfolds. But the rate of cost decline is significantly less than it is in the second half than it was in the first half and as you think about pricing normalizing and the prices in the market beginning to capture a lot of that cost decline already. So we are thinking that PC margins gradually come back to more historical norms, not in any sort of dramatic clip-like fashion but I just think we're going to see those things gradually migrating back. Jeff, I don't know what you would add.",266

Part of our improvement or performance in the first half, you talked about 2 of them being the commercial mix and pricing through about 60% of the cost decline. Our direct commercial PC business grew double digits, which drives higher attach rates of services, peripherals and financing that's helped, and we've seen an [ SRU ] improvement in there as well. And that's led to the performance that you just spoke about, Toni.
Conversely, when I look at the second half, the second half is tilting towards consumer, and consumer has a lower margin structure than our commercial business. We certainly have the uncertainty with trade and the associated costs that go along with trade as we head into the second half.
And then I would point to some of the publicly available data, which I know you know very, very well. But to make our point, DRAM, if I look at DRAM exchange, if I look about -- look at where we started the first of the year to where we are today, DRAM has fallen 60% -- nearly 60%. If I look at what they say the projection is for the remainder of the year, we see a 3% cost decline. So the rate of deflation is changing, and we think the pricing environment will reflect that towards the end of the year. Does that help?",232

Paul, I mean industry data varies but we're roughly 60-ish percent plus through the Windows 10 migration. That has clearly been a source of growth for the commercial PC business for the past 1.5 years or so. We see that continuing to be a source of growth for the remaining part of the year and probably into the very early part of next calendar year.
Tough compares, of course, if you look at what the commercial PC business has performed at for the past 6 quarters and what's in front of us, it will be tougher comparison next year. You see that in the industry forecast for PC growth next year, which is going to be down. The latest forecast, I believe, has PCs down 4% next year. This year, it's roughly flat but heavily biased towards commercial, consumer being down. And that will be a headwind as we go into the business next year.
I would also tell you the things that we've done in the business to prepare us for that, I think, are pretty encouraging. We're going to focus on the consolidation that's underway that -- as the PC industry continues to consolidate towards the top 3 manufacturers. We have made investments in coverage and capacity across all sorts of customers from the smallest businesses to the largest businesses in the world. We think that expansion of coverage and capacity helps us in the long term.
And then we have new technologies that we think help us with our Unified Workspace driving a differentiated solution into the marketplace. That will be a source of growth for the business. And then clearly, our focus on our direct commercial business and then the high-end consumer and gaming business are where you'll see our focus as we head into next year.",302

And the other thing that we look at, when we look at and evaluate large bids or large opportunities is to what extent that, that -- is that business strategic to us and sticky, meaning is a long-term customer acquisition play where they're going to buy multiple LOBs and have the opportunity to sell the multiple different types of solutions and service capabilities?
What we have generally seen with that -- the hyperscale business in China is that it tends to be very transactional, where you're getting -- that business is rebid every quarter or every half year. And so -- and given that pattern and the -- and what we've seen, we've chosen not to participate in it. And if that's the pattern that continues, you'll see us continue to not participate in it.
Instead, we're very focused on growing the customer base in China and about building lasting, sustainable customer relationships. So we have shifted the focus of the China business to we'd much rather them -- they go out and build the server buyer base into the mid- and small enterprise and larger enterprise space absent the hyperscale and not participate in that hyperscale space just given the purchasing behavior and the buying behaviors that we're seeing. So I don't think that with what we know right now that, that piece of that market is -- while it will still probably be there, it's not of a lot of interest to us at this point in time.",291

We see our HCI business continuing to grow. I think we made reference earlier that our HCI business, specifically the VxRail component of that, grew 77%. Our converged infrastructure business grew this past quarter. The broad category of unstructured data grew, and we saw actually good performance in our Unity and the new Unity XT mid-range product had year-over-year growth as well.
In addition to the PowerMax 2000 that we introduced early last fall for the high price bands and the midrange all grew. I think we've positioned the product line in a great way. You'll see some more announcements through the remainder of the year that we'll continue to refresh it and keep it competitive. And we expect to outgrow the marketplace.
The marketplace is expected to grow with the last forecast, I think, just under 3%. I would expect us to outperform the market. The investments that we've made in capacity, in coverage, the tenure of that sales force continues to grow by the day literally. And we're pretty optimistic about our prospects to outperform the marketplace in the second half of the year.",207

Now whether they're buying 1 LOB or 2 LOBs, but the point of it is that we're expanding the customer base, which gives us a broader feel, a broader base to sell into. 
And so we're encouraged by that and obviously got to go out and execute and do the -- and make sure that sales motion is right on the coverage model. But one of the investment paybacks we've been looking for from this go-to-market investment that we've made over the last 2 years has been around are we expanding the customer base.

We had a good week this week. At VMworld, we talked about our Dell Technologies Cloud platform. We actually made several announcements to extend that platform from what we announced at Dell Technologies World the last week of April. And the interest this week has been very high.
Specifically, we extended the platform of validated designs to support our PowerMax storage arrays and our Unity and Unity XT storage arrays and our PowerEdge MX compute. We also, which the thing I'm most excited about and that patent team did a great job on stage earlier in the week, is we announced the initial availability of the first on-prem Data Center-as-a-Service, so in managed service for data center on-prem with first or the initial availability of that product, which is pretty exciting for us. 
And then on top of that, acknowledging or building upon what we announced back in that last week of April, we talked about new consumption models and we've added our Dell Technologies Cloud platform and our on-demand payment terms that we can pay in any form of consumption. So very similar to how a public cloud operates today. We can actually bill the customer by usage, and that's been received quite well. So we're pretty excited about that capability.
As you think about we added VMware Pivotal Container Service support on top of that, and we have a very comprehensive multi-cloud, hybrid cloud in the marketplace, in fact, the only one that allows you to move data workloads across the edge to on-prem private data centers to the public cloud. That's what our customers are asking for, the ability to do that in an automated way, to be able to manage it in a consistent way, and our Dell VMware cloud allows us to do that. So I'm pretty bullish on the opportunities going forward. Does that make sense?",317

We don't typically parse. We give you a revenue and an op inc, but let me sort of try and give you some -- but because I'm feeling nice today, I'm going to give you some color around it, right? 
So look, as we looked at -- you just -- we looked at our margins -- gross margin for -- or our operating margin performance, let me start there. What I would tell you is that it was up 190 basis points. I'm talking about Q-on-Q now, so from 10.3% to 12.2%. I think that from a -- if you were to pick your way through that, most of that goodness was principally OpEx goodness. And the actual gross margins for us was flat to slightly down. And we -- and if you parse that margin, what you would see is storage margins were stable and we saw some server -- we had server margins declining slightly. And if you think about what's driving the server margin decline, it's really the things that we just previously talked about, which we saw some pricing aggressiveness in large enterprise deals and we saw some mix dynamics within China, which drove some margin pressure downwards.
So that's sort of the environment we saw, and that's also why we're essentially sort of flashing the headlights on the fact that we do think that we'll see a bit more server pricing aggressiveness and -- as we go through the back half. 
So that's how -- that's sort of our current thinking. I don't know, Jeff, if you would add anything, but we just thought about it right now.",277

Look, I won't comment on our peers. I mean what I would tell you is that if you think about the broad set of capabilities and solutions and the comprehensive portfolio we have, we think we have more growth levers and more levers that we can address and build upon with our customers, right? And so we have the most comprehensive portfolio in the IT infrastructure industry from our perspective.
You think about the work that we've done on go to market over the last 2 years, we've been building the customer base, which we've highlighted this quarter, whether it's around the 21,000 new buyers in ISG year-over-year or whether it's around the 11% growth -- or the 10% growth in customers, new acquisition customers. And so we've been very focused on building our customer base as well. 
Now look -- and we've obviously -- if you think about the financial performance, we clearly have been aided by -- we've had some deflationary cost environment in the first half of the year. We are obviously signaling through my guidance that, that -- and we have said that, that cost decline or that cost deflation substantially slows in the second half of the year. But our job and our model that we built is to grow at a premium to the market, take share, take relative share and generate cash flow. And so that's the model we've built, and we think that's the model that sustains in all these different types of economic environments.
And look, I mean we're doing our best to execute the model. And I think we've had a pretty good execution quarter from my perspective. But again, I think it gets back to the broadness of the portfolio. If you look at the results, obviously, we're aided by a strong CSG business this quarter. 
If we were a solely infrastructure data center business, it would have been a bit -- it would have been quite a little bit of a different story. But our broad portfolio allows us to play the growth levers that are available in the marketplace. And I think the team did a pretty good job on that.",367

Why I don't take the tariff question? Wamsi, this is Jeff. Clearly, we have spent a lot of time planning and working through the very dynamic situation that we're living in today with tariffs. Our global supply chain with 25 manufacturing sites around the globe allows us to have the agility and flexibility we need to honestly move fast and to minimize the impact. We're focused on continuity of supply and continuity of supply and delivery to our customers and managing that. But quite honestly, we're working through the challenges of List 4, which is what you're specifically talking about. 
We've mentioned List 1 through 3 in the previous calls. We successfully mitigated that cost impact to the vast majority of our products. There has been cases where we have not and we raised price. And we will continue to work to mitigate the impact to our customers with List 4 starting with All in One from September 1, call it December 15 with flat panel monitors and notebooks. 
In some cases, our costs are going to go up and we will have to move price. It's one of the comments I made earlier when you think about the second half and what's different on our client business. We have the uncertainty of tariffs and the uncertainty of the associated costs that go along with it. We cannot absorb all of that cost, and we will pass that along to our customers in the form of price in various ways.
How we do that, we're still working our way through. We spend a lot of time making sure that we have our manufacturing capabilities in place, that the manufacturing sites are prepared, the manufacturing processes are prepared for the changes, sourcing operations for our notebook, All in Ones and flat panel monitors. So that's where we are. I think that's the best answer I can give today. More to come. It is pretty dynamic. It has changed a couple of times. And will probably continue to change, but yes.",340

But as we think about just geo-based right now, we would tell you that, in general, we've seen North America demand has generally been quite -- has been healthy. And we're pleased with that. We're pleased with our Latin America demand. I think we have seen some softening in Europe and whether that's Brexit-related or just short of general economic dynamics, hard to parse that. But I think we've seen some softening there. I mean you go to Asia, clearly, we've talked about China being a sort of a softer market for us this year. Pleased with what we're seeing in Japan.

So I think, in general, I mean that would be how I would frame it for you.

It seems like from my model, your top line guidance that at least on a year-on-year basis, between 3Q and 4Q, I'm actually seeing that year-on-year's revenue should accelerate. Could you verify if that's true and kind of help me reconcile some of these statements and how that impacts your full year guidance?",93

So I'm not sure of what -- how you're modeling and so maybe the team can help you with that offline. I would tell you that as we think about storage, I mean, the market is sort of low single digits, and so that's the forecast from IDC. Jeff talked about the fact that we saw storage demand at 1% in Q2.
The broader ISG comment, which I think you're referring to, is that we continue to see softness in servers. And so you've got to think about that mix dynamic. IDC is forecasting negative growth in servers for mainstream servers for the rest of the year. And so there are some interplay between those 2 LOBs as you model ISG.
So yes, maybe the team can take that offline and take a look at how you're thinking about it. But as we look at the business, we expect to see server revenue -- that's -- the server market continue to be challenging for the remainder of the year with what we know today. We are more optimistic about the storage market. 
Now it's still -- it's not a double-digit growth market, but we are optimistic that given the improvement in the coverage model, all the work that Jeff has done with his team on product and product line positioning that we expect to see better results in storage. And so that's how we've thought about the year at this point.",249

But it seems like today's commentary was that the second half will balance growth and profitability but maybe leaning towards growth. Can you just kind of level set where we are with regards to sales productivity?",77

We don't sort of talk about those numbers publicly. But I would tell you that we are seeing the capacity that we've added sort of ramping on the sort of the normal productivity curves that we would expect, right? Now you have to balance that against it is a bit tougher market than it was a year ago. And so there are macro dynamics that you're managing as you think about productivity, although we don't tend to give the sales orgs a lot of breaks on -- we'll just have to simply drive to the productivity levels that we've committed to.
But to be fair, it's a bit choppier market out there, particularly like in servers. So -- but the productivity curves they're on -- and to your comment, we're biasing ourselves towards growth. What we're trying to signal is, is that we do want to make sure that the growth engine stays intact and that we're -- we have a bias towards customer base expansion, revenue base expansion. Even in a tougher market, the benefits of scale for us are quite significant and we want to make sure that, that scale advantage continues. 
So as we think about the back half of the year, that was what we were trying to signal. And we're still investing in sales capacity, I might add, particularly as we think about some of the market opportunity as we set up for next year. So that's how we're thinking about it.",251

Coming off the best server year in time and the best storage year in times in calendar 2018. If memory serves me, we roughly have the storage market growing 12% last year and the server market 30-ish percent if memory serves me right. There's been a digestion of that that's taken longer than, I think, all of us in the industry expected. And by and large, that's what we're dealing with combined with the softness that we talked about in what has been one of the fastest growing markets in the world, China.",112

And when you think about the macro environment, whether it's tariffs or Brexit or some of the other macro dynamics around interest rates and where GDP is trending, it does create an air of -- potentially an air of uncertainty. And so that also probably has some level of dampening effect on the market.
Having said that though, right, I mean we think that we're optimistic about the back half of the year. We think we're set up to continue to execute. And companies are still spending. And companies are still under digital transformation, and they need to -- and they think about some of these IT investments as essential to their business model evolution.

At our September business update with investors, I talked about our 2 focus areas: first, innovating and integrating across Dell Technologies to create the technology infrastructure of the future; and second, innovating to win in the industry consolidation. We are making solid progress on both, which is what I will update you on today. Plus, I'll give you my take on the demand environment.
Customers are looking for -- to Dell Technologies to help them reinvent and automate all parts of their business, essentially help them build the infrastructure of the future so they can quickly respond to market trends, customer needs and drive business outcomes. This drives long-term value for our customers and for us. It also drives us to innovate and invest in new technologies that are simpler, faster and more capable, even autonomous, all designed to be consumed the way customers want based on their business needs. We continue to invest in our power portfolio across ISG, which represents our best innovation and capabilities for the data era. We shipped PowerMax with storage class memory, an industry first to market, and it's now 50% faster. In September, we announced the PowerProtect DD Series that now features a modern software stack with 38% faster backups and 36% faster restores.
Most recently at our Dell Technologies Summit earlier this month, we introduced our all-in-one autonomous infrastructure, PowerONE. Part of the Dell Technologies Cloud portfolio, PowerONE helps customers simplify their path to hybrid cloud, combining PowerEdge compute, PowerMax storage, PowerSwitch networking, PowerProtect data protection and VMware virtualization all in a single system with intelligence built in to automate thousands of manual steps during its life cycle.
Further, we made the industry's broadest infrastructure portfolio simpler to consume with Dell Technologies On Demand, letting customers pay for infrastructure as they use it, freeing up resources, money, time and people to focus on transforming their business in today's on-demand economy. This gives customers the ability to plan and predict around peak data consumption and IT spend cycles.
We are excited about what these new innovations make possible for our customers and what they represent in terms of how we've readied the ISG of the future over the -- or how we've readied ISG for the future over the past 2 years. We've stabilized the business, reclaimed share, simplified and powered up the portfolio and added sales resources to fuel growth.
At the Dell Technologies Summit, Michael unveiled our ambitious new goals for 2030 focusing on inclusion, sustainability, transforming lives through technology and data privacy. For example, by 2030, our goal is that 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled or renewable material, and more than half of our product content will be made from recycled and renewable material. And for every product a customer buys, we will reuse or recycle an equivalent product. These initiatives follow what we've achieved over the past 10 years, like recovering more than 2 billion pounds of used electronics via responsible recycling and reusing 100 million pounds of recycled content and other sustainable materials in our new products. We have a strong record -- strong track record here to build on which helps us win in the marketplace.
We've made some important social impact commitments that are increasingly important to our customers, team members and investors. I encourage you to learn more on our website and through the replay of the summit event.
Before I get to the demand environment, I want to remind you of our operating framework that remains unchanged. We expect to outperform the market and take profitable share. We have gained 375 basis points of storage share over the last 2 years, 580 basis points of mainstream server revenue share over the last 3 years and approximately 600 basis points of PC share over the last 6 years.
Now shifting to demand. From a customer set and geographic perspective, we see solid demand in small, medium and commercial accounts with weakness in China and some softening in the large enterprise space. From a business unit perspective, we see softness in infrastructure solutions demand driven by servers, while client solutions and VMware are solid.
Let me share a few examples. Our storage business grew 7%. We saw strong Q3 demand in data protection and hyperconverged with VxRail orders up 82%. We expect to gain storage share in North America in calendar Q3. More importantly, our customers and sales teams are optimistic about our portfolio and positioning.
The server demand environment remains challenged as many customers continue to digest last year's unprecedented growth. Excluding Greater China, our Q3 server order revenue was down mid- to high single digits. While the server market remains soft, we continue to focus on growing our server buyer base, which was up 5%, growing year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. In addition, our server business benefited from an increasing mix of high-value workload platforms, increased memory and storage content and component cost decreases. We expect to gain share in North America and in EMEA and retain our #1 share positions in x86 mainstream server revenue and units.
Client solutions demand remains healthy with tailwinds from the Windows 10 refresh cycle expected to continue and then fade into the first half of next year. IDC is projecting a declining post-Windows 10, which will be a headwind to CSG in fiscal '21 overall.
In Q3, CSG delivered strong results across commercial. Going forward, we remain focused on direct growth and optimizing our channel relationships. We have invested in our sales forces in both small and medium businesses and continue to accelerate growth there. In consumer, we will focus on direct sales and high-end premium PCs, including XPS and gaming, as well as increasing our attach of services, software and peripherals.
We expect component cost to remain deflationary in aggregate through Q1 of next year but at a significantly lower rate than the last 3 quarters. We are now seeing inflation in SSDs with 20% inflation expected in Q4 and DRAM inflation beginning in Q2 of 2020 per industry and analyst estimates. We clearly have captured the operating benefits from the significant cost declines in fiscal '20, and it will be our job to mitigate these expected increases for our customers and for Dell in fiscal '21.
And finally, Intel CPU shortages have worsened quarter-over-quarter, the shortages are now impacting our commercial PC and premium consumer PC Q4 forecasted shipments.
Now I will turn it over to Tom to take you through our financial results and guidance.",1088
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 26, 2019",2019-11-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3485.0,1881102.0,73662187.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. We have executed relatively well this year and again in Q3 as we balanced revenue and profitability with more challenging market conditions.
Revenue was $22.9 billion, up 1%. FX remained a headwind this quarter impacting growth by approximately 110 basis points. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $25.9 billion, up 17%, driven by our services and software businesses, adding revenue and cash flow stability. Gross margin was up 11% to $7.8 billion and was 33.9% of revenue, up 300 basis points, driven by lower component costs and pricing discipline.
Operating expenses were $5.3 billion, up 8%, due in part to investments we have made in sales coverage to broaden solution sales capabilities and expand buyer base. Operating income was up 18% to $2.4 billion or 10.7% of revenue. Our consolidated net income was $1.4 billion, up 21%, primarily benefiting from strong operating profitability. Our EPS was $1.75 for the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion or 12.5% of revenue and $11.6 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. We generated $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow in Q3 driven by strong profitability and working capital discipline. Our Q3 adjusted free cash flow includes the impact of an approximately $400 million payment for a tax settlement, and our trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow is now $7.7 billion.
We repaid approximately $1.1 billion of gross debt in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date. And we are positioned to repay approximately $5 billion of gross debt in total in FY '20. We have now paid down $18.1 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger.
Shifting to our business unit results, Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue was $8.4 billion, down 6%. Storage revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7%, with strong growth in data protection and our industry-leading HCI business given our strong velocity with our VxRail solutions. Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 16% due to a soft market, particularly in China and in large enterprise customers in the U.S. and Europe. As Jeff mentioned, ex China, server order revenue was down mid- to high single digits. We continue to be selective on larger deals when we see very aggressive competitor pricing. We are also focused on enhancing our coverage models and building sustainable, long-term customer relationships.
ISG operating income was $1 billion or 11.9% of revenue. Operating income percentage was up 140 basis points largely due to our business and geography mix.
Our VMware business unit had another good quarter with revenue of $2.5 billion, up 11%. Operating income was $717 million or 28.9% of revenue. On a stand-alone basis, Q3 VMware growth in revenue, plus the sequential change in deferred revenue, was 18% or an increase of 12%, excluding unearned revenue assumed from the acquisition of Carbon Black. NSX license bookings grew 50%, while vSAN license bookings grew over 35%. VMware closed the Carbon Black acquisition in Q3 and expects to close the Pivotal transaction before the end of Q4.
Client Solutions Group delivered strong Q3 revenue growth and profitability. Revenue was $11.4 billion, up 5%. Commercial revenue was $8.3 billion, up 9%, including double-digit growth in commercial desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was down $3.1 billion, and it was down 6% as we continue to prioritize our commercial business and our focus on more profitable, higher-end consumer PCs.
CSG operating income was $739 million or 6.5% of revenue. Profitability was driven by component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline. Expect us to continue to balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics. As we have previously discussed, we are seeing and do expect operating margins to trend back to more historical norms given the changing cost environment.
Dell Financial Services originations were $2 billion, up 27%, with managed assets of $10.7 billion. And we continue to see interest in our flexible consumption solutions including Dell Technologies On Demand.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure. We ended the quarter with $9.4 billion of cash and investments after a $1.1 billion of gross debt pay-down and the approximately $400 million tax settlement payment. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $35.9 billion, down almost $13 billion since the EMC acquisition. Net core debt ended Q3 at $29.6 billion.
We remain focused on maximizing free cash flow, and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. Given our recent debt pay-down and refinancing activity, we have only $2.3 billion of core debt due in the next 15 months. And we will continue to look for additional opportunity to smooth our debt maturity profile and optimize our capital structure. We still expect to pay down at least $4 billion of gross debt next year and are committed to reducing leverage to achieve investment-grade ratings.
Moving to guidance. We continue to monitor the macroeconomic and IT spending environments as well as the ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we do see continued softness in large enterprise customers and in China. Based on Q3 results and the Intel CPU shortage Jeff mentioned, we now expect fiscal '20 GAAP revenue of $91.5 million to $92.2 billion, operating income of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion and EPS of $5.83 to $5.98. We now expect our non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year to be between $91.8 million to $92.5 billion. The reduction of the range is principally due to the Intel supply dynamic.
With our strong profitability year-to-date driven by favorable component cost and disciplined pricing, we are raising the low end of our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance ranges. Our non-GAAP operating income range is now $10 billion to $10.2 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $7.25 to $7.40. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%, plus or minus 1%.
We want to give you some insights into our preliminary thinking for fiscal '21. We continue to see macro headwinds in China and softening client solutions demand post the Win 10 refresh. That, coupled with the Intel CPU supply constraints and the global macro environment, leaves us slightly more cautious on fiscal '21 growth. We also expect the benefit of the fiscal year '20 component cost deflation to wane as component costs are forecasted to be inflationary in fiscal '21. Accordingly, our preliminary view is that operating income margins may trend closer to fiscal '19 levels, and we are balancing investments in the business and adjusting spending as appropriate. We will provide an updated view of fiscal year '21 expectations on our Q4 earnings call in February.
In closing, you should expect us to maximize our equity value to all shareholders through the 5 distinct levers we talked about at our business update: current operations, synergies, new opportunities, corporate structure and capital structure. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than competitors in the industry, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue over the long term and generating strong cash flow. You've seen that from us this year. As we maximize cash flow and profit, given the environment, you can expect us to adjust accordingly in fiscal '21.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1210

Let me start, and then maybe Jeff can jump in here as well, particularly on the storage and his view of the macro. As we think about fiscal '21, I just wanted to give you some -- or we wanted to give you some preliminary thinking as we see some of the current macro dynamics, right, principally some of the caution in the environment given the U.S.-China trade dynamics; the softness we've seen in large enterprise; consumption, particularly in servers; and the Intel CPU shortages causing some dynamics that are causing us to be a little bit more cautious than perhaps we would have been, say, 3 to 4 months ago. So we're going to work our way through that. We'll update you as we get through the end of Q4 and give you our view in our Q4 earnings call.

Yes, Wamsi, when I look at storage and highlights and things that we certainly are pleased to see, one is we referenced it in our opening remarks, VxRail and its 82% orders growth. We continue to see VxRail, combined with VMware Cloud Foundation, helping customers build out private cloud in this hybrid world that we look in. So that's certainly a highlight that we continue to see. The acceptance of our new data protection products has been quite good. The integrated products as well as the new data domain platforms are off to good, early starts, which to me is continued reinforcement. As we've modernized the portfolio and gotten increasingly more competitive, we're seeing the market respond accordingly.
And then the other areas that I'd point to is just the continued progress of our PowerMax platform and the new Unity XT. Both of them were growing in the double-digit zip code as we've looked at Q3 results, so very strong demand for our new products which is encouraging. The continued buildout of on-prem, private cloud, VxRail plus VCF are clearly things that are highlights of our storage business and storage demand.",193

Clearly, as we think about component cost dynamics, we have enjoyed extraordinary deflation this year. And I think most of you know, we've talked about it from time to time, that our model is -- works extraordinarily well in a deflationary cost environment where we pass some of that costs through in terms of pricing, but we hold some of that cost goodness in terms of profitability. As you flip to a more inflationary environment, that clearly is not the dynamic. And I think part of what we wanted to do is make sure people are thinking through that component cost dynamic year-to-year as you set up for next year. So obviously, it's early yet. We'll continue to monitor the forecast and our thinking around that, but there are some dynamics working through on component cost as we think about next year.",153

In recent quarters, it seemed like the China server business was the explanation, but now it looks like the unit weakness in servers has expanded outside of China. I'm just curious what the dynamics are that create such different trends between those 2 segments, and any comments around how the industry is flowing through component cost to pricing and if maybe that's a factor in the results.",87

This is Jeff. A couple of comments, and I know Tom will jump in with his thoughts as well. I think we've consistently identified large enterprise and large bids and China in our previous quarters this year as soft spots. Clearly, we saw unprecedented growth in the industry last year. That growth is being digested by the largest companies in the world. And we're seeing that primarily in that large enterprise in the United States and EMEA. China has been a headwind. We've called out, I think, consistently now for the last 3 quarters for sure, and that continues to be a headwind in that marketplace. There are also signs that we're encouraged by is the progress that we've made in our North America commercial. Our SB and NB sales forces have seen double-digit order growth in those areas in servers. So we're encouraged.
And I mentioned the growing buyer base in our opening remarks, too, I believe it was up 5%, which marks the fifth consecutive quarter of buyer base growth. It is a competitive market out there in the large bids. It's an aggressive marketplace from a pricing point of view. We're competing, but those bids are clearly competitive. And probably the other thing that is important to note is they're taking longer to close. The caution that we're seeing with our large customers is certainly being seen. And our ability to close transactions or how long it's taking to get that order closed would be another piece of color that I would add.",258

I would -- Jeff sort of hinted at it, but we clearly see where component cost deflation is being used to price pretty aggressively right now. And we see that trend generally in the large bids across the globe and in China. And we've talked about in the past that we're going to be -- look, we're going to compete where we need to compete, and we clearly want to grow the customer base, but we want those customer base to be, long term, the right type of customer for us in terms of profitability cycle that makes sense over time. And so we are being selective. And so that's just the dynamic that we're in right now.
I would also add, and Jeff hinted towards it, that our transactional server business is holding up reasonably well. So the weakness is principally in those 2 areas. I think when you get to storage, it's a different type of buying situation where you're generally putting a solution out there that is less price-sensitive in the sense of it's not tied to a commodity cost framework as much and it's more of an IP framework that you're selling in terms of capabilities and feature functionality of the storage solution. And it's a different type of -- it's a value sale solution, it's a value-selling process versus at times where it might be a more procurement-oriented process.",238

We're in this data era. The amount of data created is not slowing. It's got to be stored, which is probably why we're seeing a slightly different trend from the compute side to the storage side. But I would point to VxRail, which is hyperconverged, where we bring compute and storage together in a modern 2-tier architecture, helping customers drive out their modern infrastructure build on-prem private clouds as a point of -- certainly that we're excited about given our position there and the opportunity that presents itself going forward.",103

So perhaps you can help on the server side, what was unit versus ASP growth for server in the quarter? And when you talk about operating margins, I realize it's very preliminary in fiscal '21, is what you're anticipating that the benefit of component pricing will be increasingly passed along? Or are you actually more worried about prices staying where they are but component prices going up to the detriment of your margins? And perhaps in addressing that, you can talk about both PCs and servers and where you think you are in terms of halfway, 3/4 of the way, just starting in terms of prices being passed along, component prices being passed along in the form of lower prices to consumers.",139

That is at least 4 parts that I got. So if I look at the trend of revenue and your specific question, Toni, about revenue unit trends, our revenue growth was greater -- or our revenue decline was greater than our unit decline, which I know the obvious question is that's an ASP implication. Interesting thing we see is continued progress on high-value workloads, which is driving higher DRAM content, higher SSD content. Both SSD and DRAM content was up double digits. We actually sold up the Intel CPU stack and servers at the same time, but it did not -- none of those 3 were enough to offset a modest ASP decline. So I think that answers the first 2 questions. Tom will jump in, in a second on the long-term implications.
What we're seeing in the marketplace, again, if you think of what we've done and the series of price moves we've taken over the first 3 quarters of this year, we have the product line, specifically servers, in price position. We're quite comfortable with the price position. We're in our historical norms, maybe on the slight -- on the high side of that but in our historical norms of price position in the marketplace. And you see the businesses that are very subjected to street price respond well, SB, NB, our North America commercial business, which are good indicators for us. In the largest business, as Tom and I just mentioned, that's where the most aggressiveness is and where we see, I guess, the commodity deflation being passed on to customers.",271

And as you think through, Toni, for -- it's Tom, for FY '21 -- and look, we're still looking at this, but if you take what Jeff just said, which is particularly for our PCs and servers, there are certain list price and street price frameworks that we want to run towards, as component cost deflation stabilizes, I'll say it that way, or flattens out, and then you start to get inflation, you have this dynamic where you ultimately will make decisions about how you price or how do you adjust pricing to adjust for those component cost input rises. If you decide to raise prices, we've talked about this in the past, in general, you only get about 60% of the price increase in any given quarter. So if you make a price increase in the quarter, you don't automatically move to that new price. So it takes time to digest price increases. And you're going to balance that relative to competitive dynamics in terms of where are you from a list position and a street price position such that you stay competitive.
And so in a component deflation environment, which is what we've been in this year, we've been able to adjust street pricing or adjust pricing downward, but the rate of deflation has been greater than that such that it has allowed us to capture some of that deflation in the form of incremental dollars to the bottom. As you move to an environment of inflation, that opportunity is not there. And then you're trying to balance pricing versus demand generation and ensuring that you stay in price position but yet protect the P&L as best you can. And so look, we've navigated through these cycles in the past. The model -- we'll adjust the model appropriate. But that's the dynamic we're working our way through, we're thinking about as we think about next year right now. This will get -- hopefully, we'll continue to get more clarity on potentially second half cost frameworks of second half fiscal year '21, as we go into FY '21. But our view right now is that the cost environment becomes inflationary as you go through the year, correct.",369

We've kept the product line and price position as well. It's -- largely, we've seen most of the cost of goods in the first half passed through. I do think we have to work our way through the supply shortages and what ultimately the market pricing will be.

In terms of unit price, we don't parse it out, excluding China, I certainly won't do that today. But it's the trend that I described. We're seeing, again, those transactionally oriented businesses respond to the price position in the marketplace. As I mentioned, our units were down as well, not as down as much as the revenue. We did see increases in content of DRAM and SSD as well as the CPU that I mentioned earlier. And I think that bodes well longer term as we think about content, we think about high-value workloads, our ability to offset some of the change in the cost environment going forward.

On the component side, you talked about, with regard to the client PC business, that SSD pricing would be up, I think, 20% sequentially in the calendar fourth quarter and that DRAM pricing would start to trend higher into 2Q of 2020. Can you give us the same kind of framework or commentary of how you're seeing those trends specific to the server or enterprise SSD as well as the server DRAM market? How are you thinking about those dynamics as you kind of give the commentary with regard to fiscal 2021? And then any update on the midrange next platform on the storage side, when is that expected to start to ship and impact the storage business?",126

And real quickly, the NAND trends and DRAM trends that I mentioned were across all of our NAND purchases and DRAM purchases. So industry analysts and experts have projected the cost that I referenced earlier, the 20% of SSDs. Now DRAM, I believe I said Q2 of calendar 2020. That's across our broad purchase of both server components as well as PC components. And in the midrange, we're still on track. So the commitment I've made in a number of these calls that we will have the product completed by the end of the fiscal year, and it will be released. We're pretty excited about that, particularly with the momentum we've seen on Unity XT, which is the bridge from the old Unity product, a performance increase -- a significant performance increase that we launched over the summer that takes us to the new midrange product out -- at the end of the fiscal year. We like what we've done. Certainly, we've talked a little bit about the feature set. It's a modern stack containerized capability. It's a modular design, without getting into predisclosing what the exact product is.

Let me just give you some context here, right? So from a size perspective, we've said this in the past that the China business unit is sort of high single digits in terms of -- as a percent of revenue of the total company. So you can do sort of rough math on that. As we think about the demand environment in China, and I'm not going to parse it for you whether what we -- our belief, as we look at the business, is that there's a couple of dynamics happening. One, there is an overall sort of macroeconomic softening that's happened in the country. We have seen that in elements of the China business. It's hard, and I'm not under any ability to sort of say some of that is because of some of the more political dynamics, I can't really call that. What we're trying to do right now is ensure that we've got the China business properly framed such that when the Chinese economy comes back into growth mode or into more -- a stronger mode that we can take advantage of the opportunities over there and continue to supply our customer needs over there.
So look, it's not a -- it's a tough environment. We've done a number of actions to set that business on a framework that makes sense for us.

If we look at what the industry analysts are projecting for next calendar year, I believe the storage -- external storage forecast is roughly minus 1%, I think, is the aggregate consensus of all of the industry experts and analysts there. Look, my job is to do better than that, outperform the marketplace and take share. We're going to do that with the industry's broadest storage portfolio from our classic 3-tier storage architecture, so primarily arrays with high end, midrange and the entry-level products. We have the advantage in the high end of the marketplace with our PowerMax product. Our Unity XT product, as I mentioned earlier, is doing well, growing double digits. It's a bridge to the new product that will be out next year, as I mentioned. We've made progress with the entry-level product. Our broad storage portfolio moves into the areas of data protection, which the new integrated data protection appliance and the new data domain products are off to a good start as they've been refreshed. Then we have the HCI and CI portfolios of PowerONE that I just mentioned, a leader in the converged infrastructure category. And then we've certainly been the market leader in the fast-growing HCI space.
So with that broad portfolio now largely refreshed and modernized, I'm optimistic that we can outperform the marketplace as we head into next year. That's certainly the targets that we have in place. You combine that with the sales force buildout that we've put in place over the last 2-plus years, more storage sellers, more storage specialists. We've made progress in what we call the enterprise acquisition accounts. That business is growing nicely. So I'm optimistic that we have put the right plans together with the right portfolio, the right investments to grow our storage business at a differentiated rate to the marketplace. I'd circle back, we've largely done that in the last 2 years. We've taken 375 basis points of share. And over the 2-year period, we've largely grown the external storage business in a market that's slightly down.",345

Hey, Amit, what I said was our preliminary view is that operating income margins may trend closer to fiscal '19 levels. And principally, because as you think about -- and this will also depend obviously on what ultimately happens with the component cost environment. But right now, we expect it to be inflationary. We don't forecast free cash flow externally, I should say. We do forecast it internally, clearly. So look, it will be a function of -- free cash flow is always a function of profitability and working capital and other dynamics within the company. And so it's our job to optimize working capital. It's our job to optimize free cash flow. More importantly, you heard me say on the call that, hey, we're committed to the $1.5 billion -- essentially the $1.5 billion of debt pay-down in Q4 to get to the $5 billion target we've laid out. We've paid $3.5 billion of debt down so far year-to-date and that we're committed to the $4 billion of debt pay-down next year. And even as we run the sensitivities around that, given what we know today, that all looks within the framework of that we're comfortable with. So we'll continue to update you guys and give you further thinking on that as we come back at the end of Q4, but that's the framework we think of right now.",231

I wanted to go back to PCs. You indicated that the shortages from Intel are going to impact the current quarter. And then you talked a bit about, I don't know, perhaps lingering pressure in 2021. So I'm just kind of curious as to what you see the trajectory like. And do you expect -- I think HP just indicated they expect a bit of a pushout in terms of -- or continued, I guess, stronger demand than maybe one would have thought in the coming year because of some of the mix dynamics and pressure from Intel. I'm curious as to what you're seeing.",108

Let me at least try to give a couple of data points. One, and I think we've talked about this, we've largely mitigated the supply challenges to date, and we think our direct models allowed us to do that with the speed and flexibility that it gives us to adjust to the outputs out of the factory. Clearly, with what we said earlier, there's been a change in Q4, and we're dealing with that real time. History would suggest if we can't fulfill demand in the industry that we will see it spill over into the coming calendar year, particularly with Windows 10. We're roughly 2/3 through the refresh cycle. And to the point there's a delay with that, they're going to spill over into the following calendar year. Perhaps, maybe another way to say it is we think that elongates the cycle. We've talked about we think it spills over into the first half already. I think there's just another validation that it will spill over into the first half of next year given the continued or increasing challenges with Intel supply. So that's how we've certainly look at it. We're certainly dealing with the information that we have real time and making the adjustments accordingly.",209

So if we put aside products gross margin expansion and turn over to services, this is the second consecutive quarter of services gross margin being around 100 to 150 bps lower than where it was tracking last year through Q1 of this year. Can you just walk through the puts and takes on that line item and whether anything structurally has changed?",67

The only thing that -- and I don't have the data right in front of me. I would offer you a couple of comments. One is overall, we've seen actually good attach rate on our services offerings in general. And in fact the content rate on some of our products has increased. So we're pleased with that content rate. As we think about the margin dynamic, the comment I would offer you is principally whether we're putting a lot of that services profitability under the balance sheet that's getting -- building up the deferred revenue, so you'd have to think about -- of that dynamic. But there's nothing structurally that's happened in the business or how we're marketing or positioning the services that would call out any significant structural issue.",140

Two ways to think about it, I'll let you kind of answer it. Number one, in terms of the downshift in margins, is it -- what portion is this revenue or perhaps component pricing mix driven to drive that lower margin? Or another way to think about it would be segment-based, which would be how much of the margin degradation year-on-year is going to be ISG versus CSG versus other business.",100

We have been pretty vocal throughout this year, principally in the last couple of quarters on these calls, around the profitability profile of our CSG business in that it has trended higher than normal given some of the component cost deflation we've seen. And so a significant majority of the margin dynamic year-to-year, assuming that component costs move from deflation to inflation, which is the forecast that we have right now, will impact the profitability profile of our CSG business back towards historical norms. So I would think about most of that pressure being in -- that dynamic is a big driver of some of the profitability -- potential profitability shifts year-to-year. You have a little bit of that dynamic within the server because again, you got to think about which LOBs are more commodity cost sensitive in terms of pricing dynamics. And those 2 LOBs tend to be our most sensitive impact -- the ones that are impacted the most.",191

And Tom, I think you hit it, is if you look at the deflation in calendar '19, our model generally captures that more quickly and is advantaged when we have that deflation. And I think you see it, what was our beginning of the year expectations for profit. So we're repeating that, too, today. And as Tom said, we have a deflationary period coming, and those businesses will perform back towards their historical norms.",77

But wondering if you could back up and talk about the demand environment across other geographies around the world.

Let me -- I think the macro overhang is reasonably consistent, maybe slightly worse, but it didn't fall off the cliff or anything like that. But we are just seeing continued caution in the environment, continued softness in the environment. We've talked about it a couple of times, but principally in server, we have seen softness in large enterprise, slowness in procurement cycles -- elongation of procurement cycles, I should say. Critical projects are still getting done, but they seem to be taking longer from a procurement cycle. And I think that's just a function of sort of the macro dynamics that many companies see them -- are in, in the sense of trying to navigate what is a little bit of an uncertain macro political, economic environment right now. And so our perspective is there's a bit of caution out there that we're seeing. Our sales organizations are out there selling every day. So we've got the broadest reach in the marketplace. We are being disciplined on pricing. And so I'm not chasing and driving deals that just don't make economic sense to me over the long term. Though there is some level of that happening within our business.
As we step back and think about your question around G6 and thinking about the various geographic dynamics, we would tell you that in general, the U.S. remains reasonably healthy, right? Yes, there's some large -- there's some softness at large on the large enterprise procurement, in servers in particular, but our commercial North America business, our small and medium North American businesses are doing quite well. We're pleased with the progress. We have seen some softening in Europe, Western Europe in particular, in Q3. I think Japan continues to be strong for us. India continues to be reasonably strong. China's been soft, as we've talked about. Australia and New Zealand has been soft. And so -- and Brazil has been strong. So I mean if you just bounce around the globe and some of the major economies, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, which is, I think, the message we're trying to send you guys, which is it's a bit of a mixed bag.
Look, it's our job to navigate through all of that and drive the business forward, and I'm confident we'll do that. And that's the navigation that we had to get done here in Q4 on into next year. So I think from an overall positioning, I think we're well positioned. We've got the broadest product and solution portfolio in the market. Customer receptivity to our offerings is high. So it's a matter of us going out there and making sure that we're having the appropriate conversations with our customers every day and helping them drive to the outcomes that they desire.",472
