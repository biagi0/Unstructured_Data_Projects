During Q4, we spoke with many of you about creating a more efficient earnings process. Based on that feedback, we are condensing our prepared comments and expanding our web deck. In Q1, we will add a key topics document. These materials, along with our DellShares VLog, will be distributed well in advance of the call, and I encourage you to review them for additional perspective.
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please also note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margins, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted on the Investor Relations section at dell.com, and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now, I'll turn it over to Brian.",248
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2012",2012-02-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3277.0,275885.0,13654727.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. The fiscal year 2012 was a strong year with great financial results for Dell. We also made important progress towards our key strategic initiatives. To highlight a few key examples, we continue to enhance our enterprise solutions capabilities by adding important intellectual property from acquired companies like SecureWorks, Compellent and Force10. We improved the cost position, execution and profitability of our client business, building on the success of the past 2 years. We strategically invested in data center capacity and solution center capabilities around the world. And finally, we significantly increased the number of solutions sales specialists and increased our enterprise R&D spending. These investments have helped to reshape our business and will do so over the long term.
For the year, consolidated revenue was $62.1 billion, and we delivered a record $18.6 billion in enterprise solutions and services revenue. This business now represents 30% of revenue and almost 50% of gross margin dollars. Consolidated operating income was 7.1% of revenue for the year, which is right on our long-term target. And cash flow from operations was $5.5 billion, up 39%.
From here, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
Our full year results were in line with the outlook we provided in our November earnings call. In addition, at the beginning of the year we said we would grow operating income 6% to 12% and revenue 5% to 9%. Despite a challenging macro environment, we delivered 24% operating income growth and 1% growth in revenue.
We had record gross margin dollars, record operating income and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.13 per share, which was up 34%. While we're very pleased with our strategic progress and our total year financial results, we did expect to do a bit better. There were a few areas in the fourth quarter that negatively impacted our gross margins, and I want to address those now.
We called out the global hard drive situation as a challenge for the quarter, and while we were effective in shaping demand and pricing for hard drive cost increases, we were impacted by the available mix of drives. We prioritized high-end drives to relationship customers, resulting in a product mix that was less profitable than normal in Consumer and our after point-of-sale hard drive business. Second, we worked through the remaining inventory of our previous-generation phones, primarily impacting our Consumer business. And finally, our Public business growth was impacted by continued weakness in U.S. public spending, which did not improve during the quarter. This resulted in a more significant sequential decline and margin pressure than we would typically see in the business in the fourth quarter. These 3 areas combined negatively impacted us by about $100 million. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter P&L. Our key performance metrics and additional details are provided for your reference on Pages 8 and 9 in the web deck. We delivered revenue of $16 billion for the quarter, which represents growth of 2% and included a 14th week, which we estimate to be 3 percentage points of added growth. Our gross margins were 21.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year but down 140 basis points sequentially. Consistent with our views going into the quarter, we effectively managed operating expenses while continuing to fund strategic investments. For the quarter, OpEx declined 10 basis points sequentially to 14.6% of revenue.
Operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.1% of revenue. Interest and other expenses were $24 million, driven by a $45 million gain on the sale of an investment. Our tax rate was 18.4%, driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and tax benefits that we don't anticipate to repeat in FY '13.
Earnings per share declined 4% to $0.51 per share. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 36 days. Days receivable and days of inventory were flat relative to the third quarter. Days payable increased 5 days from the third quarter, primarily driven by the extra week that was in the fourth quarter.
We generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with $18.2 billion in cash and investments. We repurchased $561 million in stock in the fourth quarter and $2.7 billion or 178 million shares for the year. As we enter the fiscal 2013, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management, balancing cash needed for strategic investments and repurchase activities.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business, which you'll find detailed on Pages 13 through 18 of our deck. In the fourth quarter, we had record revenue in our enterprise solutions and services business of $4.9 billion. Dell Services revenue grew 12% to $2.2 billion while improving margins. The total value of new Services contracts signed is $1.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, and Services backlog increased 11% to $15.5 billion, led by contracted Services backlog growth of 13%. We're very pleased with the progress of our Services business as we head into FY '13.
Server and networking revenue increased 6%. Total storage declined 13% while Dell-owned IP storage growth accelerated 33% to $463 million, led by continued growth in all of our Dell IP categories including Compellent, which saw over 60% sequential revenue growth.
Our desktop revenue was up 3% while our notebook revenue was up 1%. Premium products gained share year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter. Revenue for our software and peripheral business declined 4% for the quarter to $2.6 billion. This continues to be an area where we'll see the effects of pruning the low-margin elements of the portfolio.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve to provide some background on our business unit and regional results.",946

I'll turn now to the segment level performance, which is detailed on Pages 20 through 23 of the web deck. Our commercial business approached $13 billion for the quarter, led by the strong performances in Large Enterprise and the Small and Medium business which were up collectively 5%, with sequential op inc growth of 6%.
Large Enterprise saw broad-based growth across both the client and enterprise solutions and services. Our Large Enterprise services revenue increased 18% as we continue to expand our vertical expertise and develop service solutions that are relevant to our customers' business needs. Overall demand continues to be softer in the U.S., but we did see good growth in both EMEA and APJ.
Public revenue was down slightly versus the prior year. Like last quarter, the primary drivers are the continued weakness in the U.S., Public and Western Europe sectors. For U.S. federal, we continue to see the slower spending pattern that we saw in Q3 after the government's fiscal year ended in September. Despite the overall revenue decline though, Services revenue increased 7% and our Dell IP storage revenue was up 32%, so these are good examples of our government customers utilizing Dell solutions to help drive productivity.
Small Medium business saw strong growth across all regions, including the U.S. Enterprise solutions and services performance hit an all-time high during the quarter, generating growth of 18%. SMB also delivered the highest growth in services across all segments at 28%.
The Consumer business delivered 2.7% op inc for the full year, in line with the expectations that we set one year ago but in the fourth quarter, results were mixed. Total revenue and margin weakness was largely concentrated in the U.S. market with a decline of 15%. We continued to see good progress on our high-end Consumer systems as our XPS notebook revenue increased 103% for the full year. So while we're disappointed in Q4 profitability, we're pleased with the overall progress made during fiscal year 2012 as the Consumer business grew op inc by $259 million versus the previous year.
Geographically, we saw 10% growth in our Asia-Pacific region during Q4, including 15% growth in China, while EMEA growth accelerated to 8% despite the challenging macroeconomic background. Growth countries continue to be a key driver as well, growing 8% in Q4 and finishing the year up 12%.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to discuss our outlook.",407
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2012",2012-02-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3277.0,275885.0,13654729.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Steve. But before we get to the outlook, let me just clarify our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion.
We're committed to executing our strategy and are encouraged by the progress we've made in the fiscal year '12 results. We're shifting the mix of the company's revenues and margin, and our enterprise solutions and services businesses now account for 30% of our revenue, up from 24% 3 years ago. We continue to make the necessary organic and inorganic investments to accelerate this progress. This will be the same play we run in fiscal year '13.
For the next fiscal year, we'll continue to focus on and prioritize operating income and cash flow as we make the necessary investments to reshape the company. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year '13 to exceed the record $2.13 we delivered in fiscal year '12.
We also expect to deliver strong cash flow again, with cash flow from operations exceeding our net income. With our primary objective continuing to be one of reshaping the company for the future, combined with today's more uncertain environment and our continued pruning activities, we're not providing a revenue outlook for the year. We feel this will allow us to focus both externally and internally on our key strategic priorities. We plan to update our longer-term outlook at our analyst meeting in June.
We're committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This past year, we allocated $2.7 billion to share repurchase, $2.6 billion to acquisitions in our Enterprise portfolio and increased our R&D and CapEx by over 30%, respectively. For fiscal year '13, we plan to allocate 10% to 30% of free cash flow to share repurchase, and we expect to spend approximately $700 million on capital expenses. We anticipate interest and other to average approximately $60 million a quarter and are projecting a full year tax rate between 19% and 21%.
For the first quarter and consistent with what you've heard from others in the industry, we're still seeing some uncertainty around the hard disk supply and pricing. We expect drive mix management to continue to be challenging, but not as impactful as in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate good customer receptivity to the launch of our 12th generation server line, which will occur in the first quarter.
Over the past 3 years, our first quarter revenue has averaged approximately a 4% sequential decline. When normalized for the 14th week, this decline is closer to 7%. We expect our first quarter revenue to be approximately in line with this adjusted historical decline.
Before we take questions, let me close with a few summary points. We remain fully committed to our strategy. Our FY '12 financial results were excellent and we delivered record revenue, op income and earnings per share. There are a few areas we'd like to improve on from our fourth quarter results, and our fourth -- our fiscal year '13 outlook calls for continued mix shift to enterprise solutions and services and a continued commitment to key investments in this area. And finally, we expect to see year-over-year growth in earnings per share.
Now let me turn it over to Rob to get the Q&A started.",537

I'm still struggling a little bit on the forces at work on gross margin. I would've thought that pruning your software and peripherals portfolio would have helped the margins on a sequential basis in the quarter. I would have thought DRAM pricing, which was down strongly, would have helped margins in the quarter, yet margins were down 140 basis points sequentially on higher volumes, suggesting that x those other factors, maybe they were down 200 basis points. I struggle with, given that Consumer is only 20% of the mix, that hard drives could have that dramatic an impact. So maybe you can go through each of the 3 reasons you cited and attribute or maybe refute the notion that pruning and other components were not of help, but I'm still struggling with why the gross margins were down so much.",149
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2012",2012-02-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3277.0,275885.0,13654733.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,8,"Yes, Tony. I think the points you raised are all correct. I think those are things that would've contributed to positive momentum on gross margins. We clearly talked about coming into the quarter some of the concerns we had around margins. And talking about the 3 items that we raised for hard disks, we had uncertainty coming into the quarter. We had significant inflation that came from the hard disk situation. We did effectively raise prices to offset that. And the teams did a great job of getting supply to support the demand that we had, but we just didn't get the mix of drives that we wanted, and it really forced us to sell lower or less configured, lower-end systems and prevented us from accessing higher-margin, more highly configured systems. That played out across the portfolio, but especially in Consumer. And also I would say within our aftermarket sales of hard disks was in the S&P business. So that's the one dynamic that I think we didn't fully understand coming into the quarter what that mix was going to do to us. On the mobility side, we talked about -- we wrote off previous generation phones. That was about a $25 million impact in the quarter, quarter-on-quarter. And that is something that we would say is behind us now. And then on the Public side, clearly talked about the weakened demand that we saw after the federal year end in the U.S. especially, there was weaker demand. And I would say we saw a bigger sequential decline in that business, which had a mix impact. But also I would say it was a more competitive environment within Public, and in some cases market pricing was more aggressive, and we participated in parts of that and that had an impact as well. So those are 3 big things that I would call out. It's about $100 million, you could say 70 basis points of gross margin. And there were other moving pieces as you look at other commodity prices and other dynamics in the quarter.",345

You -- at your Analyst Day last year, you articulated a longer-term model 5% to 7% revenue growth. I think x the 53rd week this year, you were about flat. It sounds like given the way that you've given guidance for fiscal '13, you're really not anticipating revenue growth again this year. I was wondering and I realize you're going to address this at your Analyst Day, but if that was truly meant to be longer-term guidance and you seem hesitant to reiterate it, what has fundamentally changed about either the competitive environment or about Dell's approach to the business that makes you less confident about talking about that as a longer-term goal and also obviously, and delivering against it in fiscal '12 and fiscal '13?",131

I think clearly, it's a different demand environment and there's more uncertainty as you look at things like Europe, as you look at some of the demand dynamics we've seen over the past year, that's number one. I think in addition to that we've been more aggressive, I think, in pruning. And I think that, to some extent, will continue for some period of time. And by not giving you a real revenue outlook for the year, I think it gives us an ability to make the right decisions for the long term, continue this transformation, make the investments we need and not get so fixated on trying to deliver a specific revenue commitment.",131

Software obviously is playing an increasingly important role in the industry. And we've made a number of acquisitions around software, in systems management with KACE and cloud integration with Boomi, and infrastructure virtualization and orchestration with Scalent. And I think you'll see others as well fitting within a very similar framework that we've used in the past. John Swington [ph] is joining the company to lead this group for us. And we see a lot of opportunity in close adjacencies, we've got a lot of success with a number of the acquisitions that have been software-related and believe there is significant opportunity for us to build a big business here. Don't really have any revenue projections for you at this stage but clearly it's a significant opportunity for us, and we're thrilled to have John joining the Dell team.",140

Just trying to get a sense here in terms of the sales and marketing and the R&D dynamics as we look to 2013. Obviously feels the marketing was a big push this past year, and it definitely supported your enterprise solutions growth, but we -- I just want to get a better sense here as we continue to hear more and more about the non-PC part of the business. Do you guys have the flexibility to maybe pull back on sales and marketing now, maybe to drop some of that to the bottom line, 2013 and then maybe reallocate some of it to R&D to kind of support the software buildout and the other non-PC buildouts?",124

We did do a lot of investing. We had a lot of specialists. We added a lot to our obvious -- our capabilities with some of the acquisitions we've done. And towards the end of this year, we already started to communicate that we felt we had added the investment that we could now grow into that in a productive way. So you will see going forward a return to a more disciplined approach to the investment and to have the OpEx match the revenue. We think we have the resources in place to support some growth, especially in the solutions and enterprise areas and that's really where we focused the investments. So yes, you definitely won't -- you won't see the same kind of growth that you saw last year in the operating expense.",139

There were clearly cost increases that we absorbed. As you think about the quarter, we had an order of magnitude of about $150 million of inflation from hard disk costs, and that was pretty consistent probably with what the market saw. I'm not going to provide specific details of the commitments that we made. I think some of that's probably competitive information. But that sort of dynamic. And our hope is as we look at the situation over the next couple of quarters that this is going to remain a bit challenging probably for the next 2 quarters and begin to ease as we head into the second half.

And the reason is that the gains in processor and the combination effect of what's going on in I/O and solid-state, flash, the 10-gig Romley, this is all allowing for much more intense virtualization loads. So we're super excited about our 12G server launch, which is coming in the first quarter. Obviously, virtualization is a big deal. We're simplifying systems management, really going after the bigger workloads and accelerating the movement of work from minicomputer and mainframe environments onto our 12G platforms. We also believe that Romley will help us more tightly drive a synergy with our recent Force10 acquisition. And so we've done a lot with flash, with solid-state inside 12G. Stay tuned for the announcements, but we're very excited and believe it's going to be another strong year for server, storage and networking. Remember, we're kind of changing the wholesale from being an individual product to effectively selling the entire data center.",170

So let's say you end up being about flat, could we assume then -- could be -- we would like to understand how much that you are putting out that, that delta, if you're seeing the industry that way, is actually that 3% or 4% growth that the industry is getting that you're not?",99

I think as you think about the first quarter, I mean, we're just naturally calling the historical sequential first quarter versus fourth quarter dynamics adjusted for the 14th week. Yes, I think what I would say is as you look at the revenue dynamics and how we see demand for the year, I think the first half is going to be probably more challenging than second half, and we would expect demand to be a bit better as we move throughout the year.

We have -- we've seen great growth in SMB. Obviously, we have a strong channel there. There's obviously some rebalancing as we position Compellent more to the higher end. But the whole thing, as you said, 33% growth year-over-year is strong. We're -- 93% of our revenue now is our own IP, so we're pretty much through the transition and believe we can grow this business quite nicely. But it is a competitive environment.

As you think about regionally in the quarter, obviously Asia-Pacific was the fastest growing market. We were up 10%, EMEA was up 8%, which is clearly faster than the market, and then Americas driven by the U.S. was down and down 3%. For the total year, APJ was up 15%, EMEA was up 4% and Americas was down 4%. So that's the regional dynamics. I think when you look at the product lines or the segment performance, clearly on the corporate side between Large Enterprise and SMB, we saw solid growth and year-over-year was up 6% for SMB and up 5% for Large Enterprise, and both of those were up mid single-digits for the year. So those are the fundamental numbers. Maybe Steve can give you some color.",156

The -- in Europe, I would say, we are seeing some definite growth ahead of what appears to be market conditions, so I'm really pleased with what's going on in Europe. It's a good case where if we run the strategy right, we're gaining both unit share and revenue share while our profit is accretive, both on a percentage basis and a dollar growth basis, so that's really a strong story. In Asia, we're also seeing some similar dynamics. So it really is limited to a few sectors like the U.S. federal or some of the larger government entities in Western Europe where we see the biggest headwinds. On the Consumer side, we're seeing pretty healthy growth in most parts of the world. The hard drive rebalancing did get in the way in the U.S. So we probably could've grown more but to add a little color to this, when we get the mix of drives, we have a series of customers that have a set contract with us that has a certain configuration. And we fill that -- those demands -- that need first. So it's really the transactional side of the business and even part of Tony's question, Consumer is completely transactional but we have a lot of business within our small business and our large corporate, even pieces of that, that are more transactional. In other words, it's really demand that comes in that day where it's not under a contract. That's where we had to shape the drives, and we would normally sell a higher mix of capacity into those if we had access to that. And that's what impacted both the Consumer business from a demand and a margin basis in the U.S. As a good example, we don't want to put a 350-gig drive on an XPS computer because it's going to have a bad experience for the customer. So it limited our ability of what mix we could sell. So that impacted demand a little bit, and I think we'll see that continue to improve as each quarter goes by where we have more visibility to the mix of the drives we're going to be seeing.",371

Pretty excited about Windows 8 and the effect that'll have on demand. First with Consumer but then falling pretty rapidly, there's a pretty strong appetite for a Windows tablet in enterprise, with the security and compatibility that customers kind of expect. On the server side, we've been experimenting with ARM now for, I'd say it's more than one year. The challenge is really in the software stack. It's maturing, there's the LAMP stack which is the obvious place to start. Competition isn't standing still there, and more competition there is certainly a good thing. And there's -- some interesting opportunities emerging, but I think x86 still has an enormous lead in that space.",148

There's pockets of aggressiveness, but I wouldn't call it broad-based. There is one concern that we've expressed over the last couple of quarters where some of our competitors have been long in inventory, and so we've seen older models get somewhat aggressive and we've had to back off and let that flush its way through. We saw a little bit of that this quarter. I know we've been able to successfully pass through the hard drive cost increases, and we still feel like we're in a good competitive position.

You guys can do the math in terms of 10% to 30% buyback on a cash flow generation number for this coming year and figure that out. I think we've given you a sense for tax rate being about the same year-over-year, and we've given you interest and other.

And then the follow-up question for me would be on the storage side, obviously, you're burning through, and I would assume that you're pretty much all the way through the legacy EMC business.

And we had strong -- we had good growth year-over-year as well in EqualLogic. So it picked up, but we talked about some of the challenges during the summer and even after the third quarter.

On gross margins, your gross margin if I net out that $100 million force, we're still down about 70 basis points sequentially to -- call it the mid-22s. If I think about your comments to previous questions, is that the right benchmark as we look to the April -- potential April gross margins? And if you could just talk a little bit about, will margins be flat, down or up at least directionally and what the forces are that persist there, because HDDs will be there, you've already commented on that, but I'm just trying to understand the benchmark relative to say, the mid-22s that you report in January versus what you might have in April.",122

We've been talking about that for a while, and we can start to show you -- actually, that's happening. And that's the primary driver.

I think Steve, you mentioned OpEx wouldn't grow at the same level going forward for the next year. Could OpEx actually come down for any reason? Or do you -- is Dell in the stage -- or maybe this is for Michael as well, or you have to invest just to execute on this enterprise strategy? And then on the issue of gross margins going forward, has anything changed in the pricing environment on the server side for all going forward? I think you benefited just from a beneficial mix shift in servers over the last year. I'm trying to see if there's any risk around that. And then finally after seeing them on the comments about this, then in terms of lower-margin businesses you want to prune, is there a dollar number you can help us think about? Is it $5 billion?

I'll kick it off on the OpEx. I mean, I think there will be places clearly where we continue to invest. We've been investing in solutions and services and adding solutions headcount in both the R&D side as well as sales specialists. We'll continue to do that. We will continue to invest in the acquisitions that we've done and in those acquisitions that we do going forward to build out capabilities there. I think there are still opportunities to reduce OpEx in other parts of the business, and I think you've seen us do that as we've looked at a weaker demand environment over the last couple of quarters.

The key thing is that we're starting to see the productivity benefits of the investments we made. And I think if you look at the year in balance, we clearly did the right thing in investing in the business. That's what's driving the higher margins is our ability to sell a higher mix and a higher solution set.

We can measure where we've added services content to the sale. We can look at the revenue productivity per specialist. So we've got a number of metrics that we're pretty maniacally focused on.

It seems to me that still, commodity hardware represents a majority of the company's revenue and that's been the case for obviously the past couple of years as we really try to move the strategic revenue sources. Can you discuss a little bit about how this is -- how we're going to see some of the trends that we've seen in storage and your networking as well as your Software business going forward as we transition to more Dell-owned IP and stop the resell of third party? And then the follow-up question is could you give us the unit number as well?",153

Just on the third-party storage, on the total year, that was down about 64%. We still have some more work to do there as you move into the first quarter. It was down in the fourth quarter 83%, and there's still a fair amount from a comparison standpoint in prior-year first quarter results. So as we head into the second half of the year, we're pretty comfortable that we'll be completely through that probably even into the second quarter, and we'll have overall storage business begin to move forward in a growth mode. As you think about that model, it's really almost the same exact framework we would expect to see in the networking business. And as that gets to a scale that's larger, we'll begin to give you a little more visibility to that and probably in the Analyst Meeting as well.",145

I would just add that the focus is clearly on continuing to add Dell Intellectual Property that we think is disruptive and that can provide real value for our customers. So if you look at this past year, there's a lot of clear indications of that in SecureWorks, in Compellent and in some of the other acquisitions that we made, Force10 and then the integration of things like Ocarina, an excellent add into our storage portfolio. So yes, no question that we're going to continue to be in the end-user computing business for the foreseeable future and a long time to come, and it's a great business to be in, if we can grow it appropriately and attach the services and kind of drive that business appropriately, so that's kind of how we're thinking about it.",138

I think your math is right. I think given everything we see right now as we head into the year, that's the number that we're calling. And I think as we move throughout the year and things become a little bit more certain around the demand environment, around where we are in the investments we need to make, we'll obviously give you little more clarity on that.

Just maybe one final follow-up, if I could. In terms of capital allocation, you talked about buybacks at 10% to 30% of cash flow. You talked about CapEx for the year. Can you say whether Dell is more seriously considering the issuance of a dividend? And if not, what are the key arguments against the dividend as you talk about this option with your board, given the company is generating a lot of cash? It's pretty consistent, and you're sitting on a large pile of cash as well.",90

Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statements in our press release and web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please also note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures during -- including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section of dell.com and in our press release and 8-K filed today.

While we continue to make strong progress in the transformation of the company, our first quarter results were mixed, and we fell short of our own expectations. There were some areas where our execution was not as expected, and there also are some market dynamics that created some headwinds for us. We want to be clear that we remain committed to our strategy, and we want to acknowledge that our progress will not always be linear. 
Our commitment to build a broader set of end-to-end solutions and shift the mix of our business continues to be our top priority, and we're making progress. Our mix of enterprise solutions and services is now 50% of our margin and 31% of our revenue. Dell-owned IP storage, which is a key component of our enterprise solutions and an area where we made significant investment, grew at 24%. And we've announced 5 and closed 3 acquisitions year-to-date, all of which will help drive higher value mix and more predictable revenue and marginal -- margin streams going forward. Specifically, the acquisitions of SonicWALL and AppAssure further enhance our portfolio of Dell security and software solutions. 
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $14.4 billion, down 4%. This was below our outlook. There are a few key causes to the shortfall. Our sales execution was not up to our expectations, and we've made changes to improve this as we head into the second quarter. Additionally, the demand environment was tougher than we planned, and I'd specifically highlight weaker demand in markets like EMEA and parts of Asia, in addition to public markets. Finally, we're seeing a more challenging competitive environment in a few areas of the business. We'll address these items in more detail in a moment. 
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22%, up 30 basis points sequentially. While we saw improved enterprise solutions and services margins and mix and a sequential business shift from consumer to commercial, margins were impacted by a tougher pricing environment in client products. OpEx was down $183 million sequentially, driven by one less week in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, combined with reductions in G&A and sales compensation. 
Operating income was $1 billion or 7% of revenue. Cash flow from operations was a negative $138 million. While Q1 is normally a seasonal low for cash flow, the sequential revenue decline, coupled with a 14th week in Q4, negatively impacted our accounts payable balance in the quarter. Our trailing 12-month cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, up 17%. We allocated $300 million of capital to repurchase 17 million shares of Dell's stock and ended the quarter with $17.2 billion in cash and investments. 
Turning to our lines of business. Servers and networking grew by 2%, as we saw the typical pause in server purchases ahead of the launch of our next-generation servers. The initial demand for the products is tracking ahead of our plans, and the pipeline is strong heading into the second quarter. We're seeing good traction in our networking business, as PowerConnect revenue was up 46% year-over-year and Force10 increased 69% sequentially. Dell IP Storage was up 24% to $423 million, as the Compellent pipeline continues to strengthen and EqualLogic grew at 14%. Total storage declined 8%, as third-party storage now represents less than 5% of our storage business. 
Our notebook business contracted 10%, as we saw a more aggressive competitive environment, particularly in the entry level and emerging markets. We believe some of the tougher competitive environment can be attributed to channel inventory rebuilding, following the hard disk issues of the past 2 quarters. In addition, we're seeing more consumer IT spending diverted to alternative mobile computing devices. These dynamics impacted both our revenue and margins for the quarter. In the short term, we believe our client business is well positioned on cost, and we'll focus our efforts on growth on higher-margin, higher-value segments, with a priority on profit over unit share. 
The services business continues to be a highlight. The business grew 4% to $2.1 billion, driven by 8% growth in support and deployment. The security business was up 31%, driven by our SecureWorks acquisition. Operating margins are up as we continue to improve our cost structure and increase our attach rates of premium support and deployment services. 
Revenue for our software and peripheral business declined 7% for the quarter to $2.4 billion. Consistent with our prior commentary, this continues to be an area where we'll see pruning of the nonstrategic elements of the portfolio. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that at the beginning of the fiscal year, we realigned some customers between business units, with the biggest impact in SMB and Consumer. The details behind this change are included in Slide 19 in the web deck and the tables in our press release. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve.",822
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 22, 2012",2012-05-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3232.0,312255.0,15232704.0,Presenter Speech,Stephen Felice,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. Before I get into the results by business unit, I want to provide a more detailed view of factors which impacted Q1 results, as well as some proof points supporting progress in our transformation. We believe these changes will position us for long-term success. 
Let's start with sales force productivity, where execution was below our expectations and impacted our Q1 results. As you all know, we took action last year to accelerate our transformation by hiring sales specialists to focus on our enterprise business solutions. While we've seen progress here, we still have more to do to improve our sales execution. Exiting the quarter, we've made some modifications to our selling model that will improve results going forward. 
First of all, we've moved sales resources to better optimize coverage within specific customer sets and geographies. In addition to that, we're increasing our focus on integrated solution offerings rather than overspecializing on specific products and emphasizing a strong focus on our servers, storage and notebook products. We implemented many of these changes headed into Q2 as we substantially completed the consolidation of our global sales and marketing organizations, and we're confident these actions will improve our sales execution as we move through the year. 
Now looking externally, the environment remains challenging. Consumer spending on desktops and notebooks continues to be under pressure, and much of the growth in Consumer has migrated to entry-level products in emerging markets, where we've chosen not to participate. We're also seeing some IT spending prioritized to purchase other mobile devices. Now this is mostly a consumer dynamic, but there is clearly some impact in areas of commercial as well. 
Growth markets were flat despite growth in China of 9%. We navigated these emerging markets more cautiously in Q1, and we're optimizing for profit given the economic uncertainty. Now there are also many positive indicators that our strategy to deliver converged and easy-to-manage solutions to our customers is gaining traction. Our enterprise solutions and services growth, excluding EMC, was 5%, and several products are growing at rates faster than the market. 
We're also seeing a strong response to our next-generation servers. The mix of these servers was over 25% exiting the quarter. We're seeing strong momentum in many of our acquired technologies, like Compellent and Force10, where we've added almost 1,000 new customers during the quarter. 
And our service business continues to show strength and is building a good pipeline and signing new business that should position us well going forward. Our new signings for the trailing 12 months was $1.8 billion, which is up almost 80%, and our services backlog was up 9%. 
Now I'd like to turn to our business unit results. Large Enterprise revenue was down 3%, driven by developed markets, which declined 6%. We see a good pipeline here but some customers are delaying their IT spending. Public continues to see spending pressure and was down 4%. We are starting to see improvements in U.S. federal spending, but our K-12 and health care businesses were lower than expected. 
SMB revenue was up 4%, driven by enterprise service and solution growth of 17%. SMB continues to be a solid business for us, given our scalable-solutions focus and strong relationships with these customers. The growth was broad-based geographically, as all 3 regions grew, which was led by APJ, up 10%. 
In total, for these 3 commercial businesses, we saw gross margins increase sequentially and overall operating income was at 9.3%. The Consumer business was our biggest challenge in the quarter, with Consumer notebook revenue down 15% as we limited our participation in the profit-challenged entry-level systems. On the channel front, we expanded to over 103,000 channel partners in Q1. These partners are becoming increasingly important as we provide a broader set of converged solutions on a global basis. And finally, we are confident that we are positioning ourselves well for profitable growth, and we believe the recent changes we've made in our global go-to-market processes and organization model will position us better for execution in the coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Brian to discuss the outlook.",687

Despite the good progress we're making with our enterprise solutions and services, our overall revenue performance wasn't where it needed to be in the first quarter. As Steve said, we're confident that we have action plans in place to fix our execution and improve our top line growth as we move through the year. 
In addition, the investments we've made position us well as we strengthen our execution. While we believe spending has been delayed in some areas, we have a healthy pipeline of business and expect to gain growth momentum as the year progresses. We do have concerns about the impact of the competitive pricing environment. We'll continue to monitor these dynamics and adjust our tactics to optimize operating income and cash flow for the company based on how this -- how the market plays out. 
While we're not off to the start we expected for the year, it's too early in the year to adjust our FY '13 EPS outlook. We intend to provide an update on the total year outlook during our second quarter earnings call in August. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in line with normal seasonality of a sequential increase of 2% to 4%, mostly driven by our public business seasonality. 
Before we take questions, let me close with a few summary points. We're fully committed to our strategy, and we'll continue to make investments in building end-to-end solutions capability. This is a long-term strategy and will take time. We're making progress and have several areas where our results are strong, proof points that our strategy's working. And we look forward to providing a more detailed strategic update in our upcoming investor analyst meeting in 3 weeks.

I think we're building off of the first quarter run rate. I think to some extent, we've seen some of that pause, it's already in the run rate.

Enterprise solutions and services is obviously higher margin. Services margins were up in the quarter sequentially. Both of those things were good. HDD issues generally worked through the quarter, and we've gotten supply, so that's generally behind us. Commodity inflation, deflation was about what we expected. There was slight deflation in the quarter. But the thing that we would call out was really the notebook pricing dynamics that we saw in the quarter and some mix within notebooks. So I'm not going to provide a detailed walk of that in terms of quantifying it, but that's sort of what we're seeing going on within gross margin. Steve, you want to...",134

That's where we saw a pretty heavy price competitive dynamic. And we backed off, and you saw our growth slowed down there. We feel like we're in good cost position overall. There are certain price bands where we don't participate as strongly in, and those lower price products moved pretty heavily throughout China and Asia. We also feel like there was a bit of a channel sell-in that took place, so there was a lot of competing for shelf space that we didn't think was healthy. And so that put some margin pressure on. So I think we're going to watch this carefully over the next quarter. But I don't think what we saw in the first quarter was -- is really something that's sustainable at an industry-wide level.",155

First, let me say that we're trying to move as quickly as possible in this transformation. And in trying to accelerate the transformation, it requires a level of complexity in adding a number of specialists and figuring out where the right coverage models are and in figuring out the right solutions that we choose to sell. And so the changes are refinements. As we put this business together this quarter, we noticed we got out of position in a couple of areas. One is, I'm not going to get specific on which customer sets, but we found ourselves lacking coverage in certain customer sets that we normally excel in, and so we are reallocating resources. A lot of that happened in Q1, is going to continue in Q2 probably for the next few quarters, but we got a lot of that underway. A second change is really simplifying the bundling of solutions. So I mentioned this in my comments. We -- with all of the new capability, we were tending to sell things on a single-product basis, as opposed to a more bundled solution. It was spreading our resources a bit too thin and not taking advantage of the true solution capability that we have. So we've done a better job coming out of the gate this quarter in having smarter bundles that take advantage of the core products we have in server, storage and notebooks but build around them the terrific IP that we've acquired in a number of the acquisitions we've done.",258

And then, my follow-up was with regard to Windows 8 and Romley. What -- it sounds like servers are off to a good start. If you could be more specific, how much is due to the Romley cycle? And what are your expectations for Windows 8? And when does that kick in, too, if we follow the sequential improvement pattern?",61

We're seeing, I think, very good initial demand for our 12th generation PowerEdge, and we were first to market with those products and feel that the product line is incredibly strong. We exited the quarter with the 12th generation being a little over 25% of the server business, so it's off to a strong start. I think the benefits of this generation in terms of 10-gig ethernet and all the performance characteristics, the larger memory footprints going into bigger workloads, give us lots of opportunity to grow that. We're also seeing a strong adoption of our networking architecture with that as well. As Steve mentioned, we're kind of changing the sale here from server to converged sale of server, storage, networking and kind of software and services that go around that to support it. Windows 8, obviously, we're totally lined up around the launch of Windows 8. We don't see -- corporations are still adopting Windows 7, so we don't think there'll be a massive adoption of Windows 8 by corporations early on. But certainly, the addition of capacitive touch capability into Windows 8, we think, will be a welcome addition and will have a full complement of products at time of launch.",206

We had kind of come into the quarter and seen a bit of a lull in the first couple of months, and we're looking at pipelines that were pretty strong for April that really just didn't materialize and saw some things specifically push. We feel, as we sit here today, the pipelines look pretty good. We talked about that in the comments heading into the second quarter, and that gives us some confidence that we would expect to see the sequential improvement that we would normally expect.",97

Steve can talk a little bit more about it. I think we've been focused on mid-priced, higher-priced kind of products, higher-value segments for a while. I think we'll continue to do that. There are parts of the business where that will force us probably to walk away and prune more revenue than we probably thought coming into the year given the dynamics that we're seeing.",87

The price bands and the products that are attractive to us still make up half the market. In some parts of the world, they make up 2/3 of the market. And so there's going to be a time where the compares are going to not include a lot of low-end product that we're not emphasizing. For example, in this past quarter, our XPS line sold very well. It was up 33%. But it's still a smaller portion of our total, but it's growing in mix on a regular basis. And so at some point, we think that line will be the predominant line for us. We analyze the cost structure all the time, and like I said earlier, we think we're in good cost position. I remember a few years ago, people hitting us with the same thing when Acer was pushing hard, and we said we were going to be disciplined because we didn't think they could sustain what they were doing, and we saw what happened to them. So we're not going to overreact in one quarter. We'll continue to look at the pricing dynamics and our cost structure, and we'll make sure we're competitive in the areas we want to be competitive.",206

It was down 10% in notebooks. Your margins were materially pressured, and you had to walk away from a bunch of business. That feels like a pretty sobering market and market situation. I'd like you to comment on whether the PC market is evolving in a less attractive way than you had thought 1 or 2 years ago and what you think about is realistically the normalized revenue growth for the market in clients, and what the normalized revenue growth we should think about for Dell. I would presume it would be lower, given that you have said that you may want to continue to walk away from parts of the market.",133

And as we've talked about on the call, clearly, some of that is alternative mobile devices that I would argue is a relatively new dynamic affecting the business over that period of time. That said, I mean, again, as Steve said, there are still opportunities for us to find growth here. We see it as an attractive business. It's still generating good margins, very good margins, for us, and we think we could continue to do that. There will be some pruning that continues in that business as we focus on higher-profit parts of the business.",134

But where we play strongly in, there's still an indication from the customers that they continue to stay on the course they're on. And our biz client products are very profitable. I think we really probably should limit that more on the Consumer side where we did see a lot more margin pressure and a lot more operating income pressure. But the business client product side of the business was very healthy. That's more of a near-term growth issue, and we do see that being more acute than systemic.",125

Clearly, in OpEx, you're going to be adding some higher gross margin but higher OpEx businesses in the form of your recent acquisitions. Should we be expecting OpEx to continue to go up? Or do you feel you have -- in dollar terms or in percentage of revenue terms, do you feel you have plans to offset that? And similarly, on the component side, I can't help thinking that if you believe that HDDs have largely come in a supply balance and DRAM pricing looks like it's more likely to go up than down, should we be thinking about pressure on your total BOM going forward over the next couple of quarters?",144

If you look at this quarter in terms of the demand environment and what happened to revenue, we were pretty disciplined in terms of managing through that. We are still shifting dollars and making investments in important parts of the business. R&D spending is up, and that will continue. Some of the sales investments will probably moderate in this environment as we make some of these changes. But I think what I would say is you can count on us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage OpEx without giving specific outlook on that. In terms of component pricing, I think it's a mixed bag. It's -- we've expected, as I think we've said in the first quarter or in the -- at the end of the fourth quarter, that memory and displays would probably be increasing in the second half of the year. I think we still believe that. Our outlook would have memory increasing in the second quarter and the third quarter and probably coming back down in the fourth and displays, similar. As we've also talked about hard disks, we would expect to start seeing some deflation as we move throughout the year. So not a lot of change in our outlook in terms of component prices. I would tell you in aggregate, probably a little more favorable for the year than what we would've expected 3 months ago if you put all that together.",260

What gives you the confidence that this isn't just the market not embracing sales solution versus this being sales execution-related?

Actually, I'm very confident in this question in the -- our ability to sell solutions because really, what I would say if we look back this past quarter, I think where we stumbled a little bit on execution was on transactional selling. The solutions selling was strong. We probably -- I don't have an exact number but just looking at what happened during the quarter, the number of offers we had that included servers and storage and networking and services was up quite a bit. What I talk about, the coverage, I think we over-indexed a little bit on where we put all the specialists. In other words, too many geographies, we had -- we probably saturated the place and then, left some places uncovered. Same thing with certain customer sets. So we're balancing that. We've added quite a bit of capability, and we just have refining to do as we roll that out. But the actual ability to sell solutions is improving as each quarter goes by.",169

And then, Brian, I guess, why not reduce the full year EPS outlook given the disappointing Q1, the tough pricing environment, which could linger, and the sales execution changes that sound like they're going to take time to play out?

Look, I think based on the quarter, there's clearly pressure to the total year outlook. For us to get to the outlook, it's going to require improved sales execution. It will probably require a bit of market improvement in the second half, but that's what most of the industry forecast would say right now. We'll need better revenue growth and good discipline around costs and gross margins.

And I think we would build a view for the rest of the year that assumes that's going to happen and continues to provide some tailwind on gross margins.

There are still areas where we're building scale in some of the acquired assets, and you should see gross margins continue to expand there. I think as we move through some of the next generation products here, we would also expect some of those enterprise solutions to have higher margins.

With the revenue disappointment, we'll assume that if that were a significant portion of it, that we would actually see margins a little bit better than 7% on a pro forma operating basis. Then I've got a follow-up as well.",92

Clearly, in the software and peripherals business, that was down 7% in the quarter. As we've said a couple of times, that's probably the biggest area where you'll continue to see us do that. Some of that, to be honest, as we acquire IP and build our own intellectual property, there are parts of that business where we want to sell our own stuff that's going to have much higher margins. There are other parts of the business that will continue to be unattractive in the grand scale of the overall portfolio that will continue to shrink. I think the second one is really in the Consumer business. And if you think about the overall growth that we saw there or the lack of growth was really driven by us making conscious decisions not to participate in business. So I would isolate those 2 areas in terms of the big impact on revenue.",172

And then, with respect to the pace of M&A going forward, is it safe to assume that we should expect that to slow down a little bit here? And if so, kind of the similar size deals going forward?",40

Not really going to provide an outlook in terms of M&A activity. As you think about over the last 3 years, we've had a relatively steady pace of activity there, and I think that's -- clearly, one of the elements of our growth strategy will be to continue to do that. But we feel good about the 5 that we announced in the quarter, and we've closed 3 of those thus far. We have 2 more, and we think they're very, very good and additive to the portfolio.",89

I appreciate you're not providing full year guidance anymore. But can you just on a high-level -- or maybe Michael could speak about half-over-half drivers. I get the server business seeing a refresh. You guys don't seem too convinced about Windows 8 having a meaningful impact immediately at least this fiscal year. Is there an impact of acquisitions that you're  counting on? I'm just trying to understand what can really change the second half apart from a better macro and server business for you guys?,97
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 22, 2012",2012-05-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3232.0,312255.0,15232761.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,60,"Yes, look, I think the combined impact of the 5 acquisitions that we've announced is relatively small. For the total year, it probably contributes in the order of 1% growth in revenue, that clearly, assuming we can close the deals, will happen and contribute. The server business, we should see a pickup as a result of the launch of the next-generation products, and we would expect to see that move into the second quarter. I think other than that, clearly, there's Windows 8 dynamic, but that's much more of a Consumer business impact relatively late in the year but won't necessarily impact our overall commercial business.",106

I guess just one thing on the whole sales force productivity and everything else that you guys are trying to push through and maybe a question for Michael.

I mean, I think there are parts of our cost structure that clearly are variable. In a lower-revenue environment, clearly, we had variable sales compensation that was impacted in the quarter and that shows up. I think there are other places where we're clearly going to stick to the strategy and continue to make investments that drive the long-term transformation of the business.",71

I mean, we do see productivity potential on a per-sales maker  basis that we will leverage throughout the year, so we believe they underperformed to their capacity this quarter. So we're not expecting to have to add to get to this revenue growth. We think we can leverage the resources we have if we better utilize them and put -- from the points I made earlier.",68

The SMB revenue and operating margin held up fairly well relative to the other segments. The question really is, is this a function of Dell maybe having greater early success with your value-add solution sale? And if this is the case, how long will it take to replicate in the Larger Enterprise business or Public?",63
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 22, 2012",2012-05-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3232.0,312255.0,15232769.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,68,"Well, you hit it on the head, I believe. I mean, if you really look at this, the amount of complexity and change has probably been the least in the SMB space because the sales motion is simpler. Even when you're selling a more sophisticated solution, you're usually dealing with one person on the other end of the selling chain here. So it's typically a one-to-one relationship and you bring experts in as required. As we move into these much larger spaces, it's definitely a longer sales cycle. You're dealing with more constituents, it's a longer process. And I think we're still feeling our way through that. And so that's why we do have confidence that what we're building here is definitely scalable. We just got to get refinement in it to make sure we're doing it the right way.",140

And the results clearly point to that, and if you look at the enterprise solutions and services and SMB, we're up 17%. It was led by services, which were up 23% in SMB, and we're bolstering the kind of offerings that those customers will latch onto quickly in backup, replication, network security with the SonicWALL acquisition. So we're feeling confident in our ability to expand that part of the business.",71

And then, my follow-up is really just around the Large Enterprise commentary earlier, Brian, in terms of the delayed IT spending that you talked about or deferrals. Can you provide us some more details just on the timing? When does this manifest? Was that just in the month of April and is that continuing? And what's kind of the breadth? I mean, is this just targeting PCs? Or is it servers, networking, security, even outside of your own business, are you hearing about other parts of software being impacted as well?",92

And the reason we said that was because we did see healthy pipeline building going on throughout the quarter and then, we did see it slip. So as the quarter went by, so yes, in April, we thought we would convert a lot more business. But we did see it slip, but we didn't see the pipelines go away. The pipelines remain healthy. And we have lots of anecdotes of customers just saying they're cautious, they're trying to spread out their budget and things like that. So we had enough evidence of that to feel like this is a bit of a pattern going on. The pipeline remains healthy. We are seeing some conversion happen, so these things aren't going away, and that's why we're trying to be patient here. It did happen across the board. It wasn't just notebooks. As good as our storage business was, we probably could've even done better in storage based on the pipeline that we have. So I think it's a broad-based budget concerns by customers, and we're watching this on a month-to-month basis.",186

And as we mentioned earlier, we first looked to our own execution. We see opportunities to improve there, but we tend to be closer to the action in terms of customer spending.

First, I wanted to get your take on the Windows 8 impact on the Consumer business. And the area I was hoping you could address are mix. How do you think the mix, let's say, tablets versus Ultrabooks will unfold? An then, also on Consumer behavior, with consumers having to get used to or acclimated to the Metro interface and the applications that may or may not be supported leading to also the potential impact of Windows 8 on margins, if you do have more tablets and/or higher-cost touchscreen notebooks, how that might impact your margins. And then I have a follow-up, please.",106

I don't think we have all the answers to those questions. But what I can tell you is that we think that the touchscreen products will certainly cost more. They're more in the price points and price bands that we tend to operate in. We will have a full complement of products around the time of Windows 8 being announced and available. We think there will be -- unlike other Windows transitions, this is a transition where you generally are going to need a new PC, whether it's a tablet or an Ultrabook with touch or a notebook with touch or a PC with touch or some derivative hybrid of all of the above type of products, the product refresh cycle associated with this release of Windows is likely to be very different from other releases. But it's hard to know exactly what that looks like. We're preparing a full complement of products, and we'll be ready with those, as we said earlier, at the time of the Windows 8 release.",176

My follow-up is on the services side. If I look at the breakout, infrastructure and cloud and applications and BPO were, add them together, roughly flat, and support was still up nicely. How should we be thinking about if unit growth slows here, it indeed has slowed, the combined growth rate of services as we look out over the next couple of quarters, given what I just mentioned that 2 of the buckets look like the revenue categories are running about flat, and unit growth, I would think, was slow the support and deployment. But any kind of color on the aggregate growth rate of services would be helpful.",113

The team has done a very good job of driving growth in that business with improved attach rates, as well as just execution. I would also say that as you think about infrastructure cloud, security apps, BPO, these are places we're making investments today. We're doing, in some cases, some pruning in those businesses to improve profitability. We've seen that actually happen.

If I sort of wrap all your comments together, it actually sounds like you feel pretty good about where you stand with regards to the margins at this point in the year relative to your expectations. I guess, you mentioned you're getting pressured by PC ASPs obviously. But you said you actually think components feel maybe a little bit better than they did 3 months ago, and Enterprise should help you as go through the year. So is that an accurate assessment of your comments, I guess? And if so, should we actually still expect your margins to improve as you move through the year on the gross margin side?",117

Clearly, the mix of the business and driving stronger growth in enterprise solutions and services has to be a key element of the story. The biggest challenge or the new dynamic that we're facing into is really client pricing and the competitiveness that we see there.

We think we fared well in the mid and high-priced band. One good example is we know we're doing really well with our XPS 13, our first Ultrabook. We know we're taking a lot of share with that, and I think even if you look at some industry data like what's selling in retail in the U.S., you'll see those results.

We're executing our strategy to deliver end-to-end solutions with a flexible design point. This helped drive our Enterprise Solutions  and Services business to $4.9 billion, up 6% with 14% growth in our server and networking business. ES&S is now over 1/3 of our revenue and over 1/2 of our non-GAAP gross margin. 
Year-to-date, we've announced 6 acquisitions and closed 5 of them, all of which will help drive a higher mix of solutions with more predictable revenue and margin streams. In the second quarter, we closed Wyse, the global leader in cloud computing -- cloud client computing, and SonicWALL, a leader in unified threat management and next-generation firewalls. Both are off to a great starts, and their pipelines are up more than 35% sequentially. We're also excited about the pending acquisition of Quest Software, which we expect to close in the second half of the third quarter. 
Growth in our ES&S business, good product execution and pricing discipline all contributed to solid profitability and quarter-on-quarter improvements in gross margins. While the client business deteriorated more than we expected, we've maintained gross margins in a challenging macro and competitive environment in this space. 
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $14.5 billion, down 8%. I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, including a benefit of $71 million, or 50 basis points, primarily related to a vendor settlement. Sequentially, OpEx dollars were basically flat at 14.8% of revenue. We continue to aggressively manage G&A and discretionary spending. At the same time, we had a strategic spend approaching $100 million sequentially. This consisted of OpEx from the acquired companies and incremental R&D. 
Operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.8% of revenue. Cash flow from operations was $637 million. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 30 days deteriorated by 2 days sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in DSO of 3 days. A key driver of this DSO increase was a shift in mix to more complex ES&S opportunities, where customer terms are typically longer. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 17.5%. We spent $400 million in the quarter, repurchased 29 million of Dell stock and ended the quarter with $14.6 billion in cash investments. 
Earnings per share of $0.50 declined 7%, up 16% sequentially. In June, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy with an expected quarterly rate of $0.08 per share, or $0.32 a share annually, beginning in the third quarter. We're committed to maintaining our disciplined capital allocation program that will increase the distribution of capital to shareholders to 20% to 35% of free cash flow. This program includes our dividend, stock repurchase and strategic investments. 
Now I'd like to turn to our global business units. Large Enterprise revenue was down 3%. This business delivered ES&S growth of 9%, including 17% growth in servers and networking, which was offset by declines in the EUC business. Operating income for the business expanded 40 basis points sequentially driven by higher gross margins and OpEx reductions. 
Our Public business was down 6% as we did not see the typical seasonal ramp in the state and local government business in the U.S. The softness was driven by continued budgetary challenges. Despite this, we remain disciplined, driving operating income up 150 basis points sequentially. Looking at the third quarter, the U.S. federal business is well positioned for the year end of their fiscal year, which occurs September 30, and we expect to see normal seasonality here. 
SMB revenue declined 1%. Similar to Large Enterprise, there was strong ES&S growth of 15%, including 27% growth in services, which was offset by a contracting EUC business. The stronger mix resulted in gross margin expansion and a sequential operating income increase of 50 basis points. This business continues to be a great example of our ability to drive premium growth in strategic areas by providing customers with broad-based solutions that help them efficiently solve their business challenges. 
Across the business segments, we're rapidly expanding our channel network to approximately 113,000 partners, with an increasing percentage certified in enterprise solution sales. 
The Consumer business was a challenge, down 22% with notebook revenue down 26%. Operating income declined 60 basis points sequentially as the business increased gross margins, but the reduction in OpEx did not keep pace with the decline in revenue. While we held share in key mature markets like the U.S., emerging markets were very competitive with growth occurring predominantly in the low-value space where we have not participated. I'll address this in some more detail later. 
Our BRIC revenue was down 15% with Asia-Pacific and Japan down 12%. Within APJ, our ES&S business increased 7%. Despite a challenging demand environment for desktops and notebooks, these are important markets for us, and we see improved growth potential going forward. 
Turning to our lines of business. Our server and networking business grew 14%. Servers increased 8%, helped by the success of our 12th generation server line launch. The time-to-market and competitive differentiation of these servers is resulting in higher gross margins than our previous generations and ramped very quickly to over 50% of our mix exiting the quarter. Our networking business continued to gain momentum as our easy-to-manage and high-performing networking solutions are benefiting from the server transition to the 12th generation products. 
Dell IP storage was up 6% to $416 million in the quarter. While this is below where we would have liked it, we believe this is roughly in line with the market. We're confident in our portfolio and focused on accelerating growth and improving execution. 
As you may have seen in a separate press release this afternoon, we announced that Marius Haas has joined Dell to lead our Enterprise Solutions business. He inherits a business that is growing and in great shape. We want to thank Brad Anderson for his many contributions to Dell over the past 7 years. He spearheaded the development of a world-class server business, built our data center custom solutions business and oversaw the acquisition and integrations of EqualLogic, Compellent and Force10, among other contributions. As a result, Dell now has a portfolio of differentiated intellectual property in servers, storage and networking. Marius is a 20-year industry veteran who brings great business, strategic and operational expertise to Dell, and we're excited to have him on the team. 
The Services business continues to deliver solid results. Business grew 3% to $2.1 billion driven by 7% growth in support and deployment and 35% growth in our security business. We're offsetting contraction in desktops and notebooks by selling more in-quarter services and increasing attach rates of our premium offerings. Gross margins increased sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter as we continued to improve our cost structure and focus on higher-margin areas of the Services landscape. We continue to see very good leading indicators as our new signings were $974 million and $1.8 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. The mix of our second quarter new signings is very encouraging as approximately 2/3 are focused on infrastructure, cloud and security and 1/3 on apps and BPO. We continue to increase the breadth of our vertical capabilities. Many of these new signings are in verticals outside of our traditional areas of strength. Our Services backlog increased 5% with balanced growth in contracted services and extended warranty. 
Our third-party server, software and peripheral revenue was down 9% with improved sequential gross margins. This business was impacted by the contraction in desktops and notebooks, combined with the continued pruning of low-value product segments consistent with our strategy. 
Our desktop and mobility business was down 14% as we continued to maximize operating income in a challenging environment. Our focus continues to be on mid- and high-value systems, which contracted at an industry level in the second quarter. Our Latitude and OptiPlex products performed well in the commercial space, but we're seeing pressure on Consumer and entry-level corporate products. There's particular softness and pricing pressure in key emerging markets like India and China, as well as Western Europe.  
In the quarter, we saw the channel drawing down inventory in anticipation of the Windows 8 launch. We also continued to see discretionary spending directed to alternative mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. 
In light of these results and market dynamics, I think it's important to reiterate our client strategy. We're focused on continuing to drive our cost out initiatives to maximize operating income versus unit share [ph]. We'll continue to deliver a strong portfolio of systems targeting the mid and high-value spaces. We've refreshed our Latitude and XPS portfolios with products that are thinner and more powerful. We're building strong capabilities in security and systems management and have an industry-leading position in thin client solutions. And we're positioned to be a leader in addressing the emerging corporate BYOD trend with our current XPS 13, 14 and 15 notebooks and our upcoming tablets and converged devices. In addition, you'll see new Windows 8 Ultrabooks, all-in-one tablets and converged devices in the fourth quarter and headed into next year. 
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. In the third quarter, given the macro environment and soft Consumer business, we expect revenue to be down 2% to 5% sequentially. With the uncertain environment and competitive dynamics, we're lowering our FY '13 EPS outlook to at least $1.70 per share. This incorporates a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive impact from the pending acquisition of Quest Software. For additional detail on the potential impact of this transaction, please refer to Slide 23 in the web deck. 
We expect continued solid growth in Enterprise Solutions, Services and Software, combined with what we think is a realistic view of a challenging end user computing environment in the second half. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%. 
Before we take questions, let me close with a few summary points. We're making progress on our strategy, and we'll continue to invest in building end-to-end solutions capabilities. This is a long-term strategy and will take time. In a tough environment, we did a solid job managing the business to optimize the P&L, and this will continue to be our focus. 
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation program. This has allowed us to increase the amount of cash we're returning to our shareholders in the form of our recently announced dividend and our ongoing stock repurchase program. 
Now let me turn it back to Rob.",1745

There are some short term -- as you look at the DSO within the quarter, there are some elements of specific transactions with specific customers and a terms mix dynamic that plays out that I think we get back some as we move through the year. And the impact of the mix of the business actually happens over a longer period of time. So we're still comfortable in the low 30s. As you look at the remainder of this year and as we exit the year, we'll give you a bit of an update on that. But I think it's a little bit more gradual than what we saw this quarter.",149

So perhaps you can discuss which vendors you think are driving pricing, how you -- what you think is ultimately providing it and how you foresee that going forward. And I have a follow-up, please.",85

I think we talked about emerging countries and a bit of a move to lower-value products in those markets as a dynamic that played out. So the lower-end, lower-value segments were places where we saw the most aggression and, to be honest with you, we avoided some of that. I think if you look at the notebook business in total for us, that the mix in -- the overall ASP change in the quarter was not that significant. So I don't know that it was a big driver in terms of the overall P&L, but there were pockets of aggressive competitive behavior without getting into specific vendor details. So we're going to continue to watch those as we move forward. And again, where we saw very aggressive pricing behavior, those are places where we did not necessarily participate, and that drives a lot of the revenue dynamics that you saw in the quarter.",165

But relative to your expectations at the beginning of the year, your EPS guidance is dramatically lower. And I guess the question is at what -- is there a trigger point for where you're looking at costs in a much more aggressive way than what you've done year-to-date given your current outlook for EPS relative to, I think what you had hoped to do, at the beginning of the year?",93

Look, I think we've -- what you saw in the quarter was a pretty good balance of being able to invest in the key areas of our growth. We've brought in the acquisitions, we invested incrementally in the Enterprise business, but we were able to manage OpEx in general to about a flat level with some disciplined cost actions on the G&A side as well as really discretionary spending across the portfolio. I don't think you'll see us -- I mean, I think that's the approach that we're going to continue to take, is continue to support funding in the important areas of growth in the business, but, at the same time, being aggressive on the cost reductions that we talked about at the analyst meeting. We're in the midst of really launching a broader program across the business that we think, over the course of the next 2 to 3 years, gets at the $2 billion of costs, as we talked about. And that will have broad implications across OpEx but also COGS [ph].",176

Clearly, on the Enterprise side of the business, we feel pretty good about the progress. And as we look forward and even look at the outlook that we're providing for the total year and the second half, pretty consistent view with what we talked about in terms of that continuing to grow and contributing strong profitability. I think the PC business, and maybe when you talk about that EUC business, which we talked about at the analyst meeting, we had the client business as well as SMP [ph] in that part of the business, the revenue sort of deterioration we saw in the quarter was clearly above anything we expected. And I think that's something that as we think about moving forward, you can't expect that, that business will have that sort of deterioration over a long period of time. We think, as you look at the second half of the year, it's going to be challenging environment for that part of the business, but should stabilize as we come out of that and get Windows 8 sort of in the marketplace. So I think clearly, a little more deterioration there than we expect -- faster than we expected and managed the P&L pretty well given that dynamic that we saw in the quarter.",230

To be honest, I wouldn't call out any linearity in terms of the quarter that was different.

Brian, I would say those markets in general, what we saw there was a challenging consumer dynamics that drove the overall financials. We did see solid performance from the Enterprise side of the business, and the Commercial side of the business was clearly better. So I think it's -- that's clearly what drove it. And when you look at that space in general, we saw demand growth in the market really isolated to the low-value segments of the PC business. And when you look at the mid- to higher-priced or higher-value elements of the portfolio or of the market, they were actually down within the quarter. So that was clearly where we were focused. We didn't participate in the lower-value segments, and that's how you get that sort of a result.",132

I think it was down about 14% between mobility and desktops. Can you just talk about how much of that issue was due to a channel drawdown ahead of Windows 8 versus some of the other issue that may be a bit more secular in nature? And then could you just maybe talk about given Microsoft is launching their own hardware with Surface, how do you think that plays out from your perspective, especially in the Consumer arena?",94

Look, I think as we've talked about, I mean, there clearly were slower growth or negative growth -- more negative growth in the mid- to the higher-value elements of the portfolio, and that's really what, I think in our case, drove some of the -- drove a 14% sort of decline. And a lot more growth in that business, in Consumer specifically, has been at the low end. And our choices to participate or not participate clearly affected the revenue in the quarter. But that's sort of is the dynamic that we see. There's also -- as we said, as you sort of head through the quarter, the second quarter, we began to see the channel begin to push out and try and draw down inventory levels of Windows 7-based product as they move into the fall, which we would expect to be one of the key drivers moving into the third quarter for us. So I think that's the overall framework that we see, and we don't expect a lot of -- there's really not a catalyst that we'd expect some growth in that space in the third quarter. As you think about Microsoft entering the space, clearly, as we think about it, we've spent time talking to Microsoft and understanding sort of how they're thinking about it. There clearly are opportunities for us, as Windows 8 comes through, in having differentiated products. And I think at the same time they have announced the Surface product that would be in the space, we will have products in there, and I think you'll see a diverse set of offerings that take advantage of what Windows 8 brings to market.

I would expect that the market in general will suffer through a bit of this inventory adjustment during the third quarter.

And then just given your free cash flow, where your free cash flow was, and then your commitment to share repurchase and dividends, how should we think about your M&A strategy?

We'll continue with the framework around capital allocation that we've talked about. Obviously, that is the dividend. We continue to buy back in the quarter. We have done a fair amount of acquisition activity this year. And we're in the process of obviously, hopefully, closing Quest as we enter the second half of the third quarter here, and that's a relatively large acquisition. So there will be some digestion and then execution around the integration of those specific acquisitions. But our growth plans, as we move forward, will continue to be a combination of organic investments and continued inorganic investments.",110

Product line is lining up incredibly well versus others as we do a better job of selling a converged solution, selling storage and networking along with the servers, our blades are getting stronger. We -- we're -- this is the best server line we’ve ever had, and we feel very good about what we have planned for follow-on generations. So also, mobiles are moving to x86. So we're seeing continued shift in our Services business. We've got a very nice pipeline of application migration business that's developing around some of the capabilities that we built in Dell services and other acquisitions, like Make and Clerity, was added to that.

I also think this dynamic of moving to lower-value, lower-priced sort of segments and that being the focus of the markets is a trend that I don't see changing over the next couple of quarters here.

Hate to use that as an excuse. And I would tell you the 6% growth that we saw in the quarter was behind what we expected. Well, as we -- that portfolio is in good shape. The businesses are in good shape. We've seen -- overall, I think the pipelines look good. Competitors continue to be generally aggressive in parts of this business, but we would expect to see more growth there.

Can you just help us split out unit growth versus ASP increases? And in terms of this new server cycle that you guys speak about, can you give us any sense as to how significantly more gross margin accretive it is than the previous cycle? Then the question I have for, I guess, Brian, is on the OpEx point. Just to be clear, you guys spent $100 million more on R&D. Was it incremental R&D spend by you as well as your acquisitions? Or was it just $100 million do you spend more? I just want to understand why is there a question of making money. I thought it was, historically. Have you guys decided to change the OpEx structure in the near term?",137

On the server question, clearly, we've seen higher ASPs on higher-end configurations as we've launched the new products here. And as a result, it's driven expansion in terms of margin rates within the business. The 12G has had higher gross margins, and as that's mixed up to a higher percentage of our servers at higher prices, that's helped the overall profitability in the business. On the OpEx line, specifically on Quest, Kulbinder, it's -- there is a first accounting element that drives the short-term dilution of that business. As you think about the software acquisition, the write-off of the deferred revenue over the first couple of periods of that business ultimately more than offsets the accretion. On a cash flow basis, the business will be accretive really in the first period that we bring it in. So that's really the dynamic that we'll see in the second half of the year for Quest. And speaking about the $100 million, what we did, approximately between -- well, that $75 million is related to the acquisitions and their OpEx spend as you bring them into the portfolio in the quarter, specifically SonicWALL and Wyse being the 2 largest. In addition, we've spent about $30 million incrementally in R&D quarter-on-quarter sequentially around the Enterprise business. So that provides a little more detail.",220

And as our business is more heavily weighted towards the Commercial side of the business, we still continue to feel good about refresh opportunity. Well, I think we've seen data that would suggest only about 50% of that Windows 7 transition is complete, and that'll continue and will continue as we sort of play out over the next several quarters here before anybody really thinks about Windows 8 on the Commercial side. Those areas in the corporate or commercial customer base that are looking at tablets, clearly there is a wait-and-see sort of approach how you think about that playing out in the commercial enterprise. And as Windows 8 as an alternative with a tablet product that can work in the Enterprise as well with security, it's something that we hear a lot our customers talking about and really waiting for.

And that's a tough one to overcome when you've got a big impact in a region like that. Those are the types of things Brian talked about when you think about those are markets that are likely to snap back once we kind of work through what is a cautious environment. I think a lot of commercial customers are looking at their discretionary spend right now and saying, ""Hey, I'm going to put some additional dollars to work in some of these enterprise solutions, but if I've got a decision to make, I might pull back a little bit on some of these client transitions and wait to see how things play out at a macro level.""

What I'd also tell you is that the line that separates what the server and what the storage is not as clear as it might have been a few years ago. If you look at our 12th generation servers, you'll notice that they have enormous -- huge capacities. And so you're seeing words of mouth. The storage show up inside the server itself.

Aaron, obviously, we don't provide specific outlooks for gross margin or OpEx in detail. But I would -- so I'll give you a sense of the drivers and how we're thinking about them and maybe talk about the second quarter and then maybe how it moves forward. Clearly, we got the benefit in the quarter of improved mix. We saw the higher-margin elements in the business grow faster. The Services business has expanded margins, as we said, 6 quarters in a row, and that obviously helps. Given their lower margin -- the Consumer elements of the portfolio which would have the lower margins had the most sort of revenue weakness. The [indiscernible] prices were kind of a push in the quarter. And then as I said, pricing was generally mixed and a headwind in some parts of the business, but in some places, not so much. And I think also, currency in the quarter was a bit of a headwind at the margin line. And as we sort of move prices up around that, we clearly would expect that to be less of an issue as we move forward. So I think those are the dynamics. And as you think about the second half, it's -- I would say a lot of the same dynamics would be what we would expect to continue to play out, so.",228

Four years ago this month, we embarked on our strategy to deliver end-to-end solutions to our customers with a scalable design point. Since then, we've made great strides in executing this strategy and continue to add to our capabilities. 
In the third quarter, our Enterprise Solutions and Services business revenue was $4.8 billion, up 3%, led by 11% growth in our server and networking business. These businesses, which were about $14 billion in FY '08, are now at an annual run rate approaching $20 billion. Year-to-date, they're up 4% and have generated more than 50% of our non-GAAP gross margin over that period of time. 
Year-to-date, we've added AppAssure, SonicWALL, Wyse, Make, Clerity and Quest, bringing enhanced capabilities to a portfolio of software and services that address many of our customers' most pressing needs, including security, cloud, data backup and protection, systems management and application modernization. 
Specifically, the addition of Quest Software during the quarter provides us with a foundational asset for our software business, which will contribute to a higher mix of solutions with more predictable revenue and margin streams. 
While there's no question that we're in a challenging global IT demand environment, especially in the core PC business, we're fully committed to our strategy. We continue to make key investments to drive our transformation and we're seeing important progress in building a strong Enterprise franchise as we move through the year. 
Moving to the quarter, we delivered revenue of $13.7 billion, down 11% and at the low end of the revenue range we provided in August. I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22%, down 60 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, gross margins in the second quarter benefited from approximately $70 million or 50 basis points, primarily resulting from a vendor settlement. When you normalize for this benefit, the mix to ES&S is helping stabilize margins as we see incremental margin pressure in our client business. 
We continue to be disciplined in managing our discretionary spend. OpEx dollars were down $20 million sequentially to 15.5% of revenue as we absorbed about $60 million of OpEx associated with Quest and another $90 million of strategic spend in R&D associated with recent acquisitions and organic investments. 
Operating income was $886 million or 6.5% of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.39 declined 28%. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, with an ending cash and investments balance of $14.2 billion. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 32 days, improved 2 days sequentially, driven by better inventory and receivables management. Our cash flow will continue to benefit from the changes in our business model as we migrate to more software and services-based solutions. 
With our solid cash flow and commitment to a strong balance sheet, we've invested $4.7 billion this year to acquire new capabilities and intellectual property. We've paid out $139 million dividend distribution in the third quarter, and including our stock repurchase program, we returned almost $900 million to shareholders year-to-date. 
Turning to our lines of business. Our server and networking business grew 11%, representing the 12th consecutive quarter of growth. Servers increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our hyper-scale data center solutions business and continued traction with our 12th generation servers. 12G servers now represent 2/3 of our server revenue at ASPs and margins that are a premium to our previous generation servers. Collectively, our differentiated intellectual property and solutions has resulted in a growing share position. 
Our networking business increased 40% as it continues to benefit from the 12G servers and native 10-gigabyte Ethernet on the motherboard. During the quarter, we launched our active infrastructure converged offering. This brings together Dell hardware, software and services under a common design architecture that offers customers a robust and easy-to-manage data center infrastructure for application, personal desktop infrastructure and cloud deployments. By making these deployments simpler and easier to manage, we're addressing key customer needs in this growing market opportunity. 
Dell Storage was down 3% to $378 million in a challenging environment, and this was below our expectations. Over the past 6 months, we've introduced enhancements to the portfolio, including new backup recovery and replication solutions, new storage compression and dedupe technologies, improved Compellent management software, 2 new converged data center solutions and NAS capability on the fiber channel. We believe these enhancements position us well when industry demand in this important business segment improves. 
The Services business was down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially at $2.1 billion and 5% growth in support and deployment and 16% growth in our security business. Our Services backlog increased 2% to $15.8 billion. Gross margin percent increased sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter as we continue to improve our cost structure and focus on higher-margin areas of the Services landscape. In Apps & BPO, we continue to make progress on improving profitability, which is having a short-term impact on our revenue growth. 
Our Dell software business continues to introduce innovative solutions focusing on security, application, systems management and business intelligence. For example, we sold more SonicWALL Supermassive next-generation firewalls during the quarter than at any time before. With 96 cores, Supermassive's full deep-packet inspection provides the highest level of malware detection and elimination than any firewall in the market. We also updated our security management tool, enabling the management of up to 5,000 firewalls from this single console. 
Finally, Quest vFoglight Storage 2.0 is an integrated solution that provides application-to-disk performance monitoring and enables server and storage teams to jointly resolve virtualization performance issues. These all represent competitively differentiated capabilities we did not have a year ago. 
Our third-party software and peripheral revenue was down 11%, driven by the contraction of desktop and mobility products. Our desktop and mobility business was down 19%. Our results here were mixed. Our desktop business held share relative to last year, while notebooks lost share and did not perform to our expectations. We're launching new cloud-based client solutions based on our Wyse IP. Last week, we unveiled the Wyse Cloud Client Manager, which gives IT managers the ability to expand beyond the firewall to manage multiple mobile and fixed line devices regardless of the operating system. This provides customers the ability to more effectively and securely manage BYOD implementations. 
Going forward, we're focused on selling client and virtualization solutions in our custom and commercial accounts. We enhanced our focus on our client acquisition business, including a simplified pricing strategy, and we're driving more than $1 billion in cost out initiatives specific to the client business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Felice to give an update on business segment results.",1105
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3320.0,388551.0,18496082.0,Presenter Speech,Stephen Felice,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Brian. Large Enterprise revenue was down 8%. Enterprise Solutions and Services grew 5%, including 14% growth in servers and networking. Operating income was down 170 basis points sequentially to 7.8% of revenue. Here, we saw a reduction in the number of client opportunities as many large commercial customers continue to defer purchases of discretionary IT hardware. We are seeing success in winning new business, but given the long-term nature of these opportunities, they will not impact revenue in the short term. 
Our Public business was down 11%. We did see the expected end of fiscal year ramp for the U.S. Federal business. But also, as expected, we saw a significant contraction in spending in October. We continue to see budgetary constraints in Western Europe government spending and global, state and local government spending. But despite this, we remain disciplined as, sequentially, we were able to increase gross margin percent and reduce OpEx spend. Public operating income was down 10 basis points sequentially to 9.2% of revenue. 
SMB continues to be the most stable customer set for Dell as revenue declined 1%. Similar to Large Enterprise, we saw Enterprise Solutions and Services growth of 15%, including 22% growth in Services and 16% growth in servers and networking. Operating income was down 110 basis points sequentially to 10.6% of revenue. This business continues to exemplify the progress of our transformation. And despite the macro backdrop, we feel it's important to invest through this macro cycle. 
Enterprise Solutions and Services mix has improved for 6 consecutive quarters, with expanding margins over that period of time. 
The Consumer business continues to be a challenge, with revenue down 23%. The operating loss was $65 million or minus 2.7% of revenue. Industry growth in this space continues to occur predominantly in the low-value and entry level desktop and notebooks, where we've chosen not to participate, and in tablets. 
With the launch of Windows 8, we have new tablets and convertibles, including the XPS 10, XPS 12 and Latitude 10. In addition, we have 2 touch-enabled all-in-one desktops. While it's too early to share specific demand numbers, we are encouraged by the initial customer interest in our touch-enabled computing. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Brian to discuss our outlook.",376

Consistent with our comments last quarter and with what you're hearing from many other technology companies, we continue to see a challenging global macroeconomic and IT spending environment which is clearly impacting our results. We don't expect that to improve much in the fourth quarter. 
For revenue, we expect sequential growth of 2% to 5%. You should also remember that last year's fourth quarter included a 14th week. For the full year, we continue to outlook at least $1.70 in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis, which works out to at least $0.38 for the fourth quarter. This incorporates a $0.01 to $0.02 dilutive impact from the inclusion of Quest Software to the fourth quarter. We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20%. 
Before we take questions, let me close with a couple -- few summary points. We're pleased with the Enterprise Solutions and Services business. With a revenue run rate approaching $20 billion, growing at roughly mid-single digits and strong profit, this is a business where we'll continue to invest and accelerate our growth. 
In end-user computing, we have work to do but are encouraged by early interest in our new Windows 8 touch portfolio and the new opportunities we see in our commercial and consumer businesses. As always, we'll be balancing liquidity, profitability and growth to optimize the company for long-term success. 
Now let me turn it over to Rob.",239

The operating profit there was obviously challenged this quarter. And I know you guys have been more selective recently.

Clearly, in Consumer, it's been a more challenging environment. Emerging markets have slowed. They've moved to lower-value products. We also saw, in the quarter, expected channel dynamics around the Windows 8 launch. I would say we're sticking to our focus on mid- to high-value segments of that business and not really chasing the lower end of that space. We said last quarter that we didn't think the consumer market would improve until after the Windows 8 launch and then definitely we've seen that. So we're committed to the strategy here. We understand the importance of the business and the importance of scale that comes with that. And as we've talked about, and Jeff Clarke talked about this summer, we continue to focus on cost reductions that are important to stay competitive here. So maybe Steve can give a couple of comments.",151

I totally agree with Brian that we don't see a need to change from the strategy. We certainly see a few things that happened in the last quarter that we don't really believe are sustainable changes. For example, unlike some of the prior declines in the economy, we haven't -- we saw a bigger decline in emerging markets, and that's different from the past. And China being a negative growth, India being a negative growth, Brazil being a negative growth, we don't think that's going to stay that way. We do believe that, that's relatively short term, although we don't know exactly when it's going to pull out, but we do already see signs that China is doing better. We also think that there was earnings pressure because of this transition to Windows 8. That's another thing that we don't -- that we think will ease itself out. But as you may recall, we thought that after -- in last quarter's earnings discussion, we thought the industry inventory was high, and that it would take some working out and especially that's exacerbated by Windows 8. So we think there's some certain short-term things that will not continue. We certainly do see a challenging environment in Europe, and so we don't see that improving very much. But we're hopeful that the emerging markets will start to show some recovery.",229

We saw 14% growth in servers and networking in that space. This is clearly a place where we're seeing commercial customers defer discretionary spending in this sort of environment, and that's clearly something that we've seen work its way through. Not clear that there's going to be -- I mean, there continues to be a big opportunity around the Windows 8 and Windows 7 refresh that's not completed yet. And that's still out there and we expect that to continue as we head into next year.",119

And while we're staying committed to the strategy, we're also going to defend our turf here. So I think we're in good shape with our customers. And we're showing to have the cross-selling ability because we are selling a lot of servers and networking and services into this space. So we have a healthy relationship with the customers, and we've used more this normal macro competitive environment.",93

And I believe you just said that you wanted to defend your turf or that was part of the reason why you saw some margin pressure on the client in the Enterprise business. Does that signal somewhat of a change in strategy to where you are sort of drawing a line in the sand in terms of how much market share you're willing to give up specifically in the Enterprise category?,94
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3320.0,388551.0,18496093.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,14,"Well, I think we're not changing the strategy. We're focused on profit share here, and there clearly are some places where we're going to defend our turf in important parts of our business. Enterprise for us is critically important. And we've shown that we can grow in that space. When you look at client margins, I mean, one thing, obviously, we had the vendor settlement impact in the business that affected the second quarter and gave us a benefit in the second quarter. That, for us, gives us a little bit of a challenge quarter-on-quarter when you look at gross margins. But it's clear there's been client pricing pressure as a result of the competitive dynamics and a weaker demand environment. And that's something that we expect probably will continue for a period here.",134

I mean, as we sort of heated up coming into the year, it's basically what we've seen. We had some moderate deflation in the quarter.

I appreciate the fact that the market is very difficult. But it's clear that you're losing overall client share, and even if we back out consumers, certainly on the mobility side, you were down in the 20s on the corporate side for mobility. So it's clear that Dell's losing share. If we think about that impact on the business, we've seen the Consumer business descale as a result and you're starting to see pressure on margins. When you lowered your guidance for this year, I think that was largely a reflection of the fact that you've descaled, not that your gross margins have gone down but that you've descaled. So against that backdrop, why wouldn't you tilt the balance or do something a little more radical here, going forward? And what I mean by that is why not be a little bit more aggressive and give up some gross margins to preserve volumes so you don't run that descaling risk that we're starting to see signs of? Or why is there not a more -- a stronger focus on and a very deliberate and material focus on taking out cost?",197

We think we're in a position right now where our scale is competitive. And given the size of the business but also the higher-value elements of our business, the fact that the buy that we have with our supply base tends to be higher-end buy given our commercial mix, we think it positions us well from a scale standpoint. Clearly, we're not going to go and shift our overall strategy in this sort of an environment. We think that this is more of a short-term macroeconomic set of dynamics that we're facing, that as it works its way through, we'll see PC demand improve. And as it improves, you'll see the scale return. So that's really how we're thinking about it.",141

And as I said in my comments, you won't see them in the current quarter, but we had better wins than we've seen in a while. So I think we are starting to get some of this business back over the longer term. And the other thing I'll point out is that, I'll go back to the emerging market point because that had a bigger effect than we've seen in the past. And these are areas where we have a really strong position with customers, and we really do believe it was more short-term or I should say, macro-oriented, whether it's short-term or not, depends on how they pull out of it. But we did not lose customers but we did see a big slowdown in their purchases. We are working on a few things to get more competitive and to make things simpler for our customers. We have introduced a dramatically simplified pricing strategy in the U.S. just in the past week or so, and I think as people go on to www.dell.com and look on the commercial side, you'll see that, where it's very easy to determine what our pricing is across any of the businesses. We're also aggressively continuing to work on the $1 billion cost out in the client area, and we believe we're making good progress there, and that it'll enable us to play in a broader range of price bands next year. So we hear you on some of these things, and we are intending to go after a broader part of the market. But we want to do it under the same strategy of being profitable, delivering value. We're not just going to go after the low price bands if we don't see a value proposition, where it's sustainable with customers.",315

If I look over the last several quarters, last 10 -- 8 to 10 quarters, Dell's been growing about 5 to 10 points slower than the market on the client side. So even if client growth does return, and I understand the cyclical points and pressures that the business is under, even if it returns and it's a low-single digit business, that still suggests -- low single on the unit side, that still suggests if your relative share position is going to be the same, that you're going to be down in unit terms and then there may be pricing pressure on top of that.

I do think that the position of our business, the strength of our commercial franchise in the client space as well as the broader portfolio, they continue to be important assets for us and they're well positioned. We think we can -- as you know, there's a whole set of life cycle profits that really come from having those customer relationships and the profitability that drives across the support business and our S&P business and our financing. So it's important that we drive that part of our business where we can capture that value and maintain a strong share position. And it really does help the other parts of the portfolio. So that's, I think, what you'll see us continue to focus on.",144

Clearly, we're starting to see a lot of receptivity to virtualize clients, and that drives a more profitable client business for us, but it also has a big drag-on effect on the Enterprise. And so with the addition of Wyse, we're seeing really good progress out of that as in the synergies it has with the rest of our business. We also are starting to see a lot of receptivity to the way we've approached the tablet market from a commercial perspective. I've been meeting with lots of customers who continue to say that they're needing to prioritize security and manageability as they try to roll out tablets in their environment. And specifically, products like the Latitude 10 that has things like security built into it with a smartcard feature and even something like a replaceable battery. These are things that are resonating well on the commercial side. So that -- those opportunities are going to broaden that commercial business for us, and that should help us get back to growth.",184

And on the Enterprise side, certainly, when one talks to your competitors, they're pretty dismissive of Dell and the Enterprise. You are showing some good early results. What are they missing? Where do you think you differentiate versus traditional competitors? I know you've talked about a flatter and cheaper architecture, but maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the architectural approaches and markets that are a bit different from what your traditional competitors are doing?",79

Point out that this is roughly a $20 billion business and growing pretty nicely. If you look at x86 servers, which are really the core of that business for us, we have achieved leading share in North America. And we were the only company in among the top 3 to grow in every region of the world in that space. We are really innovating in the Enterprise without having to protect the legacy of new range and mainframe products, and we believe that's a highly differentiated approach. And the combination of what we're doing in networking, storage and the ability to combine those and manage those, I believe is resonating very well with our customers. So you saw last quarter, servers and networking grew 11% year-over-year. And particularly a lot of success with our 12th generation PowerEdge, which is sort of the crown jewel of the portfolio. We have beat our competitors to market. And in the highest volume category, we have really outdone our competitors here in terms of the capability of those products. So for example, we have a product right in the core of this product line that has 63% more storage capacity than our principal competitors. So you think about applications like Hadoop, Big Data, SharePoint, Exchange, all the growth in hosting activity and cloud activity that's going on with things like OpenStack. Dell's incredibly well positioned to serve those customers. In fact, our DCS server business grew 126% year-over-year, which is markedly faster than overall market. So I think we're very well positioned in the Enterprise. And our Services portfolio is very well aligned to help customers transition from those legacy architectures to x86.",294

We have a number of enhancements to the portfolio. And I think another important element here is that the line that separates servers and storage is really blurring. We have a large customer that we've now installed over an exabyte of storage in for their cloud, and it's one of the most recognized companies in the world. But that exabyte of storage is all contained within Dell servers. So none of it shows up in our storage revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a server that has -- 2 new servers that supports 38 terabytes of storage. You'll note that, that's right in the heart of the midrange storage capacities. By the end of this month, that same server will be available with 50 terabytes of storage. So the lines here are really blurring with converged infrastructure, and our overall Enterprise server storage networking business is kind of growing in the mid-single digits and I think well positioned.",173

What are you hearing from governments? You noted a slowdown in October in the U.S. How should we think about what the federal government in the U.S. is doing as we move towards this fiscal cliff? And then just in general, I'm curious as to what -- there's been any signs of improvement maybe in China or Europe or if it just remains relatively muted?",74

We are waiting for decisions to be made and it will affect public budgets. But right now, with the uncertainty that's remaining, there's not a lot of budget available. So as soon as the September month ended and they got their approved budgeted spending out of the way, it shut down quite a bit. And so until there's clarification, it's hard to predict where that's going to go. Western Europe, we continue to see weakness in the public sector, as you would expect, with their debt crises going on there. And that one also does not show any near-term signs of improvement. The rest of it is spotty. Asia does show some signs of recovery, although as I pointed out earlier, it's been -- one of the biggest changes, I think, from previous financial economic downturns is the fact that you saw BRIC countries slow down as much. So while it's stabilizing and coming back, it's still below what would be a normal expected growth rate. So I do think, again, looking at what's going on in China, for example, that we would expect that economy to return and that we could see improvements but we're not sure exactly when.",214

First of all, we continue to see a need with the trend in technology to have an end-to-end solution. When you think about the trends that are going on in Bring Your Own Device, in virtualized desktops and cloud computing, all of these things need Dell as a trusted advisor with a lot of customers to give them a solution from end-to-end. We also have a nice cash business with our client business. There's a lot of benefits to it. And our commercial client business drives a very healthy profitability. On the Enterprise side, you could see from the server performance that we are taking share. We are gaining new customers. We are gaining them around the world. We are #1 in Asia and that's because we're winning new customers in China. Michael talked about our leadership position in the U.S. In particular, I talked about the strong growth in the SMB market. We grew Enterprise quite a bit there, we resonate really well with those customers and they have a little better wherewithal to spend money right now.

The support business is growing nicely due to better attach, yet if I look at infrastructure applications and BPO, it seems that, that business is growing well below market growth rates. So I was wondering why and what's the action plan to improve growth in those areas. And I have a follow-up, please.",59

I mean you've seen, as we've talked about over the last few quarters, pretty strong growth in terms of new signings, and much of that's around IT outsourcing and Apps & BPO. What's going on in the business is we are intentionally pruning some legacy accounts that from our standpoint aren't necessarily long-term strategic accounts for us. That has improved profitability significantly. It's been very conscious and thoughtful. And I think you'll see as those new signings begin to kick in over the next few quarters here, that those businesses will begin to show some nice growth.",99

And within that context, you've been acquiring a good deal of IP on transaction-related businesses, but is there a thought here to investing more in this business as well, including nonorganic sources?",65

SecureWorks is a great security services business that's been growing very, very well and has been a great acquisition. We've added some new intellectual property around application modernization this year with Make and Clerity. So I think you'll see us try and focus on differentiated IP that we can add to the Services portfolio and grow higher margin parts in that business.",90

And so as a result of that, they're continuing to fine-tune the model to make sure that they've got the right cost structure in place and the right people and tools and technologies in place. And so they're very comfortable with where they're positioned right now and feel very comfortable with their pipeline. They're just doing some things that they feel are the right, absolutely, the right strategy on a go forward basis. And it's showing up in the P&L, not necessarily at the revenue line right now.",121

The silver lining in a bad economic situation is it has everybody really examine their cost structures. And I feel like we're hitting an inflection point where you hear CIOs, and I've heard many of them specifically say, ""I've got to get off of my proprietary environment. I've got to get off the mainframe."" These are comments we never used to hear. And we're so well positioned without having a legacy profit stream from those proprietary environments to meet the needs of customers wanting to move, and that's why we're getting apps modernization capabilities so we can help drive that transition.",112

Can you give us any data points, post the October close, or any comfort or color that this is short term and this isn't a longer-term malaise. We have a double dip recession in Europe, we have a bit of a mess politically in Congress right now. Any kind of dynamics would be great in terms of that, and I have a quick follow-up.",84

You see what's happened with the inventory dynamics. You see what happens -- what's happened here with the Windows 8 operating system transition. I mean, those are clearly impacts that we would see working their way through the system over the next quarter or so. So don't expect a lot of improvement in macro economy and probably don't expect a lot of the fundamental PC demand dynamics to improve over the next quarter. But that will -- that element will work its way through.",111

Any ability to give us some detail on what Dell's raw material or purchase commitment inventory looks like, not necessarily on the PC side but more in terms of some of the other hardware. There seems to be some nice component pricing that's coming down. I'm wondering if Dell's been able to take advantage of that?",114

As you've seen over the last quarter, at least that we've taken inventory levels down. So we think that gives us a chance to take advantage of those opportunities and we've done some of that.",66

With margins having gradually come down for multiple quarters now, either gross and, I guess, operating level, is there anything more radical you guys have considered? Are there any disposals you can do, small or large? Or just taking more of a stringent view of the cost base if this is a prolonged downturn or if there is sustainable pressure on margins in the client business, that you have to be more actioned going forward? Is that under consideration or is it just $1 billion in the client position you mentioned so far?",104

I mean, clearly, we've managed discretionary spending with a specific focus on G&A over the last several quarters here. And if you look at the OpEx trend that we've had this year, I mean, it's been fairly well managed, as in many cases, we've added a lot of investment in the key priority areas for the business. So that will continue. We just think that's clearly something we have to do in this environment and the right thing to do. Jeff Clarke this summer talked about a broader $2 billion initiative. $1 billion of that is in the client space. Some of that will be in COGS, some of it will be in OpEx. And then there's another $1 billion that we're going after in other parts of the business. So those are broad initiatives that affect the underlying structure of the business and allow us to drive efficiency and productivity across the business. You'll see that sort of play out over the next couple of years, and we'll talk more about that as it sort of works its way through the system.",193
