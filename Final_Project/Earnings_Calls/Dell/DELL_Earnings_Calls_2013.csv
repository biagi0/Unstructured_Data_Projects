266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2013",2013-02-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,1696.0,418767.0,19754631.0,Presenter Speech,Robert Williams,,Executives,1,"Thanks, Regina. In light of Michael's involvement in the pending transaction, today's call will be led by Brian Gladden, and he'll be joined by Tom Sweet, our Corporate Controller. The web deck was posted to our website in advance of the call. I encourage you to review this and related materials for additional perspective. 
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and web deck, we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at dell.com and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
As you know, the Board of Directors of Dell, acting on the recommendation of the special committee of independent directors, unanimously approved a merger agreement to take the company private subject to a number of conditions. Given the nature of this transaction, we are not going to address any questions on this matter in today's Q&A. Now I'd like to turn it over to Brian.",278
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2013",2013-02-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,1696.0,418767.0,19754632.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Gladden,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. For the full fiscal year, our revenue was $56.9 billion, down 8%. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $1.72, down 19%. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business was $19.4 billion, up 4% from fiscal year 2012. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $14.3 billion, down 11% and up 4% sequentially, which was at the high end of the 2% to 5% sequential growth outlook we provided last quarter. The ES&S business was up 6% to $5.2 billion and now represents 36% of our revenue and well over half of our gross margin dollars. 
We continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Our strong balance sheet and cash position have enabled almost $5 billion in investments in new capabilities and intellectual property in key assets such as Quest, SonicWALL, Wyse and AppAssure. 
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22.8% and included an approximately $250 million benefit, primarily related to vendor settlements. We experienced a competitive pricing environment in our desktop and mobilities products and utilized a portion of the settlement dollars to fund investments in some customer accounts that we feel will drive solid cash flow and profitability over the long term. In addition, we did see some areas of elasticity, and we were able to hold or gain share in certain areas of the business. 
SG&A increased 40 basis points sequentially to 14% of revenue, while R&D was up sequentially to 2.1% of revenue. The dollar increase in SG&A was driven by recently closed acquisitions, strategic investments in sales capabilities and expenses related to the merger transaction. The R&D increase was driven by recent acquisitions in software, predominantly the Quest business. 
Operating income was $954 million or 6.7% of revenue. Earnings per share were $0.40, which declined 22%. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion, partially driven by the sequential growth in our business and an improved payable cycle. Our cash and investments balance ended at $15.3 billion. 
For the full year, we returned 34% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of our dividend and stock repurchase, at the high end of our stated range of 20% to 35%. 
Turning to our lines of business. Our Server and Networking business grew 18%, representing the 13th consecutive quarter of growth. As a reminder, this business includes Dell Software related to Quest, AppAssure and SonicWALL. Servers increased 5%, driven by strong growth in our hyper-scale data center solutions business as we see continued strong migration to our 12th generation servers. 12th generation servers now represent almost 80% of our Dell PowerEdge server revenue at ASPs and margins that are premium to our previous generation servers. 
Our Networking business continues to deliver strong growth, with an increase of 42% and over 100% growth in our Force10 business. 
Dell Storage was down 8% to $424 million, but we're seeing improved momentum as the business increased 12% sequentially driven by a 20% sequential increase of Compellent and EqualLogic combined. 
The Services business was down 3% and flat sequentially at $2.1 billion. Support & Deployment was flat. Infrastructure, cloud and security services were up 2%, led by our Security business, which increased 17%. 
We had a 22% decline in our Apps & BPO business, driven by select contract expirations. Our Services backlog and deferred services revenue increased 3% to $16.3 billion. New services signings increased 9% to $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Our third-party software and peripherals revenue was down 11%, driven by a continued decline in desktop and mobility related products and a contraction in our Imaging business. 
We saw good results in our Dell Software business, led by Quest, which delivered revenue over our stated target of $180 million to $200 million for the quarter. We also saw good sequential growth in our security software business and continued to add customer-centric software solutions to address critical customer needs. 
Our desktop and mobility business was down 20% and up 3% sequentially. Our Desktop business gained sequential share while notebooks lost share and continued to be challenged. We made the decision to improve our relative price position, and we believe this will benefit us going forward. We expect the market competitiveness and margin pressure to continue, which reinforces the importance of executing on our greater than $1 billion cost out initiatives specific to this business. 
Clearly understanding the dynamics of the desktop and mobility environment, we continue to innovate and emphasize alternative compute models, as evidenced by a continued strength in our Wyse business. In the fourth quarter, we saw orders in this business increase over 25%, including tied enterprise solutions.
Turning to our business unit results. I would remind you that these numbers are not adjusted for the benefit of the vendor settlements. 
Large Enterprise revenue was down 7% to $4.7 billion. ES&S grew 10%, including 25% growth in Servers & Networking. Operating income was up 60 basis points sequentially to 8.4% of revenue. 
Our Public business was down 9% to $3.5 billion. We continue to see a challenging spending environment in the U.S. Federal business as the budgetary uncertainty has impacted IT spend and delayed contract awards. Overall, the Public business saw good growth in Servers & Networking at 11% growth. The decline in revenue combined with higher OpEx resulted in op inc of 6.8%, which is down 130 basis points annually and 240 basis points sequentially. Given the budgetary issues in many of these customers sets, there are fewer desktop and mobility deals, and those that were awarded were typically very competitive. 
SMB revenue declined 5% to $3.4 billion. Similar to Large Enterprise, we saw strong ES&S growth of 9%, including 17% growth in Services and 13% in Servers & Networking. Operating income was up 70 basis points sequentially to 11.3% of revenue. ES&S revenue mix of 39% has improved for 7 consecutive quarters in SMB. 
The Consumer business continues to be challenging, with revenue down 24%. Operating income was $8 million or 0.3% of revenue. Growth in this space continues to occur in tablets and in the low-value desktop and notebook space. We're seeing good adoption of touch, and the supply of touch panels improved throughout the quarter. Given our pending merger agreement, we're not providing an outlook for fiscal year 2014 or our first quarter. 
Finally, I want to remind you that the 8-K that we filed January 10, we're going to replace our customer segment reporting structure with a product and services group based structure for our first quarter of fiscal year 2014. The new reporting groups will be as follows: End User Computing, which will include desktops, including thin client, notebooks including tablets, third-party software and client-related accessories; Enterprise Solutions Group, which will include servers, networking storage, converged infrastructure offerings and ESG-related accessories; Dell Services, which will include a broad range of IT and business services, including Support & Deployment services, infrastructure, cloud, security services, applications and business process services; and the Dell Software Group, which will include systems management, security software solutions and information management. 
We will restate segment reporting for comparability purposes for fiscal year '12 and fiscal year '13 at the time of our first quarter earnings release. This aligns with how we deliver our strategy and is a natural step for better solutions for our customers. Now I'll turn it back over to Rob.",1226

That's how we thought about it in the quarter.",62

And related to that, you talked about the imperative to really get the $1 billion in cost outs in the client business. Maybe you could help us understand where you are in that process, how much do you think you've taken out and how investors should think about that?",84

The -- like I said, Toni, the -- early in the quarter, we had visibility to the settlement, the multiple settlements in the quarter, and we really did thoughtfully think about where we wanted to apply that in some markets and throughout the quarter, continued to test elasticity, places where we found elasticity and good long-term profitability in accounts. That's where we would have gotten more aggressive. And we did that primarily in the Commercial business really throughout the quarter. Regarding the $1 billion, it's really a part of what Jeff Clarke had talked about last year in the June analyst meeting. I would say, as we've consistently talk about on this, it's a long-term program. I mean this is something we've talked about relative to 3 years. As you look at fiscal year '14, we will begin to ramp some of those benefits. I would say early on, much of that will be in COGS. And as you get later into the program, there'll be more opportunities around OpEx. But clearly, around 3 years and ramping throughout that period.",181

Could you be maybe a little more specific about which parts of the business you got more aggressive and where you think you gained share by customer segment, by region or maybe by vertical? And more importantly, do you view this as a lasting change in Dell's pricing philosophy in the client business or should we view it as more temporary given the vendor settlement benefit that you have visibility into?",79

I think this gave us an opportunity to do that, and I think we did capture some business and some of those are larger kind of long-term relationships that we think will pay off for us in terms of profitability and revenue growth going forward. I'm not going to be specific around where we did that, but clearly our focus has been on Commercial and really across the board in the Commercial business. And specifically around client, obviously, has been our focus. So I think it's going to continue to be a competitive market, no question. And I think for -- part of what we had to do is get ourselves in the right price position in some of these segments.",160

It's going to continue to be challenging. I don't think -- this is on the very, very low end of profitability we've seen in this business. I think what you'll see, I mean, we've seen good progress in that business around Enterprise, and there continues to be a good pipeline. And remember, it's not just federal. This is a broad public business that has exposure to health care, education and a broader global exposure to government. But I think you'll see us continue to work to grow the Enterprise mix in this business, and that's our focus to really improve profitability here. But I do expect, as you see the government spending continue to be somewhat constrained, that this will still be a challenging business for us.",133

Customer conversations would reinforce that. I would say as we sort of look at the back half of the quarter, I think we got a little bit more comfortable with overall corporate IT spending. And I would hope that as we head into the year that IT spending will be a bit stronger in this fiscal year than what we saw last year. And I think that's the broad comment across the portfolio, the data center, as well as the client environment. But clearly, we are still of the believe that there's a broad Windows 7-based refresh that will continue to play out as we move towards April of 2014 with the transition with Microsoft.",167

I think when you look at them individually, and I talked about China, India, Brazil. China, I would say, has begun to stabilize, and we've seen the market improve over the last 3 to 4 months. There's still, I would say not what we've seen over the last couple of years in China, but its picking up and we would expect to see growth as we head into fiscal year '14 out of China. I think Brazil, India, on the other hand, have been tougher. And I think the currency situation there has really compressed both of those markets, and I think they were significantly down. China on the other hand was closer to flattish.",117

If I take out the $250 million out of the product margins, the product gross margins dropped about 16.5%, they were about a little over 17% last quarter. So while it may have been revenue accretive, it looks like it was gross profit dilutive or maybe neutral at best. So can you just talk about the strategy of revenue versus profits, or maybe how much of the aggressive pricing is a function of having to maintain your unit volumes to keep the supply-chain scale benefit? Because it definitely sounds like we should maybe expect this level of gross margin going forward because of the competitive environment.",114

I think it's clearly, like I've said, last quarter we talked about where we were in terms of price position and expect it to get more aggressive as we sort of headed into the quarter. The settlement allowed us to do that. I think it is a bit of recognizing, we need to keep this business in price position, we need to scale it appropriately to ensure we have the right cost position and making some of that trade-off. I would say that on a gross margin basis, clearly was dilutive excluding the benefit of settlement in the quarter. And we look at these accounts that we were engaged with, where we actually were able to win business and see them as long-term opportunities for the company and see revenue growth as well as margin coming really outside the quarter. And I think that's the way we've thought about it. This is a bit of an investment in the business to ensure we're in the appropriate price position to grow and maintain our cost position, no question.",179

We -- as you know, Aaron, we don't really even track the business that way and we've given you visibility and transparency to those results on some regular basis. I guess what I would suggest is as we head into the first quarter results and begin to report the business on a product-by-segment basis, you'll get a lot more visibility to that. I think that business for us continues to be an important element of the portfolio. We think we can drive solid profitability and strong cash flow from the client business.

So I guess question is how do you feel like you're going to be positioning going forward if we do see more of this white box market start to emerge at some of the biggest service providers out there?",89

I mean this is something that we've seen for the last few years. It is relatively isolated to a few number of large-scale customers who can make the economics work. And given that, we're still seeing strong growth in our business and significant opportunities to continue to grow the hyper-scale business. So I don't think it's a new dynamic. I think it's one that we've seen, and the differentiation that we've shown in the 12G products actually is showing very well and helped us to gain share -- continue to gain share in service.",101

It looks like revenues were down about 3% year-over-year. Can we just talk about what was driving that and also to the extent you can talk about Services revenues that were client-centric? And how did that perform versus the non-client-centric services revenues? That will be helpful.,53

That's continued, and you see that in the results in the quarter. We've seen good growth to the security element of infrastructure, cloud and security, with security. And that's really the SecureWorks business driving 17% growth in the quarter. Support & Deployment, I would say, again, that is obviously going to feel the impact of the unit declines that we're seeing on the client business. To keep that business flat, obviously, it's taken some good work from the teams around the tax rates, around pricing. And so I think we've continued to see very favorable performance, especially on the Enterprise-type services side. So clearly, in a flat number there, we would've seen the client side of Support & Deployment down. And we saw significantly better Enterprise growth as we implement a lot of the support capabilities around some of the acquired Enterprise hardware capabilities in the business. So that's really how it's playing out. I would say we feel pretty good about the progress in the Apps & BPO, infrastructure side of the business in terms of improving profitability. And I think we'll continue to see progress with that as we move into the early part of the year.",235

With me today are Brian Gladden and Tom Sweet. The web deck is posted to our website in advance of the call, and I encourage you to review this and the related materials for additional perspective.
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements that are made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement and our press release and web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at dell.com and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Consistent with last quarter, we will not take any questions on the pending transaction to take the company private. Now I'll turn it over to Brian.",226

As we head into the new fiscal year, we continue to execute our strategy to be the leading provider of end-to-end scalable solutions. Our strategy is differentiated based on our focus on practical innovation, efficient and affordable solutions and our superior customer relationship model. 
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, down 2%. The Enterprise Solutions, Services and Software business was up 12% to $5.5 billion. Our continued focus on our customers and our ability to meet their needs with differentiated solutions is evident in numerous customer wins that Tom will highlight in the segment section later.
Over the past few years, we've acquired many new capabilities in areas like scalable storage solutions, application migration and software. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities additionally, and less than 2 weeks ago, we announced and closed the acquisition of Enstratius, which improves our end-to-end solutions capabilities by enabling our customers to more effectively manage and integrate their cloud environments. 
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Gross margin was $2.9 billion at 20.6% of revenue, which was down 40 basis points sequentially when adjusting for last quarter's vendor settlements. We continue to face a competitive pricing environment and have aligned our pricing strategy to invest in growth ahead of planned reductions in our cost structure, and this has affected our profitability. We remain focused on pursuing strategic revenue opportunities that will drive long-term profitability and cash flow. 
SG&A increased 4% and as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points sequentially to 14.2%. R&D spending increased 33% and as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points sequentially to 2.2%. Of note, there were almost $90 million in expenses related to the pending go-private transactions that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Operating income was $590 million or 4.2% of revenue. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 28.7% is driven by a greater portion of our business in higher tax jurisdictions during the quarter. 
Earnings per share were $0.21, declining 51%. Cash used in operations in the quarter was $39 million as the first quarter is typically a seasonal low for cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, down 31%. Our cash and investments balance ended at $13.2 billion as we repaid approximately $2 billion in debt during the quarter. 
Now let me turn to our operating segment results. As we announced in February, this is the first quarter we're reporting results under the new segment structure. We've aligned our operating segments to our end-to-end solutions portfolio in the Enterprise Solutions Group, Dell Services, Dell Software and End User Computing Group. 
Enterprise Solutions Group and the End User Computing Group received revenue from Dell Services to align our reporting structure and drive accountability in each of the respective operating segments. As a result, the sum of our operating segment revenue will not equal our consolidated non-GAAP results. 
In addition, there are unallocated costs that remained at the corporate level that are reconciling items between the total segment and consolidated operating income. The reconciliation of all these items to our consolidated results can be found in the tables that are available on the Dell Investor Relations website. 
Now let me turn it over to Tom Sweet who will take you through our new business segment results.",560

Let me take you through the financial results for each segment, and I will also share a few important customer wins. Let's start with the Enterprise Solutions Group, or ESG. This business includes servers, networking, storage and ESG-related peripherals. 
We continue to see strong growth in ESG of 10% on revenue of $3.1 billion and operating income of $136 million or 4.4% of revenue. Within ESG, our server, networking and enterprise peripheral business delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, which equates to 14% growth. This was driven by strong growth in our hyperscale data center servers. In this space, Dell servers power 4 of the top 5 search engines and 75% of the top social media sites worldwide. Our networking business increased 24% on strong Force10 results. This represents the ninth straight quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth in this business. 
Dell Storage revenue was down 10% to $424 million. We are focused on continuing to more effectively position the right solutions based on customer needs and optimizing our selling motion to improve revenue momentum. While we have made progress, we have more work to do in this area. 
The ESG market is rapidly changing and migrating to converged solutions that blur the lines between traditional product sets. A great example of this was a win with Statoil in Norway as our global capabilities and converged solution displaced legacy vendors in each of the traditional product sets. We are now rolling out a solution that includes Dell branded servers, storage and networking for their new data centers in 70 locations worldwide. 
The Services business includes a broad range of IT and business services, including support and deployment services, infrastructure, cloud, security services, applications and business process services. This business was up 2% to $2.1 billion. Op inc for this business increased to $370 million or 17.6% of revenue, up from 16.3% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. We have been reshaping this portfolio to focus on more profitable solutions that are aligned to our strategic capabilities, and we continue to improve our cost structure. 
Within Services, support and deployment increased 2%, with revenue of $1.2 billion. Enhanced and new solutions such as ProSupport Plus are adding capabilities to our portfolio that focus on proactively improving the performance and stability of critical systems by leveraging our expertise and deep understanding of the customer's IT environment. These solutions and strong attach rates have resulted in revenue streams partially mitigating the downward pressure caused by the decline in EUC hardware sales. 
Infrastructure, cloud and security services were up 11% to $612 million, which includes an increase of 20% in our security business. Security continues to be one of the top concerns of our customers, and we have continued to develop and deliver new and innovative solutions to accommodate the constantly changing threats. We had a 15% decline in our apps and BPO business, driven by a divestiture and select contract expirations [ph] as we continue working to improve the profitability of this business. 
Our Services capabilities, combined with our vertical expertise, continue to position us well to address the needs of our customers. A great example of this was a win with U.K.-based Locala Community Partnerships, a social enterprise that delivers community health care to over 400,000 people. Our solution focused on improving the management of patient records and simplifying their IT environment by delivering customized services, hardware and software through a cloud-based solution. 
Our Software business includes systems management, security software solutions and information management. This business delivered revenue of $295 million and an operating loss of $85 million for the quarter. Consistent with our prior communication and business plans, we remain confident that the Quest acquisition will be accretive in the first quarter of fiscal year '15 as we invest to grow the business. We're enhancing our software capabilities and increasing our investment in this business with additional sales capacity and R&D. Software is a glue for many of our end-to-end solutions, and it will play an increasingly important role in our competitive differentiation. 
Our End User Computing business, or EUC, includes desktops including thin client, notebooks including tablets, third-party software and client-related peripherals. This business delivered revenue of $8.9 billion, down 9%. Operating income of $224 million was down 65% at 2.5% of revenue. 
As we discussed last quarter, we are investing in acquiring new customer accounts that will benefit our long-term profitability and cash flow. We continue to expect relatively weak demand in this business and continued market competitiveness. These dynamics reinforce the importance of our cost-out initiatives for EUC, where we are targeting greater than $1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2015. 
In addition, during the quarter, we increased our investment to improve sales coverage for key areas of the business. The desktop and thin client business revenue was $3.3 billion, down 2%. The trajectory of the desktop business continues to improve as we maintain a strong position in the traditional desktop space and are seeing good traction with new desktop form factors such as our innovative all-in-one designs. 
Mobility revenue of $3.6 billion was down 16% as demand in this space continues to be pressured by customers diverting spending to alternative mobile solutions. We are encouraged by the industry-based enhancements coming to the notebook touch ecosystem, and we will bring new and innovative solutions to the market to enhance our position in this space. 
We are seeing a good ramp in our tablet-based solutions, led by our Latitude 10 business-focused tablet. Our third-party software in EUC peripherals delivered revenue of $2 billion, down 6%. A great example of our ability to deliver differentiated solutions to our customers is a recently awarded $60 million client refresh with Marsh & McLennan. We were able to offer a broad array of EUC solutions between our Latitude notebooks, OptiPlex desktops, as well as precision workstations and XPS systems for higher-end users. Our warranty, product quality, value and partnership were all key points of differentiation. We will be rolling out these solutions to 55,000 end users globally, displacing a key competitor that was a longtime incumbent. 
Before I turn it back to Rob, I want to remind everyone that consistent with last quarter, given our pending merger agreement, we will not be providing an outlook. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1061

We did that. You saw some of that last quarter. It was affected by the settlements that we had as well, and it wasn't quite as apparent in the P&L. But clearly, we've been focused on this for a while. I think there are parts of the business where we are beginning to see some elasticity. Demand has been, I would say, weaker than we expected as we headed into the year. And I think the reality is, in many cases, these are accounts that we're gaining that we feel very good about the long-term profitability and the impact on our cash flow over time. So while we may not see that showing up as a positive in the P&L in the short term, we think for the long term, it's the right thing to do to get ourselves back in price position, to scale the business. And I think as you look at the share dynamics that played out in the first quarter, we actually did improve our position on a share basis in a market that's pretty tough. So fairly conscious effort to position the business and something we've been working on for a few quarters now.",220

Is there a minimum acceptable level of profitability in the End User Computing Group that you are willing to sustain on an ongoing basis in your effort to hold or gain share? And related to that, you talked about making investments in advance of your cost cutting. I think a year ago, at your Analyst Day, you talked about this cost cutting. Given that you've started to be more price aggressive, why have you not been able to undertake any of this cost cutting to date? What's holding you back? And wouldn't it make a lot more sense to be doing the cost cutting and more aggressive pricing concurrently?",117
266017.0,"Dell Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, May 16, 2013",2013-05-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,2530.0,468325.0,21789570.0,Answer,Brian Gladden,,Executives,10,"Yes, Toni, look, I wouldn't -- without providing the details of the specific initiatives, I wouldn't say we haven't executed on the cost initiatives. I think we have continued to take cost out of the business. We are just choosing consciously to reinvest those dollars in sales resources, in R&D resources, in the Software business, things that we've talked about over time being important to the future of the company. So I think those things are going on concurrently. And in this time right now, we've chosen to reinvest those savings that we're driving as part of that initiative and the important investments for the future of the company. That's just what we've decided to do. In terms of profitability, and I assume you're talking about the EUC business, look, I think we're not managing that business for one quarter at a time. And I think there's a network effect to the impact of what we do there and the scale of that business and the customer relationships that we gain. We are clearly focused on cost in that business in this environment. We have been focused on gaining -- improving the growth of that business and gaining share. We've been able to do that. And as we execute on cost and continue to execute the strategy there, we're confident that will be an important part of the portfolio but not focused on a 90-day target relative to the profitability of that business.",243

Clearly, there are parts of the business, segments of the business, where we are being more aggressive, and we recognize that places where we have a strong foothold or historically have had a strong foothold and can ultimately build on these relationships and benefit the entire portfolio of solutions, those are places where clearly, we'd like to be a bit more aggressive and have over the last couple of quarters. I wouldn't say this has been an abrupt change, clearly recognizing as demand weakened over the course of the last year, we've recognize the need to stop shrinking at a rate faster than the market, and we've made those adjustments over the course of a few different quarters here and have seen the impact of that improve in terms of growth rates, and at the same time, impact short-term profitability for sure.",161

I think the other is some specific regions and subsegments of the market where we've got strong capability. And where we've seen good progress in terms of building out and adding salespeople, we have not hesitated to add more. And tracking the progress and productivity of those sales resources, making sure they're delivering and bringing new business to the company and really taking advantage of places where we have strength has been the focus. Clearly, the acquisition of Quest and the Software business has brought significant sales capacity to the company, and that's been one big area. And as you know and we've talked about a lot, I mean, the mid-market is a place where we have focused and added resources as well.",188

We're obviously seeing some of that. Michael Dell has indicated apparently that he's going to kind of endorse that approach in shift. So kind of on a scale from 0%, which is no change, to 100%, which is a complete change, are you kind of tweaking things now? Or do you feel like this is really taking it to the full extent that we're likely to see over time in terms of going after more of a low end strategy?",122

Look, Steve, I wouldn't say our strategy has changed really at all. I think tactically, we've recognized the need to be competitive. We've adjusted our pricing appropriately. We are expanding our offerings across the portfolio of really offerings at high-priced bands or higher-value products, mid-value products, lower-value products to play in key markets around the world, as we've done over time. And I think you'll continue to see us do that. It's not a -- this is not a new strategy. This is not a new business model for us. I would say it's adjusting tactics given what the market's doing and really where we need to be in the portfolio.",112

And Steve, I would say that I think it's fair to say that when you think about our portfolio of customers, and the vast majority of those being commercial customers on a global basis, as we've thought through our -- and made decisions to increase our focus on those customers, there's acquisition business that you engage in. And as Brian alluded to earlier, you think it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. But these are accounts that you have to go out and take a different tactic and a pricing strategy with them that's often to provide an entry-level into that account. And so I think you're seeing a little bit of that in the P&L.",121

One of them is just on the End User Computing side. I take the point you're not managing the business for the next 90 days, and that's kind of quite clear. I guess in terms of this pursuit of new customers, can you speak about where we are in that process? Have you put the investments in sales, pricing or otherwise you need to? Or is there significant more amount of effort to come through? That's kind of one question. And the second one is just the broad level. Given the uncertainty that's going on at Dell over the last few months, I understand that sales cycles may not have lengthened, but what financial impact would you say is happening -- having on either your results or on how you're managing your business from a cost perspective? I'm trying to understand, with the margins you're producing overall, now they are lower than we've seen for some time. And some of the markets, some of that, I think, has to be down to what's been going on with Dell. So any kind of insight there you can provide would be helpful.",202

We haven't changed the way we're running the business. The strategy for the company has endured, and I would say we continue to adapt that strategy given the market conditions and things that we learn as we go. But we have made no changes to the strategy in how we're running the company as a result of this process. I think that's clear. In terms of -- and it's -- I would say it's very difficult to quantify what impact the process that we're going through has had on the results of the company. We did call out incremental costs that we're incurring, the transaction costs that we've excluded from our non-GAAP reporting. But clearly, there is a chance to spend more time with customers and some level of customer -- just uncertainty that we're working our way through. That said, we feel like we've done a good job with that during this period. In terms of the EUC business and where we're positioned and where we are in that, I think, look, we made a conscious decision here to improve the competitiveness and specifically the pricing. We've got a lot of ongoing work around the productivity and cost structure of that business that will continue to allow us to be competitive there. And I don't think this is something that we think about as an initiative. I think it's really how we run the business and quarter-to-quarter manage the market conditions and the demand environment that we're in.",259

It's just not a 1-quarter or 2-quarter effort. You build the acquisition pipeline. You continue to acquire new customers, and you migrate those customers up through your business model and your other lots [ph] . So I think that process continues.",62

And related to that and on a whole strategy of attaching incremental products to that base, I'm curious to understand what's happening in Storage. It doesn't seem like you're getting that attached to the installed base that you would hope for in Storage, particularly with the Dell-branded IP. Can you talk a little bit about that as well?",89

Clearly, the Server business has had a nice run, and this for us is the ninth consecutive quarter of solid growth there. The 12th generation servers that we launched about a year ago have contributed very nicely to the ramp in that business. They have, as we've talked about before, helped us improve our average selling price in that business, move to higher-end workloads within the Server space. And that's all been part of a very strong progress, and we think we're winning in the marketplace as a result of the technology and how we're positioned with that product. In addition, when you look at density optimized servers, that market is growing very, very quickly. And that's, as well, contributed to the growth in this business. We see that as an important part of our offering and continue to make investments there. So the Server business is in a good spot, and we feel good about the technology. And it's not really a place where you see us trading at the low end. We price [ph] for growth there. I think we're growing on the basis of the technology. The Storage business, I think a little bit different discussion. We feel like that business is growing about in line with the market. It's shrinking at the market. The market is shrinking, and we're seeing that from the data that we see in the market right now. I would say that's not what we'd like to see, obviously, and that's not acceptable to us. We've got some things from an execution standpoint in that business that we are working on. We're confident in the portfolio. We've added commercial resources over the last really 18 months in this business, and we feel like we're positioned to actually outperform the market. Again, there's some execution things we're working through, and we expect to see that as we move forward.",318

Look, I think it's a good question, and it's one we spend a lot of time debating and talking about. There are multiple dynamics playing out. I think you continue to see a Win 7 on the commercial side of the business that's driving a refresh cycle. But at the same time -- and I would say even recently, we're seeing improved demand on the corporate and SMB markets. But you look at consumer, you look at government, you look at federal, those have been rather challenged. And it's some of the things we've been talking about over the last few quarters where you have competing devices. In some cases Windows 8 has been, from our standpoint, not necessarily the catalyst to drive accelerated growth that we had hoped it would be. We're encouraged by what's going to play out with new chipsets and some of the work that's going on, even within the Windows ecosystem to hopefully, over the next few months, create some catalysts. But you look at the recent external data from any of the third-party sources, we would expect to continue to see, over the next few quarters, year-over-year declines in PC demand. And I think that's -- we're trying to run the business based on that and be in a position where we're in this thing for the long term and we position the business for success for the long term.",237

Look, I think it's progressing as we expected. And as we said in the talking points, we expect to be accretive to the company in the first quarter next fiscal year. That was the plan we talked about when we announced the acquisition, and we're tracking towards that. I think we are -- the plan that we put together for that business with John Swainson clearly does have incremental investment, as we look at adding R&D resources, as we look at more sales capacity in that business, and it's got to grow into the cost structure that we have in the Software business. That's the way we're thinking about it. I would say we're tracking to that, and the team is making good progress there and we still feel good about this. Now, the operating loss in the quarter, that's sort of what we had expected as we put this business together and really got it started up. So we feel good about it.",165

Can you give us perhaps an example of how you determine which accounts are strategic enough for aggressive client pricing, at least the pricing that's beyond the norm in terms of discounting, and then what areas you may be more focused on profit preservation? I'm just trying to figure out where you draw the line, so to speak, in terms of profit versus market share focus.",83

I think we know where long-term strategic accounts are that -- where we can really leverage the relationship, and being in as a leader on the client side creates nice pull-through in other parts of the portfolio. In many cases, those are places that we've been before and had that business and in some -- in many ways, over the last couple of years walked away. So I would say those are obvious places that we know we can actually create a nice network effect for us and sell the broader set of solutions as well, including the services. So I think we've been somewhat selective and try to focus in that part of the business. There are clearly unit volume opportunities in places like consumer through indirect channels where we could sell a lot of units. But those don't really create, for us, any other profit or cash flow kind of benefits, and therefore, we're going to prioritize accounts where we can get that broader network benefit.",179

And we look at that in our discussions with customers in many cases, and they've pushed those decisions out. And they're sort of catching up now and have to get that done in the next year. Beyond that obviously, it becomes a broader opportunity around touch and how that plays out in the corporate customer base, whether it's tablets or whether it's the next-generation Windows 8 kinds of devices. So again, it's really up to us to create that opportunity and that ecosystem to drive that growth going forward with great products and great technology there. But I think that's clearly something we're watching, and it was, for us, as we headed into the new budget year for corporate customers, something we expected to see was some of that Windows 7 work had to happen, and we're starting to see some of that.",169
