266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981137.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I reflect back on this past year, it's increasingly clear that data and technology are essential to everything our customers do, and Dell is well positioned to thrive in this environment. Our FY '24 revenue was $88.4 billion, with operating income of $7.7 billion and EPS of $7.13.  
In a year where revenue declined, we maintained our focus on operational excellence, delivering solid earnings per share and outstanding cash flow. FY '24 was one of those years that didn't go as planned. But I really like how we navigated it. We showed our grit and determination by quickly adapting to a dynamic market, focusing on what we can control and extending our model into the high-growth AI opportunity.  
Our operating margin rate improved as we delivered higher gross margins with disciplined operating expense management. We focused on cash and working capital improvements, generating $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. And we improved our cash conversion cycle to negative 47 days exiting the year, a 15-day improvement. 
We delivered on our capital allocation commitments, and we have returned $7 billion to shareholders since the initiation of our dividend. Earlier today, we announced an increase to our dividend, which Yvonne will cover in more detail.  
We have positioned ourselves well in AI. We've already started to benefit from the momentum we're seeing. We saw strong demand continue for our AI-optimized server portfolio, including our flagship PowerEdge XE9680, which remains the fastest-ramping solution in company history. 
We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers, and the projected growth in unstructured data, where we are well positioned with industry-leading storage solutions. We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem, where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure. 
PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in our CSG business. Look for us to make a number of new product and solution announcements at Dell Technologies World in May, that will help customers get started with AI and make it easy.  
Turning to Q4. We saw positive signs in the business as we exited the year, but enterprise and large customers remain cautious with their spend. Our Q4 execution was solid given the environment, with ISG faring better than CSG. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion with strong profitability and cash flow. Operating income was $2.1 billion, diluted EPS was $2.20 and cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion.  
In ISG, traditional server demand grew year-over-year and a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth, and storage demand grew above normal seasonality, though down year-over-year as expected. Storage recovery typically lags servers by a couple of quarters. Our strong momentum in the AI build-out continues as we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build GenAI solutions that meet their performance, cost and requirements.  
In Q4, we saw strength across a wider range of customers and geographies with an expanding pipeline. AI optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion.  
Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. 
We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training and infrastructure requirements. They appreciate our perspective, our collaborative approach and the capabilities we can provide to help them create holistic AI solutions, including our end-to-end portfolio, engagement with our engineering teams, consulting services and financing options. Progress in this space won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity ahead.  
In CSG, we remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle as the PC installed base continues to age, Windows 10 reaches end-of-life later next year and the industry makes advances in AI-enabled architectures and software applications. In Q4, we maintained pricing discipline and managed our costs well in an increasingly competitive environment, delivering solid operating margins.  
In the near term, the PC market is still soft, and we expect the recovery to push into the second half as enterprise and large customers remain cautious with their spend. We will continue to execute our CSG strategy, which has served us well across various economic cycles, focusing on commercial and high-end consumer with a strong attach motion. 
As we enter FY '25, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turning new opportunities into incremental growth. We are well positioned with our unique operating model and a number of tailwinds. We are driving a disproportionate level of AI server growth, fueled by our technology leadership, engineering expertise, service capabilities, and our traditional server business is gaining momentum. 
Our storage business will benefit from the exponential growth expected in unstructured data, and we are bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle where we are well positioned. We are optimistic about FY '25 and expect a return to growth above our long-term framework. 
Now over to Yvonne for more details about Q4.",919
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981138.0,Presenter Speech,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11%, with strong gross margins and lower operating expense. Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.5% of revenue, up 70 basis points, with a mix shift to ISG. We saw increased pricing pressure in Q4 in PCs and servers, but remained focused on profitable opportunities, and we will continue to maintain that discipline and focus going forward.  
Operating expense was almost $0.5 billion lower than this time last year at $3.3 billion or 14.9% of revenue, down 12% as we actively managed our overall spend. Operating income was 9.6% of revenue and $2.1 billion, down 1%, with lower operating expense and an increase in our gross margin rate largely offsetting the revenue decline. Q4 net income was $1.6 billion, up 22%, driven by a lower tax rate and lower I&O. Diluted EPS was $2.20, up 22%.  
ISG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 6% and up 10% sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, down 2% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Server order growth was strong, with the majority of our AI-optimized server orders going into backlog. Our AI mix of server demand increased again sequentially given strong customer interest in GenAI.  
We delivered storage revenue of $4.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially, with better profitability as we increased our mix of proprietary storage software. Demand improved sequentially across the storage portfolio, above our normal seasonality. ISG operating income was 15.3% of revenue and $1.4 billion, down 7%, driven by a decline in revenue and a lower gross margin rate given the higher AI-optimized server mix, partially offset by lower operating expense.  
Our Q4 CSG revenue was $11.7 billion, down 12%, largely driven by a decline in units. Commercial and Consumer revenue were $9.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. CSG operating income was $0.7 billion or 6.2% of revenue. Op inc was up 8%, driven by lower operating expense and higher gross margin rates, partially offset by a decline in revenue.  
Earlier this week, we announced that Dell will have the broadest portfolio of commercial AI PCs in the industry and new XPS systems, which feature built-in AI acceleration with an addition of the neural processing unit, or NPU, helping to improve performance, productivity and collaboration. While PC demand recovery has pushed out, we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market.  
Our Dell Financial Services originations were $8.4 billion for the year and $2.5 billion in Q4, down 19%, driven by the sale of our consumer revolving portfolio and lower VMware resale. DFS-managed assets ended the year at $14.4 billion, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels.  
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, primarily driven by profitability. We ended the quarter with $9 billion in cash and investments, down $0.9 billion sequentially, driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion, and debt paydown, partially offset by free cash flow generation. And we reached our core leverage target of 1.5x exiting the year.  
During the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $74.67 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend. And earlier today, we announced a 20% increase in our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, well above our long-term financial framework and a testament to our confidence in the business and our ability to generate strong cash flow.  
Turning to guidance. There are several trends that give us confidence in our view of FY '25. First, the momentum around AI; second, the improvement we're seeing in traditional servers; and third, the aging PC installed base that is due for a refresh. The macro environment, however, is leading customers to be more thoughtful about their infrastructure budgets, particularly in the first half. 
Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY '25 revenue to be in the range of $91 billion and $95 billion, with a midpoint of $93 billion and 5% growth, above our long-term value creation framework. We expect ISG to grow in the mid-teens, fueled by AI, with a return to growth in traditional servers and storage, and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint, offset by a decline in other businesses. 
Given the higher mix of AI-optimized servers, inflationary input costs and the current competitive environment, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 100 basis points. We'll maintain our cost discipline and expect OpEx to be roughly flat. We expect I&O of roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.50, plus or minus $0.25, up 5% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.  
For Q1 of fiscal '25, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $21 billion and $22 billion, with a midpoint of $21.5 billion, up 3%. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 5% at the midpoint, with ISG up in the mid- to high teens. 
Gross margin rate will be lower sequentially given seasonally lower storage mix and a higher AI-optimized server mix. OpEx will be up slightly with typical seasonality. Q1 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15, plus or minus $0.10.  
In closing, we are optimistic and expect a return to growth in FY '25 and beyond with a number of tailwinds. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term, and we are committed to delivering against our long-term financial framework with average annual revenue growth of 3% to 4%, diluted EPS growth of at least 8% and a net income-to-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time.  
We are also committed to returning 80% or more of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over the long term. We're excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all our key stakeholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1044

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981141.0,Question,David Vogt,,Analysts,6,"I just wanted to go back to a comment that Jeff made in the prepared remarks about the unstructured data opportunity going forward. Just would love to kind of get a sense for how you're thinking about the storage opportunity as AI broadens out in your server portfolio. And how should we be thinking about the timing? 
I know, generally speaking, storage kind of follow service by 1 to 2 quarters. But with the AI opportunity, did that change in any way? And how you're thinking about leveraging your existing portfolio to take advantage of all this data that's being created?",101
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981142.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,7,"Sure. Thanks for the question, David. I look at it, and maybe in the simplest terms, to feed these GPUs with the data they need to train models, fine-tune models then ultimately drive them into production via inference is data, data-intensive. And we look at that sort of architecture that these things need to be fed and set an incredibly high bandwidth to make sure the GPU engines aren't idle. 
And when we reflect on what's happening in the marketplace, the training, a lot of training initially has been done in text. And as we get to richer data sets and we move into enterprise, which we would think the big opportunity is, as AI tracks to where the data is created, which is on-prem or out at the edge of the network, it lends itself to a growing storage opportunity for us.  
And I really like our portfolio. Think about what we've done with PowerScale. We recently launched the F710 and 210, where we've increased the write performance, we've increased the read performance, we've increased the performance around some of these high-concurrency, latency-sensitive workloads. It's aligned with what is going to be the growing need as this gets deployed inside the enterprise. 
And I think the same is true around our ObjectScale product, the XF960. These are the types of assets and capabilities that our customers are going to need as they really move from training to inference out into what we call the real production world, and we like our portfolio.  
You may have seen an announcement from us early in the quarter around a SuperPOD certified with Ethernet. We think that is an absolutely critical capability of bringing storage into the enterprise. Many and most enterprises are Ethernet based. That's a huge opportunity being in the marketplace with that and the new storage products that I referenced, I think, sets up quite well to be able to feed these new workloads with high-performance storage, which we tend to be the leader in.",335

And any kind of qualitative details that you could share with us.",79
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981145.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,10,"Sure. There's a lot to answer there. Let me start with maybe the demand. And you heard us talk about the demand up sequentially 40%, and that demand was across a rich customer set. The number of CSPs grew, the number of enterprise buyers grew. 
So for us, 2 important indicators is less concentrated this quarter than the previous quarter, with more customers in both the CSP category and the enterprise category buying from us. That demand was spread across the H100, H800, the H200 and the MI300x. So We sold a broad portfolio or a broad portfolio of silicon diversity into the marketplace for our customers. 
That's reflected in our backlog. And the backlog is hard to parse in the sense of a single lead time because it's now a complex backlog with multiple variants, the 4 that I mentioned, across deployments needed today, deployments needed through the balance of the quarter and/or balance of the first half and balance of the second half. 
So we have delivery dates planned on new data center capabilities or new data center build-out. So we're excited about that. Probably another important characterization about the demand and how the backlog looks is the pipeline. Really, we talked about our 5-quarter pipeline last call. The 5-quarter pipeline grew this quarter as well. 
So who we sold to grew. The potential of who we're going to sell to grew. The number of shipments that we had during the quarter grew, and the backlog grew. And we expect to ship more in Q1 than we shipped in Q4. I hope that was the color that you're looking for. 
And maybe the last part of your question is there's certainly a lot of energy and opportunity around these emerging nation state opportunities, building out AI and rebuilding their economies around these modern technologies. We believe we're in those discussions. We believe that's a very untapped opportunity in the marketplace. And we're certainly -- with our geographic coverage and our go-to-market coverage, I believe we're in the game.",340

Congrats on the good results. I guess, getting away from maybe the AI because I'm sure a lot of people are focused there, but I'm curious in your comments on the traditional server market. I know some of the Gartner data suggests we're still seeing overall units down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis in servers, offset by AI. But what's giving you the confidence or the visibility that you're starting to see the traditional server market recover? And just any thoughts on the pace of that as we look through the calendar year?",96
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981148.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,13,"Well, maybe a couple of data points, I'm sure Yvonne will add to this. I think we mentioned in our talking point, the traditional server business grew year-over-year in demand in Q4. It was the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. We look into the pipeline of the coming year, and it continues to improve. This is the longest digestion period that I can recollect in this industry. 
Everything is setting up for an investment in traditional servers to run traditional server workloads, which are very different than these accelerated AI workloads. So our line of sight into what our customers need gives us confidence that we believe that traditional servers are recovering. The question will be rate and what rate will they recover, but we're optimistic. 
A long digestion period, those workload is still very important, running mission-critical workloads in many of our largest customers all the way down to small and medium businesses. The performance that we exit or the momentum that we exited the year with, I think, gives us the ability to look going forward. And our internal modeling says that our traditional server market is a modest growth on a year-over-year basis.

I think you talked about gross margins being down sequentially, and the first cited reason was higher AI mix. AI was less than 5 -- AI services, less than 5% of your revenues this quarter, it probably will be next quarter. So for 5% of your revenues to have an impact on gross margins that you're calling out would, it suggest that AI server margins are really low. 
So can you, a, explicitly address that math where AI server margins are relative to company average gross margin? And can you talk about how you think about PC margins in fiscal Q1 and for fiscal '25?",116
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981152.0,Answer,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,17,"Thanks, Tony. Obviously, you know now we closed out FY '24 with really strong profitability. And moving into Q1, there's a number of factors that we're looking at. We've got CSG and ISG combined and expect them to grow about 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. We have total revenue at the midpoint, expected to grow and deliver at $21.5 billion or up 3%. ISG is expected to grow in the teens, driven by traditional and AI servers. CSG is expected to be down in the low single digits, so minus 3% about year-over-year. And then we get to gross margin rate, which I think is the key to your question. 
So we expect that to be down quarter-on-quarter, about 200 basis points. What are -- what is supporting that expectation? We are seasonally lower in storage mix. So that's -- we see that every Q4 to Q1. So that's one of the drivers. We will have higher AI-optimized server mix in Q1. Jeff already talked about that in a question. 
And then holistically, we have another few influences on the margin. We've got an inflationary component cost environment. We're moving from deflationary last year to inflationary in the year that we are in right now. And then I'd say there's more competitive pressure. We're seeing more and more of that. And so that's what we expect to be impacting the gross margin. 
And I'd say operating margin rate will be down quarter-over-quarter due to all the items I just mentioned. But for the year, we're expecting improved performance as the quarters progress. So I think it's -- we're starting this way with what we're seeing now. But again, we expect this to continue to progress as the year does.",289

And was just interested, Jeff, in getting the company's view on the opportunity over time to maybe participate in -- with the hyperscalers? 
And what are the reasons that -- I'm thinking to ask this is that what we're hearing as we get maybe into calendar '25, B100 of volume, the hyperscalers' real desire to sort of get fully integrated, rack delivered, fully integrated rack, something that the OEMs like yourself would do well, would maybe be in your warehouse. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And that's it for me.",115

I'll see if I can address the question. I mean the first thing you probably noticed in our web deck is we increased our view of the opportunity in the marketplace to $152 billion, 20% CAGR going forward to 2027, and quite frankly, that's probably a lagging indicator. It's still catching up. We think demand continues to be ahead of that, primarily driven as the overall desired demand for the computational components to do AI exceeds the supply picture. And quite frankly, is refreshing to see. We have a high-growth category here. 
That growth is happening, certainly, in the public cloud, but increasingly more so in enterprises, which is what, certainly, given our reach and the vast capabilities that we have in business to help customers adopt AI into their business flows, I think it's a big opportunity for us. It's where the data is. 83% of all data is on-prem. 
AI moves to the data. More data will be created outside of the data center going forward than inside the data center today. That's going to happen at the edge of the network, a smart factory, an oil director platform, a deep mine, all variations of this. We believe AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created, driven by latency. 
And we think about this, the opportunity is to get the training and fine-tuning, which is well underway now. But I mentioned earlier this notion about AI and production inferencing, running the actual tool in production to get the outcomes that businesses want. We believe that the enlarged or the untapped large opportunity, can't get my words in the right order, going forward for us. So this notion of enterprise, our enterprise customer base growing. 
We sold to education customers, manufacturing customers, governments, we've sold the financial services business, engineering and consumer services companies. We're seeing vast deployments proving out the technology. In some cases, they're using the tooling of the public cloud. And then they quickly find that they want to run AI on-prem because they want to control their data. They want to secure their data. It's their IP, and they want to run domain-specific and process-specific models to get the outcomes they're looking for. 
Hopefully, that gave you a rich context of what we're seeing across the customer base, the opportunity for us going forward. And this is at node scale, rack scale and data center scale.",406

How are you responding to that? Do you think that you're leaving any revenue or orders on the table if the financial returns were not acceptable or are we not anywhere close to that point yet? 
And if you could just clarify this acceleration in ISG growth that we're looking at in the next quarter. This quarter, server revenue growth was still relatively weak within service and networking despite a very strong $800 million in AI servers. So just hoping to think through how you're expecting the AI or non-AI server component of that in that ISG growth overall next quarter?",109

Look, the competitive market in PCs increased quarter-over-quarter and particularly in low price bands. So when we made remarks about us being selective or focusing on profitability, that's how to decode it in the PC business is that this -- the sub-$500 market opportunity is certainly less profitable, and we are much more guarded of how much we participated in that, which led to our share. We actually took share and midrange and high-end price bands in mature markets. So I think that's a component of this. 
When I look at AI and the comments around AI and margins, our margins actually improved quarter-over-quarter with AI. That's an encouraging sign. 
And there still less than traditional servers on a rate basis, but improving. It's the second consecutive quarter of improvement. So that's some color about what's happening in the marketplace. We did see in traditional servers that, in large bids, the competitiveness did increase quarter-over-quarter in Q4. We expect that to continue. That's not uncommon. Yvonne?",182

We're not seeing -- we're seeing -- expecting growth to return year-over-year in traditional servers, but it's a very competitive market, as Jeff mentioned.

We believe we will ship more in Q1 than we shipped in Q4. And as we look forward in our annual guidance, Yvonne has our best estimate of our demand and fulfillment of that demand that we've put into the annual guidance. 
To be able to parse it down in more detail, we have a product transition that was in front of us that we have to work on, H100, H200, to be specific, and we're taking orders on the new stuff as well as converting current pipeline on the current product, the XE9680 with H100 and Edge as well. So that's what we're working through. You might have seen our lead times have improved, that's reflective of the H100. And our lead times on the other parts are certainly longer. And that's where we're working our way through when supply, commitments and as the demand comes in. I hope that was helpful.",203

Jeff, if I could, I wanted to double click a little bit on the storage business. During the January quarter, just given the better than seasonal strength there, can you talk about whether that was driven by sort of the early wave of follow-on AI storage demand following several quarters of AI server demand? Or is that coming from traditional storage demand? 
And secondly, sort of looking here in the near term, I guess when we look at your PowerStore and PowerScale products, which part of the portfolio are your AI-focused customers spending more of their CapEx dollars on? And any thoughts on for every dollar server -- AI server being spent, is it like $0.50 or $0.75 or another $1 of incremental AI storage spending for the down line?",138
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2024",2024-02-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3565.0,3045744.0,110981174.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,39,"Sure. A lot of it, see if I can unpack that question into a few answers. So if we look at the demand that we referred to, which was beyond normal seasonality, we had year-over-year demand growth in the unstructured space, ECS as well as PowerScale. They grew quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year on a demand basis. Those are generally good indicators, as I mentioned earlier, around AI, file and object, which is the data classes that generally feed the AI engines. 
So when I think about AI and the now new products that I mentioned earlier with better read and write performance, better coherency performance in these complex workloads, better density, the 710 -- F710, to be specific, and F210 on PowerScale and the ObjectScale XF960, those are the types of products that go into these AI workloads. 
Our progress in traditional storage was good, too. We were ahead of our normal seasonality, what we had expected from Q3 to Q4, across our traditional storage business. Although we commented this in our talking points, it was down year-over-year, but better than we expected across mid-range, across our data protection products and our high-end storage products. 
And then if I think long term, going forward, as we look at the opportunity, and again, we referenced the $152 billion in our web deck, we've done some analysis that's available out in the public domain, but we're looking at an opportunity where every dollar that is for an AI server, GPU server, there's $2 to growing $3 of professional services around that, networking around that, storage around that. I won't parse it down specifically. 
But what's really important is there's a drag that the opportunity in the marketplace continues to grow, not only around the computational asset itself, with the network fabric that it's needed, the storage subsystem to feed it, and then ultimately, the professional services to help customers deploy it, but more importantly, figure out where their data is, how to prepare the data. 
And then ultimately, one of our additional value propositions across that whole spectrum is the financing arm or the ability to provide the infrastructure of all types, the ability to provide services around that and then the financing around it, we believe, is very much part of our differentiation in the marketplace, particularly as this scales to the enterprise.",391

I understand the traditional lag between storage and servers. But it seems like based on everything you said, there's a chance that storage continues to have a little bit more momentum near term relative to servers. I guess what is -- what am I missing in that, I guess, between going from inference to production type of workloads and seeing some of that extra $2 to $3? Like why wouldn't we expect better server growth -- rather better storage growth quicker this year, this fiscal year?",95

The opportunities as the richer data sets that are beyond text -- text today isn't very data-intensive and can be compressed quite efficiently. As we go to a richer data structure and data sets, this unstructured data opportunity exists as we move towards inference and in production. So that's the opportunity. 
To be able to call the rate of which enterprise will deploy AI at scale, it's all upside from my point of view. We are literally in the early innings of enterprises deploying and moving from proof of concept and understanding this helps them drive a massive productivity inside their enterprise and to allow them to really disrupt how they bring their products and service to the marketplace and how they serve their customers. 
Just like we are internally, many customers are going through understanding that and building their agendas. And this is a multiyear cycle. We believe that's the opportunity here. We've said publicly the productivity benefit alone is a once-in-a-generation or once in a several-generation productivity uplift. And then the ability to think about how you build products and build your services to serve your customers, there's tremendous capability here that we believe enterprises are in their early characterization and understanding, and it's a long deployment cycle that we believe we'll benefit from and that we're leading the industry in.",237

The inside baseball view here is we are leading the market, and we continue to expect to lead the market with our broad capabilities going forward. I believe it's reasonable at how we think about this internally, that we have our targets set on having a larger percentage of this market than we do in our traditional marketplaces. That's inclusive of the PC. 
I think one of the things, again, I think it makes us special and different here, we can reach a large set of customers from the smallest businesses in the world to the largest multinationals in the world. We can service the CSPs. We can bring them the hardware, the GPU servers, in the future, our AIPC, so all of the way out to the edge. We have a broad range of network fabric. We have the storage portfolio that's unmatched in the industry. 
Our 30-plus thousand service organizations with its -- service organization with the consultant and professional services, organization that we have servicing in 180 different countries allows us incredible breadth to reach customers, to deploy this gear wherever they might have it. The partners that we have with our GSIs and our go-to-market allow us further reach. 
So we kind of think of it that way that this is a market that's developing really aligned with the strengths of our company and allows us to extend our model in a very differentiated way, to access this marketplace in a differential manner. 
Not to mention -- I won't be shocked I said this, and I think our engineering capabilities here are pretty unmatched. And this stuff is really hard to tune these models, to build clusters, to get every ounce of performance that you're paying for is real engineering work. And we believe we have the engineering scale to help many customers do this.",314

I'll try to clear with that. Yvonne will help me along the journey here. What we talked about PCs is clearly a cycle where there's caution. You've seen that reflected in our performance and our upcoming guidance. So PC isn't an area where we're seeing the upside yet. Do I expect the PC market to be bigger in calendar '24 than '23? Yes. Do I think the PC market is likely bigger in the second half of '24 than it is in the first half? Absolutely so. 
Hence, our remarks that we believe the opportunity in PCs is second half-driven. That is primarily a result of an aging installed base. It's never been bigger and older than it is today. We have a version of Windows that's retiring. And we have hardware-enabled AI PCs with an application base coming that should make it an exciting opportunity to own an AI PC. So that's sort of how that one plays out. 
We talked about traditional servers. There's momentum there, 3 consecutive quarters of sequential growth in demand, first quarter in a long time of year-over-year demand growth. We exit with good momentum. We tried to reflect that in our guidance. That is in all geographies. 
Storage, better than we planned. It was good to see. That was across the unstructured products, as I mentioned, that actually grew demand year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and our mid-range data protection class products and our high-end products that performed better than we expected on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Yvonne reflected that in our guidance. 
That uplift in Q4 comes down in Q1. That's one of the challenges we have when we talk about the storage mix is changing in Q1 over Q4. And then there's just a tremendous uplift with AI. That is clearly the opportunity. It's large, and we believe we're disproportionately participating in it. And it's an exciting category, and that's driving tremendous momentum for us. 
Yvonne, would you fill what I missed?",329

I think the others have commented. I'll make our comment. The demand for these things is in excess of the supply. That continues certainly into next year. We're doing everything we can to get us much of that as we need for our customers. The methodology and allocation hasn't materially changed. We understand that. We're working that, and we'll continue to do so. 
I like what we've been able to accomplish thus far. I like our view with what I know at this moment in time for calendar '24, fiscal '25. I'd also tell you, it's a little more complex this year. Last year is basically the H100 show. This year, I think I rattled off 4 different variants, and there's a transition associated with that. 
Some customers will more rapidly move to that than others. We have to manage through that, and it's reflected in our pipeline and our pipeline conversion, and ultimately, our backlog and what we call inside the company are our delivery date schedules of what commitments we've made to different customers. We understand that. We know when we need the parts, we work through that. This easily continues next year. 
Obviously, any line of sight to changes that we're excited about what's happening with the H200 and its performance improvement. We're excited about what happens at the B100 and the B200, and we think that's where there's actually another opportunity to distinguish engineering confidence. Our characterization in the thermal side, you really don't need direct liquid cooling to get to the energy density of 1,000 watts per GPU. 
That happens next year with the B200. The opportunity for us really to showcase our engineering and how fast we can move and the work that we've done as an industry leader to bring our expertise to make liquid cooling perform at scale, whether that's things in fluid chemistry and performance, our interconnect work, the telemetry we are doing, the power management work we're doing, it really allows us to be prepared to bring that to the marketplace at scale to take advantage of this incredible computational capacity or intensity or capability that will exist in the marketplace. 
What I'm excited about is this continues to rapidly move to the enterprise. This continues to rapidly move to businesses, really using it to drive business outcomes. Again, that's what we're in business to do. Our large portfolio, broad portfolio allows, we believe, for us to do that in a very differentiated manner at scale. That's the opportunity. 
Someone is kicking in at the desk. I need to mention we got a storage opportunity in there, that we have a networking opportunity in there, and we have a services opportunity in there and to go for the last of the bunch of financing opportunities. So those -- how could you not be excited about that given the demand environment?",510

Thanks, Michael, for that. We are -- as we think through the full year guide, we are, as I talked about, thinking of not only the inflationary component cost environment, but the more competitive environment that we've been seeing. We are expecting -- we've talked about the dilutive rate impact within ISG of our AI-optimized servers. 
And so if we play that through, we're looking to have better performance holistically for -- at a company level, but I think it will be different by quarter. And especially with the mix we're seeing from an AI standpoint, Jeff just talked about all of the variants that are at play. And so expecting continued -- or expecting improvement as the year progresses from a margin standpoint, but it will be quite dynamic with the component cost environment and the competitive environment.",140

I'm really proud of the team and our strong performance in Q1. We executed well in an improving demand environment.  
Revenue was $22.2 billion, up 6%, with exceptional growth in servers and a return to growth in our commercial PC business. Operating income was $1.5 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.27. And cash flow from operations was $1 billion.  
We are uniquely positioned to help customers with artificial intelligence, and our strong AI momentum continued in Q1. In ISG, our AI-optimized servers orders increased to $2.6 billion, with shipments up more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We have now shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the last 3 quarters.  
Our AI server backlog is $3.8 billion, growing sequentially by approximately $900 million. Our AI-optimized server pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter again and remains a multiple of our backlog. We've seen an expansion in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions, which remains a significant opportunity for us given we are in the early stages of AI adoption.  
Traditional server demand remained strong in Q1. It grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year and the fourth consecutive quarter sequentially. Storage demand has stabilized with revenue flat year-over-year.  
Moving to CSG. Commercial PC demand has also stabilized, and we saw an improving demand environment as we moved through the quarter. CSG revenue was flat year-over-year with healthy operating profitability. We expect commercial PCs to continue to improve as the year progresses.  
We remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle driven by multiple factors. The PC installed base continues to age. Windows 10 will reach end of life later next year, and the industry is making significant advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications. We will continue to focus on commercial PCs, high end of consumer, and gaming, driving a strong attach motion, a strategy that has served us well across various economic cycles.  
Last week, we held our annual Dell Technologies World customer event in Las Vegas, and artificial intelligence was front and center. There was tremendous excitement around our approach to gen AI and the capabilities we are bringing to customers and partners as they set out on their AI journey. We highlighted our AI strategy to accelerate adoption of AI, which is built on 5 core beliefs. 
The first, data is the differentiator. 83% of all data is on-prem, and 50% of data is generated at the edge.  Second, AI is moving to the data because it's more efficient, effective and secure. And AI inferencing on-prem can be 75% more cost effective than the cloud. Third, AI will be implemented in a wide range of ways, from locally on devices to massive data centers, depending on the use case. Fourth, you need an open modular architecture to support rapid and sustainable innovation. And finally, AI requires a broad and open ecosystem to take advantage of the latest advancements.  
We launched the Dell AI Factory to help accelerate AI innovation and adoption. It combines our Dell solutions and services optimized for AI workloads with an open ecosystem for partners, including NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft and Hugging Face. The Dell AI Factory is the industry's broadest AI-optimized portfolio of solutions and services that can be designed and sized to meet the specific requirements of our customers.  
We also extended our engineering leadership with new features and capabilities across our portfolio, including the new PowerEdge XE9680L, an 8-way GPU server with 12 Gen 5 PCIe slots, and direct-to-chip liquid cooling that improves overall power efficiency by 2.5x. With its 4U form factor, customers can buy the densest rack-able architecture in the industry with up to 9 XE9680Ls and 72 high-wattage GPUs in one rack that can support performance up to 130 kilowatts straight from our factories.  
In storage, significant software updates to our PowerScale, which now includes the availability of QLC. Our PowerStorage software updates give new and existing customers up to a 66% performance boost and native sync replication for file and block. We also added the PowerScale F910 to our AI-optimized portfolio. The hardware and software capabilities has 2x faster write performance than our competition.  
We also broadened our networking portfolio with the new PowerSwitch Z9864 with 51 terabits per second of throughput for AI workloads. In client, we announced Dell's next-generation AI PCs. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite powers our upcoming XPS and Latitude 7455 available in June. These 45-plus TOPS PCs can support 13 billion-plus parameter models, which means customers can run popular models like Llama 3 directly on our PCs.  
In closing, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and to lean in to new opportunities like AI driving incremental growth. We are giving customers more choices, flexibility and control of how and where they build, train, run and deploy AI, closer to where the majority of their data exist, on-prem, increasingly at the edge, on device, and across clouds to help them accelerate AI adoption. 
We are partnering with customers on every step of their AI journey to make it easy with an open modular solutions and a broad ecosystem of AI models, tools and partnerships. We are applying AI internally across our own business for better customer and team member experiences.  
And now over to Yvonne for the financials.",889

In Q1, we again demonstrated our ability to execute and deliver strong cash flow and our traditional business has stabilized, with AI continuing to drive new growth. Our combined CSG and ISG revenue grew 8%, and our total revenue was $22.2 billion, up 6%.  
Gross margin was $4.9 billion and 22.2% of revenue, down 250 basis points given a more competitive pricing environment and a higher AI-optimized server mix. Operating expense was $3.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, down 3%. And we will continue to be prudent in our cost management.  
Operating income was 6.6% of revenue and $1.5 billion, down 8%, driven by the decrease in our gross margins, partially offset by OpEx scaling. Q1 net income was $923 million, down 4%, primarily driven by lower operating income. Diluted EPS was $1.27, down 3%.  
ISG revenue was $9.2 billion, up 22%. Server and networking revenue was a record $5.5 billion, up 42%. Server demand was even stronger with growth across traditional and AI. And our AI-optimized mix of server demand increased again sequentially.  We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year with demand strengths in HCI, PowerMax, PowerStore, and PowerScale.  
ISG operating income was 8% of revenue and $736 million, down 1%. Q1 is seasonally our lowest profitability quarter in ISG given storage seasonality, and we expect ISG operating margins to improve as the year progresses.  
Our CSG revenue was $12 billion, flat year-over-year. Commercial revenue was $10.2 billion, up 3%, while consumer revenue was $1.8 billion, down 15%. CSG operating income was $732 million or 6.1% of revenue, down primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment. The commercial PC demand environment improved as we progressed through the quarter, and we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market.  
Our Dell Financial Services originations were $1.9 billion in Q1, up 1% year-over-year despite the exit of our VMware resell business and our sale of our consumer revolving portfolio in Q3 of last year. DFS managed assets exited the quarter at $14.2 billion.  
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Adjusted free cash flow was $5.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, well above our average of $4.8 billion over the last 5 years as we continue to generate strong, consistent and predictable cash flow over time. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1 billion, primarily driven by profitability, partially offset by our annual bonus payout.  
Our cash conversion cycle was negative 47 days, flat sequentially, with higher inventory related to our AI business, offset by strong collections performance.  
We ended our quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and investments, down $1.7 billion sequentially, primarily driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion. In Q1, we purchased 6.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $108.38 and paid a $0.45 per share dividend. Since the inception of our capital return program at the beginning of FY '23, we have now returned $8 billion or 103% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends.  
Turning to guidance. Our open and modular AI-optimized server solutions, coupled with a broad ecosystem of partners and our engineering and services expertise, are winning with customers. We expect the AI momentum we've seen over the past 3 quarters to continue, driving incremental revenue for the year.  
In our core businesses, while the macro environment is still dynamic, our indicators point toward a stabilization with improvement as we progress through the year. Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY '25 revenue to be in the range of $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion, with a midpoint of $95.5 billion or 8% growth. We expect ISG to grow in excess of 20%, fueled by AI, and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year. We expect the combined ISG and CSG business to grow 11% at the midpoint, and our other business to decline, as previously discussed on the Q4 call.  
Given inflationary input costs, the competitive environment and the higher mix of AI-optimized servers, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points. So we expect both ISG and CSG operating margin rates to be within our long-term financial framework for the full year. We'll continue to be disciplined in our cost structure and expect OpEx to be down low single digits for the year.  
We expect I&O to be roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.65 plus or minus $0.25, up 7% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.  
For Q2 of fiscal '25, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $23.5 billion and $24.5 billion, with a midpoint of $24 billion, up 5%. We expect the combined ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint, with ISG up in the mid-20s.  
We expect OpEx will be down roughly 3% year-over-year. OpInc rate is expected to improve sequentially, driven by quarter-over-quarter growth in ISG and sequential growth and margin rate expansion in our storage business.  Q2 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.65 plus or minus $0.10.  
In closing, we are optimistic about FY '25 and beyond, with a number of tailwinds including AI and the coming IT hardware refresh cycle, and no one in the industry is better positioned than Dell. Our unique operating model with reinforcing competitive advantages has been honed for over 40 years now and is perfectly designed for this moment to help customers accelerate their adoption of AI. 
We have the broadest end-to-end portfolio of solutions with industry-leading positions across PCs, AI-optimized servers, traditional servers, and storage. We have the industry's leading supply chain with size and scale. And we have the industry's best go-to-market engine and an unmatched direct sales force, supported by a strong channel partner network, all underpinned by our world-class services organization that can support customers across the globe.  
It's an exciting time to be in technology and here at Dell, and we are looking forward to a bright future. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",1039

What are the lead times there? How does it compare with the total server backlog? And can you talk a little bit about the pipeline you have for AI servers and the breadth of the pipeline?",50
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3673.0,3148596.0,113170864.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,7,"Sure, I'll take that question. Look, the lead times on our product varies and is complicated. We have product transitions from H100 to H200, out selling GB200 and B200. Those are customer allocated. So to say that there's an average lead time for our product is very dependent on the customer, what technology we're talking about. 
But in average, if it was just looking at the availability of parts, the H100 lead time is better. Those products are in full production. NVIDIA's meeting the demand, and they'll have availability of the H200 on schedule towards the second or the latter part of Q2. So it's in production, as is the B200. So that's where the backlog/lead times are.  
When you look at the composition of our backlog, it's primarily NVIDIA-based. Customers range from many enterprise customers to some large CSPs. So the composition is very much our customer composition. We're excited about it continuing to build. It's continued to build every quarter. Our 5-quarter pipeline continues to grow. There's lots of projects out there. We're out competing for each and every one of them, and we'd expect growth in both going forward.",192

If I just look year-over-year at the ISG business, storage was perfectly flat. AI servers went from 0 to $1.7 billion, which sort of suggests that traditional servers were flat. So really, the only thing that changed was you added $1.7 billion in AI servers, and operating profit was flat. So does that suggest that operating margins for AI servers were effectively 0? And if that's not the case, how do you square the circle with what I just outlined?",81
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3673.0,3148596.0,113170867.0,Answer,Yvonne McGill,,Executives,10,"Toni, I'll take that one. So when I look at the overall ISG performance from an operating income standpoint, storage -- I'll start with storage, right? Operating income was low in storage. You know that Q1 is seasonally our lowest revenue quarter from a storage perspective. When the revenue declines, the business de-scales. And so we saw that evidenced in the Q1 results. And while OpEx remains unchanged, to the point you're making, the OpInc rates decline.  
In traditional servers, we saw strength in large enterprise and a large bid mix, so a shift there a bit, which, as you know, that drives lower margin rates. And when I look into Q2 and FY '25 though, I'd tell you that we expect ISG OpInc rates to improve, as we talked about in the guide over the year, and really deliver against our long-term framework, that 11% to 14%. So I think what we saw in the first quarter was multifaceted, but we do continue to expect recovery as the year goes on. And those AI-optimized servers, we've talked about being margin rate dilutive, but margin dollar accretive. And so you'll continue to see that evidenced in the results also.",199

There's -- the view that you guys have said in the past that for every $1 of AI server, there's $2 of services, storage and other higher-margin things that come. And when you see storage kind of a little below expectations in the quarter, it seems like you're yet to get that. And a lot of us are looking at the strength in your AI servers and looking forward to that gross margin tailwind to come kind of like a razor-and-blade model.  
Do you still see that coming to fruition, Jeff and Yvonne? And how will that play out in the model? I know you don't guide beyond this year, but it really should help next year over the 3- to 5-year life of those contracts. So I'm just wondering if you still believe that and how you want us to keep that in perspective when we see margins like this.",167
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3673.0,3148596.0,113170870.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,13,"Look, Ben, our view of the broad opportunities hasn't changed around each and every AI server that we sell. I think we talked last time, but maybe to revisit that, we think there's a large amount of storage that sits around these things. These models that are being trained require lots of data. That data has got to be stored and fed into the GPU at a high bandwidth, which ties in networking.  
So the opportunities around unstructured data is immense here. And we think that opportunity continues to exist. We think the opportunity around mix and switches and building out the fabric to connect individual GPUs to one another, to take each node, racks of racks across the data center to connect that high-bandwidth fabric is absolutely there and needed.  
We think the opportunity to extend in doing deployment of the rack itself is an opportunity, installing whether that's cables, heat exchangers, rear-door heat exchangers, cooling units, power units, et cetera, the cabling. We think the deployment of this gear in the data center is a huge opportunity. 
And specifically around services, there are 4 types of services that we're building through our own and through our partner network. They basically hit the categories of helping our customers with their AI strategy, how they implement AI, which is all around the data and getting the data prepared to be consumed and ingested, adopting or putting the AI infrastructure in place and getting AI adopted inside an enterprise.  
And then lastly, how do we help them scale it? I mean we look at the broad range of services that we have. We're pretty excited about the full-stack opportunities we have. A great example of that would be last week with the Dell AI Factory with the NVIDIA stack, which is a full-stack opportunity with partners like Hugging Face to help customers deploy on-prem. So nothing's really changed there.  
I think if I was to take the question that Toni asked and yours is in there as well, and I'll let Yvonne add to this, we can do better in both our traditional servers and our storage products in terms of margins. We had a mix shift in storage that was from our Dell IP to partner IP. That impacts us. We had a customer shift and a geographic shift that pushed margins down. Our most profitable segment is Dell IP sold in North America to the largest customers. They value the capabilities of our products and we get a return for that. That was a lower mix this past quarter.  
And then the traditional server business, the margins were down as well. And that was really driven -- I think Yvonne hit it, but I really wanted to make sure that we get this point across. We had good growth in our traditional server business. But it's been in enterprise, and that's a competitive market in large bids, and we acquired several new large customers during the quarter. We'll take that deal every time because we know over time, winning a new customer, we can sell the breadth of our portfolio over time. It's exactly what we did. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities to grow our customer base. Yvonne?",542

So it's going to take time for you to start seeing that reflected in the P&L as we're deferring services and support associated with the transactions that we're doing.  
And so again, you'll see that build over time and start seeing it more reflected in our financial statements.",91

But Yvonne, you're talking about improving ISG operating margins through the year. Obviously, it seems like the strength and momentum you have in AI servers means that will continue to become an increasing mix of revenue. You also have commodity cost headwind to contend with. 
And so again, I know we've kind of talked about this topic. But maybe on a bit more detailed level, can you just help us understand what are the most significant factors that we should be thinking about that would support ISG operating margin expansion as we work through the year? Is that pricing? Is that mix? Is that storage mix? Just help us understand what the most important factors there, again, as we look through the year.",137

I think it's all of the things that you mentioned, actually. But we talked about storage already that we did not perform or mix at the level that we would have expected in the first quarter. Jeff talked about having more of our Dell IP storage solutions, and we are expecting that as we go through the year. 
ISG and storage, in particular, the lowest quarter sequentially or seasonally is our first quarter. And so we're expecting that to continue to improve as the year progresses. We will be in a growth -- a year-over-year growth standpoint, and we're expecting that in the second half. So when I think of ISG growth holistically that we've guided to across the year of 20% plus, obviously, there's the AI server component to that, but it's also in storage. The expected growth in the second half is traditional servers continuing to grow, et cetera. So it's just -- it's additive as the year progresses, and that would be what we do see normally also in our traditional storage and -- I'm sorry, in our storage and our traditional server performance. 
And then on top of it, we've got the AI momentum. So that's a great adder to the portfolio. And as I already mentioned, as that balance sheet builds, we'll start to see that reflected with the services and support in our financial results.",232

We've talked, I think, much through this down cycle that the storage recovery lags servers. We expect the market to -- storage market to return to growth in the second half of the year and for us to outperform the marketplace. Yvonne mentioned Dell IP specifically, I would call out PowerStore Prime. The addition of QLC allows us to become more competitive, our performance, and have a native racks -- excuse me, native sync replication, get my words correct here, allow us to be more competitive in the largest portion of the storage marketplace. And our storage margins need to improve and will improve over the course of the year. 
And then as we look at the traditional server marketplace, we mentioned that much of our growth was driven by enterprise. And as the rebound continues to play out, we'll see commercial, medium business and small business, which are better margin profiles across that customer set.",166

And the one thing I don't think I called out specifically is that storage margins will continue to improve also because we will scale, right? We talked about the OpEx. We talked about that level of spend that we have. But as we scale that business, we will get that. And I'll reiterate that we do expect ISG OpInc to finish FY '25 within our long-term framework, so 11% to 14%.",72

Should we think that Dell is driving that more competitive pricing for share gains to get that incremental full-stack opportunity that, Jeff, you alluded to? Or are you doing this more in response to the competitive -- what the competitors are doing? 
And when we think about that 50 bps of incremental gross margin pressure, is that just coming from incremental AI server mix? Or is -- are there other moving pieces over there?",86

Sure, Jeff. I was just wondering if like the competitive pricing that you called out, is that coming really from Dell in order to take share in the marketplace because you have this full-stack opportunity that you spoke about? Or is this more in response to what other competitors are doing in the market?",55
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3673.0,3148596.0,113170881.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,24,"So let me take a stab at that and then Yvonne can certainly layer in on top of that. So I think there's various forms of competitiveness that we talked about. One, clearly, as the PC business has been in a down cycle for 2 years, as it's beginning to stabilize and look for growth, it's a competitive market out there. The consumer portion of the PC market, there's competitive pricing, there's strong promotions that we saw through the holiday season continued into Q1. The large deals in commercial PCs are quite competitive. And as I mentioned, SB and MB are lagging in their rebound compared to large enterprise, and that's a source of margin in both our PC business and our server business. 
In the servers, I think we made comments that the performance has been largely driven by enterprise, large accounts, large bids, acquisition, and those are competitive environments. Again, we look at the long-term view of them in winning new customers, and the data center serves us well over the course of a customer's life cycle with us. 
And then specifically in AI, we're not the price leader in AI. The engineering and the delta that we have and the capabilities of our product, time and time again, we are not the low-cost provider, the low pricer in the AI deals that I'm involved in, which are most of them. We are getting a premium for our engineering in the marketplace. We're getting an advantage. But these large deals, when you're talking clusters of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of GPUs, are a competitive environment. 
But we're not the one running the price down. We are, again, getting a premium for the value that we've generated or created into our products. And then conversely, I would tell you, in the smaller deals, our margins are substantially better, as you would expect. So in enterprise deployments that are smaller deals, our margin rates are significantly better than they are in the very, very large opportunities. And as enterprise continues to deploy, I think that bodes well for us over the long term. I hope that helps.",359

So the incremental gross margin headwind that we talked about of 50 basis points is really 2 factors. One of it is half of it is a margin impact, rate impact, and then half of it is mix related. So we talked about that we're seeing more AI mix, et cetera, so you're seeing the competitive dynamics that we've already talked about. And also, the inflationary cost environment is certainly having an impact on our gross margin rate. And given our AI server strength that we've seen, right, we're shipping more than we expected, so that's great news. And we're -- but it's leading to some margin rate dilution. I hope that was helpful.",130

And we do have Dell Financial Services, and we are seeing that being a differentiator right now in our working capital solutions that we're providing to our customers. We're able to put together what we're calling payment solutions for them, which is giving them different ways to manage their capital also. And so I think it is a differentiated advantage that we have that's enabling us, especially with some of these new Tier 2 hyperscalers, if you will, to leverage our capabilities and our solutions also, so both financing and from a product solution standpoint.",103

Just if you could parse it out into different buckets, that would be really helpful. 
And then, Yvonne, could you also just clarify that inventory was up dramatically in the quarter, and it's somewhat unusual for it to be up in this quarter? So just talk about what's driving that. And is it AI prebuilds or strategic inventory? Any help on that would be great as well.",98

So let me start with inventory because I think that's pretty straightforward. So inventory was up, and I would say slightly, to 25 days, really representing about a $1.2 billion increase quarter-over-quarter. We mentioned inventory was up slightly as we ramp our AI server business. So I think it's nothing substantial. I don't know, Jeff, if you have anything to add on that.",64

We obviously didn't sell those all last year. So we're -- really, it's even hard to have a full year compare on that since they weren't available all last year. But that is hyper growth as we've been talking about. 
From an overall server standpoint ex GPU servers, if you will, we're expecting somewhere in the mid-single digits for the year for server growth, revenue growth. And from a storage perspective, again, we talked about returning to growth in the second half, and so you'd see that sequential improvement as the quarters progress. So growth -- sequential growth in the second quarter and then both sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half.",126

Because we know a number of years ago, Dell had moved away from selling servers to the hyperscalers due to the limited profitability. I'd like to get an update on what the customer mix looks like today and if there's any kind of new concentration or what the exposure is to hyperscale versus Tier 2.

I can tell you, quarter-over-quarter, the number of enterprise customers grew, the percent of revenue increased, and the amount of dollars we sold to enterprise customers of AI servers and AI gear increased. 
Is it still in the balance towards the Tier 2 CSPs? Yes. Those are the largest opportunities. They tend to be very project-based or nonlinear, if you will. Those deals come in as they come in, a build-out occurs, the next opportunity, and then we pursue that. And we are involved in, I think, every one of those opportunities that are out there. 
We believe the opportunity for us long term, given our footprint and obviously our customer base, is the deployment of AI at scale in the enterprise. We continue to be encouraged by the growing customers. The number of customers that are repeat buyers increased quarter-over-quarter, indicating they are moving from more proof of concept into deploying. 
And then the long-term opportunity in the enterprise for us is inference, where you might recall from the remarks I made last week at DTW, long-term inference will be the largest use case or what I like to call AI in production and use, over the course of the decade. 
So the opportunity for us remains immense. We're excited about it. Clearly, the near-term opportunity in training is with the Tier 2 CSPs and the opportunity to take -- build expert systems, the ability to use open-source models, the ability to use your own data on-prem is clearly what we believe is happening, the opportunity, and we're there.",284

And I normally get the question, so I'll anticipate it, of what's the opportunity? Is this going to gap out? And we haven't even scratched the surface of that. So if you think about the Tier 2 CSP opportunities, our line of sight through the end of next year remains robust, a growing enterprise customer base deploying across increasingly more use cases, heading towards inference.

And we continue to work with them with our professional services to help them understand their strategy, what use cases are they trying to solve for. Consistently across enterprise, there are 6 use cases that make their way to the top of most every discussion. It's around content creation, support assistance, natural language search, design and data creation, code generation and document automation. 
And helping customers understand their data, how to prepare their data for those use cases are what we're doing today. And then once you do that, you begin to go build a set of capabilities to have [ it implemented ]. And how do they implement, well, typically, they're using information retrieval systems, whether that's RAG or vector databases or other techniques that are used in building these expert systems along with large language models to protect their data and to keep their data on-prem and to utilize their unique information to get the outcomes they're looking for. 
And customers are -- I mean, it's a large customer base. As you would imagine, they're in various stages of that. And we've just scratched the surface. The number of customers we have versus the number of customers that are buying AI gear from us, we have a lot of opportunity. And that's what we believe the promise is long term is that to be competitive in your respective industries, you have to deploy this technology. I think I've said it publicly. It's changing, it's disruptive, it changes the base of competition, it drives tremendous productivity gains. 
There's not a single customer engagement I'm involved in where those words don't get mentioned. It's how to help them get there, and they're in various stages of the journey. And I guess that's my long-winded way of saying, we're really early on in inference and have a big, big opportunity in front of us. 
And I'll reemphasize again, since it's been a subject of the call, we see in smaller deals where we're adding greater value across our deployment services, our vast capabilities around networking and around storage, margins improved across AI deployed in those environments.",379

The backlog is similar to the lead time question. It's somewhat difficult to parse because the backlog is across multiple technologies, H100, H200, B200, et cetera, even other alternatives. They have different customer commits and delivery dates depending on the priority, and the backlog clears as we go through that priority list.
We've tried to reflect the best of our knowledge of the availability of supply versus the priority, our time to the factories, in the guidance and outlook that Yvonne provided. That's about the best I can do with where the state of the backlog is. Our job is to continue to sell more. Our 5-quarter pipeline continues to look strong. It's built again. We're going to take POs. And that means backlog builds as we wait for parts. That's what we'll do.",144

Q1 was the deflationary period when we look at all of our input costs. And I think that's the last one for the year. We expect our cost to go up in Q2, all forms of costs, our freight costs, our component costs. And then we see a step function in cost in the second half of the year, driven primarily by DRAM and SSD. 
I'm sure you've done your checks. But if you look at what's happening there, you're seeing SSD and DRAM in the second half of the year up mid-teens to the 20th percentile quarter-on-quarter. That's what we think happens. 
Every indication, the lack of capital expenditure, low factory utilization and not a lot of wafer starts are going to lead to less supply than the market demand that will be out there. And the demand for AI servers and putting high-bandwidth memory in these, high-performing DRAM in these and lots of storage is consuming lots of parts. And as the backlog we just talked about gets built, we're going to be consuming lots of material in the second half of the year. 
So that's what I think happens in terms of we're going from the last quarter of deflation to now 3 quarters of inflation, a step function in the second half. It does place margin pressure on us. Again, we tried to reflect that to the best of our ability in our outlook. We've talked about this before. We generally recover about 2/3 of the cost over a 90-day period. We have begun to reprice things. Part of our server recovery is we increased price not too long ago. And we'll be looking at the cost structures of SSDs and DRAMs -- our DRAM across our entire product portfolio and adjust accordingly.",298

You sounded more optimistic about commercial client improving through the rest of the year. Maybe just share what you're seeing or hearing from your customers in that regard. How much of this is the prioritization of the replacement of the PC installed base or even sort of acceleration of acquisition of the replacement before the Windows end of life? And how do you -- what are you hearing in terms of enterprises evaluating AI PCs in that decision-making cycle as well this year?,96

Look, I'm glad you detected a bit of excitement after 2 years of decline. To have the business grow again was good. Yvonne and I often joke about this, one data point does not make a trend. We need a few more dots on the old chart to see a trend that we can call a recovery. But we're encouraged. And that's a good sign. 
Some other things that we, I think, talked about that I think are worth noting is that demand improved over the course of the quarter. The pipeline grew over the course of the quarter. We haven't had that in 2 years. We saw more activity in large businesses. That was encouraging. We still have an opportunity to see SB and MB pull along with that. So you can't call it a recovery until you see MB and SBs pull along with it, but we remain encouraged. 
I mean the 3 indicators that I called out in our remarks are what we see. The installed base has never been older. Four years ago today, we were all home, working remote, trying to mobilize our employee base to be remote. Those products are all 4 years old now. And that is typically when things get replaced and that's built up. It'll be the same through calendar '25, our fiscal '26. And that is a reason for belief that there is a refresh coming because the installed base hasn't been older and it needs to be updated. You have the additional component of there's an end of life of a version of Windows. History said, when there's an end of life -- or history has indicated, when there's an end of life of an operating system, there is a buying pattern to get update -- refresh and update it. 
And then we have the promise of what you said of AI PCs. We launched our first AI PCs much earlier this year with Meteor Lake across our entire corporate portfolio. We just announced a handful of new ones last week at Dell Technology World. There's more coming. The application base is building against that, whether that be what Adobe is doing, CrowdStrike is doing, what Zoom is doing, where you're getting more performance or more capability, or the announcement from Microsoft last week with Copilot+ where you can do things like search, recall, live caption and other exciting new capabilities that we think will drive ultimate demand for PCs. 
So that's the backdrop. I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that IDC, if you hadn't seen, took down the forecast for the year. Our internal model took it down a little bit as well. But we believe we continue to grow, as we said, low single digits. Work to do. We plan to take share and outperform the marketplace.",473

If I take your comments and Jeff's comments around AI servers, it appears that there's a modest linear ramp in sort of the AI server revenue recognition as we go through 2Q and the second half of this year. If that's right, what is the gating factor? I know you talked about it earlier and Jeff talked about different sort of customer priorities and time lines. But I'd imagine that you would have seen a stronger ramp in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. And if that's the case, are you seeing a stronger demand in 2Q that's impacting gross margins that affects sort of the guide for this particular quarter?",116

And Jeff hit on the dynamic environment and supply environment that we are experiencing there and the backlog that continues to build right now. So when I was talking about AI and how we recognize server margins, talking about them being rate dilutive but margin dollar accretive, talking about building the balance sheet up, so we're deferring -- we're selling these solutions with services, and that services gets recognized over time. And so we'll continue to build that up. 
So when we look at the deal holistically on how we're negotiating with customer, what benefit we'll receive over time, these are favorable deals for us. But again, in the P&L, you have to build up that balance sheet. We have significant balance sheet strength across our entire portfolio. And we're building this element of it as this is a new -- I'll call it a new start-up business for us. I don't know, Jeff, is there anything you'd add to that?",180

I mean you can look at many of the external sources, and you can see demand for AI broadly deployed. The industry is optimistic, whether that's token growth, whether that's data growth, whether that's the [ slots ] required to process it. What's happening is we build out these mega clusters to train next-generation AI models and applications. This is a demand driver for the course of the decade.",78
