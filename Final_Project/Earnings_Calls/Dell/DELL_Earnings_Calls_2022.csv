FY '22 was a historic year for Dell Technologies. In fact, the best in our company's history.  We reached more than $100 billion in revenue and grew 17%, a huge achievement for a company of our scale and ahead of our long-term value creation growth rates. And our opportunity continues to grow as we look ahead to FY '23. We are more vital than ever to our customers in an expanding market fueled by digital transformation.
IT investments remain a top priority for our customers as technology has become even more essential to their business. It's how you turn data into insight and action into better customer experience and competitive advantage. Customers also want choice and a trusted partner. Our position at the center of our customers' digital agenda and at the center of the technology ecosystem makes Dell the logical choice.
You can see in how we're winning with the customers like the Miami Dolphins, AT&T and Vodafone, with the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re, and one of India's largest manufacturers, Greenpanel, across data storage, hyperconverged infrastructure and in adjacent opportunities like multi-cloud, as-a-service, edge and telecom.
We are continuing to gain share in our core businesses and these emerging opportunities where we can bring our advantages to bear. We have differentiated ourselves through consistent performance across different economic environments, unprecedented challenges and unforeseen events, and we have leaned into new opportunities always with an eye toward our customers.
In FY '22, we delivered record revenue of $101.2 billion, record operating income of $7.8 billion, diluted EPS of $6.22 and record cash flow from operations of $7.1 billion, truly a record year.
And Q4 was no different. We saw 17% growth in demand of our products and services in the quarter with broad growth across geos, industry vertical and business units. As a result, we delivered record revenue up 16%.
Operating income was a record, up 1%, but slightly below our November guidance as we optimized our performance based on customer needs, parts availability and backlog dynamics.
Being trusted partners to our investors and lenders as well as our customers is important to us. And in FY '22, we unlocked shareholder value by the spin of VMware; simplifying our capital structure; deleveraging our balance sheet, returning to investment-grade ratings; approving a share buyback program for up to $5 billion; and today, announcing a quarterly dividend at an initial annual rate of $1.32 a share.
Now let me shift gears and share a little color on the current supply chain dynamics, and then we will move into BU performance. The global supply chain shortage of semiconductors and global logistics challenges for goods and components continues to impact just about every industry. We are still experiencing shortages of integrated circuits across a wide range of devices, including network controllers and microcontrollers, that go into our products and solutions. The result, we are seeing an impact across client systems, servers and storage.
In addition, freight costs have continued to rise due to increased logistics rates, a higher mix of air due to ocean network congestion and increase in part expedites to meet customer needs. We have reduced our PC backlog over the last 2 quarters, and it is nearing the high end of its normal range. However, we expect PC backlog to grow in Q1.
Our higher-margin ISG backlog increased again in Q4 to a record level due to a combination of very strong demand and the lack of compounded availability. We expect our ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of the year as part shortages continue.
As we head into Q1, we do expect component cost to improve with modest deflation while freight costs remain elevated. We are awaiting information from the recent NAND contamination announcement from Kioxa and Western Digital to evaluate the impact on Dell.
Our supply chain speed, agility and flexibility has enabled us to meet customer needs in this environment though challenges remain. And our supply chain continues to be a durable competitive advantage as we navigate the unprecedented supply uncertainty.
Turning to CSG. Our PC business logged another record year. We delivered record revenue of $61.5 billion, up 27%; record operating income of $4.4 billion or 7.1% of revenue; record unit shipments of 59.3 million units in calendar '21, up 18%, growing faster than any of the top 3. And calendar year 2021 commercial share growth was up 70 basis points, more than any of the top 3, and has now been up 470 basis points over the last 5 years.
Turning to Q4. We delivered our sixth consecutive record CSG revenue quarter with $17.3 billion, up 26%, with healthy demand, up 21%. Operating income was a record of $1.2 billion. We shipped a record 17.2 million PCs in calendar Q4, up 9%, and now have gained share in 32 of the last 36 quarters. Our leading innovation continues to build a strong foundation for future CSG results.
We won 47 awards at CES in January where we introduced our new XPS 13, our thinnest-ever gaming notebook, the Alienware 14, and an advanced commercial notebook concept built around sustainability, recyclability and reuse. Hybrid work, learning, shopping, socializing, entertainment and travel is all here to stay. And we expect commercial PC and premium consumer growth in FY '23, albeit at moderating rate relative to a record year. 
Clearly, CSG had a fantastic year, and we are well positioned heading into FY '23 as the client systems TAM has reset to a higher level.
I am very proud of our FY '22 results, our team and the company and the culture we've created. And I'm incredibly excited about the road ahead with all of you. We expect another year of growth as we modernize the data center with automation and intelligence, deploy IT at the edge and simplify multi-cloud for our customers.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck for some color on ISG and our growth initiatives. Chuck?",1000
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2022",2022-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3715.0,2506984.0,95078155.0,Presenter Speech,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Jeff. FY '22 was, indeed, one for the record books. We're in a privileged strategic position. We ended the year with great momentum, and we're incredibly optimistic about FY '23 and beyond.
Turning to full year ISG results. Fiscal '22 revenue was $34.4 billion, up 4% for the year and underpinned by 4 consecutive quarters of growth. Widespread digital transformation continues to accelerate growth in infrastructure spend, and we were encouraged by growing demand across our portfolio of ISG solutions.
Specifically, FY '22 storage orders grew at the fastest rate since the EMC acquisition, and all geographies grew storage for the year. Midrange storage orders were up double digits in FY '22, and PowerStore remains the fastest-ramping storage product in our company's history. And demand for our leading server products accelerated over the course of the year, culminating with record server demand in Q4.
ISG operating income was $3.7 billion, flat year-over-year as both ISG revenue and margin were gated by supply constraints and corresponding backlog growth. As Jeff highlighted, we will continue to navigate the challenging supply environment with our differentiated business model, our advantaged supply chain, our product design flexibility, and our unique direct go-to-market, which creates a high-quality demand signal and gives us the ability to shape demand to where we have supply.
Turning to Q4. Our final fiscal quarter of FY '22 was a microcosm of ISG's year, with strengthening demand across our storage and server portfolios. ISG demand was up 17% with revenue up 3% to $9.2 billion. Storage demand growth was up for a third consecutive quarter and in the high single digits.
Our leading storage portfolio, where we're #1 in high-end, midrange, entry, unstructured, object, all-flash, HCI and data protection, enabled us to capture growth across a variety of storage architectures and customer sizes. For example, we saw double-digit demand growth in the high end, driven by select enterprise customers, 25% demand growth for our unstructured storage solutions and 8% growth for HCI despite a tough year-over-year comparison.
Within midrange, PowerStore demand continued to ramp in Q4, up 34% sequentially and now approximately 50% of our midrange SAN mix. Encouragingly, 26% of PowerStore buyers are new to Dell storage, and 29% were repeat buyers, important leading indicators of future growth. Servers and networking revenue was up for a fifth consecutive quarter, up 7%.
Storage revenue was roughly flat year-over-year due to the aforementioned backlog build and storage software and services content that gets deferred and amortized over time. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% due primarily to backlog growth, component inflation and logistics costs. We continue to take pricing actions to mitigate cost increases, though component shortages and turbulent logistics markets remain risks that we are actively managing.
In summary, FY '22 was a solid year for ISG as infrastructure markets rebounded, the business returned to growth, our leading indicators of server and storage demand were ahead of revenue, and our integrated business model continues to deliver despite challenging supply dynamics. ISG is poised for a strong FY '23, given the momentum in the business. Tom will share thoughts on forward guidance in a moment.
Before handing over to Tom, let me touch briefly on our priority growth initiatives. At our September analyst meeting, we highlighted multiple growth opportunities both inside and outside our core business, including over $650 billion in TAM adjacent to our core, where our asset positions and durable competitive advantages give us a right to win. These are distinct markets like edge and telco but also growth opportunities like our APEX branded as-a-service solutions that provide a modern consumption experience to our customers. Customers can buy our solutions, subscribe to our solutions and select from different types of services, including fully managed service offerings, depending on their needs.
FY '22 was an important year as we launch solutions in these spaces, engage customers and made investments that positioned us for future growth. We were pleased with our strategic technical and commercial momentum in these businesses. In particular, we saw a rapid acceleration of our APEX Flex on Demand subscription offering as the year progressed, an important market indicator that our APEX strategy is resonating with customers. We also delivered a steady stream of innovations and customer wins in edge and telco in FY '22, giving us conviction in our long-term strategy.
Noteworthy in Q4 was the expansion of our APEX Cloud Services portfolio with 2 new offers: APEX Multi-cloud Data Services, which delivers storage and data protection as-a-service with simultaneous access to all major public clouds through a single console. The solution allows customers to access the cloud services they want while maintaining control of their data on-premise, avoiding lock-in and egress fees and enabling customers to meet regulatory and compliance requirements; and APEX Backup Services, which provides scalable, secure data protection with centralized monitoring and management for SaaS applications, endpoints and hybrid workloads. The solution offers all-in-one protection with backup, disaster recovery and long-term data retention in a 100% SaaS-based offering with no infrastructure to manage.
FY '23 will be about continuing to push the innovation agenda in APEX, telco, edge and multi-cloud. As these growth initiatives become more actually material, we will provide more detail.
In closing, we enter FY '23 in a solid demand environment across our businesses and with a lot of confidence.
And with that, I will turn it over to Tom.",901

In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $28 billion, up 16%, driven by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG, with demand for servers and storage well ahead of revenue.
Gross margin was $5.8 billion, flat year-over-year at 20.8% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 320 basis points lower primarily due to higher-than-anticipated component and logistics costs and higher CSG mix. We continue to take pricing actions to manage the impact of commodity and logistics cost variability. Part shortages and supply chain risks remain across the economy, and we expect ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of fiscal '23.
Operating expense was $3.6 billion, roughly flat year-over-year at 13% of revenue with the full year fiscal year '22 OpEx rate at 14.7%. We continue to invest for long-term growth but did benefit from lower compensation and benefits in the period.
Looking ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect OpEx as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher than fiscal year '22 as we invest in the business, employees return to work, and we engage in more business-related travel.
Operating income was a record $2.2 billion, up 1% at 7.8% of revenue. This was slightly lower than our November guidance given the impact of supply chain disruptions.
Net income was $1.4 billion, up 2%, with growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to the reduced debt balances, offset by an increase in our effective tax rate.
Our tax rate was 25.1%, higher than we expected at the time of our Q3 earnings call. The higher rate was driven by corporate transactions, including the refinancing and tender we executed in December. The combined effect reduced income in higher tax jurisdictions, resulting in lower utilization of available tax credits. The total tax impact was a reduction of approximately $0.19 to diluted non-GAAP EPS.
Fully diluted EPS was $1.72, down 2%, with diluted share count increasing to 810 million shares as a result of the VMware spin.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion, up 3% at 9.6% of revenue and was $9.7 billion, up 12%, for the full year.
Our recurring revenue is approximately $5 billion a quarter, up 12%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 20%, and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue.
Dell Financial Services originations in Q4 were $2.7 billion, up 12%. DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total managed assets.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We generated strong cash flow as our cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion in Q4, mainly driven by top line growth and $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Q4 adjusted free cash flow was $3 billion.
We are happy with the disciplined management of our working capital, although we continue to see higher inventory levels given the supply chain dynamics and component availability. We expect inventory balances to come down as the supply chain situation improves over the coming year.
We repaid $10.6 billion of debt in Q4, funded primarily with $9.3 billion in VMware dividend proceeds, and retired $1.7 billion in existing long-dated, high-coupon notes, funded through $2.25 billion in new bonds and balance sheet cash. The refinancing activity will save approximately $70 million in annual interest expense.
We exited Q4 with a core debt balance of $16.1 billion and a cash and investments balance of $11.3 billion.
Turning to capital allocation. As we have previously mentioned, we intend to return, on average, 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over time. We repurchased 11.6 million shares of Class C common stock in Q4, totaling $659 million. And our intent is to continue buying shares going forward programmatically as we manage dilution and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, consistent with our capital allocation framework.
Additionally, since the end of Q4 and through the close of business last Friday, we have repurchased an additional 4.2 million shares for $248 million. Program to date, we have repurchased approximately 5.4% of the outstanding Class C common stock. To complement our share repurchase program, our Board has approved a Q1 dividend of $0.33 per share.
We expect the cash impact of our quarterly dividend payments to be approximately $1 billion or roughly $1.32 per share for the full year, and we expect to have the opportunity over time to grow our dividend at least consistent with our long-term EPS growth in each case, subject to future Board approvals.
For more details on the dividend announcement, please review today's press release and Form 8-K. Alongside capital return to shareholders, we will continue to invest in the business, delever toward our 1.5x gross core leverage goal and pursue targeted M&A.
Before I provide thoughts on Q1 and full year guidance, I would like to invite Jeff back for a few comments on Ukraine.",821

Regarding Ukraine. First and foremost, our thoughts are with those families who have lost loved ones and all who are impacted. Our top priority at this time is supporting our Ukrainian team members as they attempt to relocate to a safe and secure environment. We are closely monitoring things and are working with employees to address their personal and family situations.
As for business operations in the region, the situation is rapidly evolving, and we will share more details as they become available.
Back to you, Tom.",89

Turning to Q1 and fiscal year '23. We're optimistic about the overall macroeconomic environment with global IT spending projected in the mid-single digits. Digital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look to Dell as their partner in their multi-cloud journey.
Against that backdrop, we expect Q1 revenue between $24.5 billion and $25.7 billion, up 11% at the midpoint, with CSG and ISG growing.
For non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points, driven by higher overall U.S. tax on foreign earnings and lower interest expense going forward. This guidance assumes U.S. rates are not affected by any tax reform. And based on my earlier share repurchase commentary, we expect Q1 diluted share count between 785 million to 790 million shares.
Netting this out, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, up 2% at the midpoint. I recognize that our EPS range is slightly wider than normal, but given a more dynamic component availability in logistics environment and elevated backlog, particularly in ISG, I believe it is appropriate.
For fiscal year '23, we're coming off a very strong year with record performance in fiscal year '22. As a starting point, we suggest you align fiscal year '23 financial expectations with our long-term value creation framework, and we will provide an updated perspective on the year as we move forward.
As a reminder, that's revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range and EPS growth at 6% or better over the long term. We also expect to deliver solid free cash flow and return significant capital back to shareholders with our announced dividend and share buybacks.
As we think about Ukraine, I will reiterate that, first and foremost, our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted and supporting our team members in the region as we closely monitor the developing news there. While our direct revenue exposure to Ukraine and Russia is minimal on a percentage basis, it is too early to determine any broader potential impact to our Q1 guidance and our initial thoughts on fiscal year '23.
In closing, we delivered an extraordinary year with record revenue, operating income, EPS and cash flow. We delivered significant shareholder value through the spinoff of VMware, the sale of Boomi and disciplined and consistent debt paydown, resulting in an investment-grade rating. We also introduced a comprehensive capital allocation framework and began shareholder capital return actions with share buybacks and the announcement of a dividend.
We remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",475

And given the pressures you're seeing on components and obviously, the questions geopolitically and everything that's going on right now, how should we think about timing of the benefit of these price increases to run through both CSG and ISG? And also, if you can talk about whether or not you think the moves will be sufficient enough to offset inflation and the component costs or if there -- at some point, you -- or maybe nobody knows, but at some point, you start to see some pushback because of elasticity of demand.",110
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2022",2022-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3715.0,2506984.0,95078162.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,10,"Shannon, let me chat a little bit about that, then I'll ask Jeff and potentially Chuck to weigh in as well. So Look, in general, as you think about management of price increases, what we have been doing as we see costs that are -- that have been moving upward on us, effectively, given the volatility we're seeing particularly in the semiconductor space and the dynamics of when parts are arriving at our various factories, we have been adjusting prices as appropriate. I think part of the dynamic that we're seeing right now, though, is that given the fact that we do have elevated backlog, any price increases you're seeing are generally somewhat muted as you think through the impact to the P&L, given that it's got a flow-through backlog.
And so to the extent you have elevated backlog, which we clearly do in ISG and we're at the upper end of what we would characterize as the new normal in CSG, that's going to be a bit of a headwind in terms of the pricing activities ultimately manifesting themselves in the P&L.
But our perspective is, look, to adjust prices as appropriate, we're always mindful of the market dynamic, to your point around elasticity, but we're also in an inflationary environment, which we're in, and we see that across multiple industries, as you would all know, it's appropriate that we readjust pricing and make sure that we're getting appropriate value for our solutions.
Jeff or Chuck, I don't know if you would add anything to that.",257
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2022",2022-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3715.0,2506984.0,95078163.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,11,"Maybe a couple of comments, Shannon. One is, as we look at total input costs, we just went through an inflationary period in Q4. We think component costs go down slightly in Q1, offset by a flat to probably slightly increasing logistics costs to move material around to the factories when they're delivered. So one of our biggest challenges that we've been working through is chasing those costs that are associated with the volatility, the uncertainty of when parts show up out of factories that we can move them to our subassembly facilities to turn them ultimately into finished products.
And it's that volatility, if you will, or uncertainty that we're -- certainly is catching us a little bit, maybe a surprise. We didn't see as much expedites of moving material around, which led to some of the compression in margin that you -- we've talked about. And so it's that precise thing that we're trying to get even more accurate about.
When you look at the pricing environment that we're operating in today, as costs go up, it's being transferred into price. Whether that's commercial PCs, whether that's the premium consumer side of our business, we're seeing the same thing broadly across the server base, and the same is true in our storage base. So that cost is being transferred into price as efficiently as we can where we understand it and we could be planful and mindful. It's that volatility and uncertainty that is, I don't know if it's the right word to describe it, that it can't plan for it and we're responding as fast as we can. And the higher levels of backlog, it's less efficient at capturing it. I hope that helped.",287

Is that what's sort of underpinning sort of the long-term framework sort of the reiteration that we're thinking about? And if so, is there a way to quantify potentially what that revenue impact is from supply chain right now? I know it's sort of a difficult question to answer, but just trying to get a sense for how revenue is being held back by the supply chain at this point.",123

And as we think about the year right now, and let me reiterate that we're optimistic about the year from a demand environment perspective with what we know today, that we do expect -- the guidance I gave you around Q1 revenue and a midpoint of 11% year-over-year growth, we will continue to work our way through the supply chain dynamics. But particularly within -- first with ISG, we do expect those headwinds to be with us at least through the first half of the year, right?
And so I think you've got -- as we laid out the long-term guidance for you, I want you to think about how your sequentials interact as we go through the year, but I think a good starting point is the long-term framework. And clearly, as the situation becomes clearer in terms of the logistics dynamics that -- and the supply chain that we're seeing, we'll update you.
The other point I'd like to make, though, is around -- although we've talked about ISG backlog being at an elevated level, we do expect, quite frankly, a little bit of headwind in the CSG space in Q1 with -- particularly with desktops, given some of the component shortages we're seeing. So those are the navigation that we're going to have to do as we work our way through the first quarter and, quite frankly, I think the first half, but optimistic about the year. And as you work your way through your modeling, I think just keep in mind that the concept of perhaps normal sequentials aren't quite as -- it's been a few years of variability as we've worked our way through the year.

I was wondering how you're thinking about the growth. How concerned are you about inventory levels? I know you noted that CSG backlog is expected to improve -- increase here in the near term. And any help you can give us about how you're thinking about ASP trends as well, given the moving pieces on the commodity environment?",73

I think that was 3 different questions. I'll try to get to all of them. So first off, if we step back and we look at the environment, we've just gone through 3 consecutive years of growth getting the PC industry back to roughly 350 million units, and the TAM we believe has been reset. And if you look at where a large percentage of that growth has come from, it's come from commercial PCs and consumer PCs, generally an area that we're very strong in. Commercial PCs represent roughly 75% of our revenues.
Our view is those 2 premium sectors continue to grow. In calendar '22 or fiscal '23, we have commercial PCs growing mid-single digits, and we have premium consumer PCs growing low single digits. We obviously expect to take share on top of those numbers. Where the pressure will be is in low end and mid-consumer price bands and in Chrome. You've heard us probably talk about this. Not all units are created equal. Some units are more valuable than others. We believe we play in the most valuable space, commercial PCs and premium consumer PCs. So we're optimistic that we grow those valuable sectors, so the market grows in those valuable sectors, and we can continue to be a consolidator there.
If we look at the ASP trends, the ASP trends have continued to move up as the commodity base has been inflationary. And then clearly, what I mentioned earlier, the increased cost in moving material, moving parts associated with logistics costs, have certainly driven a pricing action as well.
The pricing environment that we see today that I mentioned a little bit earlier is there is pressure as inventory levels come back to norm on midrange to low-end consumer price bands and into Chrome. We still see challenges in getting all of the material for the premium price points in consumer and in commercial. So that's why Tom just made a reference, for example, in desktops and displays, we actually see backlog building demand ahead of supply, if you will, in Q1 as we've spent the last 2 quarters, reducing the backlog of our PC business.
And in terms of absolute inventory, we've continued to take material we know that we need because if you don't take it, it's going somewhere else. That environment largely exists in the most valuable commodities.
I think I got all those answered.",405

I just wanted to peel back the guidance a little bit more. So if I look at Q1, you're guiding for down about 11% sequentially, you're typically down 8%, I think, is the average over the last 5 years. It sounds like you're going to build backlog in PCs. Are you anticipating that your ISG backlog is also going to grow? Or is there -- is it solely attributable to PCs?
And then, again, thinking about the full year, if you're guiding for 11% growth in Q1 and you have kind of normal seasonality in Q2, it calls for negative growth in the second half. And it sounds like ISG will get stronger over the course of the year. So that means pretty negative growth in PCs overall. Is that the message you're trying to communicate? Or what's wrong with my logic there?",147

I just think -- as I said, we expect ISG and CSG to grow in Q1. Yes, there are headwinds, and we do expect ISG backlog to expand in Q1. And with what we understand about PC component availability, we do expect some PC backlog growth. That's the reason for some of the caution in, one, in the revenue dynamics I gave you; but more importantly, in some of the EPS spread that I gave you, just given some of the variability that we see.
As we work our way, if you think about sort of the midpoint of that guidance, I think that we see positive growth through the remainder of the year overall with what we know today. So we can take this off-line from a modeling perspective, but that's our thinking right now. We're optimistic about the year. The trends are in our favor.  There is some short-term navigation we need to do with the supply chain dynamics.",162

Is that right? And I assume -- or can you let us know that you have more than 1 supplier for that and kind of what you meant by those commentaries for the various outcomes?,96

Yes, we have multiple partners in the world of NAND and SSDs for both client and enterprise class products. The reference that I was making is the announcement by Kioxa and Western Digital about the contamination that occurred in their factories, which means product in the factories today is contaminated. And sometime in the future, there's going to be a gap. Typically, when there's a gap of supply in a commodity that is in great demand, we see pricing pressure.
So what we're trying to communicate is there's an unknown of a reasonably large size. Those 2 companies represent a large percentage of output, and that output is at risk with the contaminated factories that will have a supply impact in the future, and we're just signaling that going forward.

Trailing nodes, whether it be a 40-nanometer node, a 55-nanometer node, 60-nanometer node, et cetera, a plethora of parts that go across all our devices continue to be in short supply. The output of that supply is nonlinear, meaning that sometimes it comes and sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it shows up on time, sometimes it's delayed. Working through that and taking advantage of our assembly capacity is ultimately the challenge in timing and the optimization that we're running through.
So what we're signaling is that semiconductor shortage continues to hit our CSG product, most notably in our high-end display business and desktops, as Tom called out. And demand -- we see demand continuing, and our supply is short of that demand, hence, the backlog growth.
On the server side, same sort of thing with network controllers and microcontrollers and power ICs, those have been the ones that I've called out into the past. They continue to be in short supply, and demand is ahead of that supply, hence, the backlog build. And then a very similar trend, which we saw in Q4, we believe continues through the first half of this year, which is in storage, which is notably around the FPGAs and CPLDs, all of the high-speed programmable logic devices that are in those controllers that we need, again, demand ahead of supply, backlog build.
So that's what we're signaling. We're signaling, I think, in Chuck's remarks and my remarks, growth in our businesses, but it's challenged with the supply.",276

If I think about the EPS growth in fiscal '22 and certainly, you talk about long-term framework of 6% EPS growth, how does that break up, you think, in '22 between stock buybacks versus operating profit dollars growth?

Amit, as it relates to the EPS growth that we chatted about are 6%-plus, right? So Look, I think you got to think about it like this. When we introduced -- if you remember the capital -- as you recall, the capital allocation framework, which is 40% to 60% shareholder capital return through a combination of share buyback and dividends, obviously, we've enacted that. We are using the share buyback program to manage dilution principally coming out of the LTI programs and the dilution that came out of the VMware spin.
And so from our perspective, as you move forward, if you think about our Q1 guidance, for instance, I do think that you should expect that we're in the quarter somewhere around 785 million to 790 million shares from an EPS, our share count perspective. And then will be somewhat programmatic as we move forward. And so while I don't want to get into forecasting share buyback, I will tell you that we will be thoughtful about how we do that.
We do expect -- as it relates to operating profit margin, look, I think overall, on an overall annual basis, somewhere in the -- I think if you look at consistently, we've been around $7.7 billion, $7.8 billion over the last number of years from an op inc perspective. I think we're probably somewhere $7.7 billion maybe slightly right around that range if you look for the year.
I don't want to get into overall op margins by business. That's not something we give guidance on. But I will tell you that, look, I mean, part of what's going to be interesting for us is as we continue to drive storage demand, there is opportunity for operating margin and ISG to continue to expand. Obviously, from a CSG perspective, the last couple of years have been quite strong from an operating margin perspective. More historically, they have not been quite as strong. Some of this -- there will be some variability this year as we work our way through supply chain, the mix of the business and the demand dynamics. But overall, we think profitability should be reasonable.",361

We did talk about a tax rate of 20%. I gave you some indication on where we think OpEx needs is probably going to trend for the year. But I would think in Q1, that's pretty consistent as you bring OpEx up from that 14.7% by roughly, call it, 40 basis points, 40 to 50 basis points, as we move through the year. And then you think about the EPS I gave you, you've gotten the tax rate.
I think interest and other is an area that we should chat about quickly just because, if you did Q4 times 4, given the amount of debt repay, you get somewhere around $1.3 billion of interest and other. I do think there will be, at some point during the year, probably later in the year, as we continue to focus on delevering, as we've talked about trending -- moving to 1.8x down to 1.5x core leverage that we will do some debt repayment. That probably -- since I've used -- I don't have any more prepayable debt, that's probably somewhere -- there will be a make well premium there. So somewhere in the -- probably safe to say somewhere in the $150 million to $200 million for the full year on -- for I/O, so you're closer to 1.5.
I think if you put all of those pieces together, you're going to come up to an operating -- or gross margin in Q1 that's slightly higher than where we ended Q4, given some of the mix of business as we look at it today. So that's -- I think that's generally how we're thinking about Q1.",311

It also has Virtustream and SecureWorks in it. I think on the broader frame in terms of VMware and what that resell relationship looks like, we've spent the last 5 years growing that business and that relationship with VMware. And we've taken the VMware revenue -- the Dell contribution of VMware revenue up to somewhere roughly sort of in the 30% -- mid-30% range in terms of VMware total contribution.
As we've talked about in the past, we -- our focus over that last -- that period of time was about velocity of VMware in terms of driving revenue and margin with -- on the VMware solution capability. So with that said, as we now have separated, if you will, through the VMware spin, we do have work to do on pricing and on working our way through the 5 years of those VMware relationships and contracts with our customers, and we are focused on resetting pricing and process over time.
So I do think that it's going to take us a bit of time to move that needle in terms of the operating loss you're seeing, which is, to be fair, principally, a lot of that is the -- most of that is the VMware resell dynamic. And so I think that's probably at least a 24-month journey as we think about how do we move that forward. I view it as an opportunity. We've got opportunity to improve that and drive better profitability there over time, but it will -- it's going to take some work there.",279

I tend to think about it like that. Supply is constrained right now. But our job, working with our -- our selling organization working with our customers just to try and capture demand and bring demand in-house and make sure we're selling the configurations that we believe we have component availability for. So I think the team does a great job with that. And if you think about our model being roughly 50% direct and 50% through the channel, we have the opportunity to shape demand.
That said, I mean, there are supply constraints throughout the industry that are impacting us and are causing incremental cost, as Jeff highlighted, as given the logistics chain as parts are arriving late and we're having to move product around. So there has been some pressure on gross margin, and you noticed that in Q4.
Look, I think that's something that we're pricing for as we see it. Pricing efficiency as long as you have an elevated backlog, well, is a bit challenging. And ultimately, that pricing will manifest itself through the P&L as we clear backlog. So look, I think -- overall, I think as we think about gross margin for the year, I do think that our perspective is that it does tend to trend up gradually over the course of the year, not -- but there's work to do to get it there.",244

We know we incurred incremental cost to do that. There's no question. And we were chasing cost with price. And with a building backlog with the demand that we spoke to, we didn't catch it. But we know we made the right decision in the best long-term interest of the company by serving our customers.
Our business, our Dell model, we'll work through this. This is what our supply chain team does. Our model is differentiated. We have, we believe, the purest demand signal in the marketplace. We transmit that to our supply chain quicker and better than most in the industry. We're capable of demand shaping with our direct selling model. And our product leverage and product development model allows us to move and qualify more material, which is what we've been doing.
I think we've navigated the last 2 years quite well as much. As we may be saying backlog wins or headwinds in front of us, our supply chain team loves this stuff. This is what they do, and we're going to serve our customers, and we will find a way to overcome.",221

Is that how we should think about the backlog that you've built? And do you think that you exit this next year at a more normalized backlog level? And what would that maybe look like?",138

So as you think about RPO, if I look at Q3 backlog, our RPO, I apologize, it was $41 billion, moved to $42 billion, right? So -- and you look at the ins and outs of that, which is we had talked about the fact that backlog build was pretty significant at the end of Q3. What you saw happen in Q4 was we actually took -- we were actually able to reduce backlog in the client space, but we built backlog in the ISG space. And as you might imagine, that has -- those businesses have different margin profiles, which was one of the sort of constraints or impacts on Q4 gross margin and profitability that was recorded in the P&L.
In terms of what's in the RPO, I mean, there's backlog change, plus there's deferred revenue component of that, plus long-term contracts that we have not yet recognized in deferred revenue but where we have performance obligations remaining. So there's a mix of types of services and capabilities in there. And so we can take that. We can further go through that with you, if that would be helpful, so.",197

Maybe how should we think about cash flow growth tracking relative to operating your net income next year? I realize you don't guide to it, but just any qualitative or quantitative thoughts that you can share there. And then any specific puts and takes we should be thinking about as we go through the year, either on a seasonal basis or just overall for the year? But that's it for me.",85

Look, we -- and Erik, welcome, by the way. But as we think about cash flow, we don't guide on cash flow, but if you remember, our long-term financial framework where we talked about adjusted free cash flow being at least 100% or better from -- of net income, I think that trend holds true. If you look at our historical performance, you'd be somewhere around 1.1 to 1.3 sort of ratios there over the last number of years. It's probably a reasonable proxy to think about for the coming year.
Look, I think we do have seasonal patterns in our cash flow. I think you realized that, right? Q1 typically is our weakest cash flow quarter. Q2 and Q4 have generally been our stronger cash flow quarters based upon seasonal patterns of revenue, and Q3 has been relatively a little bit softer. Those are historical patterns.
Having said that, I'll tell you that over the last few years, some of those patterns have changed on us given how demand has flown in the -- and given the effects of the pandemic. But I think, overall, we feel really good about our cash flow generation ability. If you look over the last 4 years, our -- on average, we've grown adjusted free cash flow by roughly 9% CAGR over that period of time while growing revenue at a 6% CAGR and growing EPS at a 16% CAGR.
So our cash flow generation, I think, is quite strong. I think the team has done a nice job of managing their way with the balance sheet or managing and discipline in the balance sheet. And so I feel good about our cash flow generation.

Thanks for joining us. Following a record FY '22, we continue to execute quite well in a complex macro environment. We are focused on our long-term strategy while continuing to innovate, enhancing existing solutions and creating new ones for our customers. 
For Q1, we delivered record revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, with strong, balanced growth across CSG and ISG. We also improved our profitability in the quarter, and we will continue to focus on disciplined cost management. As a result, diluted EPS was $1.84, a record, up 36%. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We are grateful to succeed alongside our customers. 
At Dell Technologies World, customers like CVS Health, USAA, General Motors and Boeing talked about reinventing their processes and their industries while unleashing innovation productivity and sustainability with Dell as a key technology partner. 
We highlighted our role in the multi-cloud future, announcing a steady stream of innovation that places us at the center of our customers' multi-cloud world. Specifically, we made a series of announcements that demonstrate the work we are doing to build a multi-cloud ecosystem that includes all major public clouds. We shared Project Alpine, which brings enterprise-class data services into the public cloud for cloud bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics, data and container mobility. We are also unlocking the power of data through our partnership with Snowflake, the first of its kind that provides direct access to Dell object storage on-prem, and we are including cybersecurity throughout. 
In addition, we also announced over 500 software enhancements to our industry-leading storage portfolio. For PowerMax, the world's most secure, mission-critical storage, we introduced a new intelligent NVMe multi-node, scaled out architecture with isolated cyber-vaults, 65 million immutable snapshots in the industry's first data compression for mainframes. 
For PowerStore, we added ease and integration, significantly boosted mixed workload performance deepened VMware integration and added native metro sync replication. And with PowerFlex, we have the only software-defined infrastructure that scales almost limitlessly, for compute and storage while supporting bare metal, all hypervisors and file and block storage services on a single platform with increased cyber resiliency and multi-cloud extensions. 
These software-driven innovations enable a continuously modern storage experience with highly-adaptable storage architectures, comprehensive cyber resiliency and multi-cloud ecosystem flexibility. 
And lastly, we announced a range of APEX offers that further expand our subscription and as-a-service capabilities. To date, the transition towards multi-cloud and a highly-distributed architecture is playing out much like we thought. It's clear our strategy is resonating across our customers and partner ecosystem. 
Turning to the supply chain. We experienced a wide range of semiconductor shortages that impacted CSG and ISG in Q1. In addition, the COVID lockdowns in China caused temporary supply chain interruptions in the quarter. As a result, backlog levels were elevated across CSG and ISG exiting the quarter. 
We expect backlog to remain elevated through at least Q2 due to current demand and industry-wide supply chain challenges. Q1 component costs were deflationary across key commodities, but logistics spend remained elevated due to higher rates and a mix of expedited parts. 
Turning to Q2. We expect component cost to turn inflationary and logistics costs remain at elevated levels. That all said, Dell Technologies is well positioned to navigate these supply chain challenges just as we have over the past 3-plus years. 
The big picture. As we previously noted, we are seeing a shift in spend from consumer and PCs to data center infrastructure. IT demand is currently healthy. However, there are a number of uncertainties out in the broader macro that we continue to monitor: geopolitical issues, inflation, ongoing supply chain challenges, chip constraints and COVID shutdowns. 
What we've shown over the years is that regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to outperform. We are able to quickly lean into opportunities and focus on what we can control, executing our strategy for growth, innovating for our customers, motivating our teams, building better communities and delivering for our stakeholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck for a deeper dive into our segment results.",690

Great to be here with all of you and excited to share the details of our Q1 business unit performance. 
Starting with ISG, we delivered another record Q1 with 16% growth and $9.3 billion of revenue. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of growth as widespread digital transformation continues to support growth and infrastructure spend. 
ISG profitability was up with operating income growing 39% and operating margins expanding 200 basis points to 11.7%. Servers and networking revenue grew 22%, and storage revenue grew 9% as 4 consecutive quarters of demand growth has now made its way into the P&L. We were particularly pleased with the breadth of strength in storage. In Q1, we saw storage demand growth across our portfolio, including data protection, HCI, unstructured, entry, high end and PowerStore, our marquee mid-range solution and still the fastest-growing storage architecture in company history. 
Turning to Client Solutions. CSG also delivered a record Q1 with revenue of $15.6 billion, up 17% on top of a strong prior year comp of 20% growth. This was outstanding absolute and relative performance. We gained 190 basis points of PC unit share in calendar Q1 based on IDC results, the most among the top 4 industry vendors. 
We have now gained unit share in 33 of the last 37 quarters. But as we've highlighted, not all PC units are created equal. Our focus on the commercial segment paid off in Q1 as commercial demand was solid and we saw softness in Consumer and Chrome as expected. 
Commercial CSG revenue grew 22%, while Consumer grew 3%. We also saw continued strength in software and peripherals as customers continue to seek exceptional PC experiences in the ""do anything from anywhere"" world. Our market-leading display business, for example, grew 20% and gained 370 basis points in calendar Q1 according to preliminary IDC data. 
The net of strong commercial performance, peripheral growth and disciplined cost management with strong profitability. The business delivered an op inc margin of 7.2%, and we have delivered roughly $1 billion of op inc or better over the last 7 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we are seeing a rotation in IT spending from CSG to ISG. Despite economic uncertainty, digital transformation and automation efforts are being used to solve the pressing challenges at the moment as technology and business strategies emerge, benefiting our infrastructure business. We expect ISG growth for the full fiscal year. 
And PCs are now a C-suite issue. In the world of hybrid work and in a fiercely competitive talent market, the PC is the gateway to the employee experience and a visible symbol of a company's commitment to technology. We do, however, expect CSG growth to moderate over the course of the year as the Consumer portion of the market slows. 
Q1 is proof of the benefits of having a strong geographically and sector diverse business covering the end-user to the edge, to the core data center, to the cloud. We are central to our customers' technology agendas, creating predictability, durability and flexibility in our business to pursue growth wherever it materializes in the IT market. 
As Jeff stated, there is some macro uncertainty right now. but we have shown time and time again the ability to navigate any market environment by focusing on our customers, our employees, our long-term strategy and our stakeholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tom.",562
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483615.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Chuck. As Jeff highlighted earlier, we delivered record Q1 revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, driven by strong growth in both CSG and ISG. We have previously highlighted that we thought fiscal year '23 would see a more robust infrastructure investment cycle while PC growth would shift back towards historical patterns. To date, this appears to be how fiscal year '23 is shaping. 
Gross margin was $5.9 billion, up 9% at 22.7% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 150 basis points lower, primarily due to increased component and logistics cost. However, it was up 190 basis points sequentially due to improvement in both CSG and ISG gross margin percentages as more of our prior pricing actions took effect. We also saw a richer PC and server configurations and stronger storage performance in the quarter. 
Operating expense was $3.8 billion, up 3% at 14.5% of revenue as a result of investments in our team members and targeted investments in our growth areas, including capabilities to support our evolving business model. We will balance these investments with prudent cost discipline given the uncertainties in the current environment. 
Operating income was a Q1 record of $2.1 billion, up 21% at 8.2% of revenue. Net income was $1.4 billion, up 36%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Our tax rate was 19.3%. 
Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.84, up 36% with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 780 million shares as a result of repurchases. 
Our recurring revenue was approximately $5.3 billion a quarter, up 15%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 14% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. 
Dell Financial Services originations were $2.1 billion, up 9% and DFS ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in total managed assets. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our use of cash from operations was $300 million in Q1, primarily driven by our annual bonus payout and seasonal revenue decline. As a reminder, Q1 is often a use of cash given the seasonality in our business and the timing of our annual incentive compensation payments. 
The team did a nice job on working capital management in the quarter, minimizing the increase in inventory due to supply chain challenges and reducing receivables. Our core debt balance is $16.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and investments, down $2.8 billion sequentially principally due to seasonally low free cash flow and $1.75 billion in shareholder capital returns. 
We repurchased 28.8 million shares of stock in Q1 for $1.5 billion and issued $250 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1. 
Turning to Q2 and fiscal year '23. Digital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look for a partner in their multi-cloud journey. Global IT spend is projected in the mid-single digits. And with what we see today, the current demand environment supports this. Against that backdrop, we expect Q2 revenue between $26.1 billion and $27.1 billion, up 10% at the midpoint with both CSG and ISG growing. We expect foreign currency to be a headwind for both Q2 and for the full year. 
We do expect gross margin rates to decrease sequentially as CSG mix increases and we managed through inflation and currency dynamics with an elevated backlog. OpEx will remain roughly flat to Q1 as a percentage of revenue. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 760 million to 765 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1 to $1.15 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.70, up 10% at the midpoint. 
As you know, we are coming off a record fiscal year '22 and a good start to fiscal year '23. Last quarter, we talked about our long-term value creation framework of 3% to 4% of revenue growth and EPS growth of 6% or better as a starting point for the year. 
As we look at the balance of fiscal year '23, we're watching a few macroeconomic dynamics, including the geopolitical environment, inflation, interest rates, slowing economic growth, currency and continued COVID impacts disrupting supply chains and business activity. While we believe these macro dynamics will have some impact on overall IT investment spending, with what we know today, our updated framework has revenue growth of approximately 6% with both CSG and ISG growing for the year and earnings per share growth faster than revenue in the range of 12% or better. 
In closing, we delivered a strong quarter with record Q1 revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.

Just want to make sure you said a FY '23 revenue growth of 6% and EPS, 12-plus percent. And then the question is either for Jeff or Chuck, the CSG slowing makes sense due to the consumer and you said you're monitoring macro data points, but you're confident on the strength in ISG, especially at the time when tech companies are slowing hiring. I'm kind of curious, when you talk to your customers, your CEOs and CIOs, what gives us confidence in continuing this IT spending into the back half? Or is this more a soft spending target that could change as the macro type?",113

Let me -- I will confirm that I did say for fiscal year '23 revenue growth approximately 6%, and then the EPS growth of 12% or better. So yes, you heard that properly. Jeff, Chuck, I don't -- Jeff, do you want to jump in on the ISG question?",52
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483620.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,9,"Sure. The macro question was kind of CSG making sense slowing down and then the implications to ISG. Maybe break those down as we think about those particular businesses. In CSG, we -- I think we've called out before that we thought heading into this year that we would see the growth rate in CSG temper, and what we thought is indeed happening. 
And it's happening in the areas that we happen to be less -- we participate less in, most notably Chrome, which is down significantly; and the low-end and mid-range price bands and Consumer, which are down. But what we see today, we see good growth in Commercial or enterprise PCs, whatever you prefer to call them. We continue to see that as we look forward. But it is a much lower growth rate than last year. There's no question. 
I don't know what else to add to that. There's categories we would tell you. Why would that be the case? Well, we certainly have people going back to the office. We have this notion of a hybrid worker requiring a more capable and powerful machine. We have still a number of folks that are working in this hybrid market that need more mobility, i.e., more notebooks. 
We would tell you that not all PCs are created equal, meaning that the commercial and enterprise generally have higher ASPs, richer content and configuration, greater opportunity to attach things. That's what drives our business. 
And then if we flip it over to the ISG side, look, I'd be remiss if I didn't call out. We just posted 22% growth in servers and 9% growth in storage. That's the sixth consecutive quarter of server growth and the fourth consecutive quarter of orders growth for storage, the first P&L that we've been indicating. We thought it would flip, and we saw that flip in our P&L. For P&L growth of 9% in storage after 4 quarters of orders growth. 
What's fueling that? Continued digital transformation. The fact that in this data economy and data world, you need more compute assets and storage assets to be able to accelerate that digital transformation. We continue to see that. Certainly, the demand environment we see today indicates that continues. I hope that helped, Krish.",379

Maybe Chuck and I will ham and egg this together. But if you take a look at that 22% server growth that I just alluded to and mentioned sixth consecutive quarter, if you look at where some of that growth is coming from, it's coming from content expansion. It's coming from ASP expansion. It's coming from mix of the portfolio, which are all good signs, one that we're penetrating deeper into the enterprise. We're taking on more high-value workloads, our GP, GPU or AI accelerator of growth rate was very strong in the quarter, and that's continued to bolster the performance of our server business. I think that leads to some of that. Chuck, anything to add?",118

We said it in our prepared remarks and you mentioned it in your first answer, Jeff. 
There's a rotation right now of budgets from client to infrastructure, and that's across the board in our portfolio, whether it's our fifth consecutive overall growth in ISG, our sixth consecutive quarter of server P&L growth for this question, 9% storage revenue growth after 4 consecutive quarters of demand growth. And so despite the macro uncertainty that is out there right now, what we don't see is an immediate move to go after a reduction in IT budgets. I mean, right now, it is a very healthy infrastructure environment.",127

I guess I just wanted to ask on the margin. You had very strong margins in both segments. As we sort of -- how should we think about sustainability of these margins? I know you pointed out the component costs going up, but I can also think about sort of pricing that property finds its way in a bigger magnitude through the P&L through the year. So maybe just help us through sort of thinking about sustainability of these margins on a segment basis. And what are the sort of different drivers to keep in mind here?",103
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483628.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,17,"Samik, it's Tom. Let me sort of walk you through how we think about margin frameworks as we move forward. So we talked about -- obviously, we're very pleased with the margin performance in Q1, which -- when we talk -- if you recall back in the Q4 conversation we had at the end of February, we talked about the fact that we thought we would see margins move upward coming out of Q4. We did see that driven by, I think, the strong performance in the client business, particularly the commercial business, also the strong storage growth that we saw, a 9% revenue growth. 
And the pricing actions that we had been talking about in commenting on the fact that those needed to work their way through the backlog started to manifest themselves in Q1, and so really pleased with the margin performance in Q1. 
I think the dynamic as we look at Q2 is this, that we do expect that we are going to get a heavier mix of CSG in the second quarter. We are going to continue to work and fight through inflation, right? So we do expect higher overall input cost in Q2, which we'll have to price for. And you know that with an elevated backlog that, that will take some time to work its way through. And then as we also think about the FX environment that we're going to be in, where currency is going to be a headwind of somewhere between roughly 400 basis points for the quarter, so that's going to be something we're going to have to price for. But again, you don't get all of that pricing dynamic in the current quarter, and so the macro has some headwinds that we're going to have to continue to execute our way through. 
I think at an individual business unit level, as we think about clients that -- we should see a bit more Commercial client in the quarter coming from the elevated backlog, but that's going to have some headwinds on cost as we talked about in pricing. And then the server storage mix, I think, is going to continue to be an interesting area. 
We do expect elevated backlogs in Q2, so particularly in the ISG space. As Jeff mentioned, the server supply chain continues to be challenging, I'll say it like that, with shortages in [ NICs ] and power supplies and other components. And so that will be something we'll have to work our way through. We're cautiously optimistic about storage, but we had a very strong storage quarter, and we just got to go out and continue to execute it. 
So overall, that's the dynamic that we're looking at as we think about Q2. You fast forward through the rest of the year, and I would tell you that we would expect -- if margins are dipping a bit in Q2, we expect them to be relatively flat in Q3 and come back a bit in Q4 as we think about how the mix of the business shifts towards an ISG mix at the end of the year given some of the seasonality of the business. 
So that's a broad stroke at what margins look like from our perspective. But again, I would just tell you that, look, we're going to have to work our way through inflation for the year. We'll price it as appropriate. We'll have to watch the market positioning on pricing. And currency is going to be a headwind, roughly somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points for the year. So those are all some of the dynamics that we're working our way through.",613

I have a bigger quick -- bigger picture question on customer behavior. Well, there has been a lot of cross currents in terms of supply constrained environment but also in terms of macro uncertainties. Have you seen any change in customer order behavior in terms of volume and commitment because of supply constraints, but at the same time, may be shifting away from on-prem to the cloud? Then how do you manage those trends from supply chain and R&D or maybe? Just generally speaking OpEx perspective for the year.",94

So despite long lead times, we haven't seen material differences in our cancellation rates, whether that's across our CSG business or our ISG business. And the long-term trend of where am I choosing to put a workload, per our conversations that we had at Dell Technologies World most recently is almost entirely with customers around the multi-cloud opportunities. 
So while there are certainly workloads that continue to go to the public cloud, increasingly, the conversation that we have with customers is about operating in a multi-cloud environment. They see the right workload in the right place at the right cost is the objective of their environment. And so broadly, that's the trends that we're seeing in infrastructure. 
In terms of how we manage it from a supply chain standpoint, obviously, I'll defer to Jeff on that portion.",171
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483632.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,21,"Yes. Look, maybe a slightly different perspective. I think the order pattern has changed slightly but not in the way that you described. People are coming to Dell because there's confidence in our supply chain to deliver. If you think about our performance now 6 quarters in a row of server growth and the shortage of parts and servers as customers are working to build out on-prem, to build out their digital transformation, as Chuck said, build out their multi-cloud infrastructure and certainly our architecture and strategic drive to be at the center of that, customers continue to come to Dell because our commitment to delivery date is pretty darn high. 
As Chuck mentioned, our cancellation rates have not moved over a long period of time, which while we may not give the exact date they want because we have products on extended lead time, the date we give customers is the date the product shows up. And they can count on it, they can count out on their integration and deployment of technology and their build-out of their projects. 
So probably not the answer you're looking for an order pattern, but I think it's a reinforcer of what's been happening in our business. And then we take that demand signal, which is the beauty of our direct model, and we act upon that in our supply chain. I think I've made mention in before this notion that we have digitized our supply chain where we have put together advanced planning and modeling techniques, data transparency and the ability to do predictive analytics and anticipate the needs of what we have. 
And I think we respond faster and ask quicker than perhaps others, and that puts us in a better position to ensure we have the supply, what's available, for our customers. That's the linkage between -- and how our model works, it's very different than perhaps others is the connection between the demand signal, the supply signal and, quite frankly, what we design. 
And that tightly coupled ecosystem is a differentiator for the Dell business model. And clearly, in these times, when they're stressed in the supply picture, we're able to use our early indication of what demand is, be able to schedule that, plan that in the supply chain. And then ultimately, if we have to pivot to requalify or add a different part in our designs, we're able to quickly do that.",405

So clearly, 90 days ago, you guys were really optimistic about the outlook. A lot has changed since then, and it appears that you guys have handled sort of the disruptions in April better than most companies that we've talked to over the last couple of weeks. Can you kind of share with us kind of what you saw in April, kind of what set you apart, where the component issues were and how you guys navigated that better than most? 
And then on a clarification issue, I think last quarter, you talked about a potential make-whole payment in the fiscal fourth quarter of $150 million to $200 million. Do you still expect that in the fourth quarter? And is that sort of factored into the guidance that's Tom gave for the full year?",144

Maybe I step into the supply chain component of that. Look, it's very important for us I think we've consistently communicated this. We are encountering what everybody else is encountering in this industry. There is a wide-scale semiconductor shortage across a vast number of components. I think I rattled off all sorts of components on previous earnings calls, it's still the same. 
The most stressed networks tend to be the trailing nodes, 40-nanometer, 55, 60 nanometer, the 8-inch network. What's increasingly interesting is now the new factories are being delayed in their deployment because they can't get the equipment needed. This cascades itself into categories of servers or automotive that's growing very fast. That's taking the very same components that we all need, which tend to be around the microcontrollers, the power subsystems, which are needed to build certainly the devices we have. 
That's for everybody. We are encountering that. I think we've talked about our long-term relationships. I just mentioned in the previous answer our ability to plan and anticipate and do predictive modeling, and we act with speed. I think one of the things that separates our ability in the supply chain is to see this earlier and decide quicker and adapt and provide and overcome with what is thrown at us. 
In terms of what happened in April, we all read about lockdowns. By the way, they started in March, mid-March with Shenzhen. They can make their way into Shanghai with various stages of lockdown. We had our own challenges here in the state of Texas with some border crossing issues. So we continue to adapt and improvise along the journey. It's what we do. 
Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, we've had 3-plus years of practice at this or getting good at our game. And our team is nimble. It's flexible. We're able to move material. We're able to use our vast network of 25 factories, 50 different fulfillment centers around the globe that allow us essentially to move any order to any factory to be able to build it. 
Now we can't do that instantaneously overnight. You got to get material. You got to move orders. But our ability to use our global network and to see it, I think, quicker than others is why I think we're able to continually deliver. And again, I'd be remiss to say, I didn't do my job, but we built backlog. We did not build more than we sold.",413

I'd just also underscore per your last answer, it's also our business model integrated to that incredible supply chain performance. So our sales engine that's able to not just take that -- take a demand signal and feed it back to the supply chain but also shape to availability, which we've been doing for the last couple of years, and we certainly did since March. Our product teams that are designing modularity and being able to respond to the parts that are available. So we like to say it's not one thing, it's our integrated business model.",106

Let me just comment on the make-whole payment question that you put there at the end of that question. I think you're referring to -- we talked about last quarter the fact that as we thought about our capital allocation framework for the year and the fact that we might do some incremental debt pay down during the course of the year that if we were to do some of those -- some of that debt would have a make whole payment on it and sort of. 
And so as we think about it now, we sort of have P&L for the year model at right around $1.5 billion. So you think about Q1 at 3.48x, plus we've stuck in a $100 million make-whole thought, if you will, into the ethanol for the year. We'll have to work -- as we go through the year, we will keep looking at does that makes sense to do and is that the right use of capital at the time. But -- so that's the context around that.",180

We have a 20-year relationship with VMware. As you know, we -- with all of the work that's been done with them and the close collaboration over the last 5 years or so and the whole posture around, VMware is first and best as we lead. 
Our expectation is that, that relationship continues. We have a commercial framework agreement that we negotiated with VMware as we did the spin at last year. And we would expect that those -- that continues. And the mutual benefit that we both received from the commercial framework -- they -- with the go-to-market reach we have in some of our technology and our benefit with some of their solution technology should continue.

I mean I'll take this, and Chuck certainly can build upon this. Look, I think we continue to talk about a marketplace that was going to slow down. It is slowing down. We saw that in the IDC Q1 results, which remind you, I think we outperformed the market significantly in that calendar Q1 period. 
Our own internal modeling, IDC just came out with a new set of projections last night. Our modeling is a little more positive than that or a little bigger than that, if you want to say. I'll be very specific with you. We have the market somewhere around 330 million units. We have Chrome falling fast. We have consumer in the high single digits. And we have -- on a unit basis, we have the commercial hanging in there. That's how we get to 330 units. 
When you look at the composition of our business, the places where the market is strongest is the places we have the greatest exposure. I think our mix of commercial was 77% in Q1, which is up 3 points year-over-year. So more exposed to the place that's doing better. That's what we -- clearly, where we've built our product portfolio or our relationships and customer base is, and that's how we tend to look at the market.",219

And as you said, given our focus on the commercial segment, which we think fares better than Chrome and Consumer the rest of the year, we feel well positioned no matter the sort of unit market environment. 
Obviously, part of our view that we would see moderating growth this year coming off a 27% growth in CSG last year is we're lapping some pretty strong compares in second half performance. But again, to just underscore our commentary, we expect CSG to grow for the year. We expect CSG to grow at a multiple to our long-term growth framework, and we expect to keep gaining share.",135

So we -- right now, we see the total year at 6% with both CSG and ISG growing sort of mid-single digits for the year. 
I think if you do the math on that, you would obviously see that we do expect the back half to be slower than the first half as we think there continues to be. We're lapping from a CSG perspective, some pretty tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. So that will, I think, be a bit of a -- as you think about the performance of the business, that would be something to consider. 
I do think from a CSG perspective that we expect sort of ASPs to be flat to slightly declining as we go through the year, but we don't see significant movement there given some of the inflationary pressures. But again -- and we'll have to monitor that relative to the pricing environment and what's going on in the market. 
I think -- we think we're very -- we're optimistic about this, the ISG space. Infrastructure spending is holding up with what we can see today. Implicit in my guidance, when you would think about the fact that I am slowing ISG in the back half of the year some, it's still growing but at sort of low to mid-single digits Q3 to Q4. But I think that's just being prudent given the uncertainty that's out there in the market right now. And we'll continue to update you as we go through the year. 
As it relates to working capital, look, we have a -- if you haven't looked at our balance sheet lately, we have a lot of inventory right now. So I'm up $2.4 billion year-over-year. In fact, Jeff and I were just talking about that.",343

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483657.0,Question,Amit Daryanani,,Analysts,46,"I guess I have 2 as well. I guess the first one is if I look at your full year guide, right, you're going to do fairly robust growth in the first half. But you're sort of implying that back half growth will be, I think, flattish for the most part. So maybe just touch on why do you think the back half will be flattish. It will be fairly unique if it happens. And do you expect to exit the year with a higher backlog than you're sitting on right now? Or do you -- are you anticipating working down the backlog? So I'd love to understand kind of the back half assumptions there. 
And then Jeff, I would love to hear on the storage side. This was a very sizable inflection that you folks had in April. I guess one data point won't make a trend. But what's the durability of the growth that you just saw on the storage side? And how much of that do you think was share gain versus end markets doing well?",179
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483658.0,Answer,Thomas Sweet,,Executives,47,"Well, let me start, Amit, on the full year guide. I think if you just break down the piece parts of this, clearly, CSG was 17% in Q1. We do expect it to grow again in Q2. But I think we just talked about the fact that the environment is slowing and the fact that we have some tougher compares in the back half of the year when you think about year-over-year comparison and year-over-year growth. So look, I think it's just prudent to be a little bit cautious and -- as we think about the back half of the year. Clearly, if the opportunity to grow faster is there, we will do so thoughtfully. 
On the ISG side, with what we see, we're sort of looking at sort of mid-single digits. If you think about IT, the forecast for IT spending in the infrastructure space in the back -- in the year, it's sort of mid-single digits to upper single digits. That's how we think about it as well. I think the question that we're working our way through is just does that -- how does that manifest itself, and I just would like to have the year progress a little bit further before we think whether there's any incremental strength there. So right now, I've got the year at 6%. It implies that ISG is a little softer in the second half. We'll watch it, and we'll update you again at the -- at our Q2 call. So there's just too many uncertainties out there right now to be so exact at this point in the year.",269

And maybe to build on that with storage. Look, we've talked about 4 quarters in a row now of storage orders growth. Now 9% P&L growth in Q1. Our orders growth in Q1 was in excess of the P&L growth. Let's call it double. All geographies grew storage. We grew storage on our high-end price bands, our mid-range price bands, our low-end price bands. We grew in HCI. We grew in data protection. Most notably in data protection in the area of cybersecurity, where we have a very advantaged position with our cyber-based products. Customers continue to look for us to help them in this world that we live in today with cyber and cyber resiliency. 
PowerStore group. PowerStore continues to be our fastest-growing, new architecture we put in the marketplace. Just got 500 new features into the marketplace across our portfolio. We have a mainframe refresh that will come throughout the year, and our PowerMax is unmatched in its capability. One of my favorite features there is the first time we have mainframe compression in the industry on our product waiting for the mainframe update. 
I like a lot of what's going on. It's 4 quarters in demand of Chuck [ and I's ] team. We modeled this. Tom just mentioned it, mid- to high single-digit market growth. Obviously, we want to take share. We're taking share with the performance that we just delivered, midrange in particular, which is where the largest swath of the market is. Our unstructured product continues to do well. 
It's hard for me to tell you if that's going to continue. I like all of the signs, 4 quarters of growth. I think of the strategy that we have, which is continue to drive the consolidation and the high-end innovate and disrupt in the mid-range, which we're doing, and take our leadership position in software-defined storage and continue to drive our leadership position even further there, whether that's our VxRail asset or our own PowerFlex asset, both grew nicely in orders in Q1.
So I hope that answered the question. And it's hard for me to have a crystal ball what that means in Q4. But certainly, what we've performed to date and as we look at the market as a whole, we're positioned nicely.",382

To the extent you can sort of talk about your own pricing into your customers, where do you think you're able to continue to get price and pass on inflation? And where maybe does it get more difficult, especially if some verticals are facing their own end market challenges going forward? Any help on pricing recently and what you're thinking about in the future would be helpful.",72
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483662.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,51,"Sure. Maybe I'll take a stab, and Chuck and Tom can come over the top. But we'll start with PC. So if you look at the pricing environment in PC that's back to what I mentioned earlier, this is kind of [ 3 tails ]. In Chrome, pricing is largely back to pre-COVID normal levels. It's aggressive. There's lots of inventory out there. It's an aggressive pricing market. 
In those price bands in consumer, the low end or at the low price points, the midrange price points, there's a fair amount of inventory out there. You saw promos being run through the holidays. They continued into Q1. The pricing towards the burst deals towards the second half of the year are already underway in those price bands, and they're quite aggressive. In the higher end part of consumer, whether that be our XPS area or Alienware, things are a little more stable. 
Commercial, it's a more favorable pricing environment. There's still a lot of mismatch sets out there, meaning that there aren't enough components. Everybody doesn't have the right set of components to build a finished system. So pricing is more stable, more favorable. And we're taking the inflation that we see, and we're certainly trying to pass it through. 
I think Chuck talked a little bit about this earlier, but if you look at broadly across our PC space, ASPs are boosted by the fact that we have a configuration dynamic, those buying PCs need a more capable PC to work in a hybrid modern world. We have content going up, and we're attaching more things with them. 
If I look at storage, storage is a favorable pricing place where we can take the rising input costs, and we can -- we are passing that through. And that's not unique to us, the industry is. The same is true on servers, which makes a lot of sense given there are not enough parts to match the server demand today, hence our growing backlog, and that's a favorable environment where we can pass along the cost increase. 
Our ASP performance. I think we mentioned earlier, we [ stood out ] by the fact that we have pricing and inflation and then we have this content dynamic. We're selling servers deeper into the enterprise, higher-value workloads, more GPUs, more DRAM, more NAND per server. That adds up to a higher ASP. 
Our teams are making adjustments as we speak. Tom referenced this earlier, foreign exchange rates, They're changing when we have to price. Pricing is underway to do that. We'll try to capture as much as we can along the journey. He called that out as a, perhaps, challenge in the quarter. And then we have a variety of metrics that look at our relative position to our competitors. And we largely say with everything that I just said, we are in price position in the marketplace.",486

You explicitly noted that order growth was stronger than revenue growth in storage. Was that also the case this quarter in servers and PCs? 
Secondly, you noted that you were opportunistic in your share repurchases this quarter and bought back $1.5 billion. Your share price, even with the strength in the aftermarket, is well below the average price that it was during Q1. Why shouldn't we expect you to be just as opportunistic in terms of buybacks in Q2?
And then finally, just on free cash flow, do you expect free cash flow to be higher than net income, consistent with your long-term model for fiscal '23?",116

And since we weren't in the market for last year given the beam we're spent. we thought it was appropriate. And part of our goal with the share buyback is to control dilution. And so that focus, plus the fact that share price did obviously evolve through the quarter, was the impetus to continue to be into the market a bit. 
I think what we're trying to balance as we go through the remainder of the year is the cash balance has obviously come down as we spent a fair amount of cash in Q1 on share buyback. So my point of view on this right now is that we're going to continue to be programmatic, and I will be opportunistic where it makes sense. But I don't think that pace that you saw in Q1 should be how you model the whole year, so that's how we're thinking about it right now.",184

But Tom, a clarification. You talked about pricing in a deflationary environment turning to inflationary for your components. I guess everywhere around the world for the past 3 months, I haven't seen pricing going up, and you talked about favorable deflationary. Was that like some longer-term contracts you had or agreements that are now kind of being rightsized to market? Or was it like displays or memories? I'm kind of scratching my head here about what really helped you. 
And then more of the strategy question either for Jeff or Chuck. It seems like on storage, which you touched on earlier, you had a couple of past quarters of kind of flattish growth. And now storage was up 9%, and you talked about we're in a bit of a high-performance compute/mainframe pause before it starts. Am I right we're at a new chapter of -- after several quarters of flattish storage growth actually kicking it into high gear for storage?",183

Let me take the first part of your question. Let me tell you what I believe I said, which was we expect input costs to be inflationary as we end Q2, right? And that's the entire basket of component plus logistics costs. So we do expect that to be an inflationary pressure in Q2, somewhat into the back half of the year depending upon some of the demand signals.",72
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3731.0,2580253.0,97483674.0,Answer,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,63,"Yes. And then to wrap up on storage. Look, as we said in the last few quarters, we've seen healthy storage demand growth. Translating that to the P&L takes time because we have a significant amount of our storage content that is deferred software and services. And so as we said, the key performance indicator we've been watching is the consecutive quarters of demand growth. And so after posting 4, we are now seeing that start to translate into the P&L at 9% storage revenue growth. 
On the mainframe refresh question or the high end, look, we did see demand growth in the high end in Q1. And if you'll recall, we saw high-end growth in Q4 as well. We would not attribute that right now to the mainframe refresh. We're #1 in high end and have a number of customers that refresh from time to time, and that's really what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. But that said, as Jeff called out, we are incredibly well positioned for the mainframe refresh that is sort of starting right now, and we tend to see the benefit a quarter or 2 later in our business. And as Jeff called out, the new PowerMax that adds the industry's first data compression for mainframes positions us really well for that demand cycle. So that's where we are in storage. Obviously, incredibly pleased with both our P&L performance, but more importantly, as Jeff called out, the strong demand we saw in all parts of the portfolio.",255

Thanks for joining us. In Q2, we executed well and delivered strong financial results despite a rapidly changing and challenging macro environment. We also advanced our long-term strategy, growing the core while innovating for our customers and enabling their opportunities in the data era. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $26.4 billion, up 9%, with growth in both CSG and ISG. And diluted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our differentiated business model and execution enabled us to outperform in the segments we serve. And in calendar Q2, we gained PC share and expect to gain share in server and storage when IDC releases Q2 results. 
I'd like to take a couple of minutes and talk about the macros that provides important context for our remarks today. Since we last spoke in late May, our view of the demand environment through the back half of FY '23 has changed. The demand environment slowed and pushed to the right over the course of the quarter, particularly in CSG. We saw a decline in  PC demand as we went through the quarter with higher ASPs, partially offsetting a unit decline. Our supply chain execution was excellent throughout the quarter, and we were able to offset the CSG demand weakness with backlog reduction in CSG. 
We saw ISG demand while still growing slow and pushed throughout the quarter. The Q2 and second half macro dynamics have become more challenging as customers are taking a more cautious view of their needs given the uncertainty. We have responded swiftly by managing inventories down and reducing our expenditures. 
Now let me turn to the supply chain and innovation. Like Q1, we are still seeing shortage of parts and embedded integrated circuits, including power supplies and mix. ISG backlog, particularly servers, remains elevated. PC backlog is now at normal levels as Q2 PC shipments significantly outpaced demand and the portfolio is on standard lead time across the board. On the cost front, we expect modest deflation in aggregate component costs in Q3, while logistics rates are beginning to decline. Our strength in ASPs over the last year have been a result of richer configurations and product mix, but the lower cost environment could have an impact. 
Turning to innovation. We are proud of the significant advances we have made in the first half of the year developing new solutions for our customers. Expanding our multi-cloud ecosystem and delivering new cloud experiences that include all major public clouds, Project Alpine, which brings our enterprise-class data services into public clouds for bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics and data and container mobility. The largest release in PowerStore history and the new PowerMax OS 10 software deliver more than 500 new Dell storage software advancements that help customers deliver faster insights, achieve better multi-cloud data control and increase cyber resiliency. 
New APEX offerings like Dell APEX Cyber Recovery Services that extend beyond storage, compute and data protection and deliver APEX as a full stack solution. And in CSG, we continue to deliver new commercial devices for our hybrid world, including the Latitude 9330, the world's first laptop with a collaboration touch pad. 
We also recently celebrated 25 years of precision innovation, driving many industry firsts along the way. I actually led the workstation business when we launched Precision, so I'm particularly proud of this 1 in our #1 position worldwide. As we've highlighted, we're also innovating in strategic growth areas like telecom, and I'd like to provide a few examples of our progress in this important area. In May, we announced that we joined forces with T-Mobile to make it easier for enterprises and government customers to embrace 5G. T-Mobile's 5G private mobile network combined with Dell's edge computing technologies will bring customers the power of 5G connectivity on-premise where they need it. 
In June, DISH marked a major milestone in building the world's most advanced cloud-native 5G Open RAN network. They now offer 5G broadband service to over 20% of the U.S. population on a cloud-native network built on Dell's open IT infrastructure, software and services. As we think about the second half of the year, we remain focused on what we can control: execution, relative performance, prudent cost management and delivering for our customers and shareholders like we did during Q2. What we have shown over the years is regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to outperform. 
Now let me turn it over to Chuck.",741

We delivered strong financial results and excellent relative performance in CSG and ISG while managing the shifting demand dynamics as the quarter progressed. Starting with CSG. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $15.5 billion, up 9%, with operating income at 6.3% of revenue. Consistent with our Q1 commentary, commercial continues to fare better than consumer. Commercial revenue grew 15%, while consumer revenue declined 9%. An important measure of our success in any market environment is relative performance, and we again drove differentiated share results. We gained over 200 basis points of worldwide PC unit share and over 100 basis points of display share in calendar Q2 according to IDC. We have now gained PC unit share in 34 of the last 38 quarters. And in commercial PCs, our focus on the most profitable segment of the market, we gained over 300 basis points of unit share in calendar Q2 to claim the #1 spot worldwide. 
Turning to ISG. We delivered another record Q2 with ISG revenue of $9.5 billion, up 12%, our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, with operating income at 11% of revenue. Servers and networking grew 16% and storage grew 6%, our seventh consecutive quarter of servers and networking growth and our fifth consecutive quarter of demand growth in storage. The breadth of our storage portfolio continues to be a competitive advantage with #1 positions across storage categories. The breadth of leading capabilities is a real differentiator for us as one-size-fits-all architectures simply do not meet customers' diverse needs in the data era. 
In Q2, we saw modest storage demand growth with strength in the high end and in our marquee midrange product, PowerStore, which grew double digits and has grown every single quarter since launch. And in servers, we saw demand growth in most geographies, albeit at a moderating pace. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to gain server and storage share in calendar Q2 when IDC releases results in September. 
Finally, in ISG, I'd call out our momentum on APEX, our offerings for customers looking to buy infrastructure as a subscription. Our APEX ARR is now over $1 billion, and we grew orders 78% year-on-year in Q2 while adding almost 200 new customers. Customers like Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, who is using APEX private cloud to support its growth and cloud strategy and realizing significant cost savings as the financial institution serves its members, and customers like Montage Health, who's using APEX private cloud to provide clinicians better access to critical applications and information for patient care and staff collaboration. 
Stepping back, the near-term market outlook is marked by mixed signals, as Jeff highlighted in his macro comments. That said, we remain confident in the long-term health of our markets and in our competitive position. There has been a clear and significant increase in the size of the PC market from prepandemic levels as hybrid work has become the default approach for companies worldwide. And automation and digital transformation remain the backbone of our customers' strategies necessary for productivity and growth. Done right, technology investments are key to competitive advantage in the data era and can reduce costs while combating an environment with high inflation and labor shortages. 
So we remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of our core markets and our opportunity to build meaningful new businesses in the data and multi-cloud era and in our durable competitive advantages that enable us to outcompete in any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom for the financials.",587

While we did see modest infrastructure demand growth in Q2, we now see a more challenging ISG demand environment as we head toward the back half of the year. And in CSG, we are seeing demand weakness in both consumer and commercial. 
Overall gross margin was $5.7 billion, roughly flat and 21.4% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 200 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to an increase in our cost and FX headwinds not yet entirely reflected in pricing as we balance profitability with competitive positioning. 
Operating expense was $3.7 billion, down 3% and 14% of revenue. During the quarter, we instituted a number of cost reduction measures, including a slowdown in external hiring. Operating income was $2 billion, up 4% at 7.4% of revenue. Our tax rate was 19.9% and net income was $1.3 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. 
Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.68, up 14%, with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 755 million shares as a result of repurchases. 
Note that our GAAP profitability was impacted by a $255 million net adjustment to the value of our strategic investment portfolio given market conditions and $189 million charge relating to exiting our business in Russia, both of which are primarily noncash items. 
Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.2 billion a quarter, up 8%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $41 billion, up 2% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 24%, driven in part by our technology rotation solutions. We have historically seen stronger originations when the macroeconomic environment slows and DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in assets. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $700 million in Q2 and is $5.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Q2 cash flow was primarily driven by growth in profitability, partially offset by a use of working capital. Working capital was impacted by an increase in receivables due to the timing of sales later in the quarter, partially offset by a $400 million sequential reduction in inventory. The quality and aging of our receivables is strong and the team did a nice job on inventory this quarter, which will remain a focus as we move through the rest of the year. 
Our core debt balance is $16.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash and investments, down $1.4 billion sequentially, principally due to $900 million in capital returns and a $300 million strategic investment portfolio write-down on a gross basis. We repurchased 13.6 million shares of stock in Q2 for $608 million and paid $242 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1 and in Q2. 
Turning to guidance. As Jeff highlighted, we're seeing customers become more cautious given the current macroeconomic environment. We saw a softening in CSG specific to consumer and chrome in Q1. In Q2, the decrease in demand velocity extended to commercial clients, and we are seeing more cautious spending within our ISG business. Currency also continues to be a headwind for us, roughly 500 basis points for Q3 and roughly 400 basis points for the full year. Against that backdrop, we now expect Q3 revenue between $23.8 billion and $25 billion, down 8% at the midpoint, with CSG declining in the high teens and ISG growing in the low teens. We do expect gross margin rates to increase sequentially as mix shifts to ISG. 
Given the cost controls we have in place, we expect OpEx spend to be down versus Q2. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 750 million to 755 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.79, flat year-on-year at the midpoint. The environment we saw in late May translated to a 6% growth expectation for the full year with diluted earnings per share growing 12%. Given the change in the demand environment, our current view for fiscal year '23 is revenue flat to up 2%, with diluted earnings per share between $6.60 and $7, up 9% at the midpoint. 
In closing, we delivered strong second quarter financial results but are more cautious as we enter the second half. We are actively managing our cost and spending, and we remain focused on what we can control, executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future. And we expect to deliver revenue and earnings per share growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.

I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on the kind of linearity you saw in the quarter, specifically like was the book-to-bill greater than 1 in the first month and well below 1 in months 2 and 3? And your demand outlook seems strikingly more cautious than some other enterprise peers like Cisco and NetApp. And I'm wondering why you might think that your view is somewhat different from what they are seeing.",74

Look, as it relates to Q2 and how the quarter flowed, what we saw shortly, the typical pacing in a quarter is that it builds -- pipeline builds and converts as we go through the quarter more so as we get to the mid and late in the quarter. What we saw in Q2 was pipeline particularly in the client business did not build and/or pushed to the right. And we also saw ISG demand our pipeline pushing to the right. 
So from a linearity perspective, typically, the month 2 of the quarter is when we typically would see bigger velocity growth in the pipeline. And we, quite frankly, did not see it this quarter. And what we saw, as we highlighted in our talk track, is just an overall cautiousness with our customer base as they're sorting through the macro dynamics. 
So as a result of that, I mean, clearly, as we talked about in May, we had expected that we would see softer CSG demand, but we actually saw softer demand actually much softer than what we had seen, particularly for commercial clients. And because of that, as we talked about, although we had elevated CSG backlog, we did reduce backlog as part of our shipment profile for client in Q2. 
Look, as it relates to our cautiousness around enterprise demand or infrastructure, all we can tell you is what we see. And as a reminder, since we have the largest direct selling organization of all of the technology companies, we feel like we have a pretty good pulse on sort of current demand and environment. And we're just seeing more cautiousness on the -- on behalf of the customers as they're sorting through spend, as they're thinking through projects. We are seeing projects come to fruition. They're taking longer to close. And the size of the projects are somewhat reduced from what we've seen in the past. 
Jeff, Chuck, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",347

Maybe, Toni, I'll add a little observation from what we're hearing from customers on enterprise dynamics. I think, look, texturally, if I start with the PC business, commercial customers are just citing multiple reasons for sort of delaying purchases. That's caution around future hiring, trade-offs within their IT budgets given the macroeconomic uncertainty, customers reducing the size of orders and buying for only immediate requirements, but the net was we saw a meaningful shift in corporate sentiment over the course of the quarter. 
I think ISG dynamics were a bit different. So we saw demand growth in both servers and storage but at a moderating rate as just more caution entered the environment. So where commercial PC spending paused, infrastructure spending split, companies are putting more scrutiny on spend. As Tom said, deals took longer to close throughout the quarter, and we generally just saw more deliberate customer behavior. So what you see us calling out today is us trusting that better demand signal that Tom cited and what we're hearing from customers.",174

This is Jeff. Maybe a couple of comments. I'll start with PCs and work our way through the product line. I think it's important in PCs when you look at our mix of business being commercial versus -- or more weighted towards commercial versus consumer, we get a natural uplift there. And we're seeing, while we commented demand is slowing, richer configurations we saw consistently through the quarter, primarily from our premium products like our Latitude notebooks, our Precision class of workstations. So we're seeing a higher mix of our higher-end products as well as richer configurations. And I think that bodes well long term when you think about where we play. 
Then in addition, because of how we do business that you know very well, but I think it's worthwhile mentioning, our ability to attach software and peripherals, our ability to attach services and financing options to those PCs, I think, is a differentiated capability over anyone else in the marketplace. So while the market may be softening as we're referring to, our ability to continue to outperform with the quality of mix, the quality of our business, the mix towards commercial and richer configurations we feel good about. 
Similar trend in servers. If you think about the growth of our ASPs over time in servers, they've expanded, driven by our ability to drive richer content, by selling deeper into the data center, selling higher-value workload solutions around GPUs as an example, driving artificial intelligence-related workloads across our servers, we're getting richer and greater content in each and every server. And because of the challenges that we've had with supply for the better part of 6 quarters now, we've been able to pass through the incremental inflation that's been associated with servers to end users. 
And similar in storage. We think storage is an opportunity for us to continue to drive higher revenue. We have the broadest portfolio in the marketplace. We cover every aspect of the storage market from a high end to the mid-range, to the entry level, to the unstructured space, to the data protection space, all highly valuable categories in storage, which allows us to drive a differentiated revenue in our storage business.",370

It's Tom. So let me just -- I'll start and ask Jeff or Chuck to chime in as appropriate. So look, first, let me just say, Simon, as you know, we've seen economic cycles before. And I think the teams and the company's ability to navigate, it's pretty much -- we've got a long track record of doing so and optimizing the business as we go. 
So as we think about sort of sets of actions that we're driving right now, obviously, we saw the weakening environment. We have instituted a number of cost measures as a result of that, including effectively limiting external hiring. We've looked at discretionary spending and have pulled that back. All the normal type things that you would do from an OpEx perspective, quite frankly, when you see environment starting to soften. And we'll continue to monitor that as we shape the P&L to the best of our ability to make sure we deliver profitability that's in line with our expectations. 
From a pricing perspective, though, in terms of how do you think about what do you do from a price perspective or a promotional perspective, I think we're going to be very thoughtful as we do that only around the fact that in the environment, as we see right now, particularly in consumer, we don't see a lot of elasticity. And so we're going to be very direct and directed in any promotional spend that we do, principally focused on how do you think about product in the channel and things of that sort of that we have some of, although clearly not as much as our competitive set. 
So I do think you're going to see us continue to be disciplined in pricing. We'll be -- I am pretty low to test elasticity right now, given what I think the environment looks like, but we also need to remain competitive. And so we'll be watching the market dynamics pretty closely from a pricing perspective. 
Maybe, Jeff, I'd ask you to add a few things.",343
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2022",2022-08-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4031.0,2638686.0,99439295.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,25,"I mean, I would add, Simon, I think we have demonstrated discipline in pricing. Our product portfolio [ on the low ] across the 3 is in price position. Our win loss at each type of segment, whether it's small business, medium business, large corporation global remains consistent and consistently good at release set our share gains over the past decade. So we're going to remain disciplined there in PCs. Consumer is aggressive, as Tom said, given what is happening in the marketplace. We are not that tilted, if you will, or biased towards consumer. And where we play in consumer tends to be in the premium side and the gaming side, which tend to be less competitive. It tends to be an area where we have a differentiated advantage. The same is true on the commercial side, as I mentioned in the last question. 
When we move our way towards servers, the pricing environment is relatively benign. The pricing environment, we have large backlogs, we have demand ahead of supply because of what the supply chain has gone through for the past 6-plus quarters. And we see that pricing environment or the pricing environment there enables us to pass along our increased costs, as I mentioned, and the same is true on storage. 
And then even when you step back, I'd ask all of us to reflect back, note on being ushered down here, sorry, as we work our way through this change in demand, we are unbelievably optimistic about the long term. Hybrid work is here to stay, which drives higher mobile mix, which drives greater configurations and more peripherals. PCs are more pervasive in the education system worldwide. We're approaching the 3-year replacement cycle of what we put in to respond to COVID and triaging the work from home event from 3 years ago. And we're still starting at a market that's larger than it was pre-COVID, which we're excited by. 
And then you look at what's happening on the infrastructure side, the world continues to digitize at a nonlinear rate. Data is being created at unprecedented levels. We had data gravity pulling the infrastructure resources out to the edge. The new digital highways being built with 5G. So we absolutely are very bullish and optimistic about the long-term characteristics of the marketplace.",386

It's Chuck. Good to hear from you again. I'll start and let the team layer on. Look, as you said, we're pleased with our momentum on APEX, and we're excited to share the milestones today. APEX ARR is now approximately $1 billion. We grew orders 78% year-on-year in Q2, and we added 200 new customers. If you dissect it a bit, we've seen a lot of strength in our custom solutions. So our APEX Flex on Demand offer, that's effectively customized infrastructure across storage, server, HCI, data protection with committed and then buffer capacity and also our APEX data center utility offer, which is effectively customers that want to move all or part of their data center to a Dell-managed pay-per-use model. 
And as you said, look, in the current macro environment, we're naturally seeing lots of interest from customers who are looking to manage cash outlays by pivoting to a pay-as-they-go scale on-demand type model. So really good momentum in the business. Look, from a P&L and reporting and growth and margin, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We'll continue to report out periodically on our progress like we did today, and we're going to continue to remain focused on extending the offer set in APEX and hitting our technical milestones. So more to come from us on APEX.",224

So I wondered if maybe starting with the commercial, the enterprise side of things, if you could give us any further color or double-click on the types of customer, maybe where you've seen this slowdown. Are these large enterprises smaller? Any kind of trends you see there that might help us learn what's going on in the environment. And then likewise, in consumer, even though there's less exposure, I know you guys have a lot of good data there. One thing in particular on consumer we're interested in is higher-end consumers. Do you think that you've seen any evidence that those are weakening?",143
266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2022",2022-08-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,4031.0,2638686.0,99439301.0,Answer,Jeffrey Clarke,,Executives,31,"Sure, Rod. Jeff here, I'll take a run at this and then Tom and Chuck can certainly add. If we start with just commercial PC or enterprise, as you described, I think we said it in a variety of ways, but I try to make it crystal clear. One of the things that we had seen through the quarter, and Tom referenced how the pipeline did not build through the quarter as expected and as it most traditional or historically does, we saw the buying characteristics of large companies slow or what we call large bids. And the large bid part of our business slowed. And what large bids we did have were a smaller size. 
And as Chuck said in his comments, which I think are very appropriate, what we saw was the corresponding -- that's a corresponding behavior of customers buying to their more urgent needs, not their future needs, that they were being very cautious because of the macro environment we are all operating in. And that made its way down through the large multinationals, to the large corporations, and across our customer set. 
SB and NB were least impacted or at least impacted in that way on a relative basis. So they performed better on a relative basis, which is encouraging, but large businesses primarily in both servers and in PCs. We're the ones that slowed as those large bids became less frequent and more of smaller size, and that was the challenge throughout the quarter. 
On consumer, we didn't really -- we don't compete in the very low end of that marketplace. And that's certainly what you've seen now as I'm sure your channel checks tell you that the channel has ample inventory, the competitiveness in consumer has grown because of the ample inventory. And certainly, you're seeing that in some of the other reported earnings through the last couple of weeks. 
In terms of the high-end gaming and the XPS business or premium consumer as we like to call it, I mean certainly, we're impacted. You can't have a consumer business that has exposure to those 2 subcategories to not be impacted. They were impacted less. I think that answers your question. If I didn't, I'll give -- break Rob's rule here and let you qualify it a little more.",386

As we said in our talk track that, look, we did see ISG demand moderate across the quarter in terms of the overall demand growth. What we are seeing is customers with decision cycles elongating customer deal size reducing and, quite frankly, pipeline pushing a little bit. 
Obviously, digital technologies is an underlying theme and trend is here to stay, and we do see customers that are continuing to spend, just in the overall environment is cautious. And so as we thought about -- quite frankly, what informed some of our guide is that we look back and thought about where we were in May versus where we are now, although we still see ISG demand sort of in that low double -- or ISG revenue, I should say, in the low double digits for the year. It is a bit softer. And quite frankly, as we talked about backlog and elevated backlog within ISG, that's -- as we think about the back half of the year, that's an area that will probably bring backlog down as we go through the year depending upon ultimate demand signals and supply chain.",218

And that cautionary view is impacting how fast things will be built out in the future. Again, I think our characterization would be companies are buying to their urgent and immediate needs. I won't say they're postponing their longer-term build-outs, but they're actually reevaluating the timing of those. And I think that's probably an important way to think about it. 
The notion of digital transformation, the world digitizing the things that I referenced a few moments ago are still here. We're going to live in a world that is clearly more connected, more distributed, building data everywhere with data-driven sites, and that's going to require technology to bring to life. I think an immediate opportunity, I think our direct model in the way that we operate and how I think agile and nimble we are, we typically do well when markets are up and we typically do well when markets are down. So our direct model has allowed us our belief with our listening posts to see this early, position our company appropriately, and we intend to take share in the marketplaces we serve. And we think we're positioned to do that. 
And the ability to help, if you will, soft land some of the units slow down by having a model that -- or access to the market that allows us to sell higher-end configurations across PCs, servers and storage and attached peripherals, services and financing, I think, gives us an advantage in a marketplace that may be, I'll use your word, pausing. We would prefer the word slowing for the reasons that I outlined. I hope that helped.",291

I mean I can't help myself but to say, to build up Tom's prior conversation and our -- what we can control in our playbook in these times of economic uncertainty.

That is basically we're going to focus on what we control and we're going to position to play offense in this market, and that is we intend to accelerate our strategic position in both our core businesses and in these adjacent businesses. So while we saw -- yes. 
Sorry, just to finish my thought. Look, I think the cost actions that we took in Q2 that were incredibly prudent were also strategic and not uniformly applied. So we maintained our critical innovation investments. We made critical investments in our priority growth businesses like telecom edge and multi-cloud. And we stay externally focused. As Jeff said, we're a company that has gained 570 bps of commercial unit share over the last 5 years, almost 600 in mainstream servers and are the #1 leader in storage.

I want to go back to kind of Rod's question a little bit. I guess if I were to look at the guidance, I think you said low teens on the ISG segment this quarter. I'm assuming that implies year-over-year growth. It doesn't seem like that's really dissimilar to normal seasonality. Actually, I think you could even argue it's a little bit above seasonality. So I guess my question is, as we look at this next quarter and even the quarter after that, should we think about like backlog just burning down relative to demand deteriorating? And just help me bridge that -- that bridge between what's going on with backlog versus what you're actually seeing as far as slowing ISG demand.",123

That's actually what I was alluding to, right? So the setup of this conversation, if you think about what we just talked about in Q2 was moderating ISG demand as we went through the quarter. And so our expectation is that moderating demand continues. I think if you look overall for -- into the back half of the year, we -- particularly in the ISG space, you got to think about these things separately. We are a bit more optimistic about storage demand than we are about server demand at this point. 
And my comment around how we frame the guidance and the components of the guidance, particularly within ISG, has ISG growing sort of in that high single digits, low double digits through the back half of the year, principally both through whatever the current demand generation is in that quarter and then with elevated backlog using backlog to drive incremental shipments, all of this obviously predicated on the supply chain being there. And I think we have more confidence in the availability in the supply chain, particularly in the ISG supply chain. 
Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",195

As we look at the second half and the demand environment that we've been talking about from a supply chain perspective, the things that have impeded us to be able to ship what we sell in any given quarter, we believe are clearing the way in the second half of the year, which is what we're supposed to do in the supply chain organization. So working through -- the things that I've called out in the past that voltage regulators, embedded controllers, the associated ICs with the power supplies and the mix, our line of sight to them in the second half of the year continues to improve. And we're in a good supply position.",123

Last quarter, you talked PCs could be about 330 million units. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your current view in '22 and maybe any early thoughts into '23. And if we look at your free cash flow, right, your LTM free cash flow is very impressive. But over the last 6 months, it's been negative. As you look through this weakening demand environment and particularly declining revenues in CSG, I know you've got elevated levels of inventory as well. So there are quite a few moving pieces. So any help you can give us in trying to think through as you burn through that inventory and look at the elevated backlog, the rate and pace of that beginning of, how we should be thinking about your potential free cash flow generation over the next couple of quarters?",144

Wamsi, I'll address since I'm the 1 that put 330 million out there on our last call where our current thinking is. So I'm sure you saw last night that IDC came out with their new forecast, certainly, a significant change. Second half, obviously, particularly changed in the market now in their definition of roughly 305 million units, which I believe takes the market down on their side or just under 13%. 
Our view, so tying it to the 330 million that I talked about last time, our view is built on a proprietary model. That proprietary model uses many industry sources, that uses what we learn from our supply base and what we hear from our customers. And our model is a little more pessimistic than that. We're centering around 290 million units for the year, roughly 151 million sold in the first half of the year. You can do the math of how you get or what it would be in the second half. 
So we have the second half down more than IDC does based on our insight, our listening posts and our proprietary model that allows us to at least manage and navigate the business. So that's our current outlook, 290 million. It will be wrong tomorrow. The precision of these tools isn't that specific to the decimal, but it is an approximation of where we think the market is now in driving our behavior.",240

Let me start with just the storage side. So look, we're pleased with the storage performance. You saw that fifth consecutive quarter of demand growth in storage and that streak is now extended to the P&L, we're 6% growth in Q2 after 9% growth in Q1, so that's 8% growth for the first half. 
Look, I think we saw strength across a number of portions of our portfolio. Our breadth of portfolio continues to be an advantage. And so we saw growth in storage around the high end, PowerStore continued to grow, entry, unstructured. And I'd sort of call out that as we've said in the past, the storage business can be lumpy in any 1 quarter. And if we pull the lens back to the first half, our core storage business, data protection, hyperconverged infrastructure businesses all grew at a very healthy clip. 
So looking ahead on storage, we would say, look, we do see demand growth moderating as the caution that enters the environment sort of extends to storage. But from where we sit today, we see more moderation in server buying than in storage buying. And so we do expect storage demand growth again in Q3.",204

I think last quarter, you expect the gross margin to be kind of flattish in Q3 and up slightly in Q4.

But at an aggregate level, if you recall what we said in the guidance when we talked about this in May, we expected Q2 gross margins to decline given the mix of the business, given foreign currency, again, some of the backlog dynamics. And effectively, that's what you saw happen in the Q2 results. 
What we just said in the guidance for Q3 was that we do expect operating our gross margin, excuse me, to increase in Q3, just given the mix of the business, the pricing actions that we have taken to try to offset the currency, although that continues to be dynamic. But we think the mix of the business is helpful and we mix a bit more towards commercial PCs in the back half of the year as well. So our expectation right now with what we know today is that gross margins move upward in Q3 and then relatively stable as you go through the remainder of the year.",185

So I think we've tried to say that as we think about our businesses, we've talked about the PC business and the demand, the forward-looking server part of our business and its associated demand. And I think Chuck just referenced, we expect the storage marketplace to grow in the mid-single digits -- and we expect to gain share and outperform the market. Where are the sources of that performance? The sources of those performance are going to be our #1 positions across the portfolio. We're a market leader in the high end. We just put version 4 of PowerMax into the marketplace. It's unmatched in the market, and we continue to believe we can grow that. 
PowerStore, Chuck made some references of how PowerStore is doing. It's nearly half of our midrange mix now. 24% of the customers are new. We just put our third software release into the marketplace with a new controller. We now have a feature that certainly, we wish we have had earlier, but it's now in the marketplace, a native metro sync replication. We don't have any market deficiencies in the mid-range. And we have the most modern architecture in the marketplace, and we expect to lean on that. Our PowerScale and structured product is new.

Clearly, the mainframe refresh cycle so the high end are PowerMax should benefit from that. Now it's early innings, but we do expect there to be some benefit as a result of that. And the reality of the world is that data is still getting created. So the need and the ability of a company to store data continues to grow.

Let me start and then the guys can jump in here. As you think about what might be countercyclical in our business, you rightly pointed out that what we have seen in the past with DFS is that in times of macro uncertainty or macro weakness, customers tend to want to preserve cash balances and liquidity opportunities and move towards financing. And clearly, the originations that we saw in DFS this quarter are opportunities for us. 
So I would also talk -- point you to thinking about APEX is an opportunity, right, in terms of the as a service and subscription frameworks that many customers are interested in, the lack of preservation of capital or CapEx is an opportunity to lean into APEX, which will be interesting for us. If you think about sectors or verticals within the marketplace, and you think about the macro dynamic that's going on right now and where governments, in particular, are spending money or where investments are going into think -- within the government space, the defense sector, education and health care within the government space are interesting opportunities depending upon how budgets get released and how they flow. You've seen the macro around energy. And so investment flowing into the energy verticals and energy companies will require infrastructure build out. 
So there are a number of areas within this broad context of a slowing economy that are interesting to us that we are -- we will exploit as appropriate to try and drive velocity. I would also remind you that Jeff highlighted in his conversation around supply chain that we expect deflationary component costs in Q3. Obviously, you guys have been following this industry for a while and know that in times of deflationary component costs, historically, we've tended to do well in those types of opportunities as we think about margin opportunity there. 
So look, we'll have to navigate through it. It's what we do. But I'm confident that we'll be positioned to take advantage of any growth vectors that are out there.",342

Just 1 question on ISG server refresh later this year. Obviously, the new x86 server chips that are coming out this year are probably 1 of the most anticipated product releases. Can you talk about your customer feedback on expected demand [ this year ] within the context of macro slowing? And also just given that AMD-based service systems have increased as a percentage of the overall market, but do you anticipate your portfolio to also be in line with that?",89

So we talked about a slowing server demand independent of technology and architecture. It's probably we're saying for the last 6 quarters, we've been in a growth mode. The sector has really grown for us. It's been 7 quarters in a row, and you've seen this massive consumption of infrastructure. In this case, we're talking about servers. Servers, we benefited from that by taking tremendous share in this marketplace. 
So as I look forward, as we get through the consumption cycle, and I'm not here, I can't cast how long that consumption cycle is going to be delayed or paused as we go through what's called a digestion period. We're poised quite well when the consumption button gets turned back on again. We'll have refresh products, both classes of x86 architectures. We'll be in a performance position of the progress we've made strategically across high-value workloads. Our ability to sell deeper into the data center, what we're doing in the software-defined space across the board, I think, positions us quite nicely to take advantage of when that consumption period resumes. I can't forecast that. We talked about the demand slowing. We didn't say it was stopped. So I think that's an important notification. 
And then the longer-term attributes continue to really drive a demand, a multi-cloud world, a decentralized world, a data-intensive world, a world that requires more data-driven insights, automation and embedded intelligence. Those are the things that we built for our customers. So longer term, I feel really good. I'm not a market forecaster in terms of what happens in the next period of time, but we're positioned quite well.",283

Look, obviously, I think it was Amit pointed out that over the first half of the quarter -- or first half of the year, we've seen free cash flow sort of a bit softer, given some of the sequential dynamics -- demand dynamics and revenue dynamics in the business. So as we think about the back half of the year, we will generate free cash flow. Yes, our model, as you guys all know, is when we expand revenue with our negative working capital model, we tend to generate a lot of cash flow when revenue demand or revenues flatten. You tend to have a little bit of a pullback in that. We've got a number of actions in place right now, particularly around how do you think about driving working capital down to drive more efficient utilization of working capital. You saw our inventory came down $400 million in the quarter. We'll continue to work our way through that being cognizant of ensuring that continuity of supply and supply capabilities are there to help us serve our customers. 
We did build receivables this quarter doing some of -- as a result of some of the sales linearity that we saw the receivable agings in great shape. We're not seeing any signs of stress from the customer base there at this point. And so we'll work hard to get that back in the profile. Tyler, what else would you add to that?",243

266017.0,"Dell Technologies Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2022",2022-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Dell Technologies Inc.,3560.0,2695452.0,101365143.0,Presenter Speech,Chuck Whitten,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. We delivered very good results, including strong ISG revenue with record profitability and good CSG profitability despite the difficult demand environment that we highlighted in our last earnings call. The net of our disciplined execution was Q3 revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with record operating income of $2.4 billion and record diluted EPS of $2.30. ISG revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12%, while CSG was $13.8 billion, down 17%.  
From a macro perspective, Q3 played out as we previewed last quarter. Soft underlying PC demand and slowing infrastructure demand. Though storage did hold up fairly well relative to servers with growth in multiple storage types, including high-end and PowerStore. Our Q3 performance underscores our strategic focus, the advantages of our model and our ability to deliver differentiated results in any market environment.  
Our unique sales model provides direct, real-time feedback from customers of all sizes and across geographies and industries, which allows us to see the demand environment shift faster than the rest of the industry. And as the demand environment changed, we reacted quickly and decisively, which showed in our results. We took actions to reduce costs, decreasing our operating expense 3% sequentially in Q2 and another 6% sequentially in Q3.  
We have now reduced quarterly operating expense by over $300 million since Q1. We reduced server backlog consistent with our Q2 commentary, and delivered strong profitability as our model allowed us to access component cost deflation faster than the rest of the industry. And we stayed focused on relative performance in the most profitable segments of the market. Despite some expected distortions in the PC market given elevated competitor backlog, we continue to gain commercial PC unit share in Q3 and have now gained share in 35 of the last 39 quarters. In ISG, we expect to extend our industry-leading share positions in servers and storage when Q3 IDC results are announced in December.  
And we executed on all of the above without compromising our innovation agenda, with 30 infrastructure launches in the last 13 weeks, including 6 new Dell APEX offerings in strategic areas like multi-cloud, edge and subscription and as-a-Service. We're excited about the launch of Project Frontier, our initiative to deliver an edge operation software platform focused on unifying edge operations across infrastructure and applications for a broad set of industries.  
And earlier today, we announced the availability of PowerFlex, our flagship software-defined storage solution on AWS. With the cloud-first design point, PowerFlex on AWS is the first of Dell's industry-leading storage offerings available in the public cloud as part of Project Alpine. Our effort to bring our industry-leading storage software to public cloud to provide multi-cloud data mobility and simplify data management.  
It will enable customers to use Dell storage software capabilities and APIs wherever their data resides, without the need for purpose-built or specialized public cloud infrastructure. Our new Project Alpine related SaaS offerings will add to our growing portfolio of APEX solutions, while enabling our customers to harness the power of multi-cloud.  
Stepping back, the near-term market remains challenged and uncertain. On one hand, we are seeing some customers delay IT purchases. Other customers continue to move ahead with Dell given the criticality of technology to their long-term competitiveness and a growing need to drive near-term productivity through IT. The world continues to digitally transform. Data continues to grow exponentially, and customers continue to look to technology to drive their business forward no matter the economic climate.  
As the market leader in commercial PCs and infrastructure, we are well positioned, whether a customer is seeking to drive growth, productivity and efficiencies or a combination. We're trusted advisers to our customers, and we have a business model that allows us to adjust quickly to meet their needs. 
So we are very confident in our ability to adapt and deliver results despite the near-term uncertainty. Q3 was proof of our underlying advantages and ability to execute no matter the environment. As always, we'll continue to focus on what we can control, taking care of our customers, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline and building a unique and winning culture with our team.  
This is the playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles and no matter the backdrop, we intend to accelerate our strategic position as we did in Q3. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom for the financials.",740

I'm pleased with our Q3 P&L performance despite the tougher near-term demand environment. As Chuck mentioned, we highlighted the softening environment and slowing ISG demand in our Q2 earnings conversation and the third quarter generally played out as we expected, albeit with server demand velocity slowing a bit more than we anticipated. We continue to focus on executing our strategy to win in the consolidation and modernization of our core markets. And we have executed well over the last few years and again in Q3.  
In ISG, we've grown our revenue for 7 consecutive quarters and have grown our revenue at a 3% CAGR since fiscal year '20. We have been consistent structural share gainers in servers where we are #1, gaining 530 basis points over the last 5 years in mainstream server revenue per IDC. In storage, we are bigger than 2 and 3 combined. And with our refreshed storage portfolio, we have added to our #1 position, gaining share over the last 2 quarters and anticipate gaining share in both storage as well as servers again this quarter when IDC results come out in December.  
Our CSG business has grown at a 12% CAGR since fiscal year '20. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we have gained commercial PC unit share in 35 of the last 39 quarters, including Q3. 
Turning to our Q3 results. We delivered revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with strong ISG performance, particularly in servers. We reduced total backlog by $1.2 billion sequentially during the quarter with CSG backlog now in a more normal range and ISG backlog slightly elevated year-on-year but substantially reduced from the beginning of the quarter.  
Profitability was strong in Q3. Gross margin was $5.9 billion, up 2% and 23.7% of revenue. Gross margin percentage was up 2 points, primarily due to a favorable mix shift to ISG and a decrease in our cost of goods sold due to certain components turning deflationary along with declining logistics costs. FX remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 420 basis points. Q3 operating expense was $3.5 billion, down 8% and 14.1% of revenue as we slowed hiring and reduced discretionary costs given the current macro environment.  
As a result, operating income was a record $2.4 billion, up 22% and 9.6% of revenue. Our year-to-date tax rate decreased to 18.2%, primarily due to geographic mix of income. Q3 net income was $1.7 billion, up 30%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Fully diluted earnings per share was a record $2.30, up 39%, with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 743 million shares as a result of share repurchases in Q3.  
Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.4 billion a quarter, up 11%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $39 billion, down year-over-year due to a decline in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. 
Turning to our business units. In ISG, Q3 revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12% driven by a reduction in our server backlog, consistent with our Q2 call commentary.  
Servers and networking revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14%, and storage revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11%. As mentioned, we did see softening unit demand in servers, somewhat offset by higher average selling prices, given richer configurations driven by customers running more complex workloads. ISG operating income came in at a record $1.4 billion or 14.3% of revenue which was up 390 basis points as we benefited from scale with lower operating expenses and pricing discipline.  
Our Client Solutions Group revenue was down 17% to $13.8 billion, primarily due to underlying softness in both commercial and consumer demand. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 13% and consumer revenue was $3 billion, down 29%. Average selling prices trended higher in both commercial and consumer as customers bought PCs with richer configurations. CSG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% primarily due to scaling partially offset by stronger gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses.  
CSG operating income was 7.7% of revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 17% with strength across geographies and DFS ended the quarter with $13.8 billion in assets. We have historically seen stronger originations and more recently, an increasing interest in subscription models as the macro environment slows.  
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was approximately $400 million in Q3 and is $3.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Q3 cash flow was helped by profitability but offset by the sequential revenue decline in the P&L and a use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was up sequentially as we strategically accelerated purchases of some key components as we continue to navigate through supply chain dynamics. Improving working capital efficiency and reducing inventory remains a priority.  
Our core debt balance is $16.2 billion, and our core leverage ratio is 1.6x. We ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in cash and investments, down $600 million sequentially, principally due to $800 million in capital returns.  
Turning to capital allocation. We repurchased 16.3 million shares of stock in Q3 for $609 million and paid $238 million in dividends. In addition to our $1 billion annual dividend, since the beginning of our current share repurchase program, we have bought back 70.3 million shares for $3.36 billion. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic.  
Turning to guidance. Considering the demand environment, we expect Q4 revenue between $23 billion and $24 billion, down 16% at the midpoint with ISG roughly flat. Similar to Q3, currency continues to be a headwind for us. We are expecting a roughly 500 basis point impact to Q4 revenue. We continue to be focused on managing costs. However, we do expect to see a roughly $150 million OpEx increase sequentially given the extra week in our fiscal Q4.  
We expect our interest and other expense to be up $60 million sequentially driven by interest rate volatility and the impact on our derivatives portfolio. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 22% at the midpoint, which reflects a 19% plus or minus 100 basis point rate for the full year. We expect our diluted share count to be roughly 730 million to 735 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.80, down 4% at the midpoint.  
I recognize that many of you have questions about our view on fiscal year '24. It's still early in our annual planning process. However, I'll frame our current thinking. We expect ongoing global macroeconomic factors, including slowing economic growth, inflation, rising interest rates and currency pressure to weigh on our customers. And as a result, their IT spending intentions even as they continue to digitize their businesses. These dynamics are creating a broader range of financial outcomes for our upcoming fiscal year, particularly as we think about the second half of the year. With what we know today, it's likely next year's revenue is below historical sequentials using our Q4 guidance as a starting point. 
In closing, we delivered strong third quarter financial results. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term even though some customers have paused purchases in the near term, and we are committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted earnings per share CAGR of 6% plus and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better.  
Since fiscal year '20, our revenue has grown at an 8% CAGR, our diluted earnings per share has grown at nearly a 20% CAGR, and we have exceeded our net income to adjusted free cash flow target in each of the last 3 fiscal years. We have also committed to return 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time and have returned $4.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last 12 months through share repurchase and dividends.  
We will continue to be disciplined in how we are managing the business in our financial posture in this complex macro environment, focusing on what we can control and helping our customers along their digital journey.

What do you see across the ecosystem? Is it across all enterprises, the large and smaller ones? And within that, where do you think they're focusing their budgets on right now? Is it more server storage or software? Just kind of curious, any thoughts you can give on the IT spending environment [indiscernible]",69

Thanks, Krish. Let me give you a little bit of the texture that we're seeing. But maybe let me start by just highlighting, look, we executed very well in what was a very dynamic environment. As we've highlighted, our principal objective in this environment is to deliver relative performance and share gain. And in Q3, we did that across client server and storage, and we delivered very good profitability.  
So while we're not going to get into specific demand numbers today, let me offer some texture on the environment that we're seeing. First, I would just say that the CSG demand environment remains challenged with, as you saw in our results, consumer weaker than commercial. We saw slowing server growth. As Tom highlighted in our prepared remarks, it was probably a little bit worse than we anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call. And so as we said, Q3 server revenue growth of 14% was aided by server backlog reduction and storage fared better.  
It's ultimately not immune to the broader dynamics we're seeing across customers, but we saw growth across multiple storage categories, including the high-end HCI and PowerStore. To your direct question about texture underpinning that, those dynamics were largely consistent across geographies, we'd say, verticals as well and customer size. There's probably a couple of exceptions we would call out. One would be China, which had a much more pronounced weakness last quarter.  
And we would highlight the energy sector, the U.S. government sector and then medium business generally globally as performing better relative to the rest of the business. And the customer feedback is very similar to what we described in Q2, very cautious and deliberate behavior in the face of what's a lot of economic -- macroeconomic dynamics out there. So we're hearing reassessment of budgets, reprioritization, excuse me, of spending and customers buying effectively for just their immediate needs. So net, I would say Q3 was a continuation of the trends that we called out during our Q2 earnings call.",339

Can you kind of elaborate on your earlier remarks about the framework for '24. Just to clarify, when you talk about -- obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces, but how do you think about the historical sequential moves as we move through the year. So are you trying to communicate that we basically start with Q4 and then take sort of a normal sequential pattern over the last, let's say, 2 to 3 years and sort of maybe haircut that a little bit given the uncertainty? Just trying to maybe level set since my line dropped a little bit.",106

Obviously, as we look at the environment, it's pretty early in our planning process from a fiscal year '24 perspective. clearly, the landscape and the dynamics are complex, and there's a high degree of complexity out there, whether it's around inflation or interest rates, what's going on with FX, global growth in general, supply chain, geopolitical. I could probably go on, but you get the point that at this point, there's as we look at it, there's a pretty wide range of financial outcomes depending upon how some of these things move and change on us. And in particular, I would say the back half of next year continues to be -- has a fair amount of complexity. 
So Chuck mentioned that we do see customers with a bit of cautiousness in their spend right now. I think that's pretty evident. And so that said, we're going to focus on what we can control, meaning we'll focus on ensuring we help our customers as well as ensuring we manage the P&L properly, both -- and be tight on both spending and customer satisfaction.  
And just a reminder, I would highlight that from a spend perspective, we've been focused on spend now for a number of quarters as we have restrained hiring and put other cost control measures in place. But having said all of that, what I was trying to elaborate while I don't want to get into exactly what next year looks like because we're still working our way through it. We do think it's going to -- it's got some complexity and some challenges to it.  
And as a result of that, if you took sort of the midpoint of our guide and then ran historic -- normal historical sequential, say, over a couple of -- 2-year historicals and maybe haircut those a bit, I think you're going to be in the ballpark of where what our current thinking is, recognizing that's going to continue to evolve and change over the coming months.  
Maybe the other data point to help you triangulate on that is if you look at P&L revenue growth in the back half of fiscal '23. So obviously, the minus 6 that we just printed for Q3, at the midpoint, minus 16 of our Q4 guide sort of points to a minus 10, minus 11 sort of growth rate, and that's probably something you ought to think about as you do that math.",416

Obviously, in the guide, that sounds like it's a little bit more challenged of the market. I think you mentioned ASPs were up in this Q3. So can you talk a little bit about kind of where we are with channel inventory in commercial and consumer? What you see going on in the pricing and what impact that will have in margin? And maybe if you could just throw in what's going on with your backlog. I'm sure it's being worked down as well. It's probably multiple parter there, but I think you get the gist.",106

Let me start to unpack it and we'll probably double or triple team this one. So look, obviously, it's a challenging PC market backdrop. So maybe I'll just start with our current internal estimates for this year, which I think we shared on our last Q2 call of sort of 280 million to 290 million industry units. That's still our estimate as we go into Q4. And that implies sort of a mid double-digit decline in units year-over-year.  
And I think that would be the single largest percentage decline in recent history. You'd have to go back to 2015 to see something sharper. So that's the reality of the backdrop today. As I highlighted, commercial is holding up better than consumer, and that's clearly consistent with long-term industry trends. Commercial PCs, excluding Chrome, tend to be the more durable portion of the market. along with premium consumer and gaming, and that's where we've been focused.  
And so that's the dynamic that we see right now. As expected in that environment, from what we've seen, channel inventories remain elevated. We see promotional activity to sort of move units through distribution in particular. And as I said, customers are sort of waiting for -- to purchase for their immediate needs in this environment. In terms of pricing, you mentioned ASPs.  
Look, pricing has remained relatively stable across our businesses. If I stay on PCs for a moment, there's a number of factors. Clearly, in this demand environment, we've seen a more competitive pricing environment. Consumer was the first clearly to see that pressure a couple of quarters ago, and it remains very competitive, and we saw the pricing environment get even more aggressive as the quarter progressed.  
I would call commercial also as very, very competitive right now given the slowdown we were describing. We've seen more aggressive pricing, particularly in the largest accounts as the quarter progressed. And so that's the backdrop, as you can imagine, from a supply chain standpoint, supply and demand are -- where they were out of balance last year, we're now on more standard lead times across the portfolio, and we're really in a position where what we sell is what we ship in any given quarter, and that's the dynamic in CSG.",384

No, I guess if I can just talk about the sort of initial thoughts that you provided on fiscal '24 and understand some of the challenges and headwinds on the top line. But -- maybe if you can talk about what you're thinking in terms of the sustainability of the gross margin, particularly I'm assuming some of the mix impact carries over on ISG versus CSG. And you've had a couple of quarters of sequential decline in OpEx here. But as you sort of look forward, how are you trying to align your cost structure to that sort of demand environment that you're thinking of? And sort of what are the puts and takes when we think about the rest of the P&L in fiscal '24?",127

Samik, look, I don't want to get into talking through every line item. I mean, we gave you some early thinking just so you guys sort of think your way through what the P&L dynamics at a top line might look like. I'd highlight a couple of things though, right? So first, as it relates to gross margin stability and our OpEx, look, we'll work our way through what margin dynamics will look like. We do expect right now that component costs are deflationary in the first half of next year with what we know today.  
We do think that the back half potentially may change just given some of the supply-demand balances that are out there as we work our way through the year. Obviously, in a declining demand environment, if there is a little bit of ASP pressure, which we would expect that we might see next year. However, I do think that if you look at our mix of products and where we're focused on end markets, we've got, whether it's due to configuration or attach rates in the client space or the fact that our servers that we're shipping have a thicker content rate from a memory perspective, those should all be helpful as well.  
From an OpEx per -- so margins, I think we'll have to work our way through. OpEx, look, I think we've taken cost actions that have demonstrated the fact that we can control OpEx. And if anything, that we're very much focused on how do you manage your way through a complex environment like this, we will adjust our spend targets and our cost envelopes as appropriate to manage the P&L. So I feel pretty confident in our ability to do so. The actions we've taken already you can see them in the P&L, and we'll continue to work our way through that. So look, I think it's early to start talking full P&L at this point. Again, I just wanted to make sure you guys have some context around top line as we see it right now.",348

Is there a way to understand and look at ISG in aggregate or maybe even server and storage, how much of this growth is backlog versus end demand? And it sounds like the end demand is weaker [indiscernible] goes 2 buckets up. And then Tom, I think you mentioned the OpEx headwind or the OpEx impact from the extra week in Q4. I could have missed this, but could you just tell us what the revenue benefit in Q4 as well from extra week.",105

Amit, I mean, maybe I'll jump in on the business. I'm not sure I have a ton to add to our prior answers other than to say, look, the server business, we saw slowing server growth. We had hinted at that -- not even hinted at that, stated that in Q2 and had anticipated coming into the quarter, I would say, look, it worsened over the course of the quarter vis-a-vis our Q2 earnings call.
And therefore, our server revenue growth of 14% on the P&L was aided by server backlog reduction. And we would characterize server backlog is now roughly in its normal range. Storage is a bit of a different story. It fared better. We saw growth across multiple storage categories, high-end HCI, PowerStore, I would say storage backlog remains somewhat elevated relative to historical norms given the larger business we're in. And so a little bit of different dynamics across server and storage, but all in all, a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2.",171

As it relates to Q4, there is an extra week there given the dynamics of our fiscal year. The any impact of revenue/margin, and the results are already -- we've already embedded that in our guide. Obviously, if you think about an extra week, there is some level of incremental transactional demand that you get from some of our more transactional businesses, but a big majority of our business is also project and bid based, which doesn't really get impacted by an extra week end of quarter.

So look, as Chuck has already highlighted what we saw from a pricing environment perspective. Obviously, we talked about the fact in Q2 -- in our Q2 call that to the extent that we saw that we're in a component cost deflationary environment, we tend to do reasonably well from a margin perspective, given that we don't move pricing as much as costs come down or the pacing of that is different.  
And I think that's what we saw this quarter. So we had good -- lower input costs from component costs as well as logistics costs. We obviously priced for FX and some of the other dynamics that we saw in the environment. As a result of that, given the configuration in the amount of memory and storage we're putting on the servers particularly led to some better-than-anticipated margins, I would say. And so our ability to hold on to that -- over time, you obviously have to adjust pricing for some of those market commodities. But again, that's only one element of the pricing stack and you get into things like mix and configuration as other impacts. I don't know if Jeff may add any...",213

We have a lower inventory model. One of the benefits of how we run the company since beginning. It gave us availability to the lower cost component, I think, earlier than most. Our supply chain has executed well through this time. We had fewer mismatch sets. So we're able to convert the demand shipments and the backlog shipments throughout the quarter. And as a result of that, we were able also to take advantage, as Tom said, lower freight rates, lower expedites, lower supplier premiums, and we've obviously benefited from that throughout the quarter.",105

So I noticed your first 3 quarters of the year in aggregate, free cash flow was negative. And you talked about building some strategic inventory in the last quarter. How do you think about Q4, and by definition, for the rest of the year? And as we think through next year, do you expect cash flow to exceed your net income? I guess I am asking how long do you think it would take working capital to get back to normalized levels?",88

I'll take that one. So look, I think maybe just to start, if you think about the last couple of years, right, cash has been really strong, right? So we were seeing that build given that negative cash conversion cycle, and we obviously benefit from that. I think what we're seeing now is the opposite of that, right?  
And there's 2 things happening, and you talked about it, right? So we've got the contraction in the P&L, which is impacting cash and then working capital. And our intent, obviously, is to drive those working capital balances down, but we also don't want to miss opportunities and you saw us take advantage of that this quarter, which impacted cash. Now as I'm thinking into Q4, and I'm thinking it next year and recognize we don't provide guidance, I think you have to keep that in context that, one, Tom has talked about that there will be some pressure in the P&L, and that will impact cash.  
But at the same time, we do have opportunities in working capital, and it's quite substantial, right? So we'll be focused on driving that down. And obviously, that's something we know how to do, and we'll be smart about it. But that's how I'm thinking about it.",216

And then, Tyler, I would -- but we historically do generate cash and Q4 tends to be a seasonally stronger quarter for us. Now we'll have to work our way through this quarter. But look, I'm confident in the long-term model in terms of cash generation. It's -- obviously, when we're on a negative working capital or negative cash conversion cycle, when you get sequential revenue decline in the P&L, you're going to use cash. And that's what we're seeing.  
But the team is managing its way through it. We've got work to do in inventory. Pleased with what we're doing in receivables in terms of what that looks like in terms of the aging profile, collections, our ability to manage our way through it. So it's just one of we're in a cycle where we're just going to have to work our way through it. But long term, I believe the model is intact.",156

So just really pricing versus volume comments for the January quarter.",88

Look, as we think about the guide, right, so '23 to '24, '23 to '25, obviously, at the midpoint of minus 16%. We essentially say that we expect ISG to be roughly flat. That sort of implies that the client business or CSG is sort of in the negative -- minus mid-20 sort of year-over-year growth. Look, as we work our way through whether units versus ASPs, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail, but I want you to think a little -- if you think about margin dynamics in Q4 for a second, so you've got some seasonal dynamics that typically happen in our Q4.  
One, tends to be a stronger storage quarter for us given the corporate budget cycle, the calendar year corporate budget cycle that tends to be a positive in terms of margin dynamics. The flip side of that is you get into the holiday season. Traditionally, that has been a bit stronger from a consumer PC perspective, which has put, as you might imagine, shifts the mix a little bit and put some a little bit of downward pressure on margin, coupled with -- we highlighted the fact that we did see some incremental commercial PC discounting in Q3, particularly in the third month of the quarter.  
And obviously, we have -- there are elevated inventory levels in the channel. So we put it all together and quite frankly, we sort of think about margins from Q3 to Q4 at an aggregate level as being roughly flat. And then you couple that with the OpEx dynamic that I'm talking, we highlighted that sort of gets the, quite frankly, the P&L walk as you think about it.",285

I was just curious, when we look at sort of the big beat in margin -- gross margins this quarter, you mentioned a lot of different dynamics, including things that seem under your control a little bit, like configuration and content attach rates. So how much were you able to manage the margins up versus just circumstance? And how much can we sort of think about Dell going forward in the tough environment, being able to manage the gross margins a little bit better?",90

I think, look, Q3 highlights, I think it's both the advantages of our model and very good execution in quarters. So look, foundationally, if you unpack Q3, clearly, we saw higher ISG mix. And as we've said, a relatively stable pricing dynamic. And that pricing dynamic is a combination on the PC side, richer configurations and a more favorable mix of product along with higher attach rates, helping offset PC unit declines.  
And then on the server side of the business, higher content rates, so I think memory, SSDs, richer GPUs, offsetting the unit pressure. So I think that's just foundationally. But I think the real margin story is what we were talking about a couple of questions ago, with Q3 being deflationary and our lower inventory model, it allows us to access component deflation faster than the industry.  
And then when you couple that with our ability to see the demand signal quickly and react, we were able to lower OpEx as we put in the prudent cost controls that Tom described. So those were the puts and takes across Q3. A lot of that is in our control. Some of that is the advantages of our model in this environment.",206

We're not in a position of having to discount that, not in a position to have to promo that. We're not in a position where you have to go chase volume. We have a conscious strategy in the high-price band [indiscernible] consumer and the focus on commercial. That gives us historically, and I think we're seeing it today, an advantage in the market. So we're not having to respond to that discounting in promotional activity to burn down excess inventory. Plus by the fact that we have lower inventory, just as Chuck said, we were able to take advantage of lower input cost, component costs throughout the quarter. Coupled with that, like Chuck -- maybe I wasn't clear earlier, but I think it's worth emphasizing again, the logistics costs have come down. As supply now is ahead of demand, we're able to put things on the ocean. We don't have to expedite as much. We're not using as much expedited air freight. Those all go into our input cost equation, which obviously helped us in the bottom line and the performance of this quarter.",200

Did you have any revenue that you left on the table because you weren't able to get all the parts. And then just on ISG, you talked about backlog reducing this quarter. How far would you say that we are out from backlog normalizing? And do you think you'll get any support on that on the server side? Or is it -- or the backlog is all on the storage right now?",102

Let me try to break that down -- those multiple questions and at least as I think about supply and where some of the shortages are. If I look at the CSG business, again, largely a handful of minor exceptions, supply is ahead of demand across consumer PCs, commercial PCs, displays, docs to the point that we're now able to readjust our freight networks to take advantage of that. We're in a good position. Servers, we had -- as the team mentioned, we talked about backlog and backlog reduction. I tend to think of it -- since you asked about supply where are the hot spots in supply. They tend to be in power supplies. They tend to be in the power ICs and high-performance NICs. Those are still constraints in the marketplace today.  
I think we weathered the storm quite well throughout this period of time and particularly in Q3 and allowed us to maximize server shipments. In storage, the shortages would be in these custom ASIC parts. So think of it as FPGA, CPLDs, those types of devices. The best way we translate this to our customers is in the form of lead time. I don't think -- I can't remember the last time I was in front of you all and said the PC product line is essentially on standard lead time.  
It's been a long path through this COVID supply chain challenge time to be able to say our PC product line is on standard lead time. Our server product line, a large percentage of that is on standard lead time, and it will improve throughout the quarter as will storage. So if I think about it in terms of specific backlog, we are at normal backlog in PCs. I think we're at normal to near normal backlogs in servers and a slightly elevated backlog in storage. I think that answered all 3 of your questions.",321

Look, Simon, I would say, look, we would never argue that storage is immune to the broader IT spending dynamics that are out there. But we would say it's from where we sit right now, it's held up better in our Q3. I think you're right, historically, there's been a correlation, but it tends to have less amplitude than, say, our commercial PC market or the server market. 
Clearly, right now, data is exploding. The world needs more storage. And so when we flash forward to what's implicit in our guidance, we're anticipating a seasonally strong storage quarter in Q4. And so I think why you're right, historically, there's been a correlation between our server and storage business at least from where we sit right now, we're still seeing strength in the storage market.",135

I'm just trying to square how much worse incrementally and sequentially, you think demand may get in fiscal Q4. So when I kind of look at your numbers, typically, you're up from Q3 to Q4 by 5-plus percent. So let's say, $1 billion. An extra week, we're probably at a minimum of 5%. I get -- I know you have contractual business, but you have an extra week to deliver those on those contracts. 
So that's up another 5%, that's $2-plus billion. So normal seasonality, you'd be up $2-plus billion and you're guiding basically to be down $1 billion. So it's a $3 billion delta versus normal seasonality. So I guess a couple of questions. Does that imply that you see demand getting incrementally worse. And are you anticipating any backlog drawdown? I get it was $1.2 billion in the quarter, but that doesn't explain the $3 billion delta versus normal adjusting for the extra week. So are you expecting any backlog drawdown in Q4? And how elevated in dollar terms is the storage backlog relative to where server was entering Q3?",183

So as it relates to Q4, look, I think as we think about clearly, we're projecting that the business continues to soften, right? I mean I think that's pretty apparent given the fact that I'm telling you now that we expect PC revenue to be sort of in the mid negative growth -- mid-20s year-over-year negative growth. 
And I'm expecting client -- or I'm sorry, ISG to be roughly flat versus where they were this quarter. So the business is softening. I think we'll manage our way through that like we always do. As it relates to the 14th week, there is a little bit of extra transactional demand in there. It's not that significant. So I haven't done the math on your $3 billion or your -- that 5% comment. But look, what we're trying to give you a point of view on is that we think demand does soften, right? And if you think about our guide for next year, that's sort of [indiscernible] follows from there. 
As it relates to backlog, look, we don't forecast what happens with backlog in terms of how we're going to talk to the Street about it. But we've just talked about the fact that in general, backlog is back in normal ranges. Yes, in storage is slightly elevated. So if there's any opportunity, it would be there, but that's very much going to be dependent upon linearity of the quarter and how the storage orders come in, which has always been an interesting dynamic with the storage business for us.  What we've told you is our best point of view at this point in time, and we'll continue to manage the business tightly as a result. I don't know if Jeff or Chuck, you'd add anything to that.",308

Look, I think we saw -- as you think back to our Q2 commentary, what we talked about the fact that we saw PCs -- consumer PCs have been soft, and we saw commercial PCs weakened. So I think that's pretty self-explanatory.",43

I wanted to go back to one of the comments that was made, which is that you're seeing increasing interest in subscription models. I don't know if you can talk a bit about what customer bases are interested in them. How we should think about, I know they'll have a little bit of a dampening impact to revenue, but obviously locking in recurring revenue. So maybe if you can just discuss a bit of what you're hearing from customers.",88

Thanks, Shannon. It's Chuck. I'll start. Look, it's -- that's been our APEX business, which in Q2, we highlighted that we sort of hit the $1 billion milestone and side growing at a continued healthy rate and adding new customers. We've been consistent that we're going to be thoughtful about how we discuss progress there. 
We're not -- certainly not going to provide sort of quarter-to-quarter updates. And so we can share metrics that can be traced clearly back to the P&L. But what I would tell you is interest remains very high in our subscription offers. We saw again triple-digit customer growth and healthy ARR growth in the quarter. And we continue to invest in the portfolio and our web deck as a whole series of new APEX offers that we've released since we last spoke in August. 
We tend to see broad-based interest. Right now, it does tend to be concentrated at some of the larger companies in the medium-sized businesses in the world, but we're getting a lot of interest in conversations from customers as they try to navigate this macro environment as you would imagine. It's not sizable enough relative to our $100 billion trailing 12-month business to sort of go much more beyond that. We are getting a lot of customer interest.",218

What we've done around expanding our geographic capability, our channel capability and our customer managed option capability around ADSS, I think, is another extension that we can continue to grow on. And then the 2 as-a-Service offers that we've extended. One, the Red Hat offer that we announced back in September. 
And then secondly, the new one, which is the APEX High Performance Computing service, I think, is another opportunity for us to grow. And I can tell you the pipeline is full of continue to do APEX offers.",112

While they were up and you talked about a deflationary environment for the need to secure some pretty key components which is understandable. Can you talk to us about when you think you'll actually kind of renormalize inventory and working capital? Or is it just better simply to hold more because with the deflationary environment, you just kind of have to wonder here, but I understand there's shortages.",81

Jim, look, I mean it is my goal, and I think the goal of all of us here that we need to manage inventories down. We built it over the last couple of years given the supply chain dynamics going through the pandemic. In a deflationary environment, you clearly want to hold less inventory. And so I'm not going to give you an exact time line on where we -- how this thing sort of unfolds. But I think absent the strategic buys we did this quarter, the inventory actually came down quite nicely. 
The strategic buys who didn't make economic sense. And so we -- that was the whole point behind that. So I do think it's going to be a few more quarters as we continue to normalize inventory. And then we'll have to evaluate this as we go in terms of what's the right level, given the supply chain dynamics. And so more to come on that. But in the meantime, over the next few number of quarters, we're pretty focused on pushing inventory down from a working capital perspective.",184

Before we end the call, I'm going to leave you with a few final thoughts on behalf of the team, and then we'll wrap. Look, we delivered strong performance over the last few years, and we delivered again in Q3. As we discussed today, Q3 highlights the advantages of our model. We see changes in the market first, and we react and position the business to outperform. So in Q3, we took appropriate cost action. We drove share gain. We delivered very good profitability. We drove our innovation agenda forward and we delivered against our capital return commitments. 
And that's what we mean when we say that we can deliver differentiated results in any market environment. We do expect the demand environment to be challenging in the near term. But the long-term trends remain very much in our favor. And importantly, we have a seasoned leadership team led by Michael, Jeff and Tom, who have a strong track record of delivering across these challenging economic cycles. So we're going to stay focused on what we can control, and we remain committed to delivering differentiated results for our stakeholders as we did in Q3. So with that, we appreciate everybody joining us today, and look forward to seeing you soon.",213
