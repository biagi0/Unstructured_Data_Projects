410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748065.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, the entire PC and the mobile market experienced a severe downturn positioned in the results of other players in our industry. Inevitably, Lenovo was largely impacted too. But with our diversified growth engines of infrastructure solutions and services, over 40% of our revenue now is driven by non-PC businesses. This also helped us to maintain solid profitability. Even in PCs, we continue to keep our market leadership and industry-leading profitability.
We believe the PC market might stabilize sooner than many expect, and we continue to drive efficiency in our already linked operations, maintain healthy cash position and invest in innovation and sustainability.
Despite the low IT market growth in the short term, total IT spending is expected to recover to our moderated growth rates in the mid- to long term.
Meanwhile, the macro trend of digital and intelligent transformation continues to accelerate.
Last quarter, impacted mainly by a significant decline in device business, our group revenue was down by 24% year-on-year, or 18% in constant currency. Both Solutions and Services business and the Infrastructure business grew by high double-digit year-on-year to historical records.
With positive operating profit contributed by all our main businesses for the fifth consecutive quarter, we remain committed to doubling profitability in the midterm.  
Last quarter, we took proactive actions to reduce expenses and improve efficiency to ensure our cost competitiveness, especially in areas where we see a softer market outlook.
Our cash balance is still strong. Cash conversion cycle continues to improve, and the channel inventory is reduced, which allow us to continue investing in R&D centered around the new IT technologies.
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with the SSG, Solutions and Services Group. Although adjusted to slower growth this year, the $1 trillion IT service market is expected to remain strong for the mid- to long term. By 2025, Managed Services, cloud, on-prem and edge is expected to increase at a 7% CAGR, while hybrid infrastructure solutions is becoming essential.
Vertical Solutions and Services spending is also expected to remain at almost a double-digit CAGR growth in education, smart retail, smart city and manufacturing from 2023 to 2025.
Last quarter, our SSG revenue grew by 23% year-on-year to USD 1.8 billion, setting a new record. All segments again delivered high profitability and a strong revenue growth.
The revenue mix from non-hardware tied solutions and services achieved a record high of 53% with the Managed Service business almost doubled year-on-year. Lenovo''s Hefei factory has been added to World Economic Forum's Global Lighthouse Network for its smart manufacturing solution.
SSG continued to invest in building scalable and repeatable horizontal and vertical solutions with Lenovo IP. 
We also enriched our digital workplace solutions, strengthened our hybrid cloud portfolio and further expanded our sustainability offerings. Our ISG Infrastructure Solutions Group, continues to benefit from ICT infrastructure upgrade. By 2025, the server market will reach USD 135 billion. Edge infrastructure, $37 billion and Storage $35 billion.
Last quarter, our ISG revenue increased by 48% year-on-year to a historical high of USD 2.9 billion, beating records for 3 consecutive quarters.
Operating profit more than doubled year-on-year to a new record. Server revenue grew by 35% year-on-year, making Lenovo the third largest server provider in the world.
Storage more than tripled to become #5 in the world, and the software grew by 52% year-on-year or reaching an all-time high.
Meanwhile, we continue to enhance our comprehensive infrastructure portfolio and to invest in innovation, particularly in AI-empowered edge computing and hybrid cloud.
We strengthened Lenovo's unique advantage to balance the scale and profit. We remain focused on being one of the fastest growing and ultimately the largest end-to-end infrastructure solution provider in the world.
Last quarter, our IDG, Intelligent Devices Group, experienced a severe decline in device markets. However, the real demand reflected by the activation data was actually better than the shipment data seemed to indicate. While the PC market still needs some time to digest the inventory to a healthier level, we believe total shipments are likely to stabilize at a higher than pre-pandemic level as early as the second half of this year.
In tough market conditions, IDG successfully maintained the #1 position in PCs and the industry-leading profitability for the past quarter. We achieved a solid operating margin at 7.3%.
Our strong product competitiveness was further reflected in leading activations and resulted in improved inventory level.
Our smartphone business achieved the 11th consecutive quarter of profitability. Our premium product, Motorola edge activation grew by 74% year-on-year. We expanded the premier product mix for our tablet portfolio as well. Meanwhile, our smart spaces solutions demonstrated growth potential with key wins.
In the short term, we will take proactive actions to reduce expense and improve efficiency to ensure business healthiness. While in the long term, we will keep investing in innovation, focusing on premium PC under adjacent areas and drive the evolution from smart devices to smart spaces.
Last month at CES, our Yoga Book 9i as a first full sized OLED dual screen laptop in world on a historic high of 15 awards. And our enhanced digital workplace solutions are improving user experience in our hybrid workspace.
Looking ahead, while the industry cycle still needs some time to run its full course, strong execution can make a big difference. Our diversified growth engines are firing up.
Our operational resilience is supporting the results. Our healthy liquidity is ensuring the soundness of the company and our investment in new IT is building the NextWave of our competitive advantages. Because of this, we are confident to deliver sustainable growth and improve profitability.
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wong Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",963
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748066.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q3 in the 2023 fiscal year.
The persistent macro volatility created a challenging environment for us in Q3, with group revenue declined 24% year-on-year in nominal terms to $15.3 billion, or down 18% in real terms, while group net income dropped 32% year-on-year. Notwithstanding challenging market conditions, our gross margin and operating margin improved by 44 and 28 basis points year-on-year, respectively, for the third fiscal quarter.
The group's stable profitability is a testament to its operational excellence and success in its long-term growth strategy for non-PC investment by supercharging growth in SSG and ISG.
Revenue from non-PC pillars made up 41% of group revenue, up 9 points from last year. SSG and ISG set new milestones in sales and profits. Together, their profit grew by 19% year-on-year and partially mitigated the pressure of a smaller scale operation and rising finance costs.
Going forward, the group will continue to prioritize this medium-term target of doubling its net margin. We continue to optimize the group operations for greater business agility and to support long-term growth. Our cash and cash equivalent balance exceeded $5 billion at the end of the quarter, 34% year-on-year.
We increased our net cash by $500 million from the same period last year to a balance of $581 million. We improved our cash conversion cycle by 13 days year-on-year and 3 days quarter-on-quarter to negative 6 days going to extension in accounts payable days. In the meantime, we will continue to drive inventory optimization. Last quarter end, we managed to reduce our inventory by over $900 million, both annually and quarterly.
SSG reported a 23% year-on-year growth with revenue reaching $1.8 billion, thanks to robust growth across all Service segments. Revenue of Managed Services nearly double year-on-year, owing to the ongoing asset service track. The economic downturn appears to have accelerated the popularity of asset service solutions as our deal pipeline remains steady despite macro uncertainties prolonging the conversion cycle.
Our Project & Solutions Services segment provides a broad base of solutions, leveraging Lenovo IP. We also saw revenue increasing by 7% from the same period last year.  
During the quarter, the combined revenue of Managed Services and Project & Solutions services was 53%, 4 percentage points more than last year.
Attached and Support Services revenue also increased 12% year-on-year with a record PC service penetration rates despite declining sales for new devices. 
SSG operating margin of 20% dropped 2 percentage points year-on-year was due to a mix shift. But overall, it remains significantly higher than the group average, expanding Lenovo long-term profit margin. SSG reported an all-time high operating profit of $370 million, up 12% year-on-year. Deferred revenue grew by 8% year-on-year to $3 billion. This echoed the success of the group transformation journey to enlarge and sustain its recurring revenue base.
ISG continued to deliver exceptional results as revenue and operating profit both set new records This Q3 revenue grew by 48% year-on-year to $2.9 billion, while operating profit increased by 156% year-on-year to $43 million. ISG was able to build a comprehensive product portfolio to achieve significant premium to market growth. This product strategy, along with an increase in customer base and design-in projects was effective in driving all-time high revenue of server, Storage, software and AI edge. The latest quarterly third-party statistics indicated that ISG market share by revenue in the global storage market nearly doubled year-on-year.
By customer segment, ISG exposure to CSP and ESMB segments gave the group a unique advantage in balancing scale and profits. Both segments saw double-digit revenue growth to record levels.
IDG was impacted by sector-wide headwinds, including lower demand and excessive inventory. Despite revenue and operating profit, each declining by 34% and 37% year-on-year, operating margin was well sustained at 7.3%. This industry-leading profitability reflected the group's efforts in stepping up operational efficiency and in expense control to mitigate market challenges.
We work with our distribution partners to increase their sales activity and looked at the decline in sell-out is less than the sell-in would lead to a lower channel inventory. IDG continued to invest in innovation for non-PC and adjacent areas to drive long-term growth.
The smartphone segment was profitable for 11 consecutive quarters. In the tablet segment, nearly 1/3 of sales was from premium segment and in smart collaboration solutions, growth remained robust with key wins across geographical and global accounts.
We continue R&D investment to drive innovation. The group's R&D spending increased by 5% year-on-year to view various growth engines, business transformations and ESG initiatives. The group continuing investment in R&D and together with rebalancing our operating expenses and mitigated the adverse impact from demand volatility in the near term while addressing long-term customer demands beyond technology hardware to drive sustainable growth. 
The group is now well recognized by its accelerated ESG investment and has received many accolades. MSCI upgraded our ESG rating to the highest level of AAA. The group also ranked 24th in the Boston Consulting Group's most innovative company list of over 1,500 global companies. Additionally, Lenovo was highlighted in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality index for the fourth consecutive year and featured as a leader in climate change and water security by CDP.
Last month, the group's commitment to reach net zero by 2050 was validated and approved by the Science Based Target initiative or SBTI, a partnership between the UN Global Compact, CDP, World Resources Institute and Worldwide Fund for nature, picking its the first PC and smartphone maker and one of only 139 companies in the world with a net zero target validated by SBTi.
External challenges prevailed in the global market and could extend well into future periods. The conference of global economic challenges and dynamic shift in market demand represent new long-term opportunities. The group continues to further strengthen its cost competitiveness to achieve its medium-term goal of doubling net margin. We will do this by investing in high-margin growth engines and taking proactive steps to reduce run rate operational expenses by approximately $850 million. This includes overall reduction in operational spending as well as workforce adjustments where necessary and appropriate.
We will take a comprehensive view to maximize operational efficiency, maintain momentum in our diversified businesses and continue to invest in new IT technologies to drive sustainable, profitable growth for the group.
The group will foster the development of new IT architecture with the client-edge-cloud-network-intelligence framework. These investments, coupled with the growth plan to taking out operating expenses to maintain our operational excellence and global footprint are the key to mitigating external challenges and supporting its service-led transformation, enabling the achievement of our medium-term goal of doubling net margins.
Looking forward, SSG should benefit from a list of demand for premium TruScale as-a-Service, sustainability and vertical solutions. Although macro headwinds could delay the due conversion cycle in the near term, the need to extend asset usability with supercharge long-term demand for maintenance services, SSG will further broaden its service offerings, including asset recovery services while strengthening channel tools and cooperation with business partners expand its Attached and Support Services. Managed Services is well positioned to capture the long-term structural growth in as a service.
ISG group's industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expanded to full stack offerings, including server, Storage and software. The ESMB segment will capitalize on growth opportunity in AI-empowered edge, hybrid cloud, high-performance computing and solutions for the telco communication sectors. For the CSP segment, ISG has a unique ODM+ business model to address the growing demand for vertically integrated supply chains. The business will continue to diversify its customer base and capture new accounts through design wins across technology platforms. The approach will achieve the optimal balance between general purpose and customized offerings while ensuring the appropriate scale and an efficient cost structure to enable revenue and profitability growth.
For IDG, we're striving to reinforce our #1 position in the PC sector while maintaining leading profitability. IDG will continue to lead the race in device innovation by enhancing features for hybrid working, gaming, entertainment and ESG designs. IDG will further invest to score wins in non-PC areas, including fast-growing accessories, smart collaboration and smart home devices.
In the short term, the total addressable market for PC would return to its pre-COVID level, but we anticipate it should be structurally higher in the long term as [ PCG ] comes the center of digital life.
In terms of our smartphone business, we will focus on portfolio expansion and differentiation to take advantage of the accelerated 5G adoption.
Our strong financial position provides a solid foundation for us to proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead. Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability for our shareholders. Thank you. We will now take your questions, please.",1467

We have several questions coming in. And our first question is coming on Conor O'Mara from Jefferies.
There are 3 parts of the question. First one is several cloud CapEx companies in the U.S. have tempered their budgets this year. Have you seen the same with your client base? And if not, why not? This is the first part of the question.
And the second part is regarding the cash conversion cycle. Our cash conversion cycle improved 13 days this quarter. How much of that is sustainable? And how much -- just because PC downturn [indiscernible] working capital needs.
And the last part of the question. What gives you the confidence to predict PC sales will stabilize in second half of 2023 and at pre-COVID levels?",129

So probably a couple of questions, so we need different people to answer that. Regarding of the cloud, CapEx company, so Kirk, so probably you can answer the question.",30
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748073.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,9,"Yes. Hello, this is Kirk speaking. So I would say, in general, yes, in a broad sense, the overall total available spend is probably down. However, largely, Lenovo is immune to that trend, and I'll give you some color on why Obviously, we just announced a record in our cloud business. And for many quarters, I've been talking about our new ODM+ model, where we're delivering custom designs for the largest Hyperscalers in the world. Those designs have been ramping for many quarters, not just in the server space, but we're also expanding very aggressively into the Storage space as well. So despite the fact that the total market of spend might be down, Lenovo is definitely known for many years and the last several quarters that we've gotten the designs for those motherboards, those systems and those racks because we've been designing those in for the last year plus at least.
Secondly, we're expanding our opportunity because we've expanded beyond just Intel to include AMD and also Ampere as an ARM provider to the cloud. So we're expanding the amount of designs we can get, not just by going from server to Storage, not just by doing the design, but also expanding our CPU providers.
Next, we also expanded to our NextWave and created an entire new sales force about a year ago to address the NextWave of Hyperscalers, which is growing significantly, again, branding design wins for Lenovo.
And then last but not least, we have new factory capacity in new factories in Mexico and Budapest that are significantly improving our logistics costs, and that's definitely driving us to be more agile and getting more design. So while there may be some softness in the overall market, we're dramatically increasing our presence for those reasons I stated. Thank you.",301

So, regarding of the PC demand, so in my view, if you want to understand the future, so probably you need to understand the past 3 years. So if we -- probably most of people unless see the shipment data given by IDC, but I don't think the shipment data can precisely reflect the real market. But the real demand can be reflected by the device activation data.
So if you use 2019 as a base, 100%. So actually 2020, the activation increased by probably 15%. The real demand -- I would say real demand probably increased by 15%, but the shipment only increased 7%, 8%. So that generated a lot of supply shortage. Then since then in year 2021, definitely, channel started to push inventory. So you can see in year 2021, the shipment increased by 15%. But the actual diverse activation was actually flat to 2020. So that's definitely accumulated a lot of inventory.
Then you can see in year 2022, channel started to digest the inventory. So the shipment declined significantly. But the real device activation did not decline as much as shipment last year, probably only 6% year-on-year.
So by the end of last year. So the -- so let me say, November, December. So the real activation number probably is -- the real shipment number probably is consistent with the activation number.
So in my view, next year, so the real demand reflected by the activation could be flat to this year. so which is now 5% to 8% higher than 2019. But probably we still need 1 or 2 quarters to digest the inventory in the channel. Then from the second half of the year, you can see PC market resumed the growth.
That will drive the entire 2023 shipment drop, severe drop by 5%, but it is still higher than 2019. Then since 2024, I think the market will resume the growth. So that will ensure the overall the overall demand will be 5% to 10% higher than 2019. And both shipment activation will be consistent in that year, hopefully. So that's why -- so we are rather confident for the second half of the year. So I don't know, Luca our IDG leaders have something to add.",377

So Yuanqing, I think you have already presented the data view for which, obviously, I am totally aligned. And I think maybe I can just add that we feel confident about the long-term trajectory because, simply because of digital transformation, hybrid work, digital life, all these are secular trends. PC is definitely at the center of all these trends.
And additionally, there is out in the market opportunity for more than 400 million PC that are more than 4 years old to be replaced. So I think, all these factors are giving us certain optimism that after the digestion of the channel inventory, which, as Yuanqing mentioned, will be completed in the coming months. The second half of this calendar year will start to resume growth.
And additionally, looking at the activation, you should know that our activation share -- market share is at record levels in the last 6, 8 months. So we are gaining share as a sign of the appreciation of the customer for our products and our innovation. So even, let's say, weaker market, we want to perform better than the market. We will continue to perform better than the market.",196

Yes. So over the past -- so actually, over the past 3 years, our activation numbers increase, have always been higher than the market but our shipment number actually are more conservative than the market. So that means we actually have generated less inventory than our competition. And probably we are leading to digest the inventory as well. So that's why we are pretty confident for Lenovo's future in the PC area.
And also, I want to echo Luca. So actually -- COVID actually has changed the PC landscape. So from 1 PC per household to 1 PC per person, and also because people spend more time on the PC, probably double the time so that will drive the faster replacement cycle. So that's our view on the PC demand. Regarding of the -- Kirk, so probably maybe you answer the cash conversion cycle.",146

Clearly, this is sustainable. I think rather than core sustainable, I actually would say that there are further room for improvement. I think clearly, when the economy getting, I would say, a more normal logistics and everything getting better. I think the inventory level will continue to come down. We definitely see that there are room for improvement.
As you may see, I think the industry average, I mean, obviously, different companies will have different business model is about 20 -- negative 20 days, so I definitely think that we will -- I think the negative 6 days is sustainable or more than sustainable that we will see through our operational efficiency. We're going to see further improvement, I think, is the negative cash conversion cycle. Thank you.",141

So look, in general, we are -- I will not talk for the market, but I'll talk for Lenovo. I think we are not declining our ASP in that shape. I would say that our ASP has declined slightly in the sequentially quarter-on-quarter. But year-over-year, continue to record growth of our ASP for the last 8 quarters. And probably, you can only say that the last 1 or 2 quarters, it has increased less than the previous quarters, but we are not modeling for 2023 a significant decline year-over-year of the ASP.
Now you can think in this way, from -- how the ASP is built from the commodity perspective, there is probably a little bit of downward pressure because obviously, the demand is not so great. So the commodity costs are going a little bit down, but that does not necessarily reflect on the ASP. And we are working hard to increase our premium mix so that we will control and hopefully improve the ASP.
And the other, obviously, the other element will be the exchange rate, which, obviously, is volatile, and that will maybe determine certain up or down of the ASP.
So I would not anticipate a significant decline of the ASP in the -- at least we are not modeling it for 2023. Thank you.",220

Thanks, Howard. This is Kirk. Well, I would say we are seeing record high fresh order load, so our success was not driven by backlog reduction. We've already largely passed that. So we are seeing strong fresh load. I think we are one of the few companies in the market that's very balanced between the cloud and ESMB. And I can say we had records in the cloud and records in ESMB. We had records in server and in Storage. And then even within Storage, we had records for hyper-converged traditional entry and midrange and cloud storage. So it was very broad-based.
In addition, as you know, we created a new division back in April around ThinkEdge and we grew that edge and the artificial intelligence associated with the edge with many, many end-user retail wins and through that business triple digits. So definitely, edge and the AI at the edge is a strong growth factor for us.
Outside of China, we had a record, and North America and Europe were particularly strong within that. But -- so I would just say it's broad based as the board where we saw the new fresh load, and we see that continuing again in the quarter we're in right now.
Relative to the operating margin target, I think we want to continue to drive hyper growth, so hopefully, with almost 50% growth quarter-on -- year-on-year, rather, our goal is to drive hyper growth, continue to grow share while continuing to improve operating profit. So I think we're on our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year operating profit improvement now.
So relative to at least the 2 largest competitors we have in the market, we still have a ways to go, but hopefully, we're showing a continuous momentum there while continuing to have hyper growth. Thank you.",304

And the next question is coming from Jerry Su -- Mr. Jerry Su at Credit Suisse. And it's also on ISG. Given the slower IT spending and consent on software cloud server demand, are you seeing any order adjustment or it's more on component inventory management?",49
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748088.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,24,"Well, again, I would say the NextWave business, we track over 500 NextWave Cloud accounts, and that is largely a new business for us, and that's all brand-new share gains for us. So independent of any order adjustment at the macro level, we're gaining share in there. 
With the largest 17-or-so cloud providers in the world, each is in its own unique situation. But I would say that the new processors from Intel, from AMD and from Ampere have compelling value proposition, and we have design wins different across each customer, but the number of design wins that we have is growing. So again, we're probably the beneficiary of market segment share even in a maybe a softer market that has been well documented in the press.
Relative to component inventory management. I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but I would just say for us, we're largely back to normal channel inventory levels, and we're nearly all the way through any kind of supply challenge from a data center perspective. So we're back to normal lead times for the vast majority of our projects -- products. Thank you.",190

The question is, do you supply servers for AI computing including AI graphic cards assembly? Do you anticipate AI servers will contribute to a lot to ISG segment in coming years?",52
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748090.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,26,"Yes. So again, this is Kirk. So I would say, obviously, we support a lot of different segments. It's the world's largest contributor to the top 500 supercomputers. All of those have more and more of an AI element to them. And we're confident we're going to stay #1 in the top 500, and those workloads will continue to drive more to AI. In the edge space with our ThinkEdge, we have the most dense AI edge server in the world with 4 GPUs per edge server. And again, that's driving triple digits for us. We recently announced something called AI Innovators Program. We have now over 40 partners that have certified their software on top of our edge systems. We were public a few months ago. For example, we won the largest grocery chain in the United States, Kroger where we're doing their self-checkouts to help facilitate making sure all the scanning and things like that are done through one of our AI Innovator Program ISV partners ever seen, but we're doing things like key management, drive-through management, Smart City, smart retail, smart manufacturing all on AI.
And then, of course, in the cloud, with Omniverse and Metaverse, we just won one of the largest cloud wins on digital twins as the cloud vendors start building out this capability as well. So I would say it's in supercomputing, it's an edge and it's in the public cloud as well. Thank you.",242

And we have next question coming from Mr. Albert Hung at JPMorgan. What's the channel PC inventory level compared to the normal times? Should we expect pricing enrollment to remain tough due to any demand weakness? And when could we see the benefits of decline component costs?",50
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2023",2023-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3510.0,2740907.0,102748092.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,28,"Yes. Jenny, I'll take the question. Actually, these are 3 questions in one. So let me start one by one. So first, about channel inventory. So to start with, I want to remind all of you that our business is very diversified. So we have a lot of this business that is designed to be without channel inventory. So that includes our relationship business, our public sector business and our global account business.
So with these 3 business model or for a large part of these 3 business model, there is simply no channel inventory at all. Then you have the transactional models with consumer and SMB, where the channel inventory is still above the pre-COVID levels in some regions, with the transit inventory that is also slightly higher than pre-COVID, as you probably know, the transit time has increased and now it's getting normalized. So this part is getting better. So generally speaking, we feel comfortable with our inventory position across all channels and geographies.
We are -- as I said before, we are increasing our sellout share as the demand for our products is that record high levels. And we have a plan. I think we have a detailed sellout plan, and we forecast to return at or below pre-COVID inventory levels in the coming few months. So I think we are generally comfortable about that.
The second question is, shall we expect pricing and environment to remain tough. I think the answer is yes. I think until there will be some relatively weak demand and weak micro-environment, I think we expect the pricing environment, and the competition will be intensified.
And that brings me to the last question, when are we seeing the benefit of the commodity costs going down? I think you are already seeing that in our ability to maintain a good level of GP in the last quarter, as we have just demonstrated by being able to capture the commodity cost decline and not price it at the end to sustain our GP margin. Thank you.",342

And the next question is coming from Grace Chen at UBS. Could you help us understand how Lenovo Group maintain margin for PC business, given the substantial sales decline with a smaller scale? What's your view for PC margin trend in 2023 calendar year? Thank you.",49

So I think I partially responded to this one with the last one, meaning we are obviously seeing favorable commodity trend from -- for several commodities, and we are leveraging that to sustain our GP and not pricing this advantage away on the one hand. On the other hand, we have been very disciplined in Q3, and definitely, we will continue the future to manage our expense from every angle so that we mitigate the impact of the smaller scale and eventually the risk of slightly or lower GP margin.
And regarding the GP margin, the question was whether -- what is our book for the margin trend in 2023? I would say if the competition continues to intensify, there is objectively a risk of a slightly declining GP margin, we will do all possible efforts to cope with it, leveraging the commodity decline and obviously managing in a very disciplined way expenses so that we mitigate any possible impact to the bottom line. I would say that. Thank you.",174

If I may add, I think our service-led transformation strategy, I think also provide significant help to maintain our PC margin rate. If you look at the SSG services portfolio today, I think we have a comprehensive catalog from around the box. For example, Premier Support Services to be on the box where we have a whole suite of professional and managed services via our TruScale device service, right?
And because we are adding value from a hardware, software and services perspective, so we're becoming more sticky, and that will help us to maintain our relationship with our customer and also maintain our margin. So I want to add that, Luca.",115

So what I can say is within the last 4 quarters, we have consumed a very significant portion of the inventory. And as I said before, in the coming months, we feel we will -- we know we will be back at pre-COVID of the inventory.
As for the phone, I don't know whether Sergio wants to add a comment on the inventory. Thank you, Sergio.",99

Last quarter, our activations were 20% higher than our sell-in, what leads to a 15% decline in inventory. This has been happening in the last 6 to 9 months. And I expect to -- expect that between now and the end of June, the inventory will be to a very healthy level, even lower than pre-COVID just because the channel given the interest rates are taken as inventory. So it was a very healthy quarter and expect that cycle to complete around the May time frame.
With now the opposite happening as the second half, we expect to rebound in the market to -- but the progress of inventory has been very healthy, especially in the last 6 to 9 months, including last quarter.",129

So this is Kirk. I think, again, when you say how big are the servers, I think you have to look at -- our vision is that AI will be an essential element in everything we do. So the way to think about the TAM over time is I think AI will become a fundamental element of almost every server machine out there. And you're right, the average selling prices, given the number of GPUs or accelerators is growing significantly. So relative to the margin, I think it will improve the margin. And also, because we're building strong relationships on the software side as well, we will be increasing our margin as we sell more AI servers. Thank you.",120

Can you hear me? So for quite a while, we haven't met our friends here in person. So hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Among all the uncertainties over the past year, the market conditions have evolved relatively in line with our expectations. Despite the challenging economy and softer device market demand, we continued to make steady progress in our service-led transformation and technology-driven innovation. For the full fiscal year, we maintained a stable profitability, thanks to our diversified growth engines and operational resilience. We believe that the overall PC market channel inventory digestion will come to an end. And the trends of shipment and activation will become more consistent. The entire smart device market is expected to resume growth in the second half of this year and the IT service market will resume relatively high growth, driving the total IT market in 2023 full year are back to moderate growth.
In the mid- to long-term, digital and intelligent transformation will continue to accelerate, leading to bigger growth potential for cloud and the entire computing infrastructure. Last year, we overcome tremendous challenges and achieved a stable profitability. From a full year point of view, our revenue was impacted due to device market softness, but thanks to our strong growth of solutions, services and the infrastructure businesses. Our net margin was keeping flat year-on-year non-Hong Kong FRS basis. Non-PC revenue mix increased to nearly 40%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in building the diversified growth engines. 
At the same time, our cash position remains strong, and we significantly improved our cash conversion cycle. With a healthy liquidity, we have been able to remain committed to our investment in R&D around new IT to build our future core competencies. And we continued to deepen our commitment to ESG. In fact, anticipating the decline in PC and smartphone demand over the past few quarters, we proactively took actions to mitigate the risks. With our solid profitability, strong market position, resilient operations and more importantly, reaching new milestones in our transformation from a device hardware company to our solution and services company, we are well prepared to achieve sustainable growth in the future.
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Solutions and Services Group. The new IT services segment within the $1 trillion IT services market continue to expand. By 2025 Device-as-a-Service market and cloud solution market are both expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR. Vertical solutions and services spending will also keep a strong growth.
Last year, our SSG delivered a strong revenue growth and higher profitability to become both our growth engine and important profit contributor. Its revenue broke a record to reach $6.7 billion with operating margin standing higher at 21%. Revenue mix of nonhardware-driven Solution and Services has increased that to more than half of our SSG business. Meanwhile, SSG has consistently invested in building scalable and repeatable horizontal solutions or building blocks that can be deployed in vertical solutions or industries, leveraging -- definitely leveraging our own IP. In addition, we have been continuously enhancing our digital workplace solutions and developing TruScale hybrid cloud solutions portfolio.
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG, continues to benefit from the ongoing ICT infrastructure upgrade. By 2025, the server market will surpass USD 132 billion, storage $36 billion and edge infrastructure $37 billion. Last year, our ISG delivered historical full year performance and became a profitable, high-growth engine. Its total revenue grew 37% year-on-year to almost USD 10 billion and achieved an all-time high. We also achieved record high revenue in server, storage and software, respectively. We have moved up from the fourth to be the third largest server provider in the world and have jumped from #8 to #5 in global storage market. Meanwhile, we have been consistently improving our in-house manufacturing capabilities, cost competitiveness as well as the full stack product capabilities that cover both cloud service provider and the Enterprise and SMB segments. We have also made significant investment in infrastructure innovations empowered by artificial intelligence, such as AI-powered edge computing, hybrid cloud and intelligent operations.
For our Intelligent Device Group, or IDG, its business performance was impacted by continued device market softness and channel inventory digestion in the first half of 2023. But given PCs are still the essential productivity tool in this digital era, so we anticipate the PC market will return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2023 with accelerated growth in 2024. 
Meanwhile, driven by digitalization trend and hybrid work model smart space solutions continue to see steady growth. First with severe market headwinds, IDG revenue declined year-on-year but successfully maintained our PC market leadership and industry-leading profitability. We increased the revenue mix of premier products to 30%. 
Our mobile business continues to be profitable for 3 consecutive years and achieved a premium-to-market revenue growth in most of the markets. And our smart space solutions continued to demonstrate great growth potential. We will continue to take actions to manage expense and further sharpen our operational excellence in IDG and we will keep investing in innovations, focusing on premier offerings and adjacent areas, while enhancing smart space solutions for hybrid work model.
Let me also briefly cover our fourth quarter performance. It was the most challenging quarter of the year facing pressures from both device market and the global economy. Our IDG revenue declined due to severe downturn in both PC and smartphone markets. But both SSG and ISG maintained a high double-digit year-on-year growth momentum, which helped to offset the device market softness. Last quarter, our non-PC revenue mix reached a historic high of 43%.
Furthermore, we have recognized our onetime restructuring and other charges along with various other actions to deliver about $850 million annual run rate total expense savings onwards, helping to establish a solid foundation for our operations in a challenging market and position ourselves for future growth.
Finally, I'd like to highlight Lenovo's solid performance in the face of industry downturn over the past year. We are already seeing positive signs of market stabilization. Our strategy has been proven to be working, and our operations continue to demonstrate the resilience and most importantly, even in a challenging market, we have increased rather than decreased our commitment to innovation solutions and services. Lenovo is now fully prepared in a strong position than ever before to capture the next wave of growth opportunity. Thank you. 
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1094

Good afternoon, everybody. I will now take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance for the fiscal year 2023 and its fourth quarter. Next slide, please. 
For the fiscal year 2023, the group diversified growth engines set multiple performance records. The non-PC business made up nearly 40% of the combined revenue of the 3 business groups, signaling a quick shift in our exposure towards the growth areas. ISG and SSG spearheaded our group transformation. Their combined revenue and operating profit increased by 31% and 24%, respectively. IDG remained a strong sector leader in both market share and profitability. Notwithstanding sector-wide challenges ranging from channel inventory digestion, the system macro headwinds to extreme exchange rate fluctuations during the year, IDG revenue declined 21% year-by-year -- year-on-year. Thanks to its operational excellence and its premium mix, IDG maintained a robust operating margin of 7.3%, down just mere 30 basis points year-on-year. 
Group revenue declined by 14% to $61.9 billion or down 9% on constant currency. Gross margin and operating margin delivered 18-year high, thanks to the non-PC strength helping transcend the cycle. We recognized the onetime restructuring and other charges of $249 million among various other actions to deliver an annual run rate group expense saving of about $850 million. We aim to establish a solid foundation to operate in a challenging market and position ourselves for future growth. 
Excluding the nonrecurring charges, our non-GAAP net profit margin remained stable at 3%, flat year-to-year. We remain committed to achieving our target of doubling net margin in the medium term. Profit attributable to equity holders was $1.6 billion, down 21% year-on-year. 
Today, the Board declared a final dividend of HKD 0.30 per share. Taking into consideration of the interim dividend of HKD 0.08 per share, total dividend for fiscal year '23 would be HKD 0.38 per share. 
Next slide please. In Q4, notwithstanding the market challenges, the non-PC business continued to grow 12% year-on-year, and its revenue contribution rose to 43% of the combined revenue of the 3 business groups, thanks to a resilient and well-executed transformation strategy. ISG and SSG combined revenue grew by 37% year-on-year, setting a new milestone. The strength of non-PC revenue reflected our market advantages in capturing digital and intelligent transformation opportunities and help mitigate IDG's revenue decline of 33%. Nonrecurring, restructuring and other charges of $249 million and impacted our Q4 performance. Non-GAAP net profit was $284 million, down 44% year-on-year, and the group profit attributable to equity holders was $114 million. 
Next slide, please. We continue to optimize group operations for greater business agility and long-term growth. Our cash and cash equivalent balance reached $4.3 billion in March, up 8% year-on-year. We also finished the year with a net cash position for the eighth consecutive quarter with a balance of $366 million. The group improved its cash conversion cycle by 12 days on a year-on-year basis to negative 2 days, returning to the pre-COVID period where such figures was negative.
Since Q1, we have seen continuous improvement in cash conversion cycle, a testament to our prudent working capital management. At the same time, we also put in significant effort to decrease our inventory level by over $1.9 billion on an annual basis. 
Next slide, please. Thanks to the increasing demand for the end-to-end solutions across hardware, software and services as well as subscription-based model, SSG performance continued its upward trend since the business group inauguration in April 2021. Its full year revenue and operating profit grew 22% and 16% year-on-year to $6.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Its full year operating margin of 21% top all business groups. In the fourth quarter, revenue was up 18% year-on-year, while operating margin was 20%, down around 2 percentage point year-on-year off a very high base. 
The solid performance was underlined by double-digit growth across all 3 business segments, led by management service. We reported year-on-year revenue growth of 67%, thanks to the strong as-a-service adoption. Our project and Solution and Services segment with a broad base of solutions leveraging Lenovo IP reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Attach and supported services revenue also increased 14% year-on-year with a record PC service penetration rate.
Full year deferred revenue reached $3 billion echoing the group's focus on enlarging and sustaining its recurring revenue base. 
Next slide, please. ISG delivered exceptional revenue and profit growth, with revenue growing 37% and operating profit surging to a new high of $98 million. Fiscal year '23 marked the third consecutive record setting year. ISG was 1 of the world's fastest-growing infrastructure solution providers and achieve premium-to-market growth across several product lines. Such achievement was built on years of investment in creating a full stack portfolio. This product strategy, together with a broad customer coverage and a unique, fully integrated ODM+ business model, were effective in driving revenues of server, storage, software and AI edge to an all-time high. Later third-party statistics affirm ISG's strong market positions. It started off the fiscal year with its market share by revenue in worldwide server at #4 position. It finished the year at #3 position. At the same time, it ended the year with its global share in storage at #8 and exited at #5. ISG is also capturing emerging opportunities in AI and building the most diverse AI portfolio in infrastructure. 70% of new ISG products from patch to core data center products. In the fiscal year 2024, we'll be AI ready. This includes its popular liquid cooling Neptune technology for a high GPU loading AI server training.
By customer segment, ISG exposure to CSP and E/SMB segments gave the group a unique advantage in balancing scale and profit. Both segments saw double-digit revenue growth to record levels. In Q4, ISG yet again set another revenue record with a growth of 56%, thanks to its comprehensive product portfolio, an important catalyst for significant premium to market growth. Next slide, please. 
IDG was impacted by the sector-wide headwinds, including lower demand and excessive inventory. Full year revenue declined 21% year-on-year but remained markedly higher than fiscal [ 2000 ] pre-COVID levels. Operating profit for the fiscal year dropped by 24% with operating margin down 30 basis points year-on-year, reaching 7.3%. This was significantly above the pre-COVID level, thanks to our operational excellence and a favorable mix shifting, enabling higher margin sales.
In the fourth quarter, revenue declined 33%, while the business made significant progress in cleaning channel inventory. This inevitably has a negative impact on our operating margin, which was down 90 basis points year-on-year to 6.7%. 
IDG made great progress in seizing growth opportunities beyond PC products. Non-PC sales made up 19% of IDG's revenue, up 0.4 percentage point year-on-year. Our smartphone revenue declined from overall market demand weakness. Nevertheless, is outperformed in multiple markets such as EMEA and AP by notable margin. Smartphone business also maintained profitable for 3 consecutive years with a growing 5G mix. Within non-PC business, smart collaboration solutions also delivered double-digit growth year-on-year with key wins across regions and global accounts. 
Next, slide please. Now let me shift gears and talk about our R&D investments. As we continue to invest in innovation, R&D spending as a percentage of revenue rose to 3.5% from 2.9% last year. Digital transformation has never been more important to our growth as we invest in new IT infrastructure spanning across client, edge, cloud network, intelligence. Our investment will accelerate the development of the high value-added products and key components, including edge, storage and cloud in responding to significant growth in the data creation and data consumption. We will also drive innovation to propel our AI smartphone portfolio, scenario-based solution and ESG initiatives as well as expand our services book. Every aspect of our R&D investment has contributed to our record operating margin and long-term competitiveness.

So I have several questions. First one is how is our view in the global PC market in terms of inventory cycle? How is our plan to issue the new product model in this year?,41
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028889.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,5,"Luca, please.",2
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028890.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,6,"So thanks for the question. So I think your question is, one, on the how is the market, how is the inventory and then what is the product development or innovation. So regarding the market, obviously, we have seen -- witnessed softness in the demand -- the end demand, but there is, I think, an important deep dive to do. So that is the difference between the weakness in shipments and the weakness in activation, which is the Windows-activated devices every day. We do the -- we check every day. And you can see a difference of -- a significant difference. The shipments are declining more than 20%, but the real end user demand is declining much less. So this is clearly a sign of a much healthier end user demand than demonstrated by the shipment. 
And that is the correction of the inventory that has been generated by the overshipments during the COVID period when the shipments were superior to the end demand. Now the inventory is gradually being digested in the channel. And when it comes to our inventory, we think this quarter, this is basically the last quarter with this adjustment and our global channel inventory is basically back to the pre-COVID inventory levels by the end of the current quarter. So we think our level of inventory is now normalized. We'll -- that is why we are confident that we resume in the second half a moderate growth, and that growth should accelerate in 2024. And obviously, innovation is part of the reason why we are confident there will be new devices, new form factors, AI-enabled PCs. So a lot of new things that will accelerate and attract demand.
Additionally, we are confident of the end demand because of the Windows 11 transition cycle in the end of '23 and particularly in 2024 should accelerate. And there also should be the replacement cycle of the devices that have been accelerated shipments in 2021, that will arrive to the third or fourth year of life. So the total market, we believe, is increased. Now to be more specific, when we look at the end demand measured by the Windows activation, we believe that the end state will be bigger than the pre-COVID end demand approximately by high 1 digit. Thank you.",384
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028891.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,7,"Yes. So this cycle has been very clear. So COVID triggered the booming of the PC demand than probably 2021. We faced supply shortage. So in that period, activation is much higher than the shipment. Then it triggered the channel to accumulate the inventory. So 2021 to first half of 2022. So that period, shipment is higher than the activation since the second half of last year. So shipments declined significantly by 20%, 30%. But the activation didn't decline that much. So that means the activation has been much higher than the shipment. So we forecasted by the end of this quarter, so the shipment and activation will be more consistent over time. But definitely as Luca introduced so we have a good chance to keep at a higher than pre-COVID level.",132

Within this activation scenario, it's important to highlight that Lenovo activation share is gaining market share significantly at the high 1-digit premium-to-market compared to pre-COVID, meaning we are at the record level of worldwide device activation with Lenovo brand in the world.

So I have 2 questions for the server section -- for the server segment. Number one is that can you share with us what is your revenue distribution from key markets in server? And number two is that in terms of AI server, what is the proportion of your service sales in AI? And what kind of trend are you seeing in 2023 of the AI servers contribution?",73
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028895.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,11,"So we'll ask our ISG President, Kirk Skaugen to answer the question. Kirk, please.",15
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028896.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,12,"Yes. So I think the growth of our business is very widespread. And in fact, in the previous quarter, we had over 60 different records, so it's impossible to talk about this. But the key message is it's not just 1 part of the business. We have records in server and storage and software and edge and as-a-service, et cetera. Our strongest geography right now is actually North America, which is also the largest total available market for the infrastructure business. And our weakest market has been China for obviously some of the macro issues that we've seen. But our exposure to China is the lowest it's been in 5 years. So hopefully, that answers your first question. 
As you can see, we grew 37% year-on-year. If you look at it in the fourth quarter, we grew 56% year-on-year. So we're talking about high double-digit premium-to-market. If you look at the distribution of our business, about 29% growth in server, over 200% growth in storage and that's widespread across midrange storage, all-flash arrays, entry storage where we became #1 in the world and in cloud-based storage. And then software is growing 25% year-on-year. So really broad-based business. 
From an AI perspective, definitely one of our strong growth areas. About a year ago, we consolidated about 5 different divisions into our edge division, which I really say is Edge AI. I think what we're seeing is that the amount of data in the world is exploding. Most of the statistics say that amount of data in the world will double over the next 3 years, and we're only computing 2% of that data. So this quarter, we grew over 170% in our edge growth -- actually for the whole fiscal year. And a lot of that is AI-driven workloads, things like fleet safety and fast retail, optimizing drive-throughs, line queues in major stadiums, making manufacturing more effective, et cetera. So I would say the first thing on AI is Edge is exploding.
Number two, supercomputing or international supercomputing this week in Hamburg, larger and larger portion of supercomputing is AI-driven to solve some of the biggest challenges of the world like cancer research things like that. I'm proud to report this week, we extended our #1 position as the world leader in the top 500. And also, we're #1 in -- the #1 position of the most sustainable supercomputer in the world, meaning we have the greenest supercomputer in the world at the Flatiron Institute of New York. 
Third, if you just think about Omniverse, Metaverse, digital twins, as [indiscernible] stated, we're in collaboration with Microsoft and NVIDIA and we are currently installing and building the world's largest Omniverse instance in the cloud. And I think we're very excited about that. We're working with some of the largest automotive companies in the world as they build new factories for their electric vehicles, new digital twins for the factories, planning next-generation smart cities, planning next-generation 5G networks. So Metaverse, Omniverse is a critical part of our AI story. And of course, Lenovo is unique because we can do edge to cloud and talk with the cloud. So we have the AR/VR devices. We have the workstations, we have servers and we have the storage, which means we're simplifying that for our end users.
And then lastly, obviously, generative AI, ChatGPT, we're seeing more than a 30% compound annual growth rate on that. The huge amount of server and storage infrastructure being created. We have about 60 AI-enabled products now in the market and 70% of our new products that we're announcing are AI-ready. So this is going to be a huge growth area for us in the future, and I think we're well positioned. Thank you.",624

My question is how about the current bond structure, especially with the decline of some semiconductor IC and also the memory price. What is the impact to our current outlook for our margin?",40
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028899.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,15,"Yes, I think -- Okay. And my answer will be for PC. Maybe Kirk will have a -- so definitely, there is some deflationary trend for certain of the components. Well, that's -- potentially, that's a good news. It will depend on the market competition how much it will be able to help. But obviously, we believe is positive for our GP going forward. Together, I think, with other elements, which make us confident on the sustainability of our GP, definitely our designing capabilities, so our ability to build kind of more effective cost structure in the PC segment mix sustaining the GP and also premium mix. So -- but your answer is -- your question is about the commodities. There is a moderate deflationary trend, which we believe will not continue for long because as soon as the demand will rebound, which we said we believe it will gradually happen from the second and second half that is probably coming to an end. Yes. Thank you.",167

Now let us move our questions and let us take some questions from the webcast online. First question is from JPMorgan, Albert Hung. The question is like, why ISG operating profit margin dropped in Q4 FY '23, while revenue remained strong? What is the demand outlook amid weakened IT budget? Shall we expect a slowdown in software revenue near term? What's the implication for profitability? And also the second question is, could we have more color on the restructuring, please? Shall we expect more restructuring costs in the coming quarters? What could we see the cost benefit from this restructuring?",102

So I think let me expand it because I think it also relates to the question on memory earlier. I think certainly, we still see actually growing demand in E/SMB as people build private clouds and hybrid clouds. So I think our view is that there's stronger demand in the enterprise/SMB market and in the public cloud market right now. Having said that, we've also told you that we have growing design wins as we move to the next [Technical Difficulty]",82

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3507.0,2819944.0,105028904.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,20,"In the gross profit going forward is that our E/SMB market will be stronger in the future. Relative to each quarter, I think we're proud that we've had 6 consecutive quarters of positive operating profit, but now 8 consecutive quarters of year-on-year profit improvement. So I'll say when I say every quarter, our goal is to drive hyper growth and improve operating profit year-on-year each and every quarter, but we're investing in things like TruScale-as-a-service, Edge AI, hybrid cloud infrastructure and AI. So as a result, we're seeing tremendous kind of growth in the market. 
If you look at 37% growth right now for IDC, that's a 25-point premium-to-market. And with our storage growth in Q4, we grew 432% and 208% for the year in a market that's low single digit. So I mean we're not talking about small premium-to-market. So we're aggressively investing for hyper growth and that's why part of the GP issue is -- or the profit issue is there. Memory, I would say 1-pager announcement that we made that I think everybody followed is we did launch a new brand called Wentian. So in China, for China. And while we're using Intel CPUs in that, we will use local memory, local drives to be even more competitive in the China market, and we committed to be #1 server vendor in China a bit in 5 years. So that's also a very aggressive growth at a significant premium-to-market.
Last thing is just profit. Why do we have confidence, again, that we're expanding server and storage. Remember in the [indiscernible] products for both the Intel and AMD CPUs, all of that development was done in-house. So we're being paid through our ODM+ model for the board design, board manufacturing, for the system integration as well as for the rack-level integration. And so across the board for both our E/SMB products and our cloud products as we move to in-house design and manufacturing, that will drive more profitability. And of course, we talked about software growing at 25% as well. So the market engines are continuing to grow at a premium for us. But the answer to your question is we're investing for the future in hyper growth, but our commitment is year-on-year profit improvement, which we did again this quarter for 8 quarters.",386

We are now -- last quarter, we grew 7 points premium-to-market. We came from #9 in the beginning of the year to #5 in IDC sales outside China. Now we are seeing significant growth in Asia and Europe, more than 20, 25 points premium-to-market in average every quarter. Latin America last quarter, we were 17 point premium-to-market, holding 21% market share. And the only negative premium-to-market was in North America. But the new reason as [indiscernible], we saw a decline in issuance, but our activations year-over-year were significantly better and drive the growth in most of the quarters. We expect North America to come back to premium-to-market in the second quarter of this fiscal year, [ Q3. ] We expect overall the business next year to be double-digit premium-to-market. We are now growing in new segments. Besides we are growing in Asia and Europe faster than Latin American, North America for obvious reasons from a smaller base and we see a lot of demand for the new devices, especially the premium with the edge where we have a very important launch next week with foldable. We expect this third generation to sell at least 3x more than the 2 previous generations combined. More to see next week. And we are also growing segments that in many instances [indiscernible] profitability. One of them is B2B, where we are leveraging the Lenovo channel infrastructure with a set of devices [indiscernible] that we consider the best [indiscernible] ThinkPad. If we just think about the days of ThinkPads, if we can attach 10% of that, we can almost double our premium sales. It's still in United States, but with very good feedback from the channels, some major wins.
And last but not least, we started a very strong work now in what we call Internet of services monetization. We still see a lot of potential. So in the same way we developed the B2B infrastructure to product into Lenovo, hopefully, to the next year [indiscernible] you will see major improvements in our Internet of services numbers and then also leverage the footprint on SSG and merging that business. So Asia and Europe hyper growth, protect Latin America and North America, B2B premium with a special focus on foldable, especially in North America, we see a big opportunity, but not the highest range we have in many years, probably a range in a market we decide to range the product and also our edge sales that were 3% of our business 2 years ago, it's already 15%. We expect that also to double in the next 3 years as a percentage of the business. I long answer, sorry, but the open question.",480

Thank you, Sergio. The next question is about ISG and SSG. This is from Jerry Su from Credit Suisse. For ISG, what's your expectations on the E/SMB versus CSP growth for the coming years with enterprise and CSP controlling their CapEx. With the increasing mix of AI server with higher pass-through costs, what will this impact your margin? The second question says, for the 22% year-on-year sales growth for SSG, what is the organic growth, excluding the Lenovo PCCW Solutions acquisition. How should we think about the growth outlook for SSG in the financial year 2023-'24?",98

Thank you, Jerry. So I just want to recap. So overall, I think we are encouraged to see the SSG performance as YY shared. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-to-year growth and also with record-high revenue and also profitability. The second thing is when we look at the market, I think there are at least 2 opportunities that we see even in a challenging situation. One is opportunity around how can we provide services for our hardware so that we can continue to enhance the experience, right? This is starting from support services all the way to enhanced services. One of the examples is a month ago, we just announced what we call a Premier Support Plus services. This is for our hardware devices. And it's an AI-powered predictive support services package, right, which we have seen a lot of positive feedback and also financial growth for our business, right? 
So this is one growth that we continue to see in the market, even with the overall dynamic situation. The other part is as-a-service, right? We just did a global CIO research, which we surveyed more than 700 CIO on a global basis. 79% of them, number one, they will continue to invest in IT services and IT technology, even with a challenging situation. Second is that they continue to see the benefit and hence the demand on overall as-a-service, right, from devices and also infrastructure. So that also reflected in our strong growth, if you look at our Managed Services, which is primarily driven by the as-a-service demand. 
We do not disclose our PCCW Solutions performances, but there are some color I can share. The venture started from August last year. And there's a clear complementary competence from both businesses. One, from Lenovo, I think we have a very strong pocket-to-cloud hardware and software, where in this part of the world, PCCW Solutions have a very strong IT services capability, right? So we have already seen pipeline building up and also some win cases, which is combining the best of both, right? For example, we just signed a contract with one of the leading transportation customers in Asia Pacific, which is to provide a cloud solution for that customer by combining the cloud hardware and software of Lenovo and also the capability of PCCW in building a cloud infrastructure for that customer. So we continue to see that synergy to contribute to our growth, and we are positive about the demand in the market.",420

So I'll answer the question on the data center side. So I think the question is really about E/SMB versus cloud and where we see the demand. So on E/SMB, I think we do agree with IDC that the market is in a bit of contraction. But for Lenovo, we're launching over 50 new products around our V3 platforms ThinkSystem, ThinkAgile, ThinkEdge. So we think we'll be at a significant premium-to-market as we look into next year, even though the market is certainly contracting a bit due to the macroeconomic situation. In cloud, I think we've seen softness in general compute, but we're very diversified across server and storage. We know we have new design wins, and storage and AI, as I mentioned earlier, are very robust, while general compute, I think people are optimizing the inventory that they have.
On storage, again, we're seeing tremendous growth. We achieved the #1 position in the world in price bands 1 through 4, which makes up more than 60% of all the units sold in the world in storage. We crossed over from #8 to #5, as Wai Ming said. I think we'll be the #4 here soon. So that will be a strong growth area within that, not just as a server company, but as one of the fastest-growing storage companies in the world. 
And then edge, again, for smart retail, smart manufacturing, smart city, we're seeing -- this is our third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth in Edge, and I think that will be a market that's growing to $37 billion by 2025, really larger than the entire storage market. And I think we're positioned as the industry leader there.",281

We will begin with earnings presentations. And shortly after that, we will open the call for questions.
Now let me turn it over to Yang Yuanqing, please.",107
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2023",2023-08-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3664.0,2887556.0,106969321.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, we achieved USD 12.9 billion in global revenue with net income of $191 million on our non-Hong Kong FRS basis. Despite a challenging market with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, our service-led business achieved strong growth and sustained profitability. With the non-PC revenue mix further increasing by 4 points to 41% now continuously demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in building diversified growth engines. 
As we predicted with the PC channel inventory digestion coming to an end, the trend of shipments and activations have become more consistent. Actually, the year-on-year decline of shipment was lower than PC activations for the first time in 6 quarters. But the AUR or average unit revenue of PC was under pressure due to declining component price and intensified competition and impacted our revenue. 
The entire devices market is facing the similar challenge, including smartphone tablet businesses. Meanwhile, in the short term, the infrastructure market is challenged on multiple fronts, and that had downward pressure on our top line and bottom line as well. 
In the next 2 to 3 quarters, we remain cautiously optimistic about the business recovery, and the economy stabilizes and improves and the component price bottoms out. The client device market is expected to recover and resume growth in the second half of the year. With USD 850 million cost savings that excluded more than committed, we will take more actions to keep our E/R ratio more resilient, and we are still committed to continuously improving our profitability. 
Meanwhile, the booming of the intelligent technologies such as AI-generated content is propelling the wider adoption for AI accelerating digital and intelligent transformation across industries. For many years, Lenovo has been driving our transformation to become a full step intelligent solution provider, and we are well positioned to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead and strengthen the cycle. 
Also unchanged is our commitment to doubling our investment in innovation in medium term. Over the next 3 years, we will invest an additional $1 billion to accelerate AI deployment for businesses around the world, focusing on AI devices, AI infrastructure and AI solutions. We will continue to empower our customers and the consumers in all works of life to grasp for the opportunities in the era of intelligent transformation.
Now I will talk more about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Solutions and Services Group. Last quarter, SSG, again delivered a strong growth and higher profitability. While we protected the support services business as our core profit engine, we made significant progress in expanding our managed services and the project and solution services. The revenue of which has now grown to account for more than half of the SSG business, 4 points higher year-on-year. 
Over the next 3 years, the trend of digital and intelligent transformation will continue to drive strong growth of global IT spending, especially in IT services. At the same time, overall demand for vertical solutions, including smart city, smart manufacturing, smart education and smart retail, is expected to see strong growth through 2026 as well. SSG also continued to scale with our hero offerings such as digital workplace solution, hybrid cloud and sustainability, and incubate these horizontal building blocks into vertical solutions to help our customers improve employee experience and productivity.
Next our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG. Last quarter, its overall revenue declined year-on-year for the first half in many quarters due to overall cloud service provider, computer server demand softness. GPU constraint impacting full AI adoption and the industry is a slower-than-expected transition to the next-generation platform. But we achieved the hyper growth in storage, software, services and high-performance computing. In particular, storage achieved a triple-digit year-on-year growth and matters the fourth largest storage provider in the world.
In AI hardware infrastructure business based on the latest IDC definition, we grew by triple digits and is the #3 in the world. Driven by AI-generated content breakthrough, the ICT infrastructure upgrade is accelerating even further. We will continue to invest in developing AI-ready and AI-optimized infrastructure, such as AI Edge, AI Hybrid Cloud as well as server and storage that support AI-centric workloads. We will persist in differentiated competition, aiming to resume premium-to-market growth and sustainable profitability as soon as possible. And we remain focused on becoming the most trusted infrastructure partner for our customers in their digital and intelligent transformation.
Our Intelligent Device Group, or IDG, is still under a lot of pressure last quarter. Despite all these challenges, we maintained our global #1 market share in PCs with inventory normalized to a healthy level. Our smartphone business achieved a record Q1 activation in 10 years with our improved channel inventory, which will bring even more growth potential for the future. We further strengthened the premium and the 5G with the successful launch of Motorola razr. We also demonstrated great growth potential in smarter collaboration and smart home areas. We remain committed to investing in technology innovations to ride down industry trends and build long-term competitiveness. We are driving collaborations on building the next-generation AI devices such as AI PC, AI smartphone to deliver certain level of inferencing.
For our smartphone business, we will continue to execute on our 3-year growth plan, which has helped us achieve a premier growth in our traditional stronghold in North America and Latin America, and make solid progress expanding into EMEA and Asia Pacific. Meanwhile, we also expanded our smart devices for our more diversified portfolio and enriched software and services to build IDG ecosystem.
Lastly, at the Lenovo, we believe a challenging business environment. Online makes innovation more important. AI and computing are our anchor technologies and the critical pillars of our Intelligent Transformation strategy. We will continue the hard work and driving innovations.
Here, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to Lenovo Tech World, our annual flagship event in October where we will showcase our AI devices, AI infrastructure and AI solutions, all for individuals, enterprises and the vertical industries.
Looking ahead, we will more effectively control expenses and mitigate risks so that we can deliver sustainable profitability improvement and continue to drive transformation and innovation to build our smarter future for all. Thank you.
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",1054

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q1 and fiscal year 2024.
Next, slide please. Despite the persisting macroeconomic headwinds, the group accelerated service-led transformation with our SSG revenue up 18% year-on-year and our non-PC sales improved to 41% of the combined sales of its 3 business groups. Our progress in inventory reduction and strong balance sheet has posted agility to capture the future growth opportunities, including AI. We are committed to returning to target profitability, doubling the net margin in the medium to long term remains the group's priority. The group's strong gross margin reached 17.5%, driven by the increasing contribution from the high-margin service business. The group was disciplined in streamlining its operating expense structure.
Operating expense was reduced by 11% year-on-year, ahead of our committed $850 million run rate savings target. However, persistent headwinds remained in the quarter and impacted IDG and ISG resulting in a 24% decline in group revenue to $12.9 billion or down 22% in constant currency. The magnitude of the revenue decline was healthier than expected, which led to a higher E/R ratio. The quarter saw a recent note in net profit margin on non-HKFRS standard. Group profit attributable to equity holders was $191 million, down 66% year-on-year.
Global economy starts to stabilize, although challenges remain. The group will continue to focus on controlling expenses, enhancing product competitiveness and identifying new growth catalysts in order to expedite business recovery and expand profitability. 
Next slide, please. We continue to optimize the efficiencies of group operations for greater responsiveness to challenges and long-term growth opportunities. Cash and cash equivalent balance reached $4.4 billion in June, up 15% year-on-year. For the seventh consecutive quarter, the group delivered a net cash with a balance of $454 million, 15% higher than a year ago. Inventory was reduced by nearly $3 billion or days of inventory reduced by 7 days in the quarter, attributable to accelerated adjustment in raw materials. Base of accounts payable and receivable together improved 17 days. The group shortened is cash conversion cycle by 24 days to negative 11 days. All of this critical steps in ensuring a prudent capital management to support future growth and accelerate business transformation.
Next slide, please. Successful service-led transformation position SSG to be a key beneficiary of the new IT era. SSG delivered a year-on-year revenue growth of 18% to $1.7 billion, highest for any first fiscal quarter in SSG history. Operating margin of 21% demonstrated business resilience and robust profitability. Operating profit of $361 million was up 10% year-on-year.
SSG continued to enrich its service portfolio across all 3 segments to meet evolving customer needs and to drive scale and profitability. Management services grew 54% year-on-year, capitalizing on strong demand for TruScale-as-a-service solutions, including first TruScale wins in Gulf countries in the quarter. Revenue of Support Service increased 9% year-on-year, thanks to rising penetration rates that came with greater popularity of past services such as premium support and sustainability offerings. Project & Solutions Services revenue rose 9% year-on-year supported by strong demand for vertical solutions.
Next slide, please. After outperforming the sector in growth for past 3 fiscal years based on server revenue, ISG was ultimately impacted by accelerated weakness in cloud server compute spending, combined with global GPU constraint impacting the AI server supply chain and a slower-than-expected transition to the next-generation platform. ISG reported Q1 revenue of $1.9 billion, down 8% year-on-year. The segment operating performance turned into a loss of $60 million as a result of a smaller scale operations.
Despite its service sales being impacted by these short-term sector-wide headwinds, ISG achieved multiple sales records across several product categories, showcasing its success in portfolio expansion. Storage revenue more than double year-on-year. Sales of Edge products and software increased by strong double digits in high-performance computing. ISG continued to rank as the top global player growing at 45% year-on-year in Q1.
In terms of server product, since cloud orders tend to be bulky in nature, its sales pattern can be more accurately assessed on a semiannual basis. ISG first half year run rate growth in calendar year 2023 is negative 4%, which is at a premium to sector growth. This product strategy plays an important role in enabling a broader adoption of AI by simplifying the deployment of AI solutions for businesses. The group has an AI-ready portfolio of smart devices and Edge to cloud infrastructure, and Lenovo and ISG will invest an additional $1 billion to further expand its portfolio to provide one-stop state-of-the-art AI enablement and solutions.
Most recently, ISG new ThinkSystem model utilizes the most powerful universal GPU accelerator that deliver breakthrough performance for large language model inference and retraining and graphics and video applications, including AGPU support.
Another focus area is our investment in building an AI ecosystem. Lenovo AI innovators program is now delivering 150-plus turnkey solutions, helping businesses implement generated AI immersive metaverse simulations and cognitive decisions at scale.
Next slide, please. Having navigated through the final phase of inventory digestion in the sector, the magnitude of IDG shipment decline was substantially moderated in Q1. The trends of PC shipment and activations are now more consistent. Nevertheless, our actions to clear inventory across the sector led to more competitive pricing pressure. And as a result, IDG's revenue declined 28% year-on-year. The segment operating profit decreased by 39% to $650 million.
IDG maintained its leadership position in global PC sector, the business made a great progress in seizing growth opportunities beyond PC products with non-PC sales making up 21% of IDG's revenue. Smartphone revenue declined at the beginning of the quarter but its activation rate would represent the actual customer demand, rose double digit year-on-year towards the end of the quarter. Overall, the group's quarterly smartphone activation set a 10-year record for fiscal year first quarter to support demand recovery, and the trend is particularly strong across EMEA, Asia Pacific and North America. Smartphone premium mix achieved a record high of 18%, driven by successful recent launch.
Next, slide please. Now let me shift gears and talk about R&D investments. As we continue to invest in innovation to foster diversified growth engines, R&D spending as a percentage of revenue rose to 3.5% from 3% last year. AI has become a key enabler for many technologies and will unleash higher operating efficiency for us. More importantly, AI has created tremendous opportunities given the group's comprehensive and diversified exposure across devices, infrastructure and services. As mentioned earlier, we announced in June this year to invest an additional $1 billion over the next 3 years in AI. We have also extensively collaborated with many key partners to develop next-generation product road map and solution portfolios together. This strategic investment and collaboration will build our competitiveness in the long run.
Next slide, please. The group is consistently recognized for its ESG performance with numerous accolades, including the best employer for diversity award by Forbes. MSCI upgraded the company's ESG rating to AAA while EcoVadis acknowledge the group's excellence in sustainable procurement with an outstanding program leadership award. Lenovo has once again been named in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2023, ranking 8th in the list of global companies with supply chain operations. The company has fully embraced digital transformation across its complex extensive supply chain network. Additionally, Lenovo was highlighted in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. 
Next slide, please. The trend of digitalization will unlock new opportunities in computing and AI solutions. AI is incredibly powerful, and we are leveraging our group's full capabilities to unlock the potential of AI. And these opportunities should benefit all business groups from infrastructure to services and devices.
Looking ahead, SSGC promising prospect for digital transformation, and we'll continue to scale with next-generation offerings, including digital workplace, hybrid cloud and sustainability solutions while safeguarding its core business with high value-added support services. Strengthening partnerships and channel tools are also key growth initiative for SSG to enhance its contribution to the group's success. ISG has built industry-leading full stack offerings and expanded to end-to-end infrastructure solutions that include hybrid cloud, HPC, data management, AI and Edge computing. AI provides new growth opportunities for ISG, and its unique ODM Plus business model addresses the growing demand for vertically integrated supply chains. The business will continue to diversify its customer base and drive new account acquisitions. The approach will achieve an optimal balance between general purpose and customized cloud offerings while ensuring an appropriate scale and efficient cost structure to drive revenue growth and profitability.
The global PC market is stabilizing and well positioned for year-on-year recovery in the later part of 2023. In addition, the increasing popularity of a digital life centered around PC will drive demand structurally higher than the pre-pandemic level. The commercial upgrade cycle and the premiumization trend will help IDG drive premium to market growth. IDG will continue to drive efficiency with its lean operations, maintain healthy cash generation and invest in non-PC areas, including fast-growing accessories and work collaboration solutions. It's smartphone business will focus on portfolio and regional expansion as well as differentiation to take advantage of accelerated 5G adoption.
Meanwhile, the group tries to reinforce its #1 position in the PC sector with leading profitability and accelerate innovation-led growth in non-PC and adjacent areas, including accessories. Our strong financial position provides us a solid foundation to proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead. Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability improvement for our shareholders.

Lenovo is absolutely committed to deliver real user value on AI from the pocket to the cloud. As we discussed, we've now further invested USD 1 billion to accelerate this AI innovation and deployments. I think we're seeing tremendous demand. So let me share with you a few proof points on why we're excited about AI and the growth.
First, per IDC's latest report, our infrastructure AI business grew 139% year-on-year, and we've now grown over the past few years now to #3 in the world for AI infrastructure. And we've said that we now have over $2 billion in revenue from the ISG business on AI. We launched this AI innovators program, and we now have over 65 AI optimized platforms in the market. And to your question, we'll be launching additional products as we get through the fiscal year.
We've had 45 ISV partners that are now delivering over 150 AI solutions into the market, and we have now over 100 active proof of concepts into the marketplace. We also were public that we are the leading provider of Omniverse and OBX in the cloud, partnering with NVIDIA and with Microsoft. And we just recently announced a new product called the SR 675 with the new NVIDIA L40 SGPU. And where we're going to further extend our leadership with 8 GPU support for generative AI, for metaverse simulations and for other parts of AI. 
And then lastly, yes, you're correct. We are partnering with Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel and Qualcomm and planned out leading solutions across all these areas. So with that, we expect the AI market to be growing at, at least twice the market, we plan to extend our leadership position. Thank you.",294

So AI PC will be an inflection point for the entire PC industry. And we believe it will be driving a significant replacement cycle that is valued for commercial and consumer segments. Today, AI is already present in our devices with our own IP. But what we are talking now for the future AI PC is a new class of devices with a dedicated NPU that will allow a certain level of inferencing at the Edge. There will be several innovations with great productivity features, security, privacy, improvements in battery life, improvements in some factor. And we think that we can be really -- we will be a great beneficiary of this AI PC trend, given the possibility for us to leverage our pocket to the cloud offering, including our Edge to cloud collaboration, multi-OS, multi-device R&D efforts that we have done now for a long time.

Thank you, YY. For now, we have 2 cost ranges coming from Albert Hung with JPMorgan. Question one, could you elaborate details regarding to where Lenovo is going to invest in AI? Or does Lenovo see the addressable market to be in AI for data center and PC? 
And question two, how quickly could Lenovo monetize this AI investments, i.e., its contribution to the total revenue? And what is going to be the growth rate in the next 2 to 3 years?",85

So thank you, Albert, for the question. So actually, AI is not new for Lenovo. So for years, we have been embracing AI from all aspects. So we have built our advantages in computing power from client to Edge to cloud and the network. And as Kirk has said, we are investing a further USD 1 billion over the next 3 years in AI-driven innovation.
No doubt a recent breakthrough in large language model or AIGC marks a major leap in development and application, although it's just 1 part of the narrative, but we believe is a catalyst and accelerate that will boost the adoption of AI so that it becomes relevant and real to the average person. But this is definite -- consistent with our 3 strategy. So more powerful infrastructure with GPUs, NPUs or heterogeneous computing and certainly a more powerful devices as Luca just introduced. This is because more inferencing will have under the device side in the future, whether it's for accessibility or privacy protection consideration.
So we are leveraging this way to drive our business groups addressing the real market beyond the hype and executing our strategy. So we will spend our money to make our devices more powerful -- more AI ready and optimized. So like Kirk and Luca just introduced AI PC, AI smartphone, AI server and storage, so are definitely our focus area. So actually, we'll probably -- we'll continue to embed this new AIGC technology into our smart vertical solutions to help our customer -- enterprise customer to improve their productivity as well.
We are definitely collaborating with partners like Microsoft, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD to build our next-generation product road map and the solution portfolio together. So our partners value us not just because of our road to market capability, our design capability, but particularly our ability to develop across ecosystems. So Windows, Android and across the silicons, so x86 arm, et cetera, et cetera. So we definitely believe. So we are a leading company in providing the AI-ready, AI-optimized devices and infrastructure. Thank you.",346

We are comfortable with this level, and then we look cautiously optimistic in the second half to see shipment grow year-over-year, driven by our record activation share, normalized channel inventory, as I mentioned, and improving underlying demand and, of course, more favorable compared with the second half of last year.
In regards of the PC market, we think it will end up at the low end of our guidance for this year, so around $250 million, $255 million. And then we expect a single-digit growth in 2024, helped also by the Windows 10 end of life from Microsoft, and then an accelerated growth in 2025 with a massive AI PC launch.
In regards to the margin, despite the competition has intensified, we are working hard to maintain the same or better margin level, and that is driven by several actions, including mix, segment and product mix, procurement scale, our design to cost stability and also many product portfolio optimization programs that we have launched 1 and 2 years ago as well as strong operational expense discipline among other section that we are taking.

So regarding the cloud and the dynamics we're seeing there, I think inherently, the cloud is a little lumpy because of the large customer base of the hyperscalers. We believe that if you look at calendar first half of the year, we actually executed at a double-digit premium to market. But if we look at this current quarter, I think we had some highlights and then some slowdown areas. As you saw, we grew our storage business more than 120% and crossed over to become the fourth largest storage vendor in the world and #1 in price bands 1 through 4. So storage is doing extremely well for us.
AI infrastructure, like I said, grew 139% year-to-year, but we are seeing GPU constraints. And in general, there is a move from server compute -- like general purpose compute over to AI workloads that's constrained by GPU. There is inventory consumption happening given the global macroeconomic environment. And we saw a slower-than-expected transition to the new DDR5 platforms based on the premiums on DDR5 and the overall value proposition of those.
So having said that, I think we are highly confident that as we go through our fiscal year, we're going to see an improvement from this quarter's results in the cloud and in enterprise SMB. As the world pivots more to AI and we have the 65-plus platforms launching into the market as well as our consistent expansion in storage, which obviously is well over 100% premium to market.

And the second strong hold is North America, where we are #3 and we continue to see opportunity to grow. Then in EMEA and AP, Asia Pacific, these are the geography where we are hyper growing when the last quarter, we had more than 20 points of premium to the market in each of these 2 geographies.
Then what are the priority in the next year? I think we are putting a lot of focus on premium franchisees like our Edge and the razr franchisee, which represented close to 20% of our shipments and revenues in Q1 -- sorry, revenues in Q1. And within this, you were asking on the foldable, and we are very happy with our razr launch. This is our fourth generation. 
Just to give you an idea, in the first 120 days from the launch, we have shipped more than 3 times what we shipped for the 3 generations of the previous razr combined. We are receiving phenomenal feedback from the channel and end users. So giving us a lot of confidence on our strategy to balance the scale with also a presence in the premium segment, particularly in the innovative foldable segment. Thank you.",222

Regarding of our smartphone business, although last quarter declined as much as a PC, but I'm less worried about that.

I think there'll be another quarter of inventory digestion by the large clouds and a pivot over to AI. And as we get into the second half of this year, we believe we'll have significantly improving results based on the portfolio and the demand we see.
As I said earlier, we're seeing records across the business in general purpose and enterprise. So we've had 9 consecutive quarters of growth on our Edge server business with another double-digit growth quarter. We had 45% growth in HPC, retaining our #1 position on the top 500 and #1 in the green 500. Server-based storage is growing, like I said, for us, well over 100 premium to market. And then our profit drivers underneath that, storage services and software are all growing at records this quarter as well. So it really is just a pause by the hyperscalers, I think, and that we see in the second half of the fiscal AI and overall demand coming back. Thank you.",188

And this is also in line with the market data that we have seen from Gartner and IDC. This is continued to be the sweet spot of the market in terms of growth.
Now regarding some of the demand that we see in the market, right? Definitely, device-as-a-service continue to grow, and we see pockets of opportunity around high-performance computing and hybrid cloud even faster more demand coming from our customers. And especially about phone, right, when we look at the past few quarters, right, even -- especially when we look at our internal data and also to our interaction with the customer, the demand for phone in the business scenario is getting more, right?

SMB has been impacted in terms of the shipment also by the channel inventory correction. SMB is a business model where channel plays a bigger role than the pure commercial. So that is probably a significant difference that shows up in the performance so far year-to-date.
We think SMB will return to grow as well, with the inventory, as I said, being normalized and the underlying demand stabilizing in the near term. The demand in SMB, I would probably say that it's the one more impacted by the macroeconomic condition. So hopefully, we will also see a relaxation in 2024 of that macro to get more natural demand from SMB. So -- but commercial, at this point of time, we see stronger than SMB. Thank you.",159

So I think we're trying to put AI into everything we do in this -- in the infrastructure space, from Edge server to storage to general purpose to cloud. So it's probably -- the answer is probably based on segment. I think in the Edge, we're seeing amazing new use cases with these over 150 solutions in these POCs where our Edge margins are likely improving because of the AI workloads that are getting put on them. We now have the densest Edge server in the world with more GPU support, and we're seeing proof of concepts that more than half of the global fast food chains, for example, because of that.
In the cloud, I think it's a very aggressive and fierce competitive market. But I would say in storage, our growth of 120% year-on-year is driven, again, because we're putting more and more AI into our storage business as well. And you can see that in the most recent announcement we've had. So I would say it's a mix in the cloud. It's very fierce competition and probably lower margin. But in Edge, storage and general purpose, we'll be delivering real value to the customer that's helping us improve margins a bit. Thank you.",212

I think we're very excited about our storage growth that we've had. Again, in a market that's growing at low single digits, we're well over 100% -- year-on-year, we're 120% growth. So again, we crossed over to being #4 in the world overall and now #1 in price bands 1 through 4 in $25,000. So our growth is in the entry traditional NAS and SAN in the midrange, in software defined, in cloud, in high-performance computing. So we're seeing records in our storage business essentially in almost every part of the world and every piece of our -- of the segments we participate in.
Relative to the growth rates, I think we're challenging our segment managers to continue to grow at a premium to market in every piece of the business. So we will have new cloud storage designs, and we think we'll continue to grow at a significant premium marketing cloud. But we've also had new partnerships with partners like WECA, where we're seeing growth as well. So I would say all aspects of our storage business continue to be very exciting for the horizon.

Again, if you look at the first half of the year calendar, we executed a premium to market. So I think this is a temporary issue as the cloud pivots to AI. They're consuming inventory of server compute and pivoting that to storage and AI use cases. So as we get into the second half of the year, that will significantly improve.
In the meantime, because of the lower-than-expected revenue, we're continuing to invest, for example, in AI and in storage to generate these 100-plus percent growth rates like we've shown in AI and storage, 50% growth in software, 45% growth in HPC, 9 consecutive quarters now double-digit growth in the Edge. So I think this is a temporary phenomenon, and we're confident in our long-term revenue and profit improvement strategy as we go towards the second half of this fiscal year. Thank you.",180

So definitely, the -- in short term, so the macro economy is very challenging. So they impacted our last quarter performance. But for the remaining quarter of the fiscal year, so we are still cautiously optimistic. So we think the overall device market is stabilizing. So we have finished the China inventory digestion. So from now on, so shipment will be consistent with the activation. So we are confident quarter-over-quarter. So we will see the improved performance no matter it's in the top line or in the bottom line.
So to protect our bottom line, so we announced our $850 million cost-saving plan. So we are -- so far, we have been above the track. But probably we will take even more actions to ensure our expense is consistent with the forecasted revenue so that we still can deliver the rather stable profitability to our shareholders. So definitely it's another opportunity. So we will invest more money in that space based on our client Edge cloud and network and intelligent architecture. So we think we will be a leading company, so in the AI-related devices, AI-related infrastructure under AI-related vertical solutions and the services. So that's my summary for last quarter and the future. Thank you.",207

Welcome to Lenovo's Investor Earnings Webcast. This is Jenny Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations at Lenovo. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.  
Before we start, let me introduce our management team joining the call today. Mr. Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO; Mr. Wong Wai Ming, Group CFO; Mr. Kin Wong, President of Solutions and Services Group; Mr. Kirk Skaugen, President of Infrastructure Solutions Group; Mr. Luca Rossi, President of Intelligent Devices Group; Mr. Sergio Buniac, President of Mobile Business Group and President of Motorola.  
We will begin with earnings presentations. And shortly after that, we open the call for questions. 
Now let me turn it over to Yang Yuanqing, please.",118
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3497.0,2958317.0,108763076.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, despite the macro challenges, we saw clear signs of recovery across the technology sector. Our strong execution to our strategy, operational excellence and continuous investment in innovations enabled Lenovo to achieve quarter-to-quarter improvements in our performance, once again, showcasing our business resilience. We are confident in our ability to resume year-on-year growth very soon.  Meanwhile, by leveraging our continued investment and the growing portfolio of AI technologies over the years, we received a wide recognition for our ""AI for All"" Vision and the capabilities demonstrated at our Annual Tech World event last month.  
Furthermore, we strengthened our AI ecosystem and partnerships, positioning ourselves well to capture the exponential growth in the AI era.  Last quarter, global revenue achieved a quarter-to-quarter improvement for the second time in a row, indicating an encouraging trajectory to recover. Leveraging our innovative technologies and products, our gross profit margin improved year-on-year to a record high for fiscal Q2.  Our non-Hong Kong FRS net income also improved quarter-to-quarter. 
Our diversified growth engines continued to deliver strong performance with non-PC revenue mix growing nearly 3 points year-on-year to account for more than 40% of group revenue.  As predicted in the last 2 quarters, while the macro context continue to bring uncertainties, the PC market has bottomed out with another round of potential growth brought by AI PC on the horizon. AI will also be the most important growth driver for infrastructure and solutions as a hybrid AI that leverages both public and private foundation models will create new demand for computing infrastructure and services presenting huge growth opportunities.  
For Lenovo, AI has long been a key focus of our digital and intelligent transformation strategy. Following the announcement last quarter of our additional $1 billion investment in AI innovation over the next 3 years. We unveiled our vision for our full stack AI portfolio from pocket to cloud at the Tech World at the end of last month, including AI-ready, AI-optimized and AI-enabled devices, infrastructure and solutions. We are committed to furthering our investment in innovation so that AI for all can be realized for every enterprise under every individual, ultimately driving sustainable growth for our business.  
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Solutions and Services Group. Last quarter, SSG revenue and operating profit both reached historical highs. Again, we protected Support Services & Software as our core profit engine and further expanded the Managed Services and the Project & Solutions Services. The revenue mix of which has grown 3 points year-on-year to account for 56% of SSG total business, leveraging the strong momentum of our hero offerings such as Digital Workplace solutions, Hybrid Cloud and Sustainability.  We have been integrating these horizontal building blocks into smart vertical solutions and services for different industries, winning breakthrough customer deals in multiple markets.  Lenovo's new hybrid AI professional services practice is also enabling enterprises to use hybrid infrastructure and AI to transform their business.  
Next, our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG. Last quarter, facing headwinds from global economy slowdown, platform migration as well as the supply shortage for key components, ISG's overall revenue and profitability were inevitably impacted, but we achieved a strong performance in storage, software, services, edge and the high-performance computing. In particular, storage achieved our all-time revenue record, which made us the third largest total storage provider in the world.  
Looking ahead, we expect the development of hybrid AI to drive the future growth and diversification of the global ICT infrastructure market. It will gradually find a balance between public cloud, private cloud and the local data centers between cloud and edge as well as between AI computing and the traditional computing, with AI being more balanced between training and inferencing.  At Lenovo, we are well positioned to address this trend with our richest infrastructure products and solutions. We will continue to strengthen our portfolio and the competitiveness as well as operational excellence. 
We remain confident to resume growth and profitability as soon as possible.  For Intelligent Device Group, or IDG, despite the tremendous market challenges last quarter, we maintained our global #1 position in PC shipments and activations, even though our overall revenue experienced a year-on-year decline, we maintained our profitability resilience with our industry-leading operating margin by taking concrete actions to further strengthen our operational excellence. Meanwhile, our smartphone business achieved a double-digit shipment growth year-on-year, even though the market was flat. We further enhanced the competitiveness of our products and optimized our portfolio with a higher mix of premier products. 
We will fully leverage generative AI to accelerate the launch of our next generation of AI devices, including AI PC as scheduled next year, and we remain committed to investing in technology innovations for growth and to build long-term competitiveness.  
Before I close, I want to emphasize that Rome was not built in a day. While delivering AI applications driven by generative AI and large language models might seem recent, Lenovo has, in fact, been persistently executing our intelligent transformation strategy for many years. This has given us a distinctive head start in building a comprehensive AI product road map that includes a rich smart device portfolio, such as AI-enabled PC, smartphone and tablet as well as AI-ready and AI-optimized infrastructure solutions and services. This unique advantage also enables us to build the strongest partnership in the industry. Together, we are well positioned to capture the huge opportunities brought by this wave of AI revolution.  
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wong Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",936
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3497.0,2958317.0,108763077.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q2 in fiscal year 2024. 
Next chart, please.  In Q2, the group began to yield benefit from accelerating demand momentum and improved profitability. Despite last year peak performance creating a high base and a 16% year-on-year revenue decline, group revenue grew 12% quarter-on-quarter to $14.4 billion. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sequential growth, confirming a recovery trend with a growth rate faster than our 10-year average of 9%.  Gross margin reached 17.5%, the highest for a second fiscal quarter, supported by the group's unwavering investment in innovation and the increasing contribution from our high-margin service business. Group E/R ratio remained higher than our typical target range due to smaller top line.  
On non-HKFRS standard, group profit attributable to equity holders was $273 million, representing a 40% quarter-on-quarter increase, although still down 54% compared to our nearing peak profit set a year ago.  Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0209. Today, the Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.08, same as last fiscal year.  SSG is the high-priority growth engine that spearheads the group service-led transformation and margin expansion. Its revenue and operating profit both reached all-time highs. The share of non-PC sales improved to 40% of the combined sales of the group's 3 business groups.  Sales of IDG and ISG make sequential and robust improvement, signaling momentum in demand recovery after a few challenging quarters. 
The group will continue to focus on accelerating transformation, driving demand recovery and seizing new growth opportunities in order to expedite business recovery. We are committed to restoring target profitability with our priority being to double net margin in the medium term.  
Next chart, please. The group's efforts to optimize operational efficiency help to shorten the cash conversion cycle to negative 4 days. Days of accounts receivables and inventory together improved by 9 days year-on-year, of which 6 days came from inventory days improvement alone. A reduction of $2.2 billion in inventory level was achieved through our active management in raw materials.  Q2 finance cost was down $7 million quarter-to-quarter, thanks to prudently lowered borrowings offsetting the higher base interest rates.  Last, but not least, S&P Global Rating upgraded the group's long-term credit ratings to BBB with a Stable Outlook, affirming our operational resilience and the effectiveness of our strategy in diversifying our growth engines.  
Next chart, please. SSG has once again achieved record high performance with revenue growing 11% year-on-year to $1.9 billion and operating margin of 20%, which is a few times higher than our corporate average showcases our business strength. This was achieved despite a mix shift and a high base comparison that resulted in a slightly lower margin year-on-year.  Managed Services grew 31% year-on-year on strong demand for as-a-service solutions and accelerated geographic expansion, which includes TruScale breakthrough win in Japan this quarter. Premier Support and Sustainability solutions, such as CO2 offset and reduce carbon transport, continue to boost our penetration rate. SSG is also leveraging AI to enrich its service portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers.  
A newly unveiled Care of One platform service is the first of its kind AI-empowered advisory service that makes it possible for clients to reduce lead time and maximize optimization. Our AI professional services can help customers to deploy gen AI securely and efficiently in a hybrid environment. And Lenovo Intelligent Sustainability Solution Adviser is another AI-powered service that assist our clients in aligning their IT environment with their sustainability growth.  
Next chart, please. The infrastructure market is currently transitioning to support the growth opportunities in AI. This has resulted in short-term challenges, including supply shortage of key GPU components, but shifts away from traditional general purpose computing and a slower-than-expected transition to DDR5-based platforms.  ISG recorded a 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue increase and a $7 million improvement in operating profit, suggesting stabilizing sector demand. Year-to-year revenue declined 23% with operating loss. Despite the headwinds, ISG delivered multiple performance records, including all-time high revenues in storage.  
According to third-party statistics, Lenovo is now the third largest storage supplier by global revenue market share, a significant advancement of 5 positions from just a year ago. Within the storage market price bands of $25,000 and below, Lenovo has held #1 position for 4 consecutive quarters. Moreover, we also achieved double-digit revenue growth in high-performance computing with 5 consecutive quarters of year-to-year growth.  Our edge and software revenue both achieved an all-time quarterly record with 10 and 4 consecutive quarters of year-to-year growth, respectively.  
ISG is investing in the development of differentiated technology solutions in general purpose service, hybrid cloud, HPC, data management, AI and edge computing. As part of these efforts, Lenovo has recently unveiled a new edge server with differentiated technology featuring 32% less power consumption.  
Next slide, please. IDG solidified its global PC market leadership, ranking #1 in 4 out of 5 geos with expanded market share. This revenue was up 12% sequentially. Our performance is seasonal average of last 6 years despite a decline of 16% year-on-year on high comparison base.  With the confirmed recovery trend, IDG revenue growth is expected to turn positive in the near future. IDG achieved an operating margin of 7.4%, returned to the high end of its historic range, thanks to continued R&D investment in innovations, operational excellence and exciting new product launches.  The segment also made great progress in seizing growth opportunities beyond PC products, driving non-PC sales up 2.4 percentage points year-on-year to 20% of IDG's revenue.  
Our smartphone business continued to accelerate market share gain in its growth and stronghold markets with double-digit premium to market growth in shipments.  Our innovations such as AI PC, which features AI computing and private foundation models as smart devices, are expected to be a powerful driver for the PC replacement cycle from the second half of 2024. AI PC also bodes well to the group's strategic positioning in AI from pocket to cloud, allowing for provision of end-to-end solutions that effectively harness the power of AI.  
Next chart, please. The group has consistently received numerous recognitions for its ESG performance such as its recent inclusion in the 2023 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index with the highest score in the IT industry for its environmental and social achievements.  The group was also granted the Champion Status in 2023 Canalys Global Sustainable Ecosystems Leadership Matrix, and was ranked as the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equity Index for the third consecutive year.  Among our various ESG initiatives, Lenovo has taken a significant step towards advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by joining the UNGC Forward Faster initiative, which sees to expedite private sector actions in realizing the SDGs outlined in the 2030 agenda.  
Next chart please. The group continued investment in innovation to diversify our growth engines and unlock new opportunities in intelligent transformation, especially in AI. Our investment goes beyond hardware devices, software, services and ecosystem to address the challenges in privacy protection and data security management.  All in all, the group will seek to harness the full potential of AI from pocket to cloud.  
Looking ahead, SSG will launch new AI embedded services to accommodate enterprise customers' growing demand for AI technologies, while safeguarding its core business with high value-added support services across both PC and infrastructure segments.  Strengthening partnerships and channel tools are also key growth initiatives for SSG to undertake to enhance its contribution to the group's success.  ISG has extended its industry-leading full stack offerings to include hybrid cloud, HPC, data management, AI and edge computing. AI present new opportunity for ISG, which is supported by its ODM+ business model and the new AI innovations program designed to meet the demand for vertical solutions.  The business segment will further diversify its customer base and acquire new accounts while balancing between general purpose systems and customized cloud offerings. This will ensure scalability, cost efficiency and the optimization of revenue growth and profitability.  
The stabilizing global PC market is poised for year-on-year recovery in late 2023. IDG will leverage the commercial upgrade cycle, the premiumization trend and the AI PC to drive premium to market growth and maintain its PC market leadership.  Meanwhile, IDG will prioritize efficiency, cash generation and non-PC investment. The smartphone business will focus on portfolio and regional expansion and differentiation given record 5G adoption. Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability improvements for our shareholders.

So the first half was the bottom of the PC demand, and we are looking cautiously optimistic in the second half and where we see some early signs of stabilization with Lenovo performing better than the market, driven by our record activation share and our balanced market position with the leadership in PC in 4 out of 5 geographies globally. And we believe, in 2024, the growth of the market will solidify, driven by a large installed base to be refreshed post COVID. We do see level replacement cycle and the new exciting product launches, such as AI PC. We are modeling 2024 with a low single-digit growth from the total available market from 2023. 
Moving to AI PC. We believe that AI PC will be an inflection point for the PC industry, starting from 2024 and accelerating in 2025 and 2026. When we start, I would say AI on PC is not something new for Lenovo because in the last 2 years, we already invested in AI techniques to make our PC smarter and adaptive to the user need. So we believe we have enhanced start on the AI technology there. 
 
There will be, the beginning in '24, accelerate in the second half of '24. I think there was a question on the AUR. Definitely, the configurations will become richer and the demand for those devices will require more memory, more storage and also more CPU computing power. And we are still modeling how much will be the AUR growth. But definitely, there will be a good upside there. 
 
What percentage? So regarding the percentage of AI PC. I believe it's a little early to give us a final number. We are thinking that 2023 will be -- 2024 will be a 1-digit percentage of the market and the acceleration for AI PC is going to be in 2025 with many more and new designs to be launched.

Thank you. So I think as we look at the future, we believe that as we go into the next calendar year and next fiscal year, we'll have a more balanced market between what, today, is largely driven by large language models, and becoming more balanced between storage, compute, large language models and AI inferencing. So that's number one. 
I think our profit growth drivers are continuing to be strong with records in storage and then records in services and growing quarterly software numbers. The other thing that will help our profit is as the DDR5 transition continues to happen, those motherboards move in-house for both Intel and AMD at Lenovo. So that improves our cost, delivers higher utilization in our factories and ultimately will improve our profit. 
And then lastly, we'll continue to manage our costs and expenses so that we can get profitable as quickly as possible. So I think a more balanced market and recovery. We saw quarter-on-quarter improvement going into this quarter, and we expect quarter-to-quarter improvement going into the current quarter as well. 
 
Relative to the China AI market, we're continuing to evaluate new chips that are coming to market from our suppliers, and we'll have updates in the future. But as YY said, we'll comply with all export regulations as new chips come out for all the markets we do business in. Thank you.",231

So very clear. I think, first, our strategy is to become double the business in the next 3 years. We are now on track to achieve that goal. I mean, that's the mid of the first year. That means in India, we need to become a top 3 player in the next 3 years. Last quarter, we grew in Asia close to 50%. And in the October month, that's probably the biggest month in some festivals in India. We are seeing triple digit grow year-over-year. 
We -- in partners online, we have already achieved double-digit market share in October, what shows very good progress. We are expanding offline, and we are seeing also our premium franchises growing much faster than the mainstream. So the franchise, the razr. So high expectations on India. We are on track on the plan. And not different in the rest of the globe, very similar strategy, growing faster in premium and especially in foldable. Foldable is the first form factor in a long time, attracting consumers from iOS, 20% of our razr consumers are coming from iOS, and we expect that growth to continue to expect to sell in the current generation 5x what we sold in the previous generation of the razr launches. .",211

We are investing in R&D to deliver unique and exclusive features to further differentiate and expand our leadership and more specifically, natural language interaction, processing speed for the AI workloads and the edge, security, privacy, low latency and low power consumption will be all the characteristic of the AI PC, which, we believe, will deliver such value. 
 
As a last point, obviously, this will not be only at the edge, but will be a hybrid blend of client, edge and cloud. So this also further give us an opportunity given our exclusive pocket to the cloud offering to further differentiate in the market. Thank you.",138

So I want to add a couple of points here. So definitely, so AI PC will help to protect the customer's data -- personal data, privacy. So that's the most important factor in the future people would need AI PC. But additional to that, so today, AI workload is mainly for the training. So that's the advantage of the comp part. But over time, the workload will shift to the inferencing. So all the inferencing still happens in the cloud, so definitely, it will impact the data efficiency and the cost. 
So we think with the workload shift, so probably between client, devices, edge and the cloud, you will see more balance workload among these 3 areas. So that's our view. So that's also why we need to have PC to do some inferencing work with the more efficiency and the lower cost.",144

The next question is coming from Anthony with JPMorgan. And what is your PC market outlook in the calendar quarter 4 and next calendar year? How sustainable is your PC margin? Is there any one-off items this quarter? And what is Lenovo's view on AI PC? Is it a catalyst for spec upgrade? Or is it a unique driver? And what's the expectation on AI PC penetration in the next few years?,73
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2023",2023-11-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3497.0,2958317.0,108763096.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,21,"So this is also for me. So PC market outlook calendar Q4, we are now modeling flat year-over-year. And 2024 calendar year, we are modeling low single-digit growth. No, there are no one-off income only for this quarter. Obviously how sustainable is the margin. I think, you definitely have a very competitive market as usual, but we think we can still drive the profitability for this business in the high range of pre-COVID and even beyond that with the following duration as I'm trying to summarize higher average selling price with the market shifting toward premium. Our own Lenovo share gain in the premium and commercial segment rich configuration. As I mentioned for AI PC, you will require a rich reconfiguration. We believe this trend will be visible in '24, but accelerate further in '25. 
 
Our focus on efficiencies and services and software. And I will conclude with our strong competence in what we call design to cost given our leadership in R&D and innovation. And then on the last item, the expected AI PC penetration, as I said before, for '24, we are modeling a single-digit share of the AI PC in the total market, grow in '25. And according to many analysts, it could be 50%, 60% in the market in 2026. Thank you.",216

So simply put, we are very confident that not just a key, you may improve the profitability in our PC business. You should know the past year probably was the toughest period in our PC history. So we still keep a very good GP margin and operation profit with our competitive products and operational excellence. So we definitely believe with further investment in the AI and the innovation further sharpening our operation excellence, so we will further improve the GP margin as well as the operation profit.

As I mentioned, I think as we look at AI, we've established a strong position with the initial $1.2 billion we invested and now an additional $1 billion we've committed to invest over the next 3 years as Lenovo. Our AI strategy drives a very broad portfolio from edge to cloud with our unique ODM+ development model, where we're building our own motherboards and putting them in our own factories. 
 
The second thing we're doing on AI is delivering simplified solutions through our AI innovators program so that regardless of what your business size is, you can easily deploy AI technology. And then the third is the services we announced. So relative to NVIDIA, I think you saw the strong support from all our partners at Lenovo's Tech World. We had Jensen on stage, Lisa, Pat Gelsinger and Cristiano from Qualcomm, and we plan to support all of those accelerators going forward. 
In addition, we will be the reference design partner for several of those partners as we look at next-generation form factors that start optimizing the system around GPU. So I think we believe in customer choice will be customer-driven and relative to both the CPU and the GPU from NVIDIA we will be supporting. Thank you.",209

So through our interaction with our customer, I think, we continue to see a couple of support needed and also trend in the market. Number one is hybrid work is no longer a one-off phenomenon but more becoming a new normal, especially when we talk about the whole workplace technologies, right. 
The second one is we continue to see a strong demand in terms of as-a-service, right, because this is the agility and also the facility -- the flexibility that the customers are looking for. And hence, we continue to see strong double-digit demand growth in the as-a-service segment of the IT services. And also some of the data points that we are seeing is suggesting that 1 in 5 commercial PCs in the coming 3 to 5 years will be consumed in as-a-service manner. 
 
Last, but not least, this is another phenomenon that we see in terms of our customer demand change is they're looking for a new technology that could transform user experience. And that is why, for example, we just announced our Care of One platform, which is a highly automated, hyper personalized technology to help deliver the next level of employee experiences to our digital workplace solution.

Thank you for the question. The decline in cash, I think is primarily the way how we manage working capital. As most of you know that I think interest rate remains pretty high, and we've actually been trying to optimize our cash level by managing our 3 components of working capital. I think mainly our receivable inventory as far as our payable. I think we are actually in a very comfortable position. Our cap remained pretty strong. You will know that lately, I think Standard & Poor's actually upgraded our investment brand rating. So again, this is primarily driven from the external environment because of the continuously high interest rate environment and therefore, we try to optimize between a very healthy balance sheet, a healthy cash flow against the expenses we pay for the interest.

So I think, number one, our 5G mix is growing slightly faster than the market. Of course, the different maturity levels, some markets like North America growing faster just because the carrier deployments are coming faster. We are seeing our price ranges going down by almost 30%, 40% in the last 2 years, also in line with the market, what is democratizing 5G over the place. 
 
And probably, normally, the 3G to 4G, 2 to 5 years, at least 90% of the portfolio should be 5G between the next 24 to 36 months, but we'll go in line with the market. So that also depends on the deployment from the carriers in each market. So some markets probably we will see that next year like North America, more than 18 months, and the others, 18 months [indiscernible].",138

And next question comes from Mr. Conor O'Mara with Jefferies. Can you please talk about benefit of AI on both PC and smartphone? This could be a full replacement driver if it captures consumer information. Would you talk about the latency, et cetera? What is the pace we have in China?",53

So he will -- the AI PC will know everything about you, will be able to process the data about you in your device. So without the need to load it into the cloud because I'm sure nobody wants to put on the cloud certain private data. So that is a very powerful use case where you will have AI workload capability at very high speed. You need to think about several trillions of operations per second will be the capability of this new generation of PC to elaborate AI workloads, but doing it on your device without moving your data to the cloud. 
 
I think that will guarantee privacy, security, low latency, certain things are also requiring low latency. So this is the one of the use cases we have in mind in consumer. So personal twin. Then you can imagine in commercial, you have the productivity use case where the PC will be able to do things that were just unimaginable today with this new computing power that they will have.",194

But meanwhile, you don't need to share all your personal data with the public cloud. So that's the advantage of it. So we have a survey to our customers, and most of them like the IT part. So that's for sure. 
 
So as Luca said, so gradually, it will be become your personal assistant or we call it a personal twin. So what does personal twin mean? It means only you can use this device. Meanwhile, only this device or your personal twin can understand you better. So if you ask that -- ask it to do something for you, they will always give you the best answer than any other large language model.",139

So more premium. Then also the selling price, the market will shift towards more premium. There is no issue on managing because I would tell you instead that given our R&D efforts in the last 2 or 3 years, we are very confident that we have and we will have the best design to cost.

Our understanding right now is there are new NVIDIA chips that are not on the restricted list. And so for those kind of chips, we will certainly want to be time to market with our key partners, whether it's NVIDIA or others.

So regarding the IT services outlook, number one, I think even though there are a lot of dynamics happening in the market, but throughout our conversation and interaction with our customer, I think our customer is more relying on leveraging technology to create competitive edge for their business. And that's why if you look at the overall IT services market, you continue to see resilient demand from the IT services market, right?  That's number one. 
Number two, among all the IT services market segment, we definitely see a pocket of faster growing segment. The first one is definitely the as-a-service demand, right, across the Devices-as-a-Service and also Infrastructure-as-a-Service. And that is also reflected in our strength in our TruScale as a Service business, which has been consistently growing at double-digit year-to-year basis for a couple of quarters, right? 
The other part is AI, a lot of our customer, on one hand, they are trying to understand the -- how to leverage AI to build competitive edge for their businesses. On the other hand, they're looking for a partner, for example, like us to help them to understand the technology, to help them to deploy the technology in an efficient and most importantly, in a secure manner. And this is why, I think, just in our Tech World, which is an annual flagship event of Lenovo, we announced the AI professional services in partnership with NVIDIA, which is to help our customers to accelerate their journey and also time to market for their AI solutions.

As I said before, we are still modeling how much will be the upside in AUR or ASP. Definitely, within -- with richer configuration, there will be a meaningful upside.

So there will be different classes of AI PC with and without NPU. AI workloads can be processed also by the combination of CPU or CPU trans GPU. But clearly, there will be a new class of devices that will ask an NPU, neural processing unit, within the CPU, and that will help to drive AI workloads with more efficiency, speed and energy savings. So I think there will be the 2 cases, with NPU and without NPU. Thank you.",81

So on the definition of AI PC, I think the industry is still maturing on this front. Probably if you ask several silicon vendor, they will have a different definition of AI PC for now. I believe this will mature over time. 
From a usage perspective, this AI PC will have the natural language interaction with the end user. We'll have this kind of personal twin, personal assistant approach or mode. We'll be able to execute those AI workloads in a hybrid way, so partially on device and partially on the cloud. When he's on device, you will have your personal foundation model and the knowledge base that contains your data on the device, and then you will be able to go to the cloud on demand. And the user will be able to finish where he wants to also share the cloud data and when he only want to process on the device. 
 
And in general, as I mentioned in the previous question, there will be a combination of CPU and GPU and NPU. And well, I believe this is just the beginning. So we will see more clarity over time in 2024 and in 2025, where the year that we believe will be a very big acceleration of those AI PC shipments. Thank you.",217
