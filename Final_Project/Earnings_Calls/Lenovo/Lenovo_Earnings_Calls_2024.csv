410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2024",2024-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3513.0,3039217.0,110813620.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, Lenovo delivered on its promise to resume year-on-year revenue growth despite multiple macro challenges. Profitability has improved quarter-to-quarter for 2 consecutive quarters, a testament to both the resilience of our core business and the effectiveness of our transformation. 
In addition, we have also been focusing on the growth opportunities brought by hybrid AI. This includes continuous investment in innovations to fuel sustainable growth into the future, a part of which we demonstrated last month at the Annual CES event, well, we received industry-wide recognition for more than [ 40 ] new devices and solutions. As I shared with you in Q2, Lenovo has been consistently improving quarter-to-quarter, and we have entered our trajectory to recover.
Now for fiscal Q3, we successfully achieved year-on-year growth. Group revenue increased 3% year-on-year, and the global profitability improved quarter-to-quarter for 2 consecutive quarters. Thanks to the strong execution of our transformation strategy, our non-PC revenue mix further expanded year-on-year to 42% of the Group revenue.
In the AI era, hybrid AI, leveraging both public and private foundation models is creating significant growth opportunities for the industry across devices, infrastructure and the solution services. Among the continued signs of recovery in the PC market, we're particularly excited to see the emerging trend of hybrid AI directly driving the future demand for the coming AI PC.
AI PC comes with a personal intelligent agent using natural language user interface, a compressed local large language model, heterogeneous computing with CPU, GPU, MPU, privacy and security protection and our reach AI application ecosystem. We believe this trend will stimulate another industry refresh cycle, as the users require devices designed for more creativity and productivity. According to [ analysts ] projection by 2026, it is expected that more than 50% of PCs will be AI capable.
In the meantime, hybrid AI is also driving increased demand for hybrid infrastructure. On top of that, we are seeing increased customer demand for AI native applications, solutions and services such as consulting, design, deployment and maintenance, fueling AI services growth across different verticals. Lenovo is in a unique position with many advantages to lead this hybrid AI revolution. We stay committed to furthering investment in innovation, focusing on AI and computing.
Our number and the percentage of R&D headcount keep increasing, and we're on track for a record year of R&D expense to revenue ratio. We have long embraced AI in all our businesses and have built computing capabilities from pocket to cloud. This relentless focus means we now have a full portfolio that includes AI enabled, AI ready and AI optimized devices, infrastructure solutions and services. We are realizing our vision of AI for All for each individual and enterprise, changing the way they live and work, while at the same time, driving sustainable growth for our business.
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG Solutions and Services group. Last quarter, SSG revenue reached USD 2 billion milestone, growing double digit year-on-year to another record high. Operating profit also hit a record with high operating margin above 20%. We protected the support services and software, as our core profit engine. We further expanded managed services and the project and solutions services. And together, revenue mix for these 2 areas now account for 55% of SSG's total business growing year-on-year for 11 consecutive quarters.
In particular, strong growth momentum continued for our hero offerings such as digital workplace solutions, hybrid cloud and sustainability, each winning major customer deals in key markets. Looking ahead, the new IT services segment within the [ $1 trillion ] IT services market is expected to see stable midterm growth. The rise of hybrid AI is opening up new opportunities for our AI native solutions and services. Additionally, we are proactively embedding AI into the vertical solutions that we are building for various industries to strengthen value proposition and enhance differentiation for our customers.
Next, our Infrastructure Solutions Group or ISG. Last quarter, while industry and market headwinds continued to impact the overall ISG performance, we delivered our quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter and the combined revenue from storage, software and services reached a record high of USD 1 billion. We remained a solid #3 for both storage and AI infrastructure on the global market.
Looking ahead, we expect the market will continue to shift to AI infrastructure with AI server expected to grow nearly twice as fast as the total server market. At Lenovo, we are growing key strategic partnerships and building more sophisticated AI infrastructure solutions to strengthen our portfolio competitiveness, as well as securing major customer deals and a stable pipeline. We remain confident that we will resume year-on-year growth, as soon as the coming quarter.
Our Intelligent Devices Group, or IDG delivered a strong quarter with revenue resuming growth, thanks to our clear strategy, consistent investment in innovation and operational excellence. As the PC market continued to recover, our PC business excelled and outperformed the market. We returned to year-on-year shipment growth with leading profitability. Our global #1 position in PC was further strengthened with a significant premium to the market, winning the highest market share since COVID.
Last quarter, our non-PC device businesses made encouraging progress in building a more diversified portfolio. Both the smartphone and the tablet business returned to high double-digit growth with a significant premium to the market of more than 20 points. Particularly, we see smartphone hypergrowth in Asia Pacific, EMEA and the North American market. Looking ahead, we expect the trend of hybrid AI to drive the demand for AI client devices, driving another refreshment cycle, creating more growth potential and improving margin for us.
Before I close, I want to point out that even though global economic headwinds still challenging the industry, we have [ all 3 ] the potential of the revolutionary AI technology and these applications. Our commitment to AI innovation and partnerships with other key leaders in AI ensures that we are well positioned to capture the tremendous growth opportunities in AI. Thank you.

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q3 in fiscal year 2024.
The Group's operating performance continued to expand in Q3. While still navigating the ongoing market challenges, our core business has returned to a healthy growth trajectory fueled by strong diversified growth engines and resilient profitability.
Group revenue increased by 9% sequentially to $15.7 billion, represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth, while revenue and operating profit improved sequentially across all 3 business groups.
This quarter also marked a new milestone for the Group service-led transformation with SSG achieving record-breaking double-digit growth in segment revenue and operating profit. This total contract value, a strong indicator for long-term pipeline [ soared ] by over 50% year-on-year.
IDG strengthens its business cadence to achieve 7% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter revenue growth. Its market share by shipment advanced new high across multiple geographic markets and its premium sales mix was the highest since COVID.
ISG reported a 24% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth and record high sales across multiple growth products, although it is still shy of its best-performing quarter last year.
Group net profit rose by 35% sequentially to $337 million despite a decline by 23% year-on-year. The segment margins of IDG and SSG expanded year-on-year with IDG profitability nearing its historic peak and SSG scaling segment margin to 20.4%, around 2.3x of the Group's average. Impacted by smaller operating leverage and higher R&D investment, ISG still operated at a loss, but its recovery plan has already helped to improve its operating performance by $16 million quarter-on-quarter.
Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.28. The Group showed greater resilience by balancing finance cost and liquidity amid a higher interest rate environment. Q3 finance costs were down $60 million quarter-on-quarter and $10 million year-on-year, thanks to a prudent reduction in interest-bearing borrowings. Meanwhile, the Group continued to optimize operational efficiency with days of accounts receivable and inventory together improved by 14 days year-on-year. Of these 10 days come from inventory days improvement alone despite lower accounts payable days, leading to a cash [ conversion ] cycle of 1 day. Despite a constrained spending environment, the Group remains resolute in its dedication to innovation and is on track to invest the largest share of its revenue in R&D for fiscal year '23, '24.
SSG has once again achieved record high performance with revenues surpassing the $2 billion milestone. SSG pivotal role as the Group growth and profit engine is further highlighted by its 20.4% operating margin, expanding 22 basis points year-on-year. The Pay-as-you-go TrueScale services continue to gain traction with double-digit year-on-year growth in contract signings. The third fiscal quarter also saw the signing of SSG largest to date. Infrastructure as a service deal on an extensive partner ecosystem, as well as largest today asset recovery surface deal on superior data security assurance.
SSG is also leveraging AI to enrich its service portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers. One strong use case [ enters ] embedding AI into our offerings. For example, our care of one platform uses AI to improve employee experience and productivity. On the other hand, we are also rolling out our new AI native service called AI professional services to help customers deploy AI technology securely and efficiently in a hybrid environment.
For ISG, we have seen record breaking sales across [ all ] products and order recovery from key cloud and enterprise customers. This has helped ISG in achieving a 24% quarter-on-quarter revenue increase. Its recovery plan was also effective in improving segment profitability by $16 million quarter-on-quarter, reducing loss to $38 million.
ISG expanding its hybrid AI solutions to be time to market across GPU platforms and regained the #1 provider for high-performance computing on the top 500 supercomputer list, as well as the #1 most sustainable supercomputer on the Green500 list.
ISG in-house engineered Neptune water cooling technology was honored with the top award at the United Nations Energy Efficiency competition. Neptune technology allow our customers to operate their data centers without the need for specialized and power-intensive cooling infrastructure, thereby reducing their ongoing operating costs and providing unmatched sustainability benefits.
Combined revenue from storage, services and software achieved [ 36% ] year-on-year growth, while edge revenue increased by 12% year-on-year to an all-time high. ISG storage business continued its hypergrowth in sales with 48% year-on-year increase. Within the storage market price band of [ 25,000 ] and below, Lenovo is well positioned to retain the #1 position for 6 consecutive quarters.
IDG has shown resilience with a 7% revenue growth, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, driven by premium to market growth, while maintaining an industry-leading operating margin at 7.4%. This is made possible with our operational excellence and higher premium mix. As a result, IDG is now holding the #1 spot in 4 out of 5 geographical regions.
IDG further solidified leadership in the global commercial PC segment, achieving the highest market share of 27% in 3 years. AI PC represents an inflection point for the PC industry, driving a new product cycle with premium pricing. To capitalize on this structural trend at CES, IDG won a total of 105 product awards, 61 of those awards went to the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 hybrid, an innovative product that comes with a unique dual system and is powered by cutting-edge AI computing capability.
Finally, IDG continues to accelerate momentum on the non-PC front. Its non-PC sales accounted for 21% of revenue, up more than 4 percentage points year-on-year. Meanwhile, the smartphone business delivered high double-digit revenue growth and its premium products now accounted for a record of 25% of the mix.
The Group has consistently upheld numerous recognitions for its ESG performance. One of the great example is the newly awarded Climate Plus Champion Status by EPEAT, EPEAT, has acknowledged the Group's sustainable investments in incorporating climate considerations into over 400 products.
In terms of diversity and inclusion, the Group has been included in the Corporate Equality Index, CEI, by Human Rights Champion (sic) [ Campaign ] Foundation's for 6 years in a row, while receiving its all-time high score in the annual Workplace Pride Global Benchmark.
The Group drive for environmental sustainability was also recognized with the MSCI ESG rating of AAA for the second year, as well as the first place in the most sustainable companies' category as HKICPA's Best Corporate Governance and ESG award for the 11th consecutive year and the list go on. These achievements are a testament to the Group's ongoing suit of excellence in product design innovation and dedication to environmental sustainability.
Hybrid AI represents a significant and unique opportunity for the Group to supercharge growth. Investment in innovations will be made to unlock the full potential of hybrid AI and build pocket to cloud capabilities. The robust innovation across the 3 business Groups will enhance the Group's competitiveness in next-generation product design and solutions. This will, in turn, drive profitable growth and support the Group in meeting its medium-term profitability target.
Looking ahead, SSG will launch new AI native services and embedded AI functions across our service offerings to accommodate enterprise customer growing demand for AI technologies. SSG will concurrently focus on safeguarding its core business with high value-added support services across both PC and infrastructure segments. Through collaborating with ecosystem partners, SSG is well positioned to help customers accelerate their digital transformation journey and further enhance its financial contribution to the growth.
ISG is well positioned to capture new hybrid AI opportunities with the ODM plus business model and industry-leading full stack offerings, including hybrid cloud, HPC, data management, AI and edge computing. The business segment will further diversify its customer base and acquire new accounts, while balancing between general purpose systems and customized cloud offerings. This will ensure scalability, cost efficiency and the optimization of revenue growth and profitability.
AI PC could represent an inflection point for the PC industry. It could drive a new product cycle with premium pricing, which is key to delivering premium to market growth, strong ASP and sustainable profitability for IDG. Following the successful launch of its first AI PC at CES, IDG is on track to launch NextGen AI PC in the later part of the calendar year. This will offer industry-leading computing power to the market, optimizing AI workload efficiency and user experience. Meanwhile, IDG will prioritize efficiency, cash generation and non-PC investment.

And our first question is coming from Morgan Stanley's, Mr. Howard Kao. First question is the -- our view regarding to AI PC and how much ASP uplift do we expect from AI PC versus a normal PC? And what does this mean to our profitability? And second question is regarding to our market share in North America for PC?",62
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2024",2024-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3513.0,3039217.0,110813625.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,6,"Yes. So let me first answer, then probably Luca can follow up. So as you know -- so today, AI is mainly public AI, so it runs on public cloud. So it has its limitations by -- in terms of network speed, efficiency, cost, security and privacy [ case ], et cetera. There are many use cases, where public AI is not the best of choice. And in certain industries like financial services, public AI, that may not even be an option. So customers need better ways to bring AI from the cloud to their fingertips and into their own organizations. So we believe hybrid AI is the future.
But how to lend this hybrid AI into every individual life and every enterprise. I think integrating AI with personal computing devices is a possible task. So today, everyone has a PC or a smartphone, which are the vehicles for us to bring AI to all, making AI available and accessible. So it definitely goes to the number of strengths, we are using BLP framework to establish our competitiveness, B means build, leverage means -- and L means leverage and P means [ pun ]. So we can certainly leverage our existing market leadership in PCs. So we design and manufacture our devices [ in costs ], so we can build a personal foundation model into HPC through our model or compression technology to perform AI referencing the device.
So -- and also with our large scale, so it's easy for us to build a natural platform together all AI apps or ecosystem similar to Apple Store. So all these are our existing strengths to leverage. But so meanwhile, we are partnering with key leaders in the AI area to access critical technologies and the suppliers created the most robust ecosystem. So already, we have built strong allies with NVIDIA, Microsoft, AMD, Qualcomm, Intel.
But definitely, the most important part, so we understand this web AI revolution is not limited to current technologies [indiscernible] part. We are not satisfied with just the successfully integrating others' innovation and components, as they don't guarantee our future success. So we must build our own IPs, starting from the first-generation AI PC part -- that eventually transition into our personal [ AI team ] vision.
So actually, following our AI PC initial definition of [indiscernible] [ MEMS ] features. So our personal intelligent agent using natural language user in the past, compress the local large language model, heterogeneous computing with CPU, GPU MPU, privacy security protection and rich AI application ecosystem. So in each of these domains, so we are doing innovation work, make breakthroughs, create our unique advantages.
So for example, with our model of compression and the enhancement technology, our large language model, our influencing framework can save [ 38% ] memory versus before optimization on both Intel and AMD platform. So another example is our resource aware, workload schedule, which can optimize heterogeneous XPU management.
Similarly, so in infrastructure, we are doing this BLP as well. So that's -- what I want to talk with you first. So probably, Luca, you can talk about the price -- the market share as such.",530
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2024",2024-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3513.0,3039217.0,110813626.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,7,"Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Yuanqing. So I will not talk again about the AI PC. I think you have been explaining it in a very good way. So the other 2 things were ASP, and I think there will be -- we expect there will be a 1-digit percentage, mid- to high 1 digit increase of ASP for the AI PC given the richer configuration.
In regards of the margin, we remain very confident to deliver industry-leading margin also on AI PC, and we have the plan to expand those margins towards attached services. And like Yuanqing was mentioning, also leveraging certain unique IPs that we are building over time, and we want to use to differentiate our offering from our competitors.
In regards of our NA business, I think I can just say, it's healthy, doing very well. Last quarter alone, we had a revenue growth of 23%, I think. And looking at our activation share, which we used to measure our competitiveness without giving confidential that I can tell you that we have gained 2 points to 3 points of activation share since the pre-COVID period benchmark, which we normally use. So I think we are confident and committed to this important market. Thank you.",208

So I think our strategy is working. We have a diversified portfolio of servers, storage, software and services. So as you saw, we were able now to, I think, put the worst behind us and grow 24% quarter-to-quarter for the second straight quarter. And our ODM plus model is enabling us to balance revenue scale at the cloud providers with profitable growth in ESMB. So we saw 34% quarter-to-quarter growth in cloud and 11% quarter-to-quarter growth in ESMB.
And our profit drivers, specifically around storage, software and services was able to grow 36% year-to-year. And you heard YY talk about that hitting an all-time high of $1 billion. So I think most importantly, is the market shift to AI infrastructure. So AI servers are expected to grow 2x the market in 2024. And we have now climbed from the #6 provider of AI server and storage in 2020 to become the #3 provider in 2023, up until now with 50% year-to-year growth and a 20-point premium in the market.
So as we look forward, we'll be time to market with all the major GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, AMD. We've already driven $2 billion in AI infrastructure. We're tracking over a $2 billion pipeline. And we've signed another $1 billion cloud customer that will be shipping later this year. So I think AI server is definitely, where the market is driving, and we'll be well positioned to recover further in both revenue and margin and are expecting to see year-to-year growth in the current quarter. Thank you.",257

Thank you for the question. So we are starting to ship AI PCs in the first half of 2024, and our product portfolio will expand towards the second half of '24 and then in '25. There will be several generations of AI PC with evolutionary and more sophisticated feature going forward. We are confident that Lenovo will have the broadest and most competitive AI PC offering in the industry. So we do not expect a very significant mix of AI PC in 2024, given the time of availability of the product. But it will grow gradually, particularly in the second half and then towards '25 and '26, where we expect it will go up to 60% of the mix.
I also want to note that the definition of AI PC probably will further evolve going forward. So we will be able to give a more precise guidance of the mix, which is probably not possible today. Thank you.",159

So far, I think the China market, we're seeing recovery in the business, driven by both cloud and ESMB. We've also, this last year, launched our Wentian product offering, which is a specific product designed in China for China, and we're seeing tremendous growth on that for both cloud and the ESMB business.
If you look at our geographic mix, I would say, as you saw, we grew double digit quarter-on-quarter in both ESMB and cloud. And we're confident given the design wins we have for next-generation AI solutions that we'll see strong growth for both ESMB and cloud, as we go into 2024 throughout the year. I guess, the most important indicator for you is the $2 billion of AI pipeline that we have and the 50% year-to-year growth we've seen in AI infrastructure through the first half of 2023, which is what's publicly announced from IDC. And again, we have confidence that we'll be time to market in all the next-generation AI GPUs, as they go into the middle of the year and hit major shows like NVIDIA's GTC, so that gives us confidence in the growth.
Lastly, storage, again, we've become #1 in entry storage and #3 overall. That's a growth from #11 just a few years ago, and we're still seeing 48% year-to-year growth. So the [ 3 S ] of storage, software and services is growing significantly and will help our profit recovery. So our goal is to continue to grow premium to market, while increasing our profit, as we go through our next fiscal year. Thank you.",264

So the overall market is growing double digit, around 10%. The AI market should grow [ about ] double that. We've already announced, and IDC has confirmed that we went from #6 to #3 in AI server, and we publicly stated we're driving over $2 billion now annually in AI infrastructure revenue. We're seeing tremendous growth in our AI innovators program. We invested $1.2 billion of the company a few years ago and another $1 billion commitment recently.
So these 4 AI innovation centers have driven 165 AI solutions, and we have now more than 80 AI-ready infrastructure platforms in the market. So as I said, as you look forward, we have more than a $2 billion AI pipeline now globally. And we've recently signed another $1 billion customer for our AI solutions that we'll be shipping over the next year.
And then lastly, again, we're time to market on all the next-generation platforms. As an example, we've been Microsoft and NVIDIA's exclusive partner for the OVX Cloud in the Microsoft Azure Cloud, is just as one example. So hopefully, that's helpful for you.",185

So I believe that, obviously, a lot of the growth up until now has been driven by large language models, and we're seeing a more balanced portfolio, as we go through the calendar year to include a number of inferencing servers, as well as general purpose servers. So as you know, a lot of the data is moving to the edge, and we believe you should move AI to where the data is.
So one of the fastest-growing parts of the business is general purpose ThinkEdge servers at the edge because 75% of data in the future will be computed at the edge. And I think we all know data has been doubling over the next 3 years or so. So we've had 12% year-to-year growth in the edge general purpose servers with 11 consecutive quarters of year-to-year growth there.
We also see strong demand in high-performance computing. We're selling 1 of 3 of the world's top 500 supercomputers, and our Neptune technology is the most sustainable technology in the world. So as people worry about energy efficiency, we've seen tremendous growth in our leadership position in the top 500 in HPC as well. So the simple answer to your question is we'll have a more balanced view going forward of inferencing servers, large language models and general purpose servers because general purpose servers is somewhat stalled, while people were spending their money over the last quarter or 2 on large language models. Thank you.",246

I think I'll take this question. And obviously, we have the intent to continue to drive our profitability to the high-end of a range of pre-COVID and even beyond that as you saw. There are several rationales to be able to do this and higher ASP as the market and also Lenovo is shifting towards a more premium segment, we plan to increase our share in premium and commercial. AI PC will be -- will help, ASP will help richer configuration. I mentioned before, adjacencies, services, software, and then we have probably a unique, strong competence in what I call design-to-cost given our leadership in R&D and innovation.
Now commodity costs up and down, like you mentioned, is that, to be honest, it's a normal trend in the industry. And I think we will be competitive in the market with our offering. So we are confident we are able to mitigate that sector. Thank you.",156

So I think as YY said, we have a build partner leverage model. I think our relationships with some of the largest networking companies in the world globally as well as in China has never been stronger. And this is just continuously strengthening our relationship with those powerhouses, as we deliver integrated solutions. A lot more of our business is being sold at the rack level, both for AI and high-performance computing, and we've got very strong partnerships in the industry to address that.
In addition, I would say, telco networking and network function virtualization is one of our fastest-growing businesses. In fact, I'm leaving for Mobile World Congress, where next week, you'll see some significant announcements with some of the world's largest telcos and Lenovo to expand our relationships around radio access networks, Open RAN and NFV going forward. So I think we have a great strategy with build partner leverage, and we're confident in our future strategy there. Thank you.",163

Thank you, YY. So a couple of things, right? First of all, if we look at the Solutions & Services Group result in Q3, I think we are very encouraged by the results. It is a record revenue quarter of over $2 billion, and at the same time, growing faster to the market and also maintain a relatively high margin, right? So we definitely see a continuous momentum in our Solutions & Services business.
When we look at the demand from our customer, we see a couple of things. One is definitely as a service, continue to be a big sought after from our customers. In Q3, in addition to the financial results that we have achieved, we've also seen a very strong double-digit year-to-year growth in terms of total contract value that we have signed across device as a service and also infrastructure as a service.
The second thing is definitely AI. This has continued to be the -- the buzz work in the market and a very strong demand from our customer. And we strongly believe our pocket to cloud portfolio, including AI devices, AI infrastructure, and of course, AI solutions and services has a unique advantage across our Lenovo portfolio, right?
So with regard to AI, there are 2 things that we are working on and also see strong demand from our customer. One is how can we use AI in enhancing our offerings, right? One of the example is the care of one platform, which is a Gen AI-powered service orchestration platform to uplift our managed services to deliver a higher customer satisfaction and also another level of productivity for our customer, right? So this is about AI enabled services.
The other thing, as YY mentioned, on one hand, AI is super powerful, right? Every of our customers asking a lot of questions around it. However, it is not as simple as it should be, right? So there's a lot of demand for a company like us for Lenovo, where, who is a trusted partner of our customer to help them to understand the technology and also to come up with the optimal AI strategy and offering to achieve the [ desired outcome ].
There are a couple of examples, for example, in Q3, we delivered an AI and they both light out warehouse for a major Asia logistics company to help them to significantly improve their productivity. The other example is, we have worked with a couple of automotive companies around the world to help them to implement the AI-enhanced enterprise digital twins, right. So all these are some of the highlights and also momentum that we have seen across our portfolio from hardware, software and services. So in a nutshell, I think we continue to see a strong momentum in our business, and we are confident that our Solutions & Services business will continue to grow faster than the market in the foreseeable future. So, thank you.",494

So we are seeing -- I mean, we are seeing growth overall in the business [ 21% ] last quarter. Our activations record since acquisition. We are growing in geographies. We are growing segments like B2B, what's driving a better premium mix. And we are also seeing sustainable growth on [indiscernible] edge and foldable devices.
This segment, 18 months ago, used to represent 3% to 4% of our sales last quarter, 25%. It's driven by growth in many Asia markets, Europe and in North America, especially on foldable. In foldable, we achieved 10% of the global market share, [ 40% ] in North America, 12x year-over-year from a small base, but 86% quarter-over-quarter.
And we are seeing a very high NPS scores from users. So we expect this to continue and sustain a number of growth in the near future. And of course, we will have some AI announcements come in the next 3 month to 6 months that we build upon our premium strategy.",170

It's Wai Ming here. Our dividend policy is about, I think, payment out of 30% to 35% approximately. I think of the earnings. I mean, obviously, we also adjusted for some non-cash items, so that we would want to achieve a balance between cash flow, as well as reward to our shareholders. There is no -- I think this dividend policy, I think, has been consistent. And we probably will want to, I think, stick with it.
I think obviously, when there are, I think, issues that actually one-time issue impacting the company -- impacting the company performance, we will take that into consideration, as to whether we strictly adhere to that 30%, 35%. All our objective is to want to return to shareholders, I think, in line with the performance of the company. Thank you.",141

And the next question is coming from Morgan Stanley's Howard. For AI servers, do you think customers want CPU and GPU solutions from the same vendor, which may result in better performance?

Good question. So we will be delivering choice in both CPU and GPU architecture, as we're seeing demand for all those different combinations in the market, depending on which vertical market and workload. So as we move forward into the new year, you should expect us to fully support the next-generation Intel, AMD and ARM CPU, as well as next-generation Intel, AMD and NVIDIA GPU solutions, as well as localized products in the China market and in various other markets in the world, where there's new innovation happening.
I would say that we're seeing strong demand across our AI innovators program with over 160 AI solutions on frameworks like Open Vino, which can take advantage of just using a CPU as well because the number of parameters that can be used even within a general purpose CPU architecture is growing significantly year-on-year as well. So I think we're getting good exposure to that with the number of ISVs, now over 50 ISVs that are partnering with Lenovo to deliver optimized solutions. Thank you.",174

And the next question is the -- it's -- thanks to [ Jeffrey Kwong ] from BNP. Can you share more about Lenovo's PC blended ASP trend since the AI PC impact was small. Could you quantify the impact from other major drivers such as commercial mix improvement? And how sustainable is this trend going into your fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025?",67
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2024",2024-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3513.0,3039217.0,110813663.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,44,"Sure. I'll probably take this one, Jenny. Thank you. So our ASP -- blended ASP is growing sequentially this quarter. It was also growing sequentially last quarter from the previous quarter. So that is the trend. Now the components of the increase of our ASP is twofold, is one, on the one hand, you have a better commercial and premium mix. So a combination of the 2. And the other one is the non-PC portion of it, meaning the agency services, software, things that come attached with the device. And we have done pretty well. If I look at pre-COVID versus today, you have almost up to $100 improvement of the total ASP.
I think going forward, obviously, with an inflationary component cost environment, the ASP probably will continue to go up. And with AI PC, as we mentioned, it should also go up. So I think the trend is and will be sustainable, definitely in 2024. And I think I have no reason to believe that it will not be in 2025 unless there is a different deflationary commodity cost environment, which I don't think is the case for what we can see today.

So today, we are pleased to report that since resuming year-on-year revenue growth and quarter-to-quarter profitability improvement in last quarter. We have accelerated this momentum further in the fourth quarter. We have successfully navigated the industry downturn and move faster to capture the tremendous hybrid AI opportunity. We are optimistic about the outlook of the new fiscal year. Let me start with the strong performance of our first quarter. We accelerated revenue growth across all of our businesses, driving group revenue to increase almost 10% year-on-year and the net income to double year-on-year. Fueled by our diversified growth engines, our non-PC revenue mix reached a historical high of almost 45%. Last quarter, the PC and the smartphone markets have already returned to growth. Meanwhile, hybrid AI is driving greater demand for hybrid infrastructure. Customers are increasingly asking for customized AI solutions and services, particularly consulting, design, deployment and maintenance of AI. With our persistent commitment to investment in innovation, the Nova is well prepared to lead in the hybrid AI era. We are confident to realize our vision of smart AI for all, while driving sustainable growth for our business. Now I will talk about each of our businesses in the fourth quarter. First is our SSD, Solutions and Services group. We continue to strengthen its position as both our growth engine and the profit contributor by delivering double-digit year-on-year revenue growth and higher more than 20% profitability. We expanded the managed service and the projects and solutions service with their combined revenue mix growing 5 points year-on-year to account for 55% of SSG's total business. In particular, our hero offerings such as digital workplace solutions, hybrid cloud have delivered a rapid growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to meet increasing customer demand by moving faster to build AI native and embedded solutions and services. For our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG, we achieved double-digit year-on-year revenue growth, as we forecasted last quarter. While profitability was still under pressure. We achieved the hyper growth of storage, software and services businesses. The combined revenue of which increased more than 50% year-on-year. Looking ahead, AI servers are expected to grow twice as fast as the broad server market. At Lenovo, we will capture these growth opportunities, by building our broad portfolio and converting our extensive pipeline to revenue. By leveraging our strength, we will also capture steady growth opportunities in traditional service, storage, software and services. And we have a solid plan in place to drive the business return to profitability, shortly. Our Intelligent Devices Group, or IDG, continued to deliver a solid quarter for PC. We strengthened our global market leadership with a significant [premium] to the market while maintaining industry-leading profitability. We were #1 in 4 out of 5 geographies, and achieved a record high market share in North America as well. 
Our smartphone business delivered another remarkable quarter with double-digit growth in shipment and revenue with a substantial premium to the market. Looking ahead, we expect the total volume of the PC market to recover to higher than pre-COVID levels, with the smartphone market already returning to double-digit year-on-year hyper growth. Lenovo is provided with ample room for growth. We are particularly excited about the huge growth opportunities brought by AI devices. Starting from AI PC, which is in our definition equipped with a personal AI agent with natural language interface, heterogeneous computing, including CPU, GPU, MPU. And also, we can help users to build themselves, personal knowledge base and should be connected to our open AI application ecosystem. 
And the last but not least, so we will have strict privacy on the security protection mechanism. We expect in the next 3 years, AI PC will gradually grow from premium to mainstream segment, driving a new refresh cycle in the PC market. We strongly believe most consumers of PC. The next PC will be AI PC or we should say AI PC will drive next round of the PC replacement. We are also gradually expanding from AI PC to AI phone and AI tablet, while building seamless collaboration among devices. Last month, we announced a new partnership with Meta in mixed reality, and we expect more such collaborations to come. 
Lastly, let me also briefly cover our full year performance. First with various headwinds in the macro environment, global revenue and profit declined year-on-year. But if we take a closer look -- starting from the third quarter, we have already achieved year-on-year revenue growth, and began to recover net margin from a year-on-year decline in the first half to flat in the second half of the fiscal year. Last year, we increased our R&D investment focusing on our anchor technologies of AI and computing. 
Our R&D expense to revenue ratio, R&D head count and as a percentage or achieved record highs. Our SSG delivered solid revenue growth and a higher -- more than 20% operating margin. For ISG, while we saw full year revenue decline year-on-year, we achieved the quarter-to-quarter growth for 3 consecutive quarters. Our IDG overcome the challenges of our weaker-than-expected market and delivered a resilient profitability. Our PC tablet and smartphones businesses all successfully resumed growth for the second half of the fiscal year. Entering the new fiscal year, we are determined to leverage the unprecedented opportunities of hybrid AI to accelerate the growth of our three businesses supported by our continued investment in innovation, full stack portfolio, resilient operations and ecosystem partnerships. We have full confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and the profitability improvement. Thank you.

Now I will now take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance for our quarter 4 in fiscal year 2024. So in quarter 4, the group benefited from better-than-expected demand and achieved several new milestones. Group revenue grew by 9.5% and net profit more than doubled, boosted by consistent strength across all three business groups. Despite the setback in business performance in the early part of the year, the group doubled down on its investment in hybrid AI to unlock growth opportunities, while boosting its profitability. 
Gross margin reached second highest level in the fourth fiscal quarter at 17.6%. The non-PC business made up a record high of nearly 45% of the combined revenue of the three business group, showcasing our success in building a diversified growth engine. SSG delivered its record fourth quarter revenue and boosted a 20% year-on-year profit growth. IDG segment profit increased by 17% year-on-year, fueled by operational excellence and profitable and fast-growing premium segments. ISG regained strong revenue momentum, delivering a 15% year-to-year increase, thanks to a strong recovery in cloud customer demand, and expanded generative AI portfolio and record sales across storage, software and services. ISG profitability was tended by market transition, but timely initiatives are in place to drive future improvements. 
The group recorded a onetime noncash accounting gain of $143 million from the fair value assessment of a put option liability. This gain was largely offset by restructuring and other charges totaling $132 million. Those charges resulted from various measures to further enhance the group's efficiency and competitiveness. For the fiscal year 2024, the group successfully navigated through a dynamic market environment marked by shifting demand and technology trends. The challenges experienced in the first half -- in the first half year weighted heavily on the gross full year's number, resulting in an 8% decline in revenue and a 37% decline in profit, attributable to equity holders. Nevertheless, with rising investment to drive innovations, including AI, the group full year gross margin rose to an all-time high, thanks to strong R&D investment with R&D expenses to revenue ratio reaching a record high at 3.6% for the full year. 
By seizing the market opportunities through its operational efficiency excellence, the gross revenue growth recovered swiftly with a 6% year-to-year increase in the second half of the year. SSG. Spear had the group service-led transformation and deliver multiple revenue and profit records for the third consecutive quarter, helping the group to transcend the market cycle. SSG segment profit rose 11% year-on-year, represent 35% of the combined segment profit across the 3 business groups. ISG revenue declined 9% year-on-year amid sector-wide changes early in the year, including a demand shift towards AI, but quickly regain this momentum in Q4. IDG made further market share gains in the PC and smartphone sectors bolstering this profitability. Segment profitability remained high within the upper range of its historical trend, demonstrating its resilience and agility. Basic EPS came in at USD 0.0841 Today, the Board declared a final dividend of HKD 0.30 per share, taking into account the interim dividend of HKD 0.08 per share, total dividend for fiscal year '24 will be HKD 0.38 share. 
The group efforts to optimize operational efficiency help shorten the cash conversion cycle to negative 4 days for the full year. Days of account receivable and inventory together improved by 12 days year-on-year, offsetting the lower accounts payable days. The group robust free cash flow also facilitated continued R&D investment. 
Lastly, total borrowings reduced due to strong working capital management and the full [indiscernible] of our 2024 convertible Board. SSG has once again achieved record high revenue performance for both the fiscal year and Q4. Its full year revenue and operating profit grew 12% and 11% year-on-year, respectively. The contribution from SSG to the three business group combined profit reached a historic high, underscoring its pivotal role as the group primary profit driver. SSG maintained its growth momentum in the fourth fiscal quarter, delivering double-digit year-on-year revenue growth for the 12th consecutive quarter. 
The Pay-as-You-Go TruScale services continue to gain traction and posted double-digit year-on-year growth in contract signings. The fourth fiscal quarter also saw the signing of device service megadeal as the largest win to date for digital workplace service. During the year, SSG won its largest Infrastructure as a Service build on extensive partner ecosystem as well as its largest asset recovering service on superior data security assurance. SSG is actively leveraging AI to enrich its service portfolio to meet the evolving needs of its customers. Two notable additions to the portfolio are AI discover and AI fast start, which are AI native services aimed at helping customers to deploy AI technologies securely and efficiently in a hybrid environment. 
ISG achieved its second highest annual revenue despite a 9% year-on-year decline, due to a shift in global IT budgets away from traditional general-purpose computing. Revenue in the fourth quarter -- in the fourth fiscal quarter, rebounded by 50% year-on-year, achieving a new quarter 4 revenue record and 3 consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter growth. 
Additionally, New sales records were achieved in multiple segments and products, including storage, software, services, high-performing computing and edge. However, ISG investment for premium to market growth and the slower transition to DDR5 based systems had a lingering impact on its bottom line, resulting in a full year segment loss. Nonetheless, ISG return to profitability plan and laid out strong initiative to drive profitable growth once again to capture the opportunities reflected in its AI pipeline of more than $7 billion ISG announced more than 10 new large language model AI products, including 9 MVDCGPU-based systems and several MI 300 base systems. These products are equipped with air and liquid cool solutions, utilizing our award-winning Neptune technology and build of over 80 AI optimized products already in the market. Additionally, the transition to new V3 systems is now aggressively accelerating with other new products and new partners go-to-market offerings. 
Finally, ISG is focused on expense and operational efficiency to further drive improved profitability. IDG ended the year with a 7% year-on-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by solid premium to market growth. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-to-year year-on-year quarterly revenue growth, indicating a much stronger performance in the second half of the year despite a 10% decline for the full year. 
OPM reached 7.1% for the full year and 7.4% for the fourth quarter up 64 basis points year-on-year and close to historic peak level, thanks to the operational efficiency, operational excellence and higher premium mix for the fourth quarter. IDG is aiming to take the lead in the ongoing AIPC revolution. We mark the turning point for the industry, creating opportunities for strengthening IDG's leading position. IDG is committed to AI PC innovations not only for its hardware development, but also in areas of proprietary software and components to drive product differentiation. 
Smartphone continued to shine with strong double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by notable premium to market growth, particularly in the EMEA region and Asia Pacific region. The strong performance of our smartphone business is also a result of the continued effort to enable our product portfolio with focus on premium models such as our affordable [indiscernible]. The group efforts for environmental sustainability have been well recognized for the fifth consecutive year, the group has been acknowledged by CDP for our leadership in climate change. Additionally, our Neptune liquid cooling technology designed to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint, has been awarded the best green energy product by CRN sustainability [indiscernible]. Adding to our list of achievement was the gold rating awarded by [indiscernible] for our sustainability performance, placing us among the top 3% of all companies rated by [indiscernible]. 
These track records are a testament to the group's ongoing pursuit of excellence in product design innovation and dedication to environmental sustainability. Hybrid AI presents a significant and unique opportunity for the group to supercharge growth, R&D investment will be made to unlock the full potential of hybrid AI and build focus to cloud capabilities. The robust innovation efforts seen across the 3 business groups will enhance the group's competitiveness in the next-generation product design and solutions. This will in turn, drive profitable growth and support the group in achieving our medium-term profitability target. 
Looking ahead, SSG will roll out its new AI native services and embedded AI functions, across its service offerings, to address enterprise customers' growing demand for AI technologies. Concurrently, SSG will focus on safeguarding its core business with high value-added support services across both PC and infrastructure segments, through collaborating with ecosystem partners SSG is well positioned to help customers accelerate their digital transformation journey and further enhance its financial contribution to the group. 
ISG aim to drive growth with continuously improving profitability, leveraging its investment in differentiated technology solutions in hybrid AI, high-performance computing, storage and edge systems and solutions. The business segment will further diversify its customer base, acquire new accounts and strike a balance between general purpose system to drive profit and customize cloud offerings to drive scale and overall synergies and efficiency. This approach will ensure scalability, cost efficiency and optimization of revenue growth and profitability. AIPC is about to kickstart new demand cycle for products with premium pricing and attractive features for commercial users. This is critical for IDG to drive premium to market growth, higher ASP and sustainable profitability. 
To answer this demand, IDG is developing its own IPs for better performance in areas such as influencing speed, language model compression and memory consumption. IDG is also extending its differentiation efforts beyond hardware to components and software. Notably, with the introduction of Lenovo AI core chip, [indiscernible] security solution and an AI now personal assistants. IDG is in a strong position to build competitive advantages and lead the AI PC revolution. 
Finally, as always, we will stay committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability improvement for our shareholders. Thank you. Now we will take your questions.",1677

I have two questions. One is about the AI PC. So I think we just see the copilot plus PC launched, I think, a few days ago and which is quite different versus the PC we saw in the CES. So my question is, do you think we have the required software and hardware to -- or the chip to stimulate the growth of the AI PC market? It seems the first half is relatively weak. And I think I asked the question before. So what's your expectation on the ARM-based PC percentage for next year? this is first question.",107

I think the second question is about the server business. I think we saw a very fantastic result about immediate this morning. So -- and -- but we saw that they do more and more on the server market. So from a chip vendors, it seems to start to evolve into the system design, and evolve into more like including -- used to be your stress point. So when the sale market grows so strong, what's your view? Can you can share more -- share the growth of this market and more [indiscernible] from this growth?",99
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2024 Earnings Call, May 23, 2024",2024-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3773.0,3139876.0,112969314.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,7,"So I'll start with your AI PC question, which gives me the opportunity to talk a little bit about AI PC and Lenovo Vision on AI PC. So we are very excited on this week announcement from Microsoft, and you probably saw we have also devoted two of our platforms with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite CPU and within its copilots, but I would say that is just the beginning. AI PC as you know, has been defined by IDC, the generic industry definition with a PC that contains an NPU, but we are bringing maybe a more sophisticated narrative with our own five pillars, AI PC definition, which includes your PC should have an AI agent with the capability of natural language interface, your PC should have a personal knowledge base to better know you, is not only about NPU, but it's more about an intergeneous combination of CPU, GPU and NPU, AI app ecosystem and privacy and security. So I believe that AI PC is at the infancy and many more applications that today we even do not imagine are coming to the market in probably not only in '24, but more in '25 and '26. So we are at the beginning of this cycle. So that helps me to respond to you that we believe this will be a tailwind for the PC industry, started this year. 
We have already started to ship AI PC with the original AI PC -- IDC definition, but we are going -- is going to accelerate in the second half, and then '25 and '26 will be strong years. So yes, I think the combination of new architecture plus copilot plus Lenovo is -- will also add our own IPs. For example, we will have AI now in China, we have already launched called [indiscernible]. It will be an agent that will coexist with CoPilot plus, and we believe this will be a significant differentiator. So we are optimistic about the adoption of AI PC going forward. 
Your second question was about ARM. And I think we are also optimistic about the evolution of ARM. I think we are happy to see there will be a X86 world and arm world. And definitely, we'll see going forward, which one will have the better performance, but definitely as the advantages thermal battery life, several advantages. X86, I believe, Intel and AMD are also striking to get more performance with less battery consumption. So I think will be an interesting race among the two. Thank you.",424
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2024 Earnings Call, May 23, 2024",2024-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3773.0,3139876.0,112969315.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,8,"And regarding AI in the infrastructure, I would say our strategy is working. We've grown from #6 to #3.  In -- as an AI infrastructure global vendor over the last few years as reported by IDC. This strategy started back, if you remember, even in 2018, we won AI server of the year, from HPC wire. So this is something that's not new to Lenovo. But we invested $2.2 billion to create 4 AI innovation centers around the world, now delivering over 80 products and over 165 AI optimized solutions, for example, running every Kroger store in the United States, over 3,000 grocery stores to help eliminate theft that their self-checkouts, for example. 
What's exciting for us about AI is going to grow twice the rate of the general server market, but it's also pulling together storage. So while I talked about 50% growth of our 3S, meaning software, storage and services, but actually due to a lot -- due to AI, our storage business grew over 70%, and this is in the last quarter, year-on-year. And we've now become #3 in storage from #13, if you go back a decade ago. So incredibly strong growth in the storage market. There's been a lot of questions about momentum, and then we'll talk about the architecture. 
So just a few things that I don't think we've mentioned publicly yet. Our AI server mix for the second half has crossed 29%. In the fourth quarter, our AI server revenue was up 46%, year-to-year. On-prem and not just cloud is accelerating because we're starting to see not just large language model training, but retraining and inferencing. So we saw triple-digit growth in our enterprise and SMB GPU-based server consumption year-on-year. And our visible qualified pipeline, just since the last quarter, has grown 55% and now to over $7 billion. And to kind of put it in perspective, we were public, I think a few earnings calls ago, that we are the exclusive supplier for NVIDIA and Microsoft Azure cloud on OVX or Omniverse. 
But in total, our L40,/L40S NVIDIA business just since the first half to the second half of the year is up 270%. So these are incredible growth numbers. Now looking forward, and if you go out to the back, we'll be time to market with the next-generation NVIDIA H200 with Grace Blackwell with the NVL 72. So this is going to put a $250,000 server today roughly with 8 GPUs, will now sell in a rack like you're saying up to probably $3 million in a rack. This brings us to Neptune water cooling. We won the CRN and green product of the year, the UN top Choice Award for the green server, because we can deliver 40% lower power by using hot water. And while our competitors are starting to do this for the first time, we've been doing this for 12 years. 
Today, 19 of the top 25 research universities in the world run Lenovo for their supercomputing. And we just got to have Hamburg International Supercomputing where we're running 1 of 3 of the world's supercomputers. Most of those are now running Neptune warm water. DreamWorks, Harvard and some of the largest automotive companies in the world are all now moving to this water cooling technology, because we can do things that I think are incredibly unique in the industry there. So will be time to market, and we're already in high-volume production now on AMD, MI 300x, and will also be time to market on Goudy 3 as well. So I think there's a lot of differentiation and innovation to happen in the water cooling infrastructure. And I think Lenovo is the clear leader and has been winning numerous awards on that.",626

Congratulations on the wonderful results in the last quarter of last year. My first question, I think it's more directed to Kirk. I'm wondering from a geopolitical perspective, what Lenovo is doing on the ground in the U.S. to make sure that we defend our market share regardless of the changes in administrations?",60

So North America is our largest market and actually one of our fastest growing markets, because we're very unique. Over 50% of the world is Tier 1 cloud, 50% is on-prem. So we're almost perfectly balanced in the same way when you look at our earnings so I think we're very geographically dispersed. We're also very excited that as we move to DDR5, our profitability will improve because we've brought all of our designs in-house, starting with the Eagle Stream and Genoa AMD products. So as the market transitions from DDR4 V2 platforms to V3 and V4 that will be announced shortly, all of those designs and those motherboards move into Intel manufacturing, whether that's in China or in Guadalajara. 
So part of the diversity we have is we have 35 factories around the world, and we build in Brazil for Brazil, 97% of what we're building in Europe is for Europe. And 97% of what we build in North America is in North America. So yes, we do have requirements sometimes for customers in different geographies to have manufacturing in certain places, and we've expanded our manufacturing footprint to do that. We were also very proud yesterday to be ranked once again in the top 10 supply chains of all companies in the world by Gartner. So our agility here of putting the factories where the people want them to give speed and velocity is one of the core attributes that I think is getting us to win business.",273

So you mentioned we have a $7 billion pipeline. Can you explain -- is it only AI server-related revenue? Or is it including storage? And in terms of delivery pipeline, are we expecting this revenue to be recognized in the following fiscal year? And in terms of profitability of your business group, what is the cadence towards breaking even and also making profits?",69
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2024 Earnings Call, May 23, 2024",2024-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3773.0,3139876.0,112969320.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,13,"Yes. So the qualified pipeline is GPU server related. So that means that we've identified $7 billion out there of people that are going to make purchases and our job is to go earn that business, so it turns into backlog. So you can just imagine how much as MI 300x has come out and the next-generation NVIDIA CPUs, that's driven to. So that's very exciting. 
On the storage front, our ODM plus model is winning in the market. I'm proud to talk about the fact that we committed to bring in several other billion-dollar class customers. And in this last quarter, we actually have gotten design wins for a new $1 billion-plus order in the server side, which will be a new customer and $1 billion-plus order in the storage side as well in Tier 1 clouds. The profitability goals will be very aggressive, because as we transition to DDR5 solutions, we improve our manufacturing costs. We had some slowdown in the ESMB market, where people were waiting for GPUs, and we're still constrained, as you've heard from pretty much everyone in the industry, but our global capacity of having $50 billion, $60 billion of procurement we believe we're sourcing GPUs as well as anyone in the market. 
So as GPU capacity frees up and now the -- all the analysts and we agree the non-AI ESMB market is coming back to growth, and we'll be growing at a premium to market. The current quarter looks incredibly strong. So I think that gives us confidence going into our new a year, that will be at a significant premium market while improving profitability.",273

So my first question is about IDG. So obviously, IDG has sustained a very good margin. And so as we see that the memory price has been increasing in the past few quarters. So what is it -- will it impact our margin for the outlook for IDG business?",55
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2024 Earnings Call, May 23, 2024",2024-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3773.0,3139876.0,112969323.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,16,"Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the memory cost similar to other commodities has been rising already for probably 2 to 3 quarters. So we -- as you see, we have well managed that. And I think the increase is going to be very moderate going forward, but we are very confident we are going to manage it without impacting our GP margin? My second question is about server business. In our presentation, we mentioned that we have a plan execution to turn profitable for server business. So I want to ask what is our action we have taken or going to take to turn the profit for the server business?",112
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2024 Earnings Call, May 23, 2024",2024-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3773.0,3139876.0,112969324.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,17,"Yes. So again, the main market reason that we turned negative was that the ESMB market slowed down considerably, as people shifted their budgets to AI-based systems. Now for this fiscal year, we're seeing the AI market, the cloud market and the ESMB market all recovering. So that's number one. Number 2 is we have some major new design wins that give us confidence as we go into the second half of the year, that there's significant revenue and profit coming in from that. The third is that we're incentivizing our sales force slightly differently, and we're expecting a significant improvement in sales productivity by leveraging our pocket to cloud offerings. 
So for customers that buy PC, server and storage, there's incremental incentives for them this year through our channel partnerships for them to -- if they've been a ThinkPad customer, for example, for a long time, and they bring on servers for the first time, there's incremental incentives there. And that's a very profitable high-volume part of the business. And then lastly, like I mentioned, I can't underestimate this enough. We made a strategic decision to do our designs in-house, starting with DDR5 based systems. As you know, that transition took probably a year longer than the industry expected. So those factories are ready to go to start building the motherboards for high volume on DDR5. 
So when that happens, our manufacturing gets much, much more efficient and we make more margin, because the motherboards will be designed in-house, the systems at the L10 level and the full rack integration, we're now earning the business. In fact, some of our large cloud customers are actually having Lenovo do the [indiscernible] integration for even our competitor servers when they're dual sourced. So we'll bring in the server from our competitor and actually rack and stack it with the switch and all the cabling and ship it out to the end customer. So think about we get paid for the design of the motherboard. We get paid to license that motherboard to another ODM to provide a second source, but we get paid for that. We're not paying someone else to do that. That we're getting paid for the L10 and we're getting paid for the L11.",376

I'm Ivan Lam from Cantero Research. I have three questions. So the first one is upon the AI. So I think there's a price war coming for the LLM token in China now. So how Lenovo adjusting this competition in the price war? And then because sooner or later, we'll come to the cost part of the AI service. My second question will be like, I think Indian market is also important for Lenovo. And India is asking for the local production for the PC and tablet. So how ready Lenovo is currently for the local production? And the third question is that I think Lenovo just launched a new AI smartphone in China. But given years that Lenovo still like or Motorola still maintaining a minus share. So how Lenovo and Motorola addressing these competition issues in China market? At the same time, in Latam America, and I think Latin America is currently that like Xiaomi, and Techno is like -- it's going quite wide in the region and then how Motorola adjustment there as well?",178

We have Think System, which is our hardware server storage brand. We have ThinkAgile for software defined, and we have ThinkEdge for edge AI. In China this year, we're launching two new brands and have launched two new brands. [indiscernible] which is a new brand built in China for China, will be much more cost effective and enable us to compete at a completely new level relative to the unique competitors that are in China only. And we have an edge brand called [indiscernible], which is also being launched for the Edge AI because remember, 75% of the data is going to be computed at the edge for artificial intelligence, and we're rapidly moving from LLM over to retraining and inference.
I do want to say this has been an incredible month, because we made announcements with Red Hat AI. We just announced a new relationship with NetApp around AI Pod, we announced today at .NEXT or this week at .NEXT, GPT in a box with Nutanix, and we're a Microsoft premier solution at the Edge, for their highest end hyper-converged offering. So every major software vendor, we're the partner of case around AI. And obviously, in China, we'll have the local offerings of that as well. But the difference to your question on China is that we'll have a whole new set of brands that will be uniquely shift in China for China.",250

So you may think about the cloud-based -- the cloud-based large language model, right, or public AI , we call it public AI. So that's why we think future trend is not just the public AI , it's hybrid AI. So that's while with AI PC, AI devices will become more attractive -- right? So definitely yes, public AI. So when they deal with more influencing request. So they will become more expensive. The cost will be more example for those companies. But you -- if you use your AI PC to deal with some personalized use case. So definitely, you -- the cost is very limited. So -- and also -- so definitely, people don't want to contribute all their private data or privacy to the public cloud company.
So why we think in the future, AI will be the hybrid AI. So in some common or public knowledge, public intelligence, you will use the public AI. But for the personalized usage case, so probably you will use private -- private AI which will have some cost advantage. Actually, I know large language models company competitively is very fierce, particularly in China. So they need to find the business model, right, with this kind of public AI. But for sure, for us, we have already had the business model. If we can sell more AI PC, we can make more money. So that's a very simple and easy to understand. 
But for sure, for individual for the consumer is for enterprise customers as well. So for enterprise customers, they don't want to give their IP or private data to the public company [indiscernible] so private. So that will be the trend. So I think [indiscernible] team can help our customers to build the hybrid infrastructure. So based on our Lenovo IT architecture, which we call client edge cloud, networking and intelligence. And [indiscernible] team can help our customer to deal with their data. So leveraging their data to realize the AI in all the value chain. So that will be the Lenovo's approach. We believe the hybrid AI will be the trend. Regarding of the manufacturing, so Lenovo, definitely, we have already had a global footprint. So we not only leverage China's most sophisticated manufacturing capability to manufacture for the world. But also, we have the [indiscernible] printer in almost everywhere in Japan, India, Brazil, Hungary, Mexico [indiscernible], in India to build product, locally -- So definitely we shouldn't comply to the --  if the tariff is higher. So we definitely need to leverage the local manufacturer to reduce the tariff, et cetera, et cetera. But regarding of the phone, so probably [indiscernible] is your question.",455

Last year, 8 to 10-point premium to market. If you look second half, double of that. Last quarter, we grew in [indiscernible]. Latin America that you mentioned, yes, 1%, North America 12%, Europe, 72%; Asia, 134% and China at 31%. I think the competition in Latin America is not different. I think our share has been stable, the growth you are mentioning is coming mostly from 4G and from other vendors. We see still a lot of opportunity in Latin America to improve our mix. Our mix -- our premium mix as we reported, has grown from 13% 2 years ago to 17%. This quarter, we expect to be more than 25%. I think we have a structured plan to continue growing double-digit premium to market, faster in Asia and Europe as we announced in the beginning of the year, because our market share is a little smaller, but they are continue to grow in North America and Latin America. There are some other data that if you look like [indiscernible] in North America, our share of June last year was close to 20%. 
Last month, we hit the 82%, the highest we ever had. Last month, we are #1 in prepaid. So we still see growth, of course, faster in Europe and Asia. China is an important market, not less important. We need to succeed in China. We started accelerating Asia and Europe, but not -- we just launched AI mobile in China. We are collaborating a lot on one UI with the PC and other IoT. So we expect with now AI come in place -- there will be some opportunities to disrupt in China. But most of the growth next year is going to come from Europe and Asia, some growth in Latin America, in North America and China still grow not as fast as the other [regions].",322

Let's now move to the Q&A our webcast audience. We have questions from Jeffrey, Mr. Colin Amira. For SSG, you mentioned AI workloads will run on a combinations of public cloud and on premises, and also on the edge and on the design. What kind of investments does the Lenovo need to make in products and starting to be able to offer a total solution offering?",77

Thank you, Jeffrey. This is a good question, right? So let me give you a holistic update, right? So if you look at SSG, as [indiscernible] mentioned, we are -- we continue to see strong momentum in our business. If you look at our revenue growth, this is the 11th consecutive quarter of revenue year-to-year growth. and at the same time, at a healthy margin of 20%. So this is another great quarter of SSG. Now if you look at our conversation with our customer, I think almost all of our conversation with our customers is actually around AI, right? 
And I can add some data points and share the team here. I think our customer is telling us that of our customers strongly believe AI is going to create a very positive impact for the business. And then another data point is 96% of our customer is going to double down their investment on AI-related items, from infrastructure to devices to software and solutions, right? So there's a lot of demand from around AI. However, the maturity of our customer in terms of IT setup is quite different, right? 
Some of them are more mature, some of them need more help. I think this is exactly the opportunity not just for SSG, right, but also for the overall Lenovo because we have the whole portfolio from pocket to the S to the cloud software and solution. So the SSG strategy has been two-pronged. One is we have plug-and-play solution we call hero building block that are readily available for our customer who know what exactly they want. For example, our digital workplace solution, hybrid cloud solution and our sustainable solution, right? So this is first one. 
The second one is we just set up an AI practice, which is a team of people who have consultants, data scientists and also experts in building infrastructure, especially for AI workload to help our customer to look at their overall IT readiness, right, and hence, to explore what kind of AI solutions are more suitable and create a better outcome for our customer, right? As mentioned, I think before you can harness the full part of AI, you've got to make sure you have the right new IT, right? 
My knowledge is you can buy a great super car, if you have no petroleum, the car doesn't work. That's why you need data for AI, right? So this is the work that we have been doing. Now I'll give you one example. This is a real customer example that we just done, right? So we have been working with one of the leading logistics customer in Asia on AI solution, right? So we go through the AI discovery, the MVP, the scaling and then the enhanced cycle, where we help them to implement one of the state of the art AI power logistics center, right, we significantly the efficiency and also capacity of the logistics center of that customer. So we build one warehouse with them, and they are very happy. 
And now we are engaging with them to build the second and the third warehouses, right? And these kind of solutions are very replicable and scalable. Last but not least, I think Kirk has a very good program. It's called the Lenovo AI innovative program, right? This program, it's about how can we work with and get access to the best AI solution provider on the planet, right? Most of these are very good in AI solutions but they might not have the scale to reach to the global customer. They might not have the full stack of hardware, software and solution that's needed to bring to some of the big locultural customer. So our program is to work with these AI solution provider and bring it to our customer. And the example that I just mentioned, the logistic company in Asia is one of the solutions from our AI innovator members of that program. To give you a number today, we have 50 AI innovative program members certified. And altogether, there are -- the last time we counted -- 150 solution, AI solution, right, that are certified by Lenovo supplier -- Trusted supplier program, and readily available for SSG to bring to our customer. Thank you.",717

So actually, this year is Lenovo's 40 years anniversary. So almost in almost 40 years of history, almost every 10 years, every decade. So we have a different set. So the first decade. So we probably only distribute the other brand. So second, we build our brand with our PC business. Third, we become the global international companies through the acquisition of [indiscernible], then the fourth, we become very diversified the business company. So as I just introduced now with 10 years -- 10 years ago, Lenovo was just a PC company. But now 45% of our business comes from non-PC business or business groups. 
So we are starting our fifth decade. We think the theme of this decade will be AI. We think AI will transform all our businesses. So AI devices, AI infrastructure and the AI embedded solution and the services. So I always say, so working in this industry is our fortune. So every day, you can see the innovation, you can see the different things. You can see the potential of the growth. So definitely, I believe Lenovo, we will catch up this opportunity to become a strong AI player in the world. Thank you.",207
