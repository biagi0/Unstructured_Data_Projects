410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3862.0,2237527.0,86852809.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss yet another record-breaking quarter. Our innovative product portfolio and operational excellence drove growth across all businesses, and our transformation investments are paying off. 
For the second straight quarter, we achieved a hyper growth in both revenue and profit. Our group revenue grew over 22% year-on-year, reaching USD 17.2 billion. This new record is $2.7 billion higher than the previous one we achieved just last quarter. In fact, profit achieved even stronger growth with pretax income and net income both up over 50% year-on-year, reaching new records. 
Pretax income reached USD 591 million and the net income reached USD 395 million. All of our core businesses delivered both top line and bottom line year-on-year growth. Our record performance starts in our Intelligent Device Group, where PC and Smart devices business delivered another historical quarter. 
Our innovative product portfolio adapted quickly to meet customers' new needs in work, learn and play from home and captured strong demand. Our revenue grew over 26% while pretax income improved 35% year-on-year. And industry-leading profitability further improved to 6.6%, all achieved new records. 
We extended our #1 position in PCs, growing PC volume to historical market share of 25.3%. Our focus in high growth and the premier segments continued to drive double, even triple-digit growth in both revenue and volume. 
We saw strong performance across all geographies. In North America, we achieved almost 60% volume growth year-on-year. In EMEA, we've become #1 in PC for the first time. In Asia Pacific, profitability reached a new record. In China, we also achieved over 30% year-on-year shipment growth. 
For several quarters I have predicted that the total PC shipment will likely reach 300 million units in 2021. Many people thought it's too optimistic. But the latest IDC data has confirmed that the total PC market last year has indeed surpassed 300 million units, driven by strong Q4. Obviously, this proves our view that work, study, play from home has become a new lifestyle. 
So the information consumption upgrade will drive 1 device per person track and expand from just smartphones to also include PCs, tablets. And it will continue to drive the demand of PCs, tablets and smart devices for the long term. 
So looking forward, we will continue to fulfill customers' new needs with innovative products and leverage our operational excellence to capture the strong demand. Meanwhile, our mobile business delivered double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. And not only resumed the profitability since the pandemic, but also achieved a record profit since the Motorola acquisition. 
In Latin America and North America, our stronghold remains solid. Across our expansion markets in Europe and Asia, we had a strong double and triple-digit growth, thanks to expanded carrier relationships and a stronger product mix. Looking forward, we will continue to drive growth with our strong 5G product portfolio. 
Our Data Center Group achieved record revenue of over USD 1.6 billion while improving profitability by almost 1 point year-on-year. Both our Cloud Service Provider and the Enterprise SMB segments delivered year-on-year growth at a [ premier ] to the market. Enterprise SMB reached USD 1 billion in revenue, the highest amount in over 3 years. 
In Storage, we had record revenue and outgrew the market by 11 points. We also had record revenue in Software Defined infrastructure and services. And we extended our #1 position in TOP500 supercomputers to 182 systems. Our TruScale private cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service, combined with SAP's HANA Enterprise Cloud, has been well received and is generating a strong pipeline of demand. 
Lenovo is a unique player providing a full range of IT infrastructure from on-premise Data Center, private cloud, private cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service to public cloud infrastructure. Looking forward, with our strong in-house design and manufacturing capabilities, we will capture the growing hybrid cloud and infrastructure demand and continue to outgrow the market while improving profitability. 
Our Service-led Intelligent Transformation continued to make strong progress as total Software & Service revenue grew almost 36% to a new record of USD 1.4 billion, over 8% of total group revenue. Our Attached Services, Managed Services and Solutions Services achieved year-on-year growth of 26%, 73% and 49%, respectively. 
Device as a Service's total contract value achieved a high double-digit growth of 74% year-on-year. In addition, our e-commerce revenue grew 45% year-on-year and continued to set new records. 
Looking forward, we will further drive Service-led Intelligent Transformation through further driving growth in Managed Service, particularly Device as a Service, and leverage our experience and capabilities to build a solution focusing on smart manufacturing, smart education, smart health care and more. Clearly, 2020 was a challenging year that brought remarkable changes to our world, thanks to our continued innovation, excellent operations and a robust resilience. 
Lenovo quickly responded to the changing market and delivered excellent results. As we prepare for the new fiscal year ahead, we will further align our organization with our strategy and sharpen our execution effective April 1, 2021. We will establish a new business group, SSG, Solutions and Services Group, by integrating all the existing services and solutions teams across the company into a dedicated organization. Thus, the 3 business groups could be fully responsible for the execution of each S in the 3S strategy. 
IDG, Intelligent Device Group, will be led by Luca Rossi, Senior Vice President and the current President of PCSD in EMEA and Latin America, to focus on smarter IoT. ISG, Infrastructure Solutions Group, renamed from Data Center Group, will continue to be led by Kirk Skaugen, Executive Vice President and President of Data Center Group, and drive smart infrastructure. And the newly formed SSG, Solutions and Service Group, will be led by Ken Wong, Senior Vice President and current President of PCSD in Asia Pacific, will be responsible for growing our business in smart vertical and services. 
At the same time, in order to further improve synergies among business groups and build a unified customer-centric interface, we will integrate the existing geo-model structure into 2 sales organizations: China Geo to be led by Liu Zheng, Executive Vice President and Current President of IVG in China; and the international sales organization to be led by Matt Zelinski, Senior Vice President and the current President of PCSD in North America, covering Asia Pacific, EMEA, North America and Latin American Geos. 
The 2 sales organizations will assume the same sales function system and drive integrated go-to-market strategy across all business groups in their respective locations. They will face our customers and partners, unified as One Lenovo. As a result, I believe, we will be able to respond more quickly to customer needs and market demands and further unlock the company's true value. 
Here, I would also like to share another news, Mr. Gianfranco Lanci, President and Chief Operating Officer of Lenovo, will be retiring from the company in September 2021. Gianfranco has been instrumental in our success, growing Lenovo into the undisputed #1 in global PC market in the past decade. His incredible legacy has led much of the foundation for our future growth. During the transition period to September, he will continue to fulfill his responsibilities while ensuring a smooth transition for the future. 
In 2021, with our planned issuing of Chinese depository receipts on Shanghai Stock Exchange, we will also further invest in technology and innovation, driving intelligent transformation across industries and create sustainable growth for our company. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1248

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in 3Q fiscal year 2021. 
Next chart, please. This quarter, the group again set several performing records. We delivered sales growth across geographies and businesses, robust margin, all-time high group revenue and profits and strong cash flow generation. Our Service-led transformation continued to accelerate, and we further enhanced our Service portfolio to build new growth catalysts. 
Our group revenue increased 22% year-on-year to $17.2 billion. PCSD and DCG achieved record sales, while MBG grew its revenue at a double-digit rate. The group's gross margin improved 10 basis points year-on-year and our E to R ratio was reduced by 0.5 percentage point to 12.1%, a result of our operational excellence and optimization in sales mix. 
Software & Services and e-commerce business grew their revenue strongly by 36% and 45% year-on-year, respectively. The high margin rates continue to support our profit trajectory. Our net income grew 53% to an all-time high of $395 million. Record-breaking PCSD profit and consistent profit improvement in MBG and DCG helped in setting this new milestone. The basic earnings per share was USD 0.0331, up 53% from the previous year. 
Next chart, please. In Q3, our cash flow generated from operations improved by $1.425 billion year-on-year to $1.963 billion. Our net debt level was reduced by $735 million year-on-year. The supply dynamics remained a challenge for the sector. Our inventory days increased 4 days year-on-year as we continue to secure critical parts to fulfill strong future demand. Sequentially, inventory days lowered by 5 days quarter-on-quarter, thanks to strong demand. AR days also improved 8 days year-on-year, thanks to improved efficiency in our factoring program. 
Next chart, please. PCSD achieved all-time high revenue and profit. The sector demand was strong and above expectation as supported by lifestyle changes, including 1 PC per person trend and rising usage intensity, leveraging our operational excellence, product innovation and quick time-to-market capabilities to address new demand tailwinds. 
PCSD revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to USD 14 billion in the quarter. Our unique hybrid manufacturing strategy allows us to have greater flexibility and more supply to fulfill strong sector demand. We boosted our share gain to capture 25.3% of global market share and expanded our market share lead to 4.2 points ahead of the #2 player. We also became #1 in EMEA for the first time. 
PCSD further scaled up its high-margin and high-growth segments to drive expansion of pretax margin by more than 40 basis points to a record high of 6.6%. The Thin & Light, Gaming PC, e-commerce and Software & Services business saw double-digit growth and market share gain. Pretax profit increased by 35% year-on-year to $925 million. 
Next chart, please. MBG revenue grew 10% year-on-year, thanks to the team's continued effort in expanding portfolio and carrier ranging. With launch of new 5G models and gaming phones, the group has improved its average selling price by 19% year-on-year, and such product mix improvement helped the business to resume profitability. Its PTI dollar risk USD 10 million and could have improved further if it wasn't for the higher freight costs and industry-wide component shortages. 
The revenue contribution from 5G models now represent more than 10% of MBG revenue, significantly growing from the previous quarter. The business will continue to execute its 5G for all strategy to make 5G more accessible in all prices spectrum while continuing to make important carrier penetration to drive profitable growth. 
Next chart, please. In the third quarter, our DCG achieved record revenue, driven by solid growth across both CSP and ESMB segments. The CSP business continued to capitalize on cloud demand and achieved double-digit revenue growth across regions, except for China, where orders with better profitability were given higher regional priority. 
ESMB business delivered the highest revenue in 3 years, thanks to its record performance in software-defined infrastructure, storage, high-performance computing and services. These high-margin products with higher revenue mix resulted a better profitability profile. 
The DCG business improved its operational result by $14 million year-on-year to a pretax loss of $33 million. The group's efforts in product diversification and development of alternative platforms, the availability of high-end system as well as storage solution have started to pay off. Given our recent design wins for profitable projects and advanced configuration, DCG is on track to drive long-term top line growth and profitability expansion. 
Next chart, please. Our teams are executing well on the Software & Services-led transformation, accelerating our pace further to transitioning into a service model and expanding our Service scope. The Software & Services business, which carries the highest margin profile among all products, reported invoice revenue and deferred revenue growth of 36% and 30% year-on-year, respectively, representing to around 8.1% of the group's revenue. 
Among the 3 key business elements: Managed Service, including Device-as-a-Service, commonly called DaaS, enjoys 73% growth because of strong progress in contract wins globally. Complex Solutions also remains strong and posted 49% growth from all verticals. Attached Service continued to grow steadily, up 26%. 
Next chart, please. Looking forward, the group will continue to leverage its core competence in driving earning growth and business transformation by taking advantage of tailwind opportunities, including e-learning, work-from-home, play-from-home, cloud infrastructure and 5G. We remain optimistic that these long-term structural trends can expand the addressable market for PCSD and cloud infrastructure as well as the accelerated development of 5G services. 
Our PCSD business will leverage our operational excellence and global franchise to increase supply to meet strong segment demand and drive consistent premium to market revenue growth through investment in the high-growth and premium segments. We will continue to build capability to drive sales growth in Software & Services business and extend e-commerce based on our well-established infrastructure. 
For MBG business, the group will further push product innovation and accelerate 5G smartphone launches to strengthen its stronghold markets. MBG will strengthen its competitiveness in target market, grow at a premium to the sector and improve long-term profitability. 
For DCG business, the group aims to deliver premium to market growth and enhance profitability. For our Cloud Service Provider business, the group recent design wins will attract new customers and expand its share with existing accounts by leveraging its unique strength in the global supply chain and worldwide reach and expanding its portfolio with advanced configuration and storage platforms.

First one is on the PCSD business. So congratulations on the continued improvement on the PTI margin in PCSD business. And I wonder how much of it was due to the rising service contribution. And also, how do we see the margin trend going to first half this year, considering there's a lot of the components are -- have a price hike due to supply shortage and DRAM pricing is to further increase in the first half of this year? And how would the margin be affected? 
And my second question will be on Data Center business, that the margin also improved nicely. If I simply compare the margin you have compared to the -- for example, 2 quarters ago or 4 quarters ago that you have a similar revenue scale, the margin has improved. So can we view it as a structural improvement on the overall Data Center business? And how would you project the margin improvement direction going forward?",164
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3862.0,2237527.0,86852814.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,6,"Thank you, Sebastian. So for the first question, I would like to ask my great partner and friend, Gianfranco, to answer this question. Although I want to congratulate him on his retirement this coming September. Unfortunately, he cannot start his retirement life yet. He will still be with us for 2 more earnings cycles as our COO and ensure smooth transition. So Gianfranco, could you answer this first question, then Kirk will answer the second question.",76
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3862.0,2237527.0,86852815.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,7,"No. Yes, we're right. Thanks. Talking about the margin contribution, for sure, there has been growth. I think there are 2 elements when I look at the margin improvement, and one is, for sure, coming from the Service growth. 
The other one, if you look at our numbers, is also coming from better AUR in the sense that despite the growth of Chromebook, despite -- and we have seen AUR going up in consumer and also in SMB and a little bit in e-commerce due to, I would say, a different profile of the demand from customers because we have seen a very strong growth on Gaming and a very strong growth on Thin & Light. We are back to grow on Workstation because we got a very good premium to market in all this growing segment. 
So I think it's -- Service, we have been growing Service 30% to 40% during the last, I don't remember how many quarters, but many quarters. And of course, there is a good contribution for Service, but I would say the major contribution is really coming from a different profile of the business and better average selling price. 
Coming to components, I think it's true there are some components going up with DRAM. But on the other side, the SSD, which is a big portion of our product cost, is still going down, right? So I really don't see for the next 6 to 9 months any major impact coming from components going up. In my opinion, when I look at the PC industry today, the only limitation, but it's not really a margin limitation, it's a growth limitation, can only come or is coming only from supply shortage between IC and Display. 
That -- our last quarter result without this limitation could be -- and I'm not dreaming, could be even better. So we have been able to manage the supply issue very, very well if you look at the results, but we can say that it could be even better without any limitation on the supply. Thank you.",347

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3862.0,2237527.0,86852817.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks, Sebastian. Yes, I think you're correct. We're seeing sustained improved margins in the business, and I think it's driven by a number of factors, consistent with our strategy that remain strong. 
The first is in the Cloud Service Provider market. We're diversifying from servers into storage and winning multiple multi-hundred million-dollar deals in Storage. We're expanding beyond Intel architecture into AMD solutions, and we're now bringing our motherboard development on these new designs in-house. 
So we're getting the profit, not just on the system integration, but also on the motherboard design and manufacturing. And we've also talked about significantly expanding our own in-house manufacturing with new factories coming online in Monterrey and Hungary to support our customer base. So that's making the CSP, or the Cloud Service Provider, business more profitable. 
On the Enterprise SMB, we said we just had our highest quarter in 3 years, despite being in the middle of COVID. That's really being driven by not just the efficiencies across the company, but by our 4S strategy where we talked about higher profitability. 
So in Storage, I do see just published our latest storage numbers. We were at 11-point premium to market. We became #2 now in entry storage, up from #5. So we crossed the #3 and #4 player. And we're just 3 points away from being #1 in entry storage worldwide. 
In Software, we have higher attach rates. In software-defined, IDC just showed in hybrid cloud we grew 58% year-on-year, which was a 45% premium to market. 
And then lastly, on Services, we're tracking a double-digit growth year-on-year in our point-of-sale attach rates. We're expanding our TruScale as a Service offerings, and we're delivering more professional services. For example, almost every HPC install, where we had a record, we do data center design around our Neptune warm water cooling. And we also do data center design for some of the largest cloud players in the world not just providing them servers and storage, but actually designing the whole data center for them. 
So those are I think just some of the examples. Hopefully, they give you confidence that this is a sustained growth driven by in-house design and manufacturing as well as 4S focus that's improving our profitability. And I don't see that changing in the future. I think these trends, we feel confident for the future. Thank you.",396

My first question is regarding PC. Given the very high supply-demand dynamics, would you consider raising the retail price to reflect undersupply? And could we expect further PCSD margin improvement in the coming quarters? And could you also give some updates on the channel inventory level? 
My second question would be, you mentioned some further investment in the Service segment using the proceeds from PTI. Could you give us a great example of how are you going to use that? And any milestone of Service segment? For example, when would you expect the Service revenue to reach like 15% of total group revenue?",108

All right. No, coming to -- let's say, I answer first on the channel inventory because this is probably a very interesting question. I think when I look at around the world, frankly speaking, I don't think -- from U.S. to Europe to China to Asia Pacific. I think our channel inventory has never been so low. And in some cases during the last quarter, we were down to 2 to 3 weeks. 
Usually running -- a normal channel inventory is running around 6 weeks, right, between -- so we were really down to the very, very low level, and it's still more or less at that level. So the channel inventory, unfortunately, is still low. As I said, with no limitation on supply, the result of last quarter could be even better than what you see in terms of reporting. 
Are we going to -- as I said, demand is still very, very good. I would say we are not seeing any decline in demand, but it's probably even building up even stronger considering that Q1 is always much lower than Q4. It's even stronger than in Q4. 
And we are doing some adjustment on the price, but I think it's really not rising price because shortage or because of tight supply. It's mainly because -- as I said before, we see in terms of demand a very different profile than in the past with gaming, graphic card, better memory, better RD, better SSG, bigger [ SSD ]. 
And in terms of margin trend, I see very stable margin trend for this quarter and also for the next couple of quarters. So I think it's -- we will continue to see a very good growth in terms of CA and revenue and with a stable or slightly better margin. Thank you.",307

The PC, tablet demand will be still strong for this coming year, as I always said to you. So this pandemic is driving the people's behavior change. Now work from home, study from home, Internet from home have become the new normal. It drives information consumption upgrade from 1 [ phone ] per unit to 1 PC or -- and tablet per person. So definitely, it will drive the strong demand for PC and tablet. 
Also today, the people spend more time on their PC and their tablet. So probably that will drive the faster replacement cycle in the future so that we believe that the demand for PC and the tablet could be stable. So actually, I have predicted the PC TAM would reach 300 million this year. 
But actually -- so last year, we have already reached 300 million. So we believe this year, so the demand will continue to grow by 5% to 10%. So that's our focus. So actually, today's supply shortage is driven by the strong demand. So don't misunderstand. So supply shortage will not stop us to further grow. So second question, could Wai Ming answer the second question regarding of the CDR.",206

I forgot that. Yes, I think the investment, we are actually working primarily investing in technology-related projects and investments. I think, at the moment, we are actually working out the details.

We will have that disclosed much more detail in the prospectus in the -- while we are actually in the process of preparing the document and waiting to review the document by the regulators.

So I have 2 questions. The first question is a follow-on on the PCSD operating profit margin. I understand you guys during the quarter saw higher logistics costs. I was just wondering how much did that impact your margins? And when can we expect these higher logistics costs to normalize? 
And the second question is on inventory. I noticed you guys had higher finished good inventory, both sequentially as well as year-on-year in the December quarter. I guess, my understanding -- or I thought because of the strong end demand, you guys would actually have lower finished good inventory. I was just wondering what -- why was the finished good inventory up during the December quarter.",121

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3862.0,2237527.0,86852831.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,23,"Yes, yes, yes. Coming to logistics costs, when we see the impact, it's probably in the range of -- in terms of impact, this is decimal. It's not a big impact, maybe 0.1%, 0.2% because on such a big impact. For sure, we are seeing the logistics costs going up, but this is not in Q4. This is already after, I would say, Q1 last year. 
So we have seen logistics cost going up in Q2, going up in Q3, stabilizing in Q4 because we have not seen an increase compared to the previous 2 quarters. And we expect that, slowly, they will go down as soon as we are back to normal in terms of pandemic and with -- back to normal in terms of travel and so on. 
But when I look at the impact, I think because we have also been able to manage very, very well the increase in terms of charter, in terms of -- when you ship 20 million, 21 million, 23 million units per quarter, despite the cost increase, you can still manage to get a good discount, I would say. It's really how you manage logistics in terms of both, A, the charter, sea shipment, train shipment and so on. But we are talking about a very low number in terms of decimal. 
Inventory -- the channel inventory is extremely low in terms of 3 to 4 weeks today. We have been building on the other side. In this situation, when there is any opportunity to buy ahead, we buy ahead. We buy ahead any kind of things, but it's Display, IC because we wanted to make sure that, one, we can satisfy demand; and second, we can keep the factory up and running. 
So when I look at the inventory, I think it's mainly coming from parts components not only. But with this kind of situation, when some component, it's very difficult to forecast in terms of delivery. So you usually try to build up the other components in order to make sure that as soon as you get the parts that are used on shortage, you don't have a problem on the normal supply. 
So we have been building up more inventory just to make sure that we have enough components in the factory or in our ODM supplier. That as soon as we get what is in shortage, we can produce and ship. 
Finished goods, there is also -- the other consideration is that we have -- when we look at our finished goods inventory, a lot of this is in transit, is on the boat -- is in the boat, reaching our customer for Q1 -- for this quarter demand. 
And we are -- we also built up some -- or we have some additional finished goods because mainly for retail in U.S. and in some cases also in Europe, you need to deliver within January and February. And in February, we should not forget there is the Chinese New Year. So production will be a little bit impacted, not too much, maybe 2, 3, 4 days. 
But with this kind of situation in terms of demand and supply, even 2 or 3 days of factory shutdown for Chinese New Year can be a problem. So this is also the other reason you see some finished goods. Probably today, there is nothing left already in terms of finished goods because they are either on the boat or on the plane reaching our customers.",585

I just have a question on the restructuring to the 3 new groups. How different should we think about these 3 versus the current structure in terms of the performance indicators?

So we will do this restructure. The first reason is Gianfranco will retire in September, so we need to make some change on our organization and leadership. The second reason is definitely we want to drive our organization to be aligned with our strategy. So we have a Service-led 3S strategy part. 3S means smarter, IoT smart infrastructure and smart vertical part. So with the new organization, so our IDG, Intelligent Device Growth, will address the smart IoT direction. 
Then our new named infrastructure solution group plus it's a DCG will drive the smart infrastructure. And definitely, so the new established smart -- new published solution and the service group, SSG, will drive the solution and service direction. So that's a very crucial part for our intelligent transformation. So this has been growth. 
We integrated other service-oriented teams in our growth to drive Attached Service, Managed Service, Device-as-a-Service, solutions and the smart vertical, et cetera, et cetera. So definitely, smart vertical, we will be focusing on smart manufacturing, smart retail, smart city, smart education, et cetera, et cetera. 
So in the past couple of quarters, we have seen very good progress in our Service-led transformation. So last quarter, our Software & Services business grew by 36% year-on-year. So with the new organization. So we definitely believe we will keep the strong growth in the service area. So definitely, our Service business has much better margin than the average in our company. So that's why we think this is crucial for Lenovo's transformation for our future strategy -- our strategy execution.",261

I have a question on PC, 2 questions total, but first question is on PC. I would like to know what is the Enterprise segment? How is the Enterprise segment looking this year versus Consumer? Historically, we see Enterprise margin on the PC side higher than Consumer, and now it seems like it may be changing. So my question -- my first question is to Enterprise demand and also like Enterprise versus Consumer PC margin. 
My second question is on your CDR and more on the longer-term outlook. As we invest more in new technologies and innovation, how would that impact our operating expense and how would that impact our IDG profit margin?",119

So Enterprise segment, when we look at the trend, for sure, during pandemic -- with the pandemic, when I look at -- talking about calendar year, Q2 and Q3, we have seen a slowdown, right? Really, a slowdown on demand when -- but a big increase on consumer and partially SMB. So it's not only consumer with this very strong demand, it's also -- it was also SMB when I look at Q2 and Q3 calendar year. 
Q4, we start to see some signal of demand coming back, much better than the previous 6 months. And when I look at this quarter, I think demand is really back on Enterprise Notebook and that of Workstation, I mean, I would say, all the key segment or product segment in the Enterprise. 
And again, I think even in Enterprise during the last quarter and this quarter, the major concern in terms of -- is supply, and it's really how we can satisfy demand. So Enterprise, I think, we see a rebound during the last, let me say, 3 to 4 months between November, December and also now January and February. And backorder is really building up nicely. 
Margin -- when we look at our margin, I think -- and when you look at our 3 segments, margin on Enterprise and also margin on SMB, they continue to be very, very strong. The real difference is that -- also marginal consumer is becoming very good, but it's still not at the same level as SMB and Commercial. But before there was a big gap, and I would say the marginal consumer is reducing the gap against SMB and Enterprise. But still, we still run Enterprise with better margin than Consumer, more or less at the same level as SMB.",297

So for the first time, we see the Enterprise or Commercial demand increase so -- last quarter. So actually, the Commercial PC increased by 26% -- 20-something in the market. So definitely, Lenovo have around 6 points premium to the market. So that's a very good symptom that the economy -- the global economy is recovering. So that has less impact than previous quarters. Meanwhile, the consumer demand is still strong. So that's the [ splitter ] landscape for you to consider. Next question?",93

I think on the CDR, well, I've said in the earlier question, I won't be able to tell you exactly which project we have been starting. But generally, I think we are raising I think the proceeds, investing in technology. It would obviously either -- I think when completed will either improve our operating efficiency or will form part of our services or solutions that we offer to our customers. 
As you know, I think if you look at the profile of our business, I think Solutions & Services normally command a much higher gross margin, I think, than our existing devices business. So net-net, I think after we actually raise the capital to invest, I think, in areas, we are very, very confident that, not only will help us to expand further our top line of business, but at the same time, we'll be able to improve I think the margin profile of our business.",158

So even I myself don't have that number so far. So we -- yes, so we will integrate all the service-oriented teams together. So -- but yes, so by the April 1, so it will become more clear. But the content or the scope of the business is very clear. 
So that will drive Attached Service, Managed Service, including Device-as-a-Service and solution service -- for the solution service. So we are particularly focusing on smarter vertical solutions like smarter manufacturing, smarter education, smarter retail, smarter tickets. 
So I definitely believe -- so in all these areas, we can drive the hypergrowth. So for the Attached Service, so although it's close to the box service, but now Lenovo's attach rate is still much lower than the industry average. So we still have a lot of room to improve in that area. Definitely, Managed Service, that will be the trend. 
So in the past quarter, this business grew by more than 70% year-on-year. So that will be our strong growth focused area. So that's definitely -- as I said, smart vertical will be the third area we will drive the growth.",190

But first of all, mobile business, I think, is back to profitability already since a few quarters, right? I think we have seen some impact on the profitability just during the last 2, 3 quarters due to the pandemic and due to the demand coming from the impact -- with the impact coming from COVID-19. 
But if you look at the last 6 quarters, I would say, we were already back to profitability before pandemic. And then of course, we have seen some impact during the pandemic. Now we are back to profit. And I think that even if I look at the next few quarters, I think we will continue to deliver good profitability because the business is back to growth. 
It's back to growth in U.S. It's back to growth, very -- almost 80%, 85% in Europe, where we see really very, very good opportunity to further develop Europe with good connection and good relationship with most of the operators in Europe. But it's also back to growth in Asia Pacific, talking about India or other countries in Asia Pacific. 
So I think we will see growth in terms of revenue, but also we will continue to deliver good profitability like this quarter. The only question mark also on Mobile, it's again supply with the same -- more or less the same profile that we see on PC, IC and Display. 
What was the other question? One it was -- yes, the Chinese competition. But frankly speaking, we have seen Chinese brand competition in Europe. But despite the Chinese brand competition in Europe, as I said, we continue to see -- we have 85% revenue growth, and we continue to see a big opportunity. 
In Latin America, we continue to be #2. And I would say, compared to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 quarters ago, in terms of competition landscape, we really don't see a major, major difference or a big difference. Some of the Chinese brands coming, some other less aggressive than before, but I would say the overall landscape is the same. There are also some other brands that are -- they just announced to lead the market, and it's going to be another very good opportunity in both U.S. and Europe in terms of growing potential.

A year ago, as we faced a great uncertainty. I told you we would continue to be resilient and strive for new heights. Today, I'm pleased to say that we have indeed seen phenomenal growth in every part of our business and have achieved both a record fourth quarter and a new milestone for our fiscal year.
Starting with our historical fourth quarter results. Group revenue reached USD 15.6 billion, growing 48% year-on-year, fastest growth in almost a decade. Pretax income soared to USD 380 million. Net income reached USD 260 million, both around 5 to 6x as much as last year. All our core businesses achieved high double-digit growth in revenue at the same time for the first time in 6 years, demonstrating our progress in diversification of our businesses.
For Intelligent Devices Group, PC and Smart devices had its best fourth quarter ever with USD 12.4 billion, up 46% year-on-year. Even more, profitability hit an all-time high at 6.7%. All of our geographies realized the high double-digit growth in revenue. Particularly in China, we grew 80% year-on-year. Our PC volume outgrew the market to further strengthen our leading position. Tablet volume also had breakthrough growth of 157% year-on-year, around 3x as faster as the market. Our consistent strategy to focus on and invest in high growth and the premier segment keeps delivering strong results as gaming PC, thin/light, Chromebook and visuals volume each grew at more than double-digit rates and outgrow the market.
Our mobile group continued its momentum of profitable growth with terrific results. Revenue achieved a hyper growth, up 86% year-on-year. Pretax income reached USD 21 million, record high since the Motorola acquisition. With the expanded carrier relationships and a strong product portfolio, particularly 5G products, our volume grew at a triple-digit rate in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Latin America remains a strong hold with market share reaching a new record of nearly 21%.
Our Data Center Group had a tremendous quarter. Revenue grew at a strong 32% year-on-year, the fifth straight quarter of premium to market growth. Profitability improved 4.4 points year-on-year, the biggest increase in over 2 years. Both our Cloud Service Provider segment and Enterprise SMB segment achieved year-on-year growth. In particular, the CSP business grew 73% year-on-year. Our storage, software-defined infrastructure and the software business all had a record fourth quarter revenue. Particularly, storage revenue achieved a high growth of 73% year-on-year.
Our Service-led Transformation accelerated fueled by ongoing strong growth in Software and Services, with revenue up 44% year-on-year. Managed Service revenue, including DaaS and TruScale, nearly doubled. And Solutions revenue grew 65% year-on-year.
This historical quarter ensured we reached a significant fiscal year milestone. For the first time, group revenue surged to over USD 60 billion, adding more than USD 10 billion in just over a year. Profit grew even faster to reach new records, with pretax income of almost USD 1.8 billion, and the net income was almost USD 1.2 billion. Both were up more than 70% year-on-year. 
Our Intelligent Device Group and the Data Center Group achieved a revenue growth of 20% and 15%, respectively, as both reached historical highs. Our Software and Service revenue grew twice as fast as the overall group revenue at almost 40% year-on-year to a record USD 4.9 billion, which now make up 8% of our overall company revenue. This demonstrates our solid progress in Service-led Transformation. 
These results come from excellent performance across all our businesses, delivering to the new needs in the new normal, leveraging our clear strategy, innovative products, operational excellence and our global-local model. 
While we completed our true historic and record year, we are not stopping here. Looking forward, we will further drive our Service-led Transformation to capture growth opportunities created by both the new normal and the new technologies. 
We see 3 important industry trends now and post the pandemic. The first trend is consumption upgrade as people spend more time on their devices, leading them to buy more devices and upgrade more often as we work, live in the [ attempt ] from home. At the same time, the adoption of commercial and 5G is driving the shift from computer to computing, making more traditional devices [ inflated ].
The second trend is the infrastructure upgrade. The ever-growing use of online applications has not only increased the demand but also raised the bar for ICT infrastructure. Infrastructure not only refers to traditional data center products like server, storage, network but also edge or cloud, total solutions for computing power, from design and the deployment to operation and the maintenance.
The third trend is the application upgrade from digitalization to intelligent transformation with AI at its core. Industry survey by a leading consulting company shows the digitalization and the intelligent transformation of enterprises have accelerated by 3 to 4 years to enable more productive and efficient processes and the remote working conditions. The massive amounts of data from business digitalization and various smart devices are stored, organized and analyzed with computing power from edge and the cloud. Then by combining the data and the computing power with the algorithms based on industry know-how, we build intelligent solutions to transform industries. 
At our last earnings call in February, I shared that Lenovo was making changes to align our organizational structure to our 3S strategy. Under the new structure, Intelligent Device Group, or IDG; Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG; and the Solutions and Service group, or SSG, will each focus on the unique opportunities created by these 3 upgrade trends to achieve sustainable long-term growth. 
In the year ahead, IDG will continue to drive leadership in PC and tablet through innovation and operational excellence and further penetrate in new areas such as embedded computing, smart office, smart edge and AR/VR. And mobile will continue profitable growth as we take advantage of increased market demand and the changing competitive landscape and maintain strong momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific and keep our stronghold in Latin America.
ISG will continue premier to market growth. We will further expand our Cloud Service Provider customer base and grow our channel business through our newly integrated One Lenovo sales organization structure. We will drive storage, software-defined infrastructure, software and services to further improve profitability and ramp up TruScale Infrastructure as a Service. 
Our new business group, SSG, will strengthen our attached services portfolio and increase attach rates, expand Managed Services and develop repeatable solutions in key vertical industries. 
Meanwhile, we have reduced the greenhouse gas emissions by 92% over the past decade and set new science-based targets to continue making progress in sustainability. In fact, we have been recognized by the annual Corporate Knights' Index as one of the world's 100 most sustainable companies.
The past year certainly presented many challenges that reminded us of the importance of adaptability and resilience. But the past year also created opportunities for Lenovo to empower our customers and the society, to do more than just to survive in the new normal but to thrive and achieve even greater success. We will continue to turn challenges into opportunities and build an even smarter future in the year ahead.
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1217

I will now take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q4 and fiscal year 2021.
We had a strong finish to a record fiscal year. For quarter 4, we delivered $15.6 billion in revenue with a 48% year-on-year growth, which is the fastest growth in almost a decade, with net profit increasing by more than 5x. Not only did all our 3 business groups achieved high double-digit sales growth for the first time since Moto and 86 (sic) [ x86 ] acquisitions, the group high-margin Software and Services booking revenue also grew at its highest rate ever since our Service-led Transformation started. Our core competencies of operational excellence, time to market and innovation are setting us apart in the post-COVID world and accelerating our transformation towards end-to-end solutions. 
Our E to R ratio was reduced by 1.9 percentage point year-on-year to 14.1% as a result of disciplined control and economies of scale. Profit attributable to equityholders was $260 million. And the basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0219.
Q4 marked another exceptional quarter for our PCSD business, with sustaining its position as the largest global PC brand by market share. All regions saw year-on-year revenue increases in the range of 29% to 80%, leading to a blended 46% growth and record revenue of $12.4 billion for the group. PCSD delivered a record profit of $831 million in the fourth quarter with a 58% year-on-year growth. Its pretax margin expanded 50 basis points to an all-time high of 6.7%. In addition to the high-growth segments, which have been our strong catalysts in past quarters, e-commerce and services upselling emerged as a new growth engine to propel hyper revenue growth of 42% to 58% as well as higher profitability. Enterprise demand recovery was also encouraging, as evidenced by double-digit growth in shipments.
Our MBG business delivered a hyper sales growth of 86% year-on-year while improving its pretax profit by $80 million year-on-year to a record $21 million since acquisition. We achieved premium to market growth across our major geographies and outperforming the market. We have grown our MBG business by strengthening its product portfolio via a 5G-for-all strategy and broadening its carrier ranging across key focus markets. 
Data Center Group concluded the quarter with a 32% year-on-year growth to $1.6 billion in sales, thanks to the robust hyperscale demand and new customer acquisitions. Revenue of Enterprise SMB business reached 3-year high despite continued soft demand from Enterprise. Their high margin boded well to the sales mix. Along with more profitable Cloud Service Provider projects, DCG pretax improved by $45 million year-on-year, the largest expansion in the last 10 quarters. 
It has been 3 years since we started our Software and Services-led transformation. The high-margin Software and Services business continued to see accelerated growth in invoice revenue to its highest ever rate of 44%, contributing 7.9% of group sales. Deferred revenue increased 32% year-on-year, which further secure our future growth by building a sticky business model. Managed Services enjoyed 91% growth in invoice revenue supported by upselling opportunities, leveraging the growing popularity of our as-a-service solution. 
Our group generated an additional $10 billion revenue for the full year, capping off a record year with the highest rate in almost a decade. Our revenue grew 20% to $60.7 billion. Profit attributable to equityholders increased 77% to $1.2 billion, and basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0954. PCSD, DCG, as Software as a Services businesses, each scored all-time annual revenue or record profit. Challenges from the pandemic impacted MBG's first half performance, but its swift recovery in second half led to its higher half year profit since acquisition. Our E to R ratio was reduced by 110 basis points year-on-year to 12.5% on disciplined expense control. Pretax income was $1.8 billion, up 74% year-on-year, while pretax margin reached 2.9%, its highest level in the last 13 years. 
All of our business reported margin expansion. We have repositioned Lenovo to take advantage of the higher demand for computing power, data and end-to-end solutions. The consistent and strong earnings trajectory across our business units have underscore our company achievement after the Intelligent Transformation. 
Today, the Board declared a final dividend of HKD 0.24 per share. Taking into consideration of the interim dividend of HKD 0.066 per share, total dividend will be HKD 0.0306 per share, a 10% increase compared to dividend paid in FY '19-'20. 
For the fiscal year, our operating cash flow improved by $1.4 billion to $3.7 billion, thanks to strong earnings and working capital management. To optimize our capital structure, we reduced our net debt and repurchased perpetual securities amounting to a total of $1.4 billion. In the fiscal year, we obtained our first investment-grade credit rating with the subsequent upgrade. All of these actions together saved us 13% in financing costs and perpetual securities dividend. We expect more cost saving in the next fiscal year. 
PCSD business achieved many performance records as industry demand continued to exceed expectations throughout the year. Its revenue grew 22% to an all-time high of $48.5 billion, while pretax profit advanced 34% to $3.1 billion. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been many unexpected lifestyle changes, including the one PC per person trend, rising usage, intensity and e-commerce revolution. The group has leveraged our operational excellence, product innovation and quick time-to-market capability to address these new demand tailwinds. 
We maintain a solid worldwide #1 position for the third consecutive year and became #1 in EMEA in the second half of the year for the first time in our history. We made the strategic decision to drive high-growth segments and expect segment profitability. We also deploy our capital and resources under PCSD to grow the high value-added Services business. As a result, the business further extended its industry-leading profitability to set a new milestone at 6.5%. 
In the earlier part of the fiscal year, MBG operation was negatively impacted on both supply and demand side by the pandemic. Nevertheless, our commitment to strategic action has helped us stage a swift recovery in second half of the year. Thanks to the strong momentum across key markets, the business delivered a 39% revenue growth in the second half and then a 9% for full year. 
Similarly, the pretax performance reversed from a loss in first half to a record pretax profit to $31 million in the second half, up $87 million year-on-year. We achieved a record market share in Latin America and North America and nearly doubled our revenue base in Europe. 
Our strategy remains clear: driving product portfolio enhancement to include more premium model; a 5G for all strategy to make 5G connectivity more accessible; and broaden our carrier ranging to drive regional expansion. Looking forward, MBG will target to groom NA to be a significant contributor and embark its Europe business at a faster pace while maintaining LA as a stronghold market. 
Data Center Group delivered a record-high annual revenue at $6.3 billion, up 15% year-on-year. CSP is the largest growth contributor with a strong double-digit increase. Positive catalysts for CSP included public cloud demand and customer and product expansion. We are winning projects not only utilizing our in-house design and manufacturing but also high-end design storage and HPC to expand the number of growth engines. 
ESMB revenue was at its highest in last 3 years, outperforming the overall enterprise market even though market demand was sluggish. Storage, SDI software and HPC performed well, posting strong double-digit growth and record revenue. 
Our DCG is now ranked global #2 in entry-level storage, advanced from #5 last year and extended its #1 lead in HPC segment. 
On pretax, DCG saw improved profitability for the fourth consecutive year by $57 million year-on-year, and narrowed pretax loss to $169 million, driven by broad-based improvement across CSP and ESMB. 
Since this group started its Service-led Transformation, the Software and Services business had made tremendous progress. Its invoice revenue grew, accelerated and reached 39% for the year to $4.9 billion, which is nearly twice as high as the group revenue growth rate, now contributing 8% of the group sales. The business has broadened its scope and scale and has won many landmark deals. Managed Services enjoyed 78% growth, thanks to mega as-a-service deals signed around the world with leading technology, retail and financial institution as well as global spot events. Complex Solutions posted a strong 58% growth from all verticals. Attached services continue to grow at a fast pace of 48%. 
Deferred revenue increased 32% year-on-year to $2.2 billion, pointing to a fast-growing recurring revenue base as we make further inroads to build a sticky business model. With regional economy on pace to expect and signs of a rebound in enterprise IT spending, the group will continue to ride on recovery-led opportunities and deliver sustainable growth.
With our new organizational structure, we plan to supercharge the growth opportunity arising from our Service-led Transformation efforts and capitalize on long-term upgrade cycles. With the investment-grade rating, we will further improve our debt capital structure by leveraging current low interest environment. 
Our planned CDR listing will also further our market-leading position in China and provide capital for us to invest in technology, hence, further support our long-term growth. 
By business group, our PCSD business will continue to address opportunities emerging from new smart devices and expand its leading position in both market share and profitability. It will leverage its innovation, solution capabilities and further improve its world-class supply chain to meet strong segment demand partly driven by commercial recovery. 
For mobile business, the group will focus on sustaining its strong momentum in North America and Europe while maintaining its leadership in Latin America. MBG will further push product innovation and accelerated 5G smartphone launches to score wins in more markets and stay on the profitable growth journey.
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group or DCG business will aim to grow the channel business with the One Lenovo platform while delivering premium to market growth and profitability. In the ESMB segment, the group will grow high-margin services tax rates, expand high-growth segments and position its hybrid cloud solution to drive a paradigm shift in computing with edge to cloud solutions. 
For the CSP business, the group will continue to expand customer base and gain wallet share among existing accounts. To achieve that, the business will leverage its unique strength, including in-house custom design,and worldwide manufacturing capability and expand its product portfolio with advanced configuration and storage platform. 
The newly established SSG will bring our Service-led Transformation to a new level. We will continuously focus on expanding our capabilities in 3 key priority segments with clear multiyear growth targets: we will raise the attach rate for attached services; drive higher growth in Managed Services and as-a-service by enhancing delivery differentiation and platform; and develop end-to-end solutions and our Lenovo IP to support our growth in solutions.

Congrats for the very good results, Yuanqing and Wai Ming. So I have 2 questions. One question is about the impact of the chip shortage, and we see it recorded very good results last quarter. But looking forward, do you see any impact from shortage business? This is number one. 
And the second one is that we see reopening of the major countries. And so in the major countries, do you see the PC demand become -- remain still strong? Or do you see some markets, especially do you see the consumer market has any change?",97

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3766.0,2302637.0,88900913.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,9,"Okay. Good. No, okay, impact of the -- first of all, let me say, we are facing this shortage since Q4 last year, so it's not new. We have seen some deterioration from this beginning Q1 in terms of shortage and now is getting relatively stable. And I would say moving forward, I don't expect further deterioration. But for sure, we will continue to face the shortage for the next 12 or 18 months. It's mainly coming not only from PC demand but also from other products, automotive and so on. We have been able, as you see the result, to manage the shortage quite well in Q4 and last year in Q1. And we will continue to manage as we did in the past also in the future. 
There is another important thing that probably because when we talk about shortage people, they just think about IC. And they think that all they see are the same or similar, right? Part of the shortage came from by the demand from car, the car industry, but usually, the IC that they utilize is based on a very, very old fab technology, 28 or even higher in terms of technology. While we use still chipsets that are coming and IC that are coming from a little bit more recent technology. So the 2 things are not really overlapping too much. And while it's very difficult to invest on very old technology, it is different from our side. Now let's say, in terms of impact looking forward, as I said, we will be probably in a similar situation like Q1 or Q4 but not a deterioration.
Talking about PC demand, I think it's a very good question because it is true that a lot of countries in the world that are finally opening up, and it looks like we are slowly getting out of the tunnel. But when I see the demand in terms of PC, this quarter, even for the next following quarters, is still very, very strong. And I think the real difference is not because people -- because people working from home, learning from home, playing from home, everything from home. But I think the major difference is people, they start to realize, one, they need 1 PC per person and not 1 or 2 PC per outlet. Second, and there is a direct -- there are a few very interesting survey in terms of what the people think about PC after pandemic, let's say. 
Second, the experience on PC, a very different experience than what experience on certain applications. So PC is becoming much more key for a lot of people not only because everything from home but also for gaming or entertainment or other things, people, they realize they can do and they can get a much better experience than what they get on a phone or a tablet. 
The last thing is that when you look at the installed base, we have a very old installed base, 4, 5 or 6 years, and it's a huge number. And all these people, they are -- or they will be in the position to refresh their own PC, so we will see an acceleration of the refresh of the entire installed base. But again, because if you want to get good experience, if you go to enjoy certain experience, you need a brand-new PC, not a 4, 5 years old PC. So I'm quite optimistic. We are quite optimistic that what we see in terms of growth but also if you look at the market research data and so on, it will continue for several quarters this year for sure and next year also.",616
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3766.0,2302637.0,88900914.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,10,"Thank you, Gianfranco. So given this is a very important question, so I just want to echo what Gianfranco just said. So PC and the tablet demand are still very strong. So not only we see a big volume of the backlog in our order pool, but also, we are -- so you can see that the number, particularly China number, China has already reopened for a couple of quarters. But their demand is still very strong, or even stronger than other geographical parts. So that can prove what Gianfranco just said. So this pandemic just pushed people's behavior on a change. So they try to own PC [ after first half ]. And also people are spending more time on their devices, and they are buying more devices and upgrading more often. So their work, learn and platform home. So we believe that the demand will continue to be strong for a longer time, not just because of the pandemic. 
And also regarding of the shortage, so I think this shortage is mainly driven by the stronger demand than expected. But for sure, not just the PC and the tablet but also electronic cut as well. So it's caused by additional growth. So that means the market will continue to grow, and then Lenovo will also grow. It's just how much growth would -- depending on how much supply we can get. But in that aspect, so we are confident that Lenovo can perform better than the market and our key competitors. 
First, we have a very strong global supply chain, which was just awarded the Gartner's top 25 supply chain. Also, Lenovo has a very unique business model. Most of our competitors don't do manufacture by themselves. They're just outsource to the third party. But Lenovo has a hybrid model. We do 50% outsourcing and 50% in-house manufacturing. So this unique business model gives us advantage to approach upstream vendors and build a better relationship with them. So in shortage like this, we can leverage this relationship to get better supply situation. So I'm confident that we will continue to outperform the market, and the key competitors enjoy sustainable growth. Thank you.",364

For my first question is still regarding PC front. I think education or compute demand has been quite strong over the past couple of quarters. Can you give us some idea what do you think about the education penetration rate or also the growth outlook into the later half of the year? I think there are some concerns that this could slow down due to a stumble in some area is reaching some higher penetration. So I would like to get your thoughts on that. 
And then secondly, on the data side, on DCG, I think in last quarter, it seems like that the loss is at about USD 30 million, which -- please correct if I'm wrong, that this probably means that it's already at the breakeven level excluding the depreciation and also the amortization. So how should we think about the future profitability of DCG?",152

But also moving forward and not only in last quarter or Q4, there are some seasonal effect because this is -- education is a kind of a seasonal business. But as I said, also if you look, it's mainly Chromebook but not only Chromebook. And when you look at the projection in terms of Chromebook growth, we are still talking about a big double-digit number in the sense that it's starting with 3 or 4 so for this year and I think also for the following years. 
Corporate, I think, is a very different picture in the sense that we have seen a slowdown during pandemia with, of course, corporate reducing investment and trying to control cost. Starting from Q4, we have seen a rebound. Last quarter was already quite strong. And we expect that as soon as the people, they come back to work -- work in the office, I mean, not from home, this demand will accelerate because what we see in corporate, it's a big transition from -- I'm talking about corporate, not government. Big transition from desktop to notebook simply because the people, they want to be ready on the quick for any issue can happen in the future. So they are really -- we see a replacement of the desktop installed base with notebook. 
The other important thing when you look at Europe but also U.S. or some other countries, there are huge programs on digitalization, right? In Europe is 1 of the 4 or 5 key element of the [ founder ] I think from the European community for the different countries. They need to invest on the one clear guideline. They need to invest on digitalization. That means that, again, this means that you need to upgrade or to update or to look at the new installed base in terms of not only PC, in terms of PC for sure, but also in terms of infrastructure, cyber and storage, the entire infrastructure. And this is when you look at the number in terms of amount of dollars, it's really, really huge. So corporate, in my opinion, we see a speed-up of the growth during the next 3, 4, 5 quarters without any help.",382

I think the nice thing about the Data Center business is the design wins to get good long-term visibility into the key profit drivers that will continue to improve DCG's profitability, ISG profitability in the future. And that is that we're improving not just in server but in storage. Our in-house design and manufacturing is giving us design wins at the motherboard level. And we're expanding our Services business and the attach of our premium services at a double-digit increase to our servers and storage versus last year. 
And lastly, we see the enterprise and small business market and the on-prem as a service through our true scale now growing significantly with our as-a-Service business growing triple digits year-on-year.

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3766.0,2302637.0,88900928.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,24,"Thank you for the question. It's a very good question because I think the channel inventory has probably never been so low in the history. We are running today in certain country with 2 or 3 weeks of channel inventory, which is really too low. In the sense we were used to run with something between 6 to 8, and now we have 50% of what we need. And frankly speaking, we will be in this situation at least for the next 2 or 3 quarters because when I look at our back order, as Yuanqing said, we are not able to reduce our backlog quarter-by-quarter. It's still there with the same amount, more or less with the same amount of units. So channel inventory is worrying and not -- but because it's too low. And this is, I would say, everywhere, really everywhere, from Europe to China. China is even probably one of the worst places in terms of channel inventory. In terms of being too low, Europe, U.S. and Latin America, it's really everywhere. Then we need to deal with this situation. 
So pricing, with this stronger demand on one side, some components but mainly when I look at components, it's really very cheap components. I mean you talk about IC. You are talking about sense or not -- but pricing are slowly going up. And in order to maintain the profitability we need and also in -- to make sure that we continue to watch pricing, we still -- we want to be competitive, of course. But pricing are slowly going up. And I think we'll continue to go up for the next 3 or 4 quarters because the component cost trend. 
On the other side, it's not affecting demand because demand is so strong. That is really not -- we didn't see -- we started already the exercise in last quarter, even in Q4 partially. But we didn't see any impact on the demand at all.",330

From the mobile side, I think, number one, despite the high growth, the demand was even stronger. We are seeing demand growing in many different regions across the globe and even in different channels, including like enterprise where we are just starting. So I believe in the future, we will sustain the profitability. We don't see any deterioration. And we expect to still growing premium to market for the full year in the next few quarters. And we expect demand to hold now. As much as there is more competition from some players, as you mentioned, there are other entity that are benefiting demand, so our expectation is to continue grow premium to market. And we are seeing demand stocking channel at very healthy low levels and demand across multiple regions, especially North America, Latin America and Europe but also market tracking growing in a good pace. And we'll continue to focus on our strategy, that is focused on our core strength and grow profitably like we have been doing now over the last 2 to 3 years.",179

So we definitely have a higher expectation in our Mobile business to drive the profitable growth. Actually, we think we have the better position than other competitors in some markets, particularly mature markets. In North America, so we will leverage some competitors exit to further grow our share. Definitely, a similar situation will happen in Europe and some Asia-Pacific market as well. So we will keep the strong growth, profitable growth in those markets, right? So actually, for the Mobile businesses, we could grow even stronger, but we are limited by the supply as well. So we will try our best to get more supply to support our profitable growth. Thank you.",116

Number one is just a follow-up on the component shortage topic. When do you -- I'm wondering whether you are able to quantify the size of component shortage and when do you expect the component shortage will ease. 
And then second question about servers. I understand that your servers have been growing quite well. I'm wondering whether you're also seeing some component shortage in servers. And also, what do you believe as your key competitive edge to win server -- cloud server orders from the ODMs.",90

No, but it's also a very interesting question. It's a good question because to quantify, it's always not easy. But I would say, if I look at our back order, and we can probably say that in terms of quantifying the shortage, we can probably say that it's around 20 -- in the range of 20%. So without shortage, we could probably ship 20 -- easily 20% more. So still a brilliant result in Q1; without shortage, could be much, much better, let's put it in this way. But it's not easy to quantify because, unfortunately, we are not talking about 1 component or 2 components. We are talking about a big number of different small components. Then in some cases, you can -- if you are flexible and good enough, and this is why also it's important to run your own factory, you can easily switch, and you can be flexible enough to enjoy maybe some other components that are available rather than what is not available. 
But you need to be very flexible. You need to do qualification very quickly. You need to do a lot of things, that if you run, let's say, your own destiny is much more easy than depending from an ODM supplier. 
When, as I said, I would not expect that in the next 12 to 18 months the situation will improve. It will not deteriorate, probably it will stay at the same level, but I would not expect that for the next 12 to 18 months. So we'd see still the same situation also next year. Because to build that capacity when you talk about the fab, silicon foundry, it takes some time. There are big investments going on in different areas of the world in terms of new fab. But they will not be ready before 12 to 18 months.",310

So 2 questions: first is servers being impacted by component issues; and second is how do we differentiate in the cloud service provider market versus the ODMs. So I think, certainly, there's no one in technology, I think, that's not affected in some way by the chip shortages. However, I think we've done an outstanding job multi-sourcing across our portfolio. We just had, for example, record AMD shipments in our server technology with all of the latest Milan announcements we just made with AMD. We've announced 18 new platforms this quarter in think system and think agile. And we're multi-sourced across just about everything. So we don't see that being a major impact to having a significant double-digit premium to market and growth as we move forward here. 
As our supply chain is a little bit more nimble, I mean we are bringing in inventory for the cloud service providers based on future orders. So I think we're excited that we're not just winning the server business, but we're also winning significant storage orders, gateway orders, high-performance computing and the cloud orders. It's improving our profitability, and so we're able to pre-stage that and build that equipment because we're not just doing the system integration or just the rack integration, we're also doing the motherboard design. So we get to get a start on that much earlier. 
And candidly, we don't need to worry about ODMs because we're now designing our own motherboards in-house, manufacturing them in our own motherboard factories and integrating them in our own system factories around the world. In fact, we've recently talked about significant new motherboard factories in Mexico, expanding in China as well as expanding in Europe, in Hungary to increase our capacity based on the demand we see. So I don't think the chip shortage changes that. 
Our strategy for the cloud, for the public cloud is what we call ODM plus. So we have $40 billion a year of procurement power, so we have much larger procurement power especially in a shortage than most ODMs. Unlike the multinational traditional OEMs, we can build our own motherboards. We're not outsourcing those to someone, so that improves our profitability and our agility. And we're in 180 markets. So as we take China cloud providers global or we take U.S.-based cloud manufacturers global, in either sense, we have the ability to get to every corner of the globe from India to Brazil, to South Africa, to anywhere in the world. So this is our supply chain, which was just ranked #16 by Gartner of all companies in the world and #5 in tech, is proving to be a significant advantage for us both in procurement and in supply chain. So I think 73% growth, this is just the beginning because we know the design wins in cloud are coming, and we know that those design wins are even going to have a better mix with improved profit.",493

So we will drive the 3S strategy, some other smart IoT and smart devices, smarter infrastructure and smarter verticals. So definitely, our Solution and Service business will be key to realize this transformation. So we will drive a high attach rate of the attached service. We will drive hyper growth for the Managed Service, by including Device as a Service and TruScale or Data Center as a Service business. And meanwhile, we will drive a multiple smart verticals in manufacturing, education, retail, et cetera, et cetera.
So you know Lenovo has very strong execution capability. Once we have the clear strategy, we will drive the results for us. So actually, a couple of years ago, you were worried so whether we could turn around our Mobile business and the Data Center business. So we couldn't give you answer immediately. But over the past couple of quarters performance, you could see clear progress in these 2 businesses. So that can demonstrate Lenovo's execution capability. And also it could demonstrate our further success of diversification of our business. Definitely, for the next step, driving the Intelligent Transformation will be our strategy.

We are pleased to report a record fiscal first quarter results in our new organizational structure. While Wai Ming will go into detail about our performance, I want to focus on the greater opportunities we see and how we will deliver growth and sustainable profitability increases well into the future.  
The new normal has changed how people live and work. It has accelerated the digital and the intelligent transformation and the upgrades in smart devices, ICT infrastructure and applications. With our clear 3S strategy and strong execution, Lenovo is confident to capture these significant opportunities to further grow and improve profitability.
In fact, last quarter, despite the challenging environment, Lenovo delivered a record quarter with a significant year-on-year profitability improvement. Group net income more than doubled. Net income margin reached the highest in many years. Group revenue continued the hyper-growth of almost 27% year-on-year.  
But I want to say, this is just the beginning. In the coming years, we will continue to focus on high-margin businesses, including Solutions and Services, particularly as-a-Service business, infrastructure upgrade, premium PC and the adjacent non-PC devices. We will further increase investment in innovation and consistently improve our gross margin and overall profitability.  
Now I want to go into the details of each business group. Let's start with our new Solutions and Services Group or SSG. Today, the ICT infrastructure is transforming to a new architecture of client, edge, cloud, network, intelligence. This new IT will accelerate digital and intelligent transformation and bring each individual and enterprise higher efficiency and productivity, but also more complexity. This means customers now need more sophisticated IT services.
This shift created the huge market opportunities for solution services as well as managed services, including the subscription-based, all-inclusive business model, which we call as-a-Service. This is not only a reshaping of IT services, but also a massive transformation of the entire industry. IDC estimates the new IT service market to be over USD 1 trillion through 2025.  
While there is a potential to grow in traditional support services, even larger growth opportunities lie within managed services, other service and the vertical solutions. The margins of each service businesses are much higher than devices alone. So SSG's high growth will definitely drive higher profitability for the group.  
SSG addresses these opportunities with the 3 service segments, and we already see strong initial results. Last quarter, SSG revenue achieved the significant growth year-on-year with a strong operating margin of 22%, which is much higher than our traditional hardware businesses. 
Support Services profitability was up by almost 3 points year-on-year. Managed Service, as-a-Service and Vertical Solutions all achieved a double- and a triple-digit growth year-on-year. We will own many more high-profile smart city and smart retail deals on the implemented hybrid cloud solutions with our own IP.  
Going forward, we will drive further growth and margin enhancement. Our Support Services business will improve penetration rates and leverage the increasing device install base, especially as commercial rebounds to grow. For as-a-Service, we will aggressively invest in capability, platform and tools and drive scale through building more repeatable Vertical Solutions with our own IP and through strategic partnerships.  
Now let's talk about our Infrastructure Solutions Group or ISG. ICT infrastructure is the foundation to digital and the intelligent transformation. IDC predicts the ICT infrastructure to be a near $250 billion market through 2025. We have been investing in ISG for years, having started with only a global server business from IBM x86 acquisition.
ISG has built a storage, software, service, software-defined infrastructure capabilities and become a full-stack data center infrastructure provider. We have also expanded from providing enterprise IT infrastructure to public cloud and the full hybrid cloud solutions to our customers.  
Now years of investments are paying off. This business is close to achieving profitable growth and generating returns. Last quarter, ISG delivered a record revenue and has outperformed the market for 6 straight quarters while achieving the best results in 5 years. We are now #3 in x86 server and the #2 in mainstream storage worldwide. Our higher-margin businesses, storage, software, continued strong growth year-on-year, particularly, hybrid cloud solutions grew high double-digit year-on-year.
Looking forward, we will continue to invest in ISG's competitiveness and move towards profitability. We will increase investments in edge computing, hybrid cloud solutions and the 5G cloud network convergence. We will also continue to strengthen our in-house design and manufacturing capabilities, improve efficiency and expand the strategic partnership to enable more solutions. Our vision is to become the largest ICT infrastructure solution provider.  
For Intelligent Device Group, or IDG, I want to reemphasize that the pandemic has changed how people live and work. And PCs has returned to the center of our digital lives. People now spend much more time on these PCs. PC refreshment cycle has shortened, and the penetration rate has increased. IDC confirmed that the total PC demand will at least remain at the current levels until 2025, while commercial demand is rebounding quickly. At the same time, the IoT market is expected to surge by 11% CAGR through 2025.  
IDG is fully leveraging our PC leadership proposition and synergy across businesses to expand in adjacent non-PC segments, such as the smart meeting collaboration and the embedded computing. We have also been investing in innovation in the premium segments like Workstation, Gaming PC and the Thin & Light to drive sustainable profitability increases.  
Last quarter, IDG continued significant top line growth of almost 30% year-on-year, but the profit grew even stronger at over 40%. In one aspect, this is driven by strong performance in PCs, thanks to years of investment in premium and high-growth PC segments. We continue to improve our both average selling price and profitability. In another aspect, this result is driven by strong performance of non-PC segments, which already accounts for 18% of IDG's total revenue. 
Both tablet and smartphone businesses achieved over 50% growth year-on-year with a record performance. We strengthened the #2 position in Android tablet worldwide. Smartphone had a record operating margin of almost 5% and then now has become a self-sustainable healthy business. We are confident to leverage the change in market landscape to continue hyper growth. 
Going forward, IDG will continue to invest in smart devices, core component technologies and the next-generation computing platform. We will continue to focus on premium segments to improve average selling price and profitability. We will leverage our broad customer base to cross-sell adjacent non-PC products and further increase non-PC business mix. 
Last quarter, we increased our R&D by 40% year-on-year. And we will continue to invest in innovation and aim to double our R&D expense in 3 years. We will further strengthen operational excellence and improve efficiency through more decisive and thorough digital and intelligent transformation internally. And we remain committed to ESG and the sustainable green development. All these efforts will not only help us deliver long-term profitable growth, but also bring to life our vision of smart technology for all.  
Lastly, I invite you to attend our annual flagship event, Tech World, next month where we will discuss more about our vision and our future. Thank you.
Now Wai Ming will talk about our first quarter in more detail. Wai Ming, please.",1210

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2022.  
We achieved our best first quarter in history. We outperformed the market and attained record Q1 revenue of $16.9 billion, posting growth of 27% year-on-year. Our net income margin reached a 13-year high of 2.8%, and net profit more than doubled year-on-year. All our 3 business groups set new milestone in revenue and performances.
IDG, our Intelligent Device Group, realized its all-time-high operating margin of 7.5% and profit growth of 43% year-on-year. While PC business is contributing to the growth, non-PC products also registered a growth of 57% in revenue year-on-year.
Our new product driver, the Solutions and Services Group, SSG, saw its operating profit grow 51% year-on-year, contributing to 20% of our group's profit. Its 22% operating margin was nearly 3x of business group average.
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, ISG, achieved its record revenue since the x86 acquisition and made its largest profit improvement since 2Q fiscal year '18/'19 by $49 million year-on-year.  
While maintaining our E/R ratio year-to-year, our research and development investment grew 40% year-on-year. We believe our commitment to R&D will drive innovation and differentiation that will continue to support higher profitability. We plan to double our R&D spending in 3 years.
Furthermore, considering the improved product mix structure, we are confident that we can continue to expand our net income margin. Profit attributable to equity holders was $466 million, and the basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0402, representing 123% growth year-to-year.
Our operating cash improved by $131 million to $448 million, driven by strong profitability. In this fiscal quarter, the ongoing component supply shortage remained a key challenge, and our order backing further extended to fiscal Q2 across PC, smartphone and server. To support our growth, we continued to execute our component buy-ahead program to meet strong demand. 
To optimize our capital structure, we further reduced our net debt by 4 -- $541 million to $739 million and lowered our finance costs correspondingly. In addition, Fitch upgraded our credit rating to BBB in March 2021. Recently, S&P and Moody's revised our outlook from stable to positive, reflecting our sustainable growth outlook.  
Targeting the fast-growing new IT services segments within the trillion-dollar IT services market, SSG delivered a successful first quarter with strong revenue growth and high profitability. This financial result, SSG, have demonstrated the group's strategic focus for the past 2 years on service-led transformation and started to bear fruits.
SSG revenue increased by 38% year-on-year to $1.2 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth across 3 segments and all regions. Operating profit surged by 51% year-on-year to $264 million. Driven by strong top line momentum and solid expansion in operating margin, we stand at 22%, topping all business groups. SSG will continue to contribute to Lenovo long-term profitability through its higher profitability and fastest revenue growth among all our business groups.  
Revenue of Support Service grew 24% year-on-year. We continue to drive its penetration rate by strengthening premium service attached and new solutions such as asset recovery services.
The remarkable growth of Managed Service reached 64% year-on-year, demonstrating our ability to serve customers' demand as they switch to as-a-Service model. Total contract value of as-a-Service more than doubled during the quarter. The growth momentum continues as we secure several landmark deals and strategic partnerships.
Project & Solutions also reported strong revenue growth of 56% year-on-year, paving the way for scalable growth. This achievement as a whole contributed to a 41% year-on-year growth in booking, while deferred revenues amounted to $2.4 billion, up 34% year-on-year.  
ISG continued its faster-than-market growth momentum for 6 consecutive quarters. Sales grew 14% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Profitability improvement of $49 million was the strongest in the past 2 years, driven by more profitable cloud service provider projects and favorable mix within enterprise and SMB. ISG will continue to increase its profitability.  
CSP sales reached an all-time high, and they continue to expand client base, adding 12 new CSP next-wave clients with more project wins. Its global design-in projects now expanded from 1 socket to 8 sockets, server to storage, liquid cooling, more advanced system designs and multiple platforms from a single platform.  
ESMB delivered the highest 1Q revenue in the last 5 years, supported by record sales and high margins, storage, high-performance computing and hybrid cloud solutions. In the mainstream storage market, the group was one of the fastest-growing vendors and maintained its position as the second largest global player. 
Q1 marked another record quarter for our IDG with a 43% improvement in operating profit and a 28% revenue expansion. There were multiple drivers contributing to IDG's performance, including strong commercial demand and encouraged share gain in premium segments, resulting in higher ASP and profit margin. 
The use of PC has returned to the center of people's digital life, leading to increased demand for premium products, including Gaming, Thin & Light and Yoga series. Digital transformation had taken a different turn to drive commercial recovery as economies reopen. 
IDG's commercial PC sales and its premium product sales, such as Yoga and Gaming PC, grew significantly year-on-year, translating into high ASP and stronger profitability for IDG PC mix. We further improved our ASP by 6%. Q1 marked the 14th consecutive quarters of profit margin expansion for IDG.  
The non-PC product was another bright spot, representing 80% of IDG revenue in Q1. Tablet revenue grew 58% year-on-year, and smartphone sales went up by 64%. Our smartphone profit expanded $85 million year-on-year, while operating margin reached new high of 4.9%, driven by consistent market share gains across all geographical markets.
The successful execution of our smartphone strategy in product optimization and broader carrier ranging have proven to be earnings accretive. We will continue to increase ASP through investing in innovation and driving favorable premium mix. This will contribute to a healthy growth of our smartphone business, continue revenue growth while maintaining profitability. 
ESG continue to be a very important focus area for Lenovo. In the environment aspect, we are very proud we exceeded our 2020 climate change commitment. Furthermore, we launched our new 2030 climate change goals. Our new 2030 Science Based Targets address both Scope 1 and 2 direct emissions as well as Scope 3 emissions intensity in our value chain. 
In the social aspect, we formally announced our Product Diversity Office in 2020, supporting our commitment to develop technology for diverse users and minimize bias inherent in the technology or product itself.  
In regard to governance, we established a new ESG Executive Oversight Committee. The committee is comprised of executives from different business areas and geographies to ensure Lenovo ESG programs and investment effectively and appropriately address risk and opportunities. We are very pleased to note that our strong ESG performance has earned the recognition from a number of notable organizations. We will continue to honor our responsibility as an industry leader and corporate citizen.  
Looking ahead, we believe the accelerating global trend in digitalization and service-led transformation and the recovery of global IT spending post COVID-19 will continue to benefit Lenovo. Our commitment to R&D investment will further elevate Lenovo leadership in innovation, while our branding efforts will raise customer recognition of such differentiation. Both are the key drivers for us to further expand our gross margin. 
Our service-led transformation, commercial recovery, favorable mix, product innovations such as full-stack offerings from ISG and our strong operational efficiency are all supporting factors to help achieve Lenovo medium-term financial target of doubling our net margin.  
SSG will play an important role as the group's high-margin, high-growth engine, targeting the fast-growing new IT service segment. In addition, our extensive exposure to commercial PC and ESMB infrastructure offer vast solution and service potentials, leveraging on strong as-a-Service demand. We will continue to enrich our solution portfolios with in-house IP to drive scalable growth and build competitive edge for the next-stage expansion.  
In ISG, we will continue our profitability improvement, supported by consistent premium-to-market growth in both ESMB and CSP markets. We will continue to deliver industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expansion from server to full-stack offerings.  
In ESMB, we will expand the product portfolio through servers into storage, software-defined infrastructure, software, services and new segment coverage in edge through AI and communication solutions while raising profitability. In CSP, we will fully integrate our unique ODM+ model to expand profitable opportunities and drive quarter-to-quarter profit improvements. 
In IDG, we will sustain our profit expansion while investing in R&D to drive higher value-added premium products and smarter devices. We will further enhance our operational excellence and global supply chain management. The digital transformation took a new turn as the economy reopened, thus creating a strong demand and order backlog in commercial PCs.  
The premiumization trend could also accelerate as remote learning and working models have raised the bar for video and audio designs. Riding on the 2 trends, we believe the ASP and margin expansion in PC will continue to support our profit improvement.  
Our smartphone business will form an important driver for non-PC growth, while it's focused on sustaining strong growth momentum in North America and Europe, while maintaining market leadership in Latin America. It will further push product innovation and accelerate 5G smartphone launches to score wins in more market and stay on track for profitable growth.  
Our strong financial position and cash flow have provided a solid foundation on which Lenovo can proactively pursue growth opportunity ahead, particularly in the fast-growing service area. Lastly, we reiterate to our shareholders Lenovo commitment to sustainable profitability increase.

And the first question is about your new segment that is SSG. I noticed it's the first time Lenovo has officially re-segmented revenue. So can you please tell us more on your -- the segment of SSG? I mean what's your -- what's the relationship between now the SSG and the former segments? And what's your strategy on SSG's further development? That's my first question.
And the second question is about chips. Can you give us more color on the chips right now with respect to the laptop?",102

So now we have a new leader of SSG, Ken Wong, in the call. So probably I would invite Ken to answer your first question. So regarding the chip shortages, so probably the Chief Operating Officer, Gianfranco, can answer the question.",42
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4101.0,2372817.0,90609826.0,Answer,Kin Hang Wong,,Executives,7,"Thank you, Yuanqing. So this is Ken. Thanks for the question. I think this is a really great question. I think we're very happy to see, in fact, the increasing demand for more sophisticated services requirements coming out from new IP, I think as Yuanqing mentioned. Now with the new IP, I think, obviously, the benefit is going to be able to help enterprises to increase efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. I think the biggest challenge for a lot of people is that there's a lot of complexity and complication.
So I think Lenovo and especially SSG's role is to help our customer to navigate and overcome all these challenges in order to get the benefit. Now that's why if you look at our business, right, we have basically 3 tower of services and all entangle to work to provide the end-to-end solution to our customer regarding new IT. Now the tower 1 is mainly around our attached services, right? These are the basic warranty and also warranty upgrade to improve the ownership experience of our hardware products.
Now tower 2 is about managed service and also as-a-Service. Now this is the part where we add a lot of value. And also because a lot of data point that we got, right, this is the market where it's growing very, very fast, right? Some of the data point is suggesting that this is the part of the bucket that is rolling at 30% plus on a year-to-year basis. And we have been focusing a lot in this area in terms of building our capabilities, building our system and tools so that we can provide the best-of-the-breed managed services. 
And to share a lot of -- a little bit more detail, I think this year, we're already able to provide tower 2 services, managed service and as-a-Service in over 100 markets that we have business in. And the target is do all the way towards 180 markets that Lenovo has business in, right? So this is obviously a huge growth opportunity for our business. 
Last but not least, right, I think the tower 3 is about project solution and also vertical solution. This is where the part we can add even more value by understanding some industry-specific requirements, leveraging some of the Lenovo internal IP and provide a integrated solution, an end-to-end solution for our customers. 
Now with all these, right, I think we are very confident that the SSG business will continue to grow. I think as Yuanqing mentioned in his opening that we'll continue to grow even at a speed that will be faster than the overall growth from a top line and also bottom line perspective. Thank you.",449

So I want to add a couple of points. So this business, our Solutions and Services business, is key to Lenovo strategy. So we call it service-led as we have a strategy path. So that means smart IoT, smart infrastructure and smart vertical part, all of those are related to Solutions and Services.
Second, so SSG will help us to achieve our goal to sustainably improve our profitability because this is a high-margin business. So actually, you see last quarter's same profit -- operating margin was above 20%, so it was 22% year-on-year, and it's still increasing. So that will help us to improve our profitability over time.
Okay. So the next question will be answered by Gianfranco regarding of the supply shortage.",124
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4101.0,2372817.0,90609828.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,9,"Talking about the supply shortages, first of all, one clarification. When we talk about chip, I mean, mainly, it's really IC, integrated circuit. So small components, mainly that are key for motherboard display, the LAN card or some other things because sometimes, I think there is confusion between CPU or other GPU and so on. But the shortage, it's really on IC.
We are facing these shortages in -- so now it's already 3 -- almost 3 quarters, right? We don't see further deterioration in that, but yes, they are still short, and I think they will continue to be short at least for the next couple of -- maybe 2 or 3 quarters. We see some improvement in here and there. On the other hand, when you look at our growth, that is between 20% to 30% on PC in -- it's a potential limitation, but it's a potential limitation to grow more than 25%, 30%.
So we still see for the future quarters a good opportunity to continue to grow with this trend. And as I said, it will not improve seriously at least for the next 2 or 3 quarters because it's not only coming -- and it's not coming -- it's not only coming from PC demand. It's coming from automotive. It's coming from any kind of smart devices, including white goods, any kind of really smart devices where you need even small board. And now you'll see electronics, you see small board almost anywhere, right?
So PC demand, for sure, is one of the reason, but it's not the only reason of the shortage. We have seen, on the other side, good improvement on display. Display, I think, it's -- we don't see any issue on display. We don't see any issue on any other major components. It's just IC, and I said it is mainly impacting motherboard and display in the sense that you need the board managing the display. I hope I have answered your question.",333

Thank you, Gianfranco. So in summary, so the key shortage is on IC. So the component shortage will probably last until first half of next year. But we want to emphasize this shortage is [ influenced ] by stronger-than-expected demand, not shrinking demand, but demand for devices, data center infrastructure are all very strong. Actually, Lenovo's backlog is almost the same as the previous quarter. 
Another point is Lenovo has a track record to drive better-than-competitor results regarding of the supply part. So mainly because of Lenovo's unique business model part, we are not like our competitors who outsource 100% of production to the third party. At Lenovo, we have the hybrid, 50% in-house, 50% outsourcing model part. So this model give us more flexibility and a better relationship with Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers, upstream suppliers, so that we can manage our supply base part. So even with the supply constraints, we are optimistic and confident to continue to drive the premium-to-the-market growth. Thank you.",167

My first question is still regarding the service. So could you provide some analysis? From quantitative analysis, what's the, say, long-term target of service segment? What's the KPI for this? And from, say, qualitative analysis, could you share more color on the difference in customer behavior between the service and traditional hardware segment? For example, how is the customer churn rate? And how is the customer cross-selling opportunities for service segment? I guess one also key question is whether the customer tend to adopt more than one partner in service model or they just use single source in service. 
And my second question is the OP margin. Segment OP margin achieved new set of highs for PC, and mobile KPI also achieved record highs. [ Several ] also showed very meaningful loss reduction. But the group gross margin actually dropped on a sequential basis. Could you help me to understand a bit more about the disconnection between gross margin and OP margin?",167

Now regarding the target, I think, first of all, we're very happy to see the Q1 performance, right, the 38% year-to-year growth and 20 -- 22% of operating margin. Now as I answered the previous question, I think we continue to see a very strong demand for all kinds of services, right, from attached services all the way to managed services and everything as-a-Service.

I think there are, I think, a couple of reasons, Albert. I think one already -- Gianfranco mentioned about the competition issue. I think the other one is obviously scale. I think quarter 4, I think we will not play -- I think quarter 4 numbers, I think we obviously get some maybe -- because of scale, because of some one-off costs that actually drive, but in fact, it's actually not significant. I think for us, I think there may well be also some changes, I think, in terms of the mix of the product, I think, resulting that -- again, I think -- probably I need to give -- I think provide more detail, for example, in different geography or in different countries, I think the profit margin or the gross margin profit is a little bit higher than the others, for example, like Japan, generally.
I think when the market size changes quarter-to-quarter, that actually have a small impact, I think, on our overall gross margin. But generally, I think as Gianfranco said, we've actually been looking, I think, more comparable. I think it's really year-to-year and we've actually been, I think, improving gross margin, and that is our target. And we also feel very comfortable that we can continue to maintain the margin improvement. I think resulting what Yuanqing said earlier that it is our medium financial goal, I think, is to [ show ] improvement in gross margin, obviously, as well as operating efficiency, be able to bring our net margin, I think, to double, I think, from last year, 2% to 4%, I think medium-term target, and we are obviously on track on that.",281

So I think in the past 2 months, the confirmed COVID-19 confirmed cases in U.S. surged a lot again from a very low base in May and June. So previously, I think the -- my impression is like Lenovo believes that the commercial PC demand is increasing due to people will be back to office rather than work from home after the easing of the COVID. But now the situation looks like to be getting worse again in Western countries. So just wondering if you could give us an idea about our PC business outlook in terms of like commercial or consumer or educational segment. And that's the first question. 
And the second question is for inventory. So in the past few quarters, I'm seeing that your raw material and working process inventory surged more meaningfully compared with the finished good. So I'm just curious, what kind of component, materials or ICs are accumulated in the past few quarters? And whether if -- I mean if there is any demand deteriorating, if there would be any kind of risk on inventory write-off in the future.",194

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4101.0,2372817.0,90609846.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,27,"Yes, yes, the PC demand in each segment. So obviously, we are seeing a very robust consumer segment demand still. We observed that in some of the country with the lower COVID rate or with the better COVID situation, the demand slow down a little bit, but still maintains far superior to the previous pre-COVID levels, so to say, demonstrating our theory that the PC is truly back at the center of people digital life. So that is for the consumer part. 
The commercial side, the demand profile and the outlook we estimate is very bright because we have noticed during the initial COVID 1 year ago, many enterprises have lowered down investments. But now due to the necessary, the must digitalization of their businesses, there is a very significant demand increase. We have noticed this initially more in the large and very large enterprises, namely our global accounts, but now it's expanding also to the large enterprises and the SMB.
So I would say we are very positive on the demand of the commercial PC business. For both segments, there is also an upgrade into the product demand, which means there is a higher demand of audio, video, microphone conferencing experience. So that drives the premium PC higher, which consequently drive AUR and our margin opportunity higher as well. 
You also asked about the education. I think the education, namely Chromebook, is also in function of the learn-from-home status. Now there is a little bit of slowdown, particularly in U.S. We have noticed the Chromebook has slowed down a little bit. But that's also related to the seasonality and to the government funding incentive, which we have reason to believe that will pick up. So it's probably that this education segment is probably the lowest among the consumer and commercial. But we still believe it's very early to say that the demand is trending down. It's just a pause. But in -- and in any case, for us, Chromebook is a very small fraction of our PC revenue. I think it's less than 5%.",345
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4101.0,2372817.0,90609847.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,28,"Yes. So I want to echo Luca's point. So firstly, from what we can see, PC demand is still very strong in both consumer and the commercial segment. Our backlog order last quarter was similar to the previous quarter. So very big volume, we still cannot ship. We still cannot deliver because of the component shortage. 
From a long-term point of view, so we are equally optimistic because we think this pandemic has changed the people's behavior. So the hybrid working approach will last for a long term, just to stay. So that will drive the PC demand, at least to keep at the current level of, let me say, [ 368 million ] units per year level, which is much higher than the pre-pandemic, which is just 206 million. 
Now our people spend more time every day on their PC, so that they will drive the faster replacement cycle. And also, it will definitely drive the more penetration rate. So that will help PC total market keep stable. So that's our view. And also, the commercial -- because commercial customers or market is getting recovered, so that we believe the averaging selling price will go up and also that will help us to improve the profitability. So given Lenovo commercial PC products are stronger in the industry, particularly in the premium Thinkpad sort of area part, so I think that will help us to improve the profitability.
Regarding of the component that you mentioned, I don't think that's the issue part. So actually, it's driven by the supply shortage. We have to buy ahead for some components. So perhaps, Gianfranco, you want to add something here?",277
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4101.0,2372817.0,90609848.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,29,"No, yes, yes, very well. And -- but there is another important there, there is another element in my view also that is going to drive demand on PC in the next 3 to 6 months, which is the Windows 11 that we -- because it's going to be available very soon, and this will also help to drive demand first in consumer, second in commercial later. 
On the inventory, I think we did it on purpose to build up some inventory in terms of components because with the shortage today, if you are in a good position in terms of inventory, then you can speed up the manufacturing and ship as quick as possible. Because like YY said, we still see back order very, very high. It's almost 1 quarter of back order. So we really don't see any deterioration on demand.
And to have even more inventory, it will be good. Because with the shortage, and you need to play between different components, you need to see what is available, what isn't, to make sure that in terms of square set, you are okay. And we really don't see any possibility of the deterioration or write-off of the inventory. Unfortunately, it's not enough. It should be more. But should be more, it depends on the shortage. So inventory is really not the issue.
I think that clean the back order and shipping to the customer on time is the real issue we have today. And we will not see any good solution for sure until the end of the year and probably even next year as demand is so strong; on consumer, still stronger; getting very strong on commercial, but it's already a couple of quarters, almost 3 quarters. 
And the impact of COVID-19 with the new -- the delta and what we are seeing. First of all, in the Western world, it's very clear that with the vaccine, people, they may get infected. But if they are vaccinated, they don't go to the hospital. They -- it becomes like a flu, but it's not getting very serious.
Second, I think most of the enterprise customer, all the larger enterprise customer, it's really not because people that they start to invest again, not because people are coming back to the office, but because they want to -- they really want to speed up the digitalization of the company in order to be ready for any future surprise or future issue. So I think it's got nothing to do, in my opinion, with people going back to the office or not when we look at commercial investment. 
I would say the only thing where you see a little bit of slowdown is education, mainly in units, Chromebook. We are not one of the largest player on Chromebook.  Chromebook is for us today something in the range of 5% of our revenue. We've never been very focused on Chromebook also because talking about inventory, we prefer to use the parts and the components to build better machine in terms of the average selling price rather than building a Chromebook. We lead to our competitor to do it. But I think it's the only area also due to some seasonality because now it's valuation. It's the only area where we see a little bit of a slowdown. Consumer and commercial, we really not see any slowdown.",565

I'm mostly a little bit surprised about that because we don't see any buildup of inventory in the channel, exactly the opposite. In most of the geo, the level of the channel inventory has never been so low. We are talking in some cases of less than 4 weeks, 3 to 4 weeks. And we know with the 3 to 4 weeks, usually, you lose the sales because the profile of inventory never [ comes ].
And I don't know where the information is coming from in terms of building up channel inventory. But for sure, it's not the case for us. As I said, the back order we have is so -- it's almost 1 quarter. And in most of the countries, with people, distributors and dealers and so on, I think, desperate to get the goods.
So both commercial and consumer, as I said, again, probably there is -- we may see some in education inventory building up, Chromebook mainly in one geo, which is U.S. This may be the case if we talk about overall inventory, as I said, that I don't see issue on consumer. I don't see issue on commercial. We might see something on education. But again, in our case, in fact, we are growing #3 in terms of -- even #4 in terms of Chromebook supplier. So it's not going to be a major concern even with some slowdown on the sales.",251

I think in accordance with the requirements laid out by, I think, the relevant regulatory -- regulators, I think we achieved certain milestones. I can give you a little bit sort of color, including, for example, I think management and director doing the education and taking exam. I think getting all the adviser, I think verifying our documents, I think we are making very, very good progress. And we obviously will follow the procedure as laid out by the regulators. And if there is anything that I think that we want to go to public, we will obviously, I think, publish an announcement informing the market.

So I think we feel very confident in our continued growth, for year-on-year growth, quarter-on-quarter revenue growth and improving profitability. We've now shared with you 6 quarters premium to market with our all-time record revenue. But we also had records across our server business, storage business, cloud business, high-performance computing business and communication service provider and service. So in the areas of storage, we're seeing more than 50% year-to-year growth and 14 quarters of premium-to-market growth, which has catapulted us to #2 in the mainstream storage market of 25,000 and under storage.
So it's a good momentum story for us, and we continue to grow, we believe, at a premium to market. Despite, again, certain supply shortages, we don't think that will limit our continued record revenue growth and improving profitability.",133

So thank you. Thank you, Kirk. So definitely, we think the ISG has a big opportunity to further grow. So there, we'll transform from server only to the full stack of data center, product, storage, software-defined software and the services. And also, there were -- so we have successfully shifted from enterprises -- SMB only to cloud service provider. So we will be focusing on the hybrid cloud as well in the future. So the opportunity is huge. We will ensure the investment to guarantee the growth in that business.

Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing. Yuanqing, please.",124
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195345.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While the pandemic and industry-wide supply shortage continues, thanks to our operational excellence, innovation and strong execution, our momentum grow even stronger across all our key businesses. Again, this quarter, we will look at the significant opportunities in the market, our strong performance, capturing these opportunities and our plans for sustained profitability increase and the growth over time.  
Lenovo's new IT technology architecture of client edge, Client-Edge-Cloud-Network-Intelligence is helping us win more opportunities in the market. Based on this architecture and our 3S strategy, we will combine our Smart Device/IoT, Smart Infrastructure and Smart Vertical solutions capabilities to help our customers realize their digital and intelligent transformation. Lenovo is well-positioned to capture this growing opportunity and continue improving profitability. With strong execution of this strategy, last quarter, we delivered another phenomenal quarter with both historical higher profit and revenue.  
Group net income grew 65% year-on-year to USD 512 million. And net income margin improved 0.7 points on track to doubling in 3 years.  
Corporate revenue continued a strong growth of over 23% year-on-year to USD 17.9 billion. And our operating cash flow doubled year-on-year to USD 1.6 billion. 
At the same time, our R&D spending increased nearly 60% year-on-year as we increased investment in innovation. Going forward, we will continue to focus on high-margin businesses and segments. We aim to double our R&D investments over 3 years and develop more core technology along our new IT structure. We will also further drive our internal digital and intelligent transformation to improve efficiency and consistently improve our profitability.  
Now I want to discuss the details of each business group. Let's start with the Solutions and Services Group. As the technology architecture becomes more complex, customers demand more sophisticated IT services. IDC estimates this rapidly growing opportunity to be over USD 1 trillion through 2025. Within which, the device-as-a-service market is estimated to be 6 -- USD 67 billion by 2025.  
These service businesses have much higher margin and faster growth than devices alone. So we expect the SSG's growth to continue driving higher profitability for the group. Last quarter, SSG continued to deliver high growth with high profitability. Its revenue grew 30% year-on-year with operating margin of almost 21%. Support service improved the penetration rate in both PC and infrastructure.  
Managed service saw revenue growth of almost 90% year-on-year. We have launched our other service brand, TruScale, at our flagship event, Lenovo Tech World. And we now have even broadened as-a-service portfolio for our customers.  
Project Services and Solutions achieved almost 22% year-on-year revenue growth as we gained more traction with repeatable solutions based on Lenovo IP.  
Looking forward, SSG will continue to drive both growth and the profitability. We have integrated our internal IT function into SSG to enhance our service, R&D and the delivery capabilities and turn our proven internal digital capabilities into solution offerings.  
In Management Services, we will continue to build the platforms, tools and go-to-market capabilities to enhance our TruScale as-a-Service offerings. 
In support services, we will continue to improve penetration rates, especially as commercial segment rebounds.  
For our Infrastructure Solutions Group, ISG, the opportunity keeps expanding as the ICT infrastructure upgrade continues. IDC expects the ICT infrastructure to become a $250 billion market globally through 2025, which is as big as the PC market.  
Last quarter, ISG delivered a record performance led by all-time high revenue of almost USD 2 billion, up almost 34% year-on-year. Profitability continued to improve by USD 24 million year-on-year, nearly breakeven.  
We outgrew the market in nearly every segment. Cloud service provider reached a historical high revenue over 50% year-on-year growth. And the enterprise SMB revenue had a strong growth of almost 20% year-on-year.  
In the higher margin segments, storage revenue also grew over 50% year-on-year to a new record.  
In high-performance computing, we delivered the fastest university, high-performance computer in China today, which is also powered by Lenovo Neptune water-cooling technology.  
Looking forward, we will continue to invest in ISG's competitiveness and increase investments in faster-growing segments, such as edge computing, hybrid cloud solutions and the 5G cloud-network convergence. We will further enhance our in-house design and manufacturing capabilities to drive profitability improvements, as we drive to breakeven and beyond. Our vision remains to become the largest and most trusted ICT infrastructure solution provider. 
For the Intelligent Device Group, IPG, the demand for PCs and devices remains strong. IDC reports that commercial demand, excluding Chromebook grew 18% year-on-year last quarter. In addition, Windows 11 launch is expected to increase PC demand. We agree with the IDC's assessment that annual PC volumes will maintain at 340 million, 355 million unit level for the next few years.  
Meanwhile, the reshuffling continues in the global smartphone market, giving Lenovo more room to grow. At the same time, the IoT market is expected to surge by 11% CAGR through 2025. Last quarter, our IDG continued to deliver excellent revenue growth of nearly 21% year-on-year, and the profitability grew even stronger, up 34% year-on-year on top of its already high bases.  
In PCs, premier segments delivered a high growth. Premier Yoga and the workstation revenue each more than doubled year-on-year. Commercial PC revenue grew 29% year-on-year, with SMB growing 48% year-on-year.  
In the non-PCs, smartphones had its best quarter ever. Profit reached a new historic high while revenue grew 27% year-on-year, highest in 15 quarters. All geographies delivered a high double-digit profitable growth. Not only our stronghold, Latin America and North America, even in the expansion markets of EMEA and Asia Pacific, our revenue grew by strong double digits.  
Tablet revenue continued to grow 20% year-on-year. Our accessory business revenue also grew 31% year-on-year.  
Going forward, IDG will continue to invest in premier segments to increase profitability and the average selling price. We will leverage our PC leadership to cross-sale adjustment to non-PC products like smartphones, tablet, smart meeting collaboration, embedded computing and further increase our non-PC business mix.  
Through our clear strategy execution and the increased investment in technology, we are confident that we will continue to deliver sustainable growth and our commitment to double profitability in 3 years. Thank you.  
Now, let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1039
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195346.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q2 fiscal year 2022. We achieved the best quarter in our history. Our new financial records included all-time high revenue, pretax income and net income. Q2 revenue grew at a healthy rate of 23% year-on-year to $17.9 billion, and net income margin expanded 0.7 points to boost a 65% net profit year-on-year growth. All of our 3 business groups set new milestones in revenue and contributed to improved profitability.  
Profit attributable to equity holders was $512 million, and the basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0442, representing 71% growth year-on-year. The Board of Directors declared today an interim dividend of HKD 0.08 representing an approximately 21% increase on the dividend paid in the last fiscal year. We continue to drive innovation and differentiation in supporting our goal to raise long-term profitability and capture the opportunities brought by digital transformation from new IT.  
Our research and development investment grew 57% year-on-year. This investment includes talent acquisition and development, intellectual properties as well as projects in premium, gaming and workstation PCs, edge servers, storage, high-performance computing and Lenovo Brain AI. We kept the annual increase of our E-to-R ratio at 0.7 points. As we exercised disciplined control of expense in other areas, our operating margin is up 0.7 points year-on-year. This accelerating innovation strategy reflects the value created by R&D to support our gross margin expansion of 1.3 points year-on-year to 16.8%.  
Our cash flow generation has shown marked improvement since 9 quarters ago, as we continue to improve efficiency and profitability. For fiscal Q2, we boosted operating cash flow by $790 million year-on-year to $1.6 billion, driven mainly by our strong profitability.  
To optimize our capital structure, we further reduced our net debt by over $1 million year-on-year to $60 million and lower our finance costs accordingly.  
In the past 3.5 years, we cut our net debt by more than $2.5 billion, including the repurchase of perpetual securities. We are pleased to see the net debt approaching nearly 0.  
Going forward, we are confident our continued operating trajectory will result in net cash in the near future. 
Riding on the fast-growing new IT service opportunities and commercial upgrade cycle, SSG delivered a stellar second quarter with strong revenue and profit growth. SSG revenue increased by 30% year-on-year to $1.4 billion supported by consistent strong double-digit growth across its 3 segments. Operating profit advanced by 32% year-on-year to $285 million. SSG continue its growth trajectory by focusing on advantages offered by the group's strong platform, leveraging its partnerships and launching new services to tap into new opportunities including ESG-related end-to-end life cycle management. All of these moves will ensure the group's thriving future and sustainable growth.  
By service segment, Support Services revenue rose 23% year-on-year. Our service traction with commercial customers is encouraging, and they are taking full advantage of our advanced services capability to optimize their hybrid working model and give ESG deployment a higher priority. We are not only seeing a rising service penetration rate towards industry best practices, but also the accelerating world in our high value-added services.  
Managed Services and as-a-Service posted a remarkable 88% revenue growth year-on-year, thanks to phenomenal as-a-Service growth and enriched portfolio. SSG integrates all 18 as-a-Service solutions under Lenovo TruScale brand, offering customers the best tools with flexibility and simplicity. Our next action in line is to launch these services in more geographies, which should further accelerate TruScale's growth momentum.  
Project & Solutions also reported solid revenue growth of 22% year-on-year, as we continue to expand in-house intellectual properties and repeatable deals. These achievements altogether contributing to a 34% year-on-year growth in booking revenue, while deferred revenues recorded another quarter of strong growth, up 31% year-on-year to $2.6 billion.  
ISG continued to take advantage of infrastructure upgrade opportunities, expanding market share in nearly every business segment. For the second quarter, ISG revenue grew strongly by 34% year-on-year to an all-time high of $2 billion. While its operating loss significantly narrowed by 80% to near $6 million, a combination of customer base expansion in CSP and improved sales mix in the ESMB business drove further improvement in profitability.  
In Q2, CSP sales reached another record on the back of strong cloud demand and a broader client base. Its unique ODM+ model provides new stack of solutions across motherboard system and rack integration for server and storage. This business model provides greater flexibility, responsiveness and resilience for our customers who need strong support from infrastructure suppliers, so they can focus on growing their core businesses.  
ESMB segment revenue in Q2 was the highest in the last 5 years and make market share gains in several high-growth and high-margin products with more prominent growth seen in server, storage and high-performance computing.  
In mainstream storage market, the group increased its storage sales by 52% year-on-year and further solidify its #2 position by narrowing the gap in market share to the top player.  
In high-performance computing, Lenovo recently delivered its largest system to the public sector in North American market and the faster machine powered by our water-cooling technology to a university in China.  
IDG revenue set a new record in fiscal Q2, up 21% year-on-year. Its operating profit surged 34% year-on-year and its operating margin reached an all-time high record of 7.6%.  
Demand is shifting to high value-added segments as the use of PC has become an essential aspect of more than life. In the meantime, commercial demand continued to benefit from digital transformation, growing at a near record rate in our history. These 2 trends positively impact our ASP and profitability. Our ASP increased 17% year-on-year during the quarter, while Q2 marked the 16th consecutive quarter of year-on-year profit margin expansion for IDG.  
In fiscal Q2, non-PC products contributed to 90% of IDG revenue, and our smartphone profit expanded to a record $89 million. We continue to gain global market share in smartphone across geographies. In North America, we achieved the highest activation rate in history, and we are closing the market share gap with the #2 player.  
In Europe, our smartphone revenue grew high double-digit year-on-year while we solidify our #2 position in our stronghold market in Latin America.  
Our latest ESG report is now available from our Investor Relations website, marking the 15 years of this publication and highlighting our sustainability efforts. We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our ESG targets. We recognize our leading role in the industry, and we commit to make responsible changes to mitigate environmental impact. In the next few years, we aim to accelerate our adoption of clean energy and strengthen our ESG innovation all the way from product design, manufacturing, packaging to product end-of-life management.  
Our SSG provide a wide range of asset service offerings and sustainability services, including asset recovery services. They are not only integral to Lenovo's end-to-end life cycle services, but also assist customers in meeting their environmental goals through offering secure and responsible disposal of products, while maximizing value recovery.  
On the social side, Lenovo as a global company is proud to continue its efforts in diversity and inclusion. By FY '26, we target to increase the executive representation of women within our organization around the world to 27%. Along the way, we are proud to dedicate our continuous efforts towards excellence and inclusion for our global workforce.  
Looking ahead, Lenovo will continue to innovate in new IT to lead as a transformative engine to the accelerating global trend of digital transformation. We will target to double down our R&D investments. This investment in innovation will support Lenovo service-led transformation, take full advantage of enterprise demand recovery, drive sales in high value-added products and ultimately expand our gross margin to achieve Lenovo medium-term financial target of doubling our net margin.  
SSG is riding on the fast-growing new IT service opportunities. The group extensive exposure to commercial PC and infrastructure growth offers huge solution and service potential. Furthermore, we proactively reach and serve our customers' demand with integrated and complete solutions to improve our penetration rates. Our newly launched fully integrated TruScale brand is developed to capture the vast growth potential as-a-service segment through partnership with global system integrators and channels, enhanced capabilities and expand the platform. These factors add momentum to SSG existing strength, driving Lenovo profitability to the next level.  
For ISG, the strong infrastructure upgrade and commercialization of new technologies including edge computing, hybrid cloud solutions and 5G cloud network conversion will continue to improve the business profitability and premium to market growth in both ESMB and CSP markets. We'll continue to deliver industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expansion from server to full stack offerings.  
In ESMB, we will expand from service into storage, software-defined infrastructure software and services where opportunity exists for higher profitability.  
In CSP, we will fully integrate our unique ODM+ model to expand customer base and drive quarter-to-quarter profit improvements.  
In IDG, the commercial upgrade cycle remains strong. Moreover, Windows 11 launches super potential upside to market demand, and we lead our competition in new model launches.  
To efficiently manage the industry-wide component shortage and our demand backlog, we will enhance our leading operational excellence and global supply management. We will continue our profit expansion [indiscernible] R&D investments to drive higher value-added products, accessories and smart devices.  
Our smartphone business will remain an important driver for non-PC growth. We will focus on growing the premium to market in North America and Europe while maintaining market leadership in Latin America, will further push product innovation and accelerate 5G smartphone launches to win more market and stay on track for a profitable growth.  
In other non-PC adjacent areas, we will launch new features such as smart meeting collaboration and embedded computing products. With solid execution on all these strategic actions, we believe IDG's ASP and margin expansion will continue.  
Our strong financial position and cash flow provides a solid foundation on which Lenovo can proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead, particularly in the fast-growing services area. Finally, as always, we cannot emphasize enough to our shareholders of Lenovo's commitment to drive sustainable profitability.

My first question is on PC business. I guess over PC supply/demand remains in balance, and there is still some unfulfilled order. Could you provide some color on the older backlog by application and by market? For example, how is the recent order momentum in consumer and commercial? And how is it in developed markets and emerging markets? Is there any divergence between each segment?  
And my second question is could you provide some color on PC inventory in channels? And it will be good if you could include the product in transit because the shipping logistics cycle is getting longer. I was wondering whether the inventory is actually already back to normal in developed market if we include the product in transit?",128

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195351.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,7,"Yes. Of course, with pleasure, Yuanqing, and hello, to everybody. So actually, I think your question is twofold. One is the demand and backlog and the other one is about the inventory situation. So regarding the supply/demand, it is correct. It's still imbalance, meaning that we are seeing a very, still a very strong demand and the supply is not yet sufficient to cover all that demand. So we entered this quarter with a significant backlog. And despite record shipments, we will exit the quarter also with a significant backlog.  
Now on the mix of the demand, I think there is certainly a very strong outlook and good visibility on the commercial side. I would say this is coming all over the world, so no matter in emerging or in mature markets. And we are confident also based on our discussions with channel and with customers that there is a very strong plan for investment in IT for our enterprise and SMB customers going forward, also with visibility extend into next year.  
While on the consumer, I would say, is a mixed bag in the sense that we are seeing still a good demand. In some market, it's softening a little bit. But when I say softening is related to last year, but still higher than the pre-COVID levels, meaning higher than 2019, but we still have several markets with strong demand even in consumer. And one of the example that is very, I think, interesting is exactly the China market, where despite there is not any lockdown and all the COVID kind of things has passed. There is a very strong demand in consumer, which makes us happy as our exposure there is very significant.  
And regarding your question on inventory, I think the inventory is a little bit higher than in the last year, meaning it's getting a little bit close to normal, but still there is no any place or no any country or geography where we have an excess of inventory.  
And if I look at in transit, yes, it's a little bit longer due to the logistic lag, but I would not say anything to report that, that makes us nervous. It's less than what it was pre-COVID, and we are calling a very normal situation or even better than normal. It also has proved that we cannot unfortunately fulfill all the demand we have.",400

So if I can add some points. So definitely, we see the strong commercial demand. So if you exclude the Chromebook last quarter, so we grew by 18% in entire commercial PC. SMB was even stronger with 48% year-on-year growth. Global account was 70% to 80% year-on-year growth.  
So Windows 11 -- so it's -- so will be the key driver in the future. It has not been reflected to the last quarter's performance, but we think it will reflect to the future PC demand potential. So now the only weak segment is education. So Chromebook, you know about that. But we also see some government is planning the new incentive plan. So to give money to the schools to buy the Chromebook or PC for their students. So that's what we have seen. So we have talked PC overall demand for a couple of quarters. So now IDC has a similar view as us. So in the next couple of years, PC demand will keep at 340 million, 350 million level. So it will not drop to the level before pandemic, but it's mainly driven by the people's new working approach. So definitely, the hybrid working approach will be a new normal. So everybody needs a PC to work not just at the office, but also at home. So that will drive the high demand. So that's our view.  
And also, another trend that you can see from our last quarter's performance, our average selling price are going up significantly. So it's mainly because now our PC has come back to the center of people's lives. So every day that we use for the video conference, so that is better quality of PC. So better video audio, screen, et cetera, et cetera. So that's -- so even in the consumer space, consumer segment, you can see the average selling price going up. So that's what I want to add to Luca's comment. Thank you.",326

One is about the -- you mentioned about diversity. And I'm wondering for the long term, will you see demand versus value. That means maybe the commercial PC is gaining market share, but the personal individual PC is declining. Will this happen? That is the first question. 
And the second question is you might -- in the last conference about the IC shortage. I'm wondering, can you update what the situation at the moment? And we also see the gross margin is still very strong. I'm not sure if you can give us more color on the gross margin in the next coming quarters.",109

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195356.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,12,"Yes. So the line was a little bit blurry, but I think your first question was about the future growth of the PC market in commercial and what could happen in consumer in the longer term. 
So I think we are very optimistic in the commercial outlook, as we were saying before. And to be honest, we are also optimistic on the consumer side in the sense that the PC now is a game for everybody to enter into the digital life to access to many, many things that you cannot do from another device. So we believe that the commercial will grow, the consumer will probably not hyper grow, like it happened in the last 12 months because that was probably an exceptional situation, but we'll not go back to pre-COVID levels. And then we are aligned to the view of IDC that the market will remain in the range of 340 million, 355 million, 360 million. And probably the commercial will grow a little bit more and the consumer will lower a little bit, but still stronger than pre-COVID. 
Your second question was around IC shortage. I think the situation that we reported last quarter is still similar in this quarter. So the IC parts are still constrained, and that is related to strong demand in the IT field, but also in several other industrial areas from the electric vehicles to other areas. And we believe this situation will not necessarily improve in the short term. However, as we have, I think, demonstrated over the last several quarters, we are able to navigate that with our global local manufacturing footprint and also our hybrid manufacturing, partially in-house and partially outsourcing, we are able to better manage the Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. So we are very confident about that. 
Regarding the gross margin, you are correct, it's very strong. I think we are optimistic that we will maintain and hopefully increase this margin by selling more premium devices by having a better penetration of our accessories, of our services that is also related to the favorable outlook of commercial. I think overall, we are optimistic that we can maintain and improve our gross margin over time and extending our lead in the market share as well.",379

So I completely agree with Luca. So I also want to tell you so the commercial PC margin is higher than consumer, so particularly in SMB, so we actually have the highest margin in that segment. So the strong growth in that segment will help us to improve margin. Also -- so in the consumer, we see the trend to go to the premier segment. So this will help to maintain or increase margins as well. So regarding oversupply, so definitely. So another point I want to add to Luca's comment is Lenovo. So we pursue the Lenovo supply chain, so that we have the scale, the size to better negotiate with the upstream vendor -- suppliers. So that will give us another kind of advantage. So that's why -- so we are confident that we can ship premier volume to our -- to the market, to our key competitors. So that's another point. And also to secure the supply. 
So we have pursued some strategic buying ahead. So that's why you see our material inventory are going up in the past couple of quarters. So that's what we have done to ensure we can supply enough goods for our customers. So that's about it, next question.",210

I just wanted to ask why do we decide to withdraw the CDR? And what does that mean for the future? Does that mean we will look for another time to apply for it? Or is this plan just totally gone? So that was my first question. 
And my second question is on PC as well. So when we look at IDC numbers, Lenovo's PC shipments have been declining 2 quarters in a row on a sequential basis, but at the same time, your finished goods inventory has been climbing over the past several quarters. Is there anything we need to worry about when we look at these 2 numbers?",117

So we have given the announcement. So there is no additional comment on that. So our decision was made based on variety of reasons associated with market conditions, complexity of our businesses and definitely, the overall CDR listing process. 
But I want to emphasize since we have been listed in Hong Kong already, so the CDR was just nice to have. So even withdraw CDR, we are not changing Lenovo's fundamentals and will not impact our business as well. So as you can see, our performance is still very strong. And we are -- we have no problem to further grow in the next couple of quarters. Okay. So Luca, could you please...",131

Yes, Yuanqing. Yes. Yes, for sure. So look, despite the fact that in the last quarter, we didn't grew a premium to market, and that's only limited by our -- by the supply because when I look at our backlog, we could grow exponentially. We still managed not only to maintain the #1 position, but also to extend the lead, that is the #2. If you observe the latest IDC report, we gained in absolute almost probably a little bit less than 2 points of absolute market share. So I think we are not worried about the fact that we are not growing a premium just because we know the limitation is now supplied. And as a reaction, we are managing this supply very carefully with allocating to the right segment and to the geographies. That is one. 
And when you refer to our inventory, I think there are two kinds of inventory. I don't know which one you refer to, but the one is FGI, finished goods inventory. I don't think that represent any meaningful piece of our overall inventory, and that's quite low, I would say. It's just business as usual level of inventory for certain customers that need immediate supply. And the inventory that grew a little bit more is the parts inventory, which is related to a strategic decision, just like Yuanqing mentioned, to buy high certain parts to secure the supply. And we believe this is the right thing to do in a world where supply is very constrained. Hopefully, I answered what you were asking.",262

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195365.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,21,"Yes. Well, thank you for the question. We actually plan to increase our net margins, double our net margin over a period of 3 years. I think that primarily will be driven from the expansion of gross margin as well as, I think, obviously, through our operating efficiency, I think that actually are the -- from a pure financial perspective, the net result has increased net margin by 2%, which was 2% last year, last fiscal year, going forward, will be 4% in 2, 3 years' time. And that will be achieved by expansion of gross margin and continue our operating efficiency resulting to the result of the target of 2%. 
And in fact, if you look at Q1 as well as Q2, I think we only just passed through the first half of the 3-year period. I think we already approached about 3% net margin. So we are very confident that we can continue to follow that trajectory, especially with the transformation with the services, the SSG, which is obviously a key driver of improvement of our operating margin in addition to the continuing expansion of the profitability of our ISG business.",193
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3600.0,2424461.0,92195366.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,22,"Yes. So not just the SSG will help us drive the high margin and high profit. So actually, in all our businesses, so we will drive higher margin. So in PC, we just talked about that. So we see the market is shifting to the commercial. It's shifting to the high end of the consumer PC. So that will help us to drive a higher margin, definitely. So in the -- or even in MBG, our mobile business, and ISG, the Infrastructure Solutions business, so we will drive high margin as well. 
So actually, I don't know whether you have realized in the past quarter. So actually, although our PC business is still growing fast, still growing premium to the market. So actually, our mobile business and our ISG business grow faster than our PC business. So all 3 businesses grew more than 20% year-on-year. 
But even more importantly, so our mobile business has improved their margin and their profit significantly on past 3 years with it improved from like minus 9, minus 10 to today plus 4% to 5% in our mobile business. Even for the ISG infrastructure solution business, so we -- now we are very close to the breakeven. So we are very confident. So this quarter, current quarter, so probably we will achieve the breakeven. 
So actually, we improved the margin by or profit by 10 points over the past couple of years as well in the ISG. So I don't know whether Kirk and [ Buniac ], you want to add something here.",258

This is Kirk speaking on ISG. So yes, I'm quite confident that we're going to continue to grow profit. I think we're excited that we achieved record revenue of nearly $2 billion, significant double-digit premium to market for now 7 quarters in a row. And the profit is improving because we're applying more of our business to the in-house design and manufacturing. So we're one of the only companies in the world that can deliver a true edge-to-cloud experience, and we're seeing that pay off in both revenue growth and margin improvement. So our ODM+ model of in-house design and manufacturing now has delivered more than 50% growth in cloud. 
And as you're probably aware, because I see it every day, more of the world's data is going to be stored in the public cloud than in enterprise for the first time. And obviously, we're in a world where more data was created in the last 2 years in the entire history of the world combined. So we're now able to see 50% growth in storage, which has better profit, more than 50% growth in the cloud year-on-year. And with our in-house design and manufacturing, both of those issues as well as the services that we're attaching to that are all driving up our profit more and more every quarter. So we expect to continue to be able to deliver records quarter-on-quarter with improving profitability. Thank you.",239
