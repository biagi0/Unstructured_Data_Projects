410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3547.0,583149.0,26498901.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and happy lunar new year. I know you most likely have questions on our recent M&A deals, but before we go there, I want to talk about our outstanding performance last quarter. 
This last quarter, Lenovo delivered both record revenue and record profit. Our revenue surpassed USD 10 billion for the first time at nearly USD 11 billion. Even better, our net profit reached USD 265 million, up 30% year-on-year. We continue delivering our promise of improving our profitability. Our strong performance is the direct result of our clear strategy and consistent execution. We are focused on protecting our core PC business while aggressively are taking growth in PC Plus areas, including tablets, smartphones, servers and storage.
For PCs in a very tough marketing environment, we not only protected our #1 position with a record share of 18.5%, but also at the same time, our PC operation profit grew by 27% year-on-year. Even more impressive, our strong PC results were driven by balanced performance worldwide, strengthening both volume and profit.
In China, we improved our operation margin by one more point to reach 7.1% from 5.8% a year ago. In EMEA, we gained 4 points of market share year-on-year. In Asia Pacific, we regained the #1 position in the region. And in Americas, we were the fastest-growing company at certain one point premier to the market. While we continue to successfully protect our PC business, our attack in PC Plus business also had a very strong quarter. Our tablet sales volume was up more than 325% year-on-year to a record of almost 3.4 million units, with 4.3% worldwide market share. Every geo had a strong growth, with EMEA leading the way, growing almost 4.5x year-on-year. 
And our star products, the Yoga Tablet was particularly popular among customers worldwide. Our smartphone business continues to grow globally. Our worldwide smartphone sales volume grew almost 50% year-on-year, driven by hyper growth in Asia-Pacific and in EMEA.  Outside of China, for the first time, we sold 2 million smartphones.
Overall, we sold nearly 14 million, maintaining our strong position at the #4 worldwide. We will build on this momentum and capture the 4G opportunity, especially in China with our newest products. Even more, last month, we announced 2 deals aligned with our long-term strategy, that we will significantly increase our PC Plus business. We know these are absolutely the right investments to secure our future. Our plan is clear, and we are now building the foundation of growth for the next decade. First, we announced a deal to acquire IBM x86 server business. This deal would immediately make Lenovo the #3 player in this area globally and would make us the leader in key growth markets around the world. We will fully leverage our strength in supply chain to bring down the costs and are confident we can turn the server business into a more profitable business than PCs. This will definitely help improve our overall profitability. We also will draw on our strong channel relationships to drive hyper growth, particularly in China where demand for servers is still very strong.
Meanwhile, our planned acquisition of Motorola Mobility creates a perfect fit with our global growth strategy in smartphones. With this agreement, we will become a much stronger #3 smartphone company in the world. And already, we are mapping out a thorough integration and turnaround plan.
I'm confident that from day one after closing, we will be able to realize the synergies that are tangible and substantial, as well as introduce new products to the market. We believe that we not only can achieve significant savings from lower material costs but also can reduce E/R with our global scale. at the same time, in the iconic Motorola brand, we will definitely introduce rich and more innovative products. Those products will not only serve customers in North America and Latin America but also will be reintroduced back to China and other emerging markets where we believe customers will embrace Motorola once again.
For both of these deals, our top priority now is to work through the regulatory process and obtain approvals. We have a good understanding of this process, and we will be open and transparent with all regulatory agencies around the world. We have very strong track records in our other M&A activities, and we welcome the process as an important next step. In fact, we have reshaped our organization to accelerate the integration process once these deals close. We have created 4 business groups. The PC business group, we are focused on protecting our leadership and the profitability in PCs. The enterprise business group will drive our growth in servers and storage. Our mobile business group is in charge of continuing to grow our smartphone and tablet businesses aggressively. And our ecosystem, cloud service business group, will continue to drive monetization as well as applications and software for the best user experience.
Our new structure will go into effect on April 1 to drive even more efficiency, growth and innovation across all our business lines. Looking ahead, we are confident that our existing business will grow as we have committed to our shareholders. We are also confident that our newly acquired businesses will give us a solid foundation to build new pillars for long-term, sustainable growth. Thank you very much. Now let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming.",898
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3547.0,583149.0,26498902.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 3.
Next chart, please. We continue to have strong growth in both sales and profit with margin expansion in quarter 3. We recorded growth in all our key businesses: PCs, smartphone and tablet. Strong growth in our smartphone and tablet businesses have added an important new source of sustainable growth for the group, and MIDH business now accounts for 16% of group's turnover compared to 15% in quarter 2 and 11% a year ago.
Group sales grew 15% year-on-year to around $10.8 billion. Revenue derived from our PC and related business was up 10% year-on-year gain to $8.7 billion, driven by both shipment growth and increase in ASP. Sales in our mobile Internet business were up 73% year-on-year to $1.7 billion. Gross profit was about $1.4 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Gross profit margin dipped slightly to 12.6% from 12.7% last year and 12.9% in quarter 2. This small decline were largely due to the increased mix of the fast-growing consumer business and also the impact from a temporary interruption in the supply of casing component for our premium commercial products during the quarter.
Operating expenses increased 9% year-on-year to $1 billion in quarter 3. This includes the increase from adding new businesses, i.e., CCE and the EMC joint venture, which we only started the integration in quarter 4 last year. We have also started our efficiency improvement program early in this fiscal year with reducing resource in our PC business while redeploying the resources in our high-growth PC Plus business. This resulted in a $13 million severance expense incurred in quarter 3.
During the quarter, we recorded $22 million of profit from the liquidation of an available for sale of financial assets in quarter 3. In addition to the effects from better scaling and stringent expense control, the E/R ratio does improve from 10.1% last year and 10% last quarter to 9.5% in quarter 3.
Operating profit was $334 million, up 37% year-on-year. Increase in other nonoperating expense was mainly due to a higher financing cost from additional financing and increased factoring cost. Pretax income was $321 million, up 30% year-on-year, being the first time for it to surpass the $300 million level.
PTI margin continued to improve year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter. Effective tax rate for quarter 3 was around 17%. Profit attributable to equity holders was $265 million, up 30% year-on-year. Again, this is also a record high level for the group. 
Basic EPS improved to USD 2.56 from USD 1.99 last year.
Next chart, please. Our balance sheet in quarter 3 remains healthy. Non-current assets were about $4.7 billion, which was similar to last quarter 2. Current assets were about $14.8 billion against $13.3 billion in quarter 2, mainly due to the increase in cash and receivables, which is in line with our business growth. Inventories were relatively stable, under tight control even we continue to increase in-house manufacturing in China and Brazil, together with the consolidation of our acquisition of CCE in quarter 4.
Net current assets were around $61 million at the end of December against net liability at the end of September. The non-current liabilities were at around $1.9 billion.
Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. We continue to leverage our strong cash position to support our strategic business expansion into consumer business, mobile device business and enhancing our capability through increasing in-house manufacturing mix. Adoption of this strategy impacted on our cash conversion cycle trend. As a result, the cash conversion cycle has come down to negative 2 days in Q3 against negative 5 days last year. We recorded our operating cash inflow of around $1 billion versus outflow of $189 million in last quarter 2, and $889 million in quarter 3 last year. The cash flow derived from operations is remaining very healthy in quarter 3.
With the 2 acquisitions we announced, I want to highlight our cash position for your reference. We have net cash reserve of around $3 billion and, together with the undrawn facility, around $1.7 billion, we have a total around $4.7 billion usable cash on hand. We have to pay a total of around $2.7 billion upon closing of the 2 deals and $1.5 billion 3 years after the closing of the Motorola Mobility transaction. We still have around $2 billion usable cash after the closing. We contemplate both acquisitions will operate on the negative cash conversion cycle business model and do not require significant capital investment in short term. Together with the cash flow from operations, we have very healthy cash resource to continue to fund the growth of our existing business. We're confident that we expect growth in our core business and healthy cash flow from operations. Even with the potential short-term financial impact arising from our investment in the 2 transactions, we do not expect any change in our dividend policy.
Next chart, please. We continue to do well in all geographies in Q3 for both our PC and mobile device business and our PC Plus strategy. Our balanced geographic exposure, especially markets outside China, including Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, continue to help contribute to our top line growth. We continue to record share gains across geographies, products and customer segments.
Results of the initial expansion of our smartphone and tablet business in markets outside China were also encouraging.
China. We continue to outperform in the China PC market despite its decline and further strengthen our #1 position with a record high market share. Our PC Plus strategy continues to work well, and both our smartphone and tablet business continue to post strong unit shipment growth.
Total revenue from China was roughly flat year-on-year. Our overall margin in China was up 0.8 points year-on-year and 0.1 points quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%. This reflected the successful execution of our ""protect and attack"" strategy to protect China PC profit through tighter control on pricing and expense control, which resulted in improving PC margin while continuously attacking to mobile device markets. We will continue to invest in the PC Plus area and in LTE 4G products to position ourselves well for the growth opportunities. We remain confident that our PC Plus strategy is fully operational in China and can continue to drive growth in China.
Asia Pacific. Revenue was up 22% year-on-year to about $1.6 billion in Asia Pacific, while operating profit reached $25 million in quarter 3. We continue to perform well in Japan and maintain our leadership position. But depreciation of Japanese yen has negatively impacted sales in the region. Our drive in smartphone and tablet in this region has been encouraging, and our smartphone shipments reached over 1 million units for the first time in the region. Our operating margin was up 0.4 points to 1.5% year-on-year under the strong progress in the PC Plus area.
EMEA. We continue to have very encouraging results in EMEA with record high market share. Revenue grew 25% year-on-year to about $2.9 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets and consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. Our mobile device business, especially tablet business in Europe, has also recorded strong growth momentum. As a result, our operating margin was up 0.2 points to 1.8% year-on-year.
Americas. We continue to achieve strong growth in the American regions. Our unit shipments grew 28% against the market decline of around 3%. Revenue was up 36% year-on-year. We continue to benefit from strong growth in both commercial and consumer businesses in North America that resulted in our market gain of 1.2 points to 10.2%. We continue to deliver strong growth in Brazil. Our integration of CCE has been on track, helping us achieve a record high market share in Brazil in quarter 3 where unit shipments increased by 3.8x year-on-year.
We continue our investment in the fast-growing Brazil and Latin America businesses, coupled with competition in PC business in the region and the impact from a temporary interruption in the supply of casing components for our premium commercial products to our North American business, the operating margin of Americas region and thus resulted in a decline.  We expect the margin in this region will recover in the next few quarters.
Next chart, please. We continue to outperform the worldwide market across PCs, smartphone and tablets, driven by our solid PC Plus transformation and strategy execution. Notebook shipments and sales were up 9% and 11% year-on-year, respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 9% and up 12% year-on-year. Our MIDH business continues to show strong performance, up 73% year-on-year in sales led by the smartphone and tablet business which fueled the strong growth of the group. We will continue to invest in innovation and broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitiveness and services to our customers.
Looking ahead, we remain confident our existing business will continue to outperform the market across our key products under the solid execution of our PC Plus strategy with margin expansion. We will continue to invest in our core PC business to lead in multiple computing, accelerate our smartphone worldwide expansion and invest to prepare for LTE in China and breakthrough in tablets. We will continue to build our enterprise product portfolio and invest in ecosystems, as well as innovation across the board.
We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunities of our existing business. We are confident the trend in the growth of our existing business that we have shown in the past several quarters will continue to deliver the improvement in profitability.
The 2 acquisitions, that is the IBM low-end server business and Motorola Mobility, will further strengthen our competitiveness upon closing to position us well on our next phase of growth over time. The 2 transactions are subject to regulatory approvals, and we will update the market on our progress going forward. We have started to prepare our post-merger management process in order to ensure a smooth transition after closings.

So I'm just wondering how do you expect this Motorola business to help because your sales before the acquisition was in the investment stage and Motorola itself is running at really high operating expense ratio. So what are the areas that you have assumed previously before you do to the deal? I mean, you must have very good confidence after you've done a lot of simulations, so what could be the assumptions that you think there is a lot of room that you can remove the cost or it's mainly coming from the increase in the sales?",134
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3547.0,583149.0,26498922.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,22,"So Arthur, I would say that probably today China is the most competitive market for the smartphones. So you can see the among the top 10 sales, many come from China. So even from this Lenovo Smartphone business, so I think your -- although we only developed a couple of emerging market -- our margin, profitability in those market is still better than in China, still better than in China. So that can help with you to explain as to why we haven't been made a good money in China. And also, Arthur, we are in the past -- we've mainly -- the sell through carrier. Sell-through carrier. We cannot address high-end premium price in China. So we have now -- we have the brand to address the open market as we have premier price trends. So I believe -- with the launch of our view of the smartphone brand [indiscernible]. So we can slightly improve our profitability in China. So that's our current plan. So with this Motorola deal, definitely that gives us entrance to U.S. and Latin America and other mature market. So not only it gave the brand that we need, it gave us a much better IP position which we need. They gave us very strong carrier relationship which we need. They gave us very good talent pool which we need. So that's Motorola deal can bring us. But meanwhile Lenovo, so we have more efficient operating platform and much more efficient than manufacturing facility so we combine 2 advantages together, so we are definitely confident so we can improve the profitability with the Motorola business with the Motorola business.So that said, we actually identify the many cost savings in material cost, even if it's manufacturing cost, supply chain cost. So in the many areas, I believe we have opportunity to reduced those current cost of Motorola.",311

I think Motorola, I think our -- should get -- while Motorola is currently is well over 4 billion combined with our smartphone business that will exactly double our and then we can actively see I think the cost synergy coming out from I think from combining the 2 operation, I think the scale is at least 100%. The second piece of information that you should bear in mind as you look at the Motorola numbers is Motorola which is I think they obviously restructure the company. In terms of launching new product which is the Moto X, which is the high-end and the [indiscernible] Moto G with is the, the only have I think the Moto X is probably about 6 months and Moto G for about 3 months. So I think take that in mind that you understand what that is. I think profitability will come off improvement on margins which obviously, cost related is very important and improving efficiency I think is also directly related to an increasing in doing business. So and what Yuanqing has said, I think we obviously can leverage  -- I think the advantage, the competitive advantage of a particular portfolio which obviously, help them to add more product and more content. And bear in mind that I think in last year, I think they really have 2 brands or 2 products Moto X and Moto G. So I think combined with that, we are positive that I think we're going see on time, that definitely we'll be able to see I think financial performance.",272

I think this is -- I think the time -- the time frame is really based on -- I think we made out [indiscernible] and we obviously, have an achieved through the operating and that's the position. Now in terms of accounting write-off, there is no -- there obviously will be some, I think, one-time charges I think in the beginning when the acquisition is over.

I think based on the financial that we look at, I think there is not any.",139

So in Motorola only, that business in U.S. and Latin America. We have very limited business in other geographies or regions. So we wanted to expand to more regions in the country, including China, including other emerging markets. So in China, Motorola is still well-known, well-respected brand so we have received many positive feedback on that. And obviously, the Motorola -- the brand and the product to be relaunched in those markets. So we will -- so definitely, Motorola side -- IBM side is a very similar. It's very similar. There are 7,500 people. So I think we are significantly improve our R&D capability. So we have opportunity to like in the full range of still [indiscernible] in the market. So we have high expectation particularly in the China market and the emerging market.

The first one is on your smartphone business in China. So when I look at your reported number, it seems like the average selling price is trending down further in the quarter, and this is probably one of your lowest ASP being reported ever. Could you give us more highlights? Is this a factor that you were clearing your inventory? Or -- and how should we expect the future ASP trend?",79

So from the -- so one of the factors that we are -- we need to clear the inventory on the 3G product to prepare the 4G where the [indiscernible]. So that is one reason. Another reason is today we sell most smartphones through the carrier. So that's an area we add. So now we are -- we have the plan to sell more below the market. And with the launch of new product [indiscernible] buybacks [indiscernible], we tried to sell more premium products to the market. So if we can sell more premium products, if can sell more in the other markets that will help us to improve our ASP as well as the profitability because that's how we do.",134

So basically, on your Page 8 of presentation, you highlighted 4 potential improvements you'll be seeing, including cost savings, reducing E/R ratios, innovative products and emerging markets. So now you are also saying that immediately after you closing the deal, you should be able to realize a lot of synergy.

We are seeing a lot of synergies there. I believe that there is the global scale, a larger scale with the Lenovo capability [indiscernible] because we don't have the Motorola to spend money and material effect. As probably next step is how we can demand [ph] supply chain, in the supply chain. So today, actually, Motorola gives you margin. It's still very good. It's more than significant is to us expenses early way too high [ph]. It's way too high. So that is why [indiscernible] 1 billion dollars [indiscernible] if we combine the scale, we're more efficient operating platform of Lenovo, so definitely. So we are very confident that we can significantly reduce the expense related to [indiscernible] improve the profitability quick. So that's what I can share with you.",143

I think, Jenny, I think the product obviously have different designs, I think some underlying components which are obviously common. As I have mentioned earlier, I think one of the questions relates to the earlier question is, if you really look Motorola business and looking at our business, I think it's really above over 5 billion. So we basically increase the scale by 100%. So that obviously trend how much [indiscernible] and we create the low hanging fruit. And the others that come along I guess slowly and I think like to give a lower primarily we will increase help you under the Motorola brand. I need to confirm that Motorola today, the broadband. It's not our business and again, you see the same progress. If you look at the Motorola financial today. And in Motorola, the changes I've been meaning improve all is actually restructure the company. And we only introduced the Moto X and the Moto G I think for 6 months, so 3 months. That revenue, obviously, that's not necessarily, in our opinion, I think the full value of the brand are in doing business in different parts of the world.",195

Good evening. So do you enjoy the video? Yes, so it's our last fiscal year. So thank you for joining us today. I'm very excited to share our historical performance and our future strategy with you. 
Last quarter, we delivered outstanding results despite it being our seasonally low quarter. Revenue grew almost 20% year-on-year, while earnings increased almost 25% year-on-year to $158 million. Although China PC market was slowing down, we saw strong growth across all other 3 geos. So actually, for the first time, our EMEA geo become our largest PC geo. We also become the #1 consumer PC player in EMEA. But meanwhile, China still contributed most of our profit. We improved our -- so although our revenue didn't grow, but we improved -- in China, but we improved our PC PTI by 1 point to almost 7% there. Worldwide, not only did we strengthen our #1 PC position, but we also gained about 3 points of the market share in tablets. And we're also the world's fastest-growing major smartphone company, growing almost 60% year-on-year. For the fiscal year, our revenue reached an all-time high of nearly USD 39 billion, up 14% year-on-year. More importantly, we had record profit, with pretax income of more than USD 1 billion for the first time in our company's history. Overall, we had record earnings of USD 817 million, up almost 30% year-on-year. More impressively, we drove strong growth across all product lines. We shipped 55 million PCs, to reach our all-time high share of 17.7% worldwide. And we're the worldwide leader in every quarter of the last fiscal year. We shipped 9.2 million tablets, quadrupled our last year's volume. And we also shipped over 50 million smartphones in 26 global markets. Now we are #4 in both tablet and smartphone worldwide. We also had important success in our ecosystem business, with the Lenovo App store delivering more than 25 million downloads per day, and our SHAREit app become our first to reach the 100 million users milestone. 
So these results show the formula for success that I always talk about: clear strategy, innovative products, operational excellence and a diverse global team and culture. So this formula is clearly working. So they improve our ability to make better money in matured businesses, like PCs, and to drive growth in those that are shifting to maturity, like smartphone, tablet. So this is our stronghold because we are the best company in the world at balancing the innovation and the efficiency. Our next goal is becoming global #1 in broader PC area. Broader PC means desktop plus laptop plus tablet. So we want to become #1 in this area, so in 2 years. Now we are second place, 4 points behind the #1. So we want to catch up this gap in 2 years while building the new growth pillars in mobile and enterprise through successful integration of IBM x86 server and Motorola Mobility. Both deals are progressing through approval process. 
To stabilize its current business, IBM announced a commitment to invest $50 million more over the next 2 quarters to further drive sales and invest in business partners. Feedback from customers, channel partners have been very positive. Once the IBM deal is closed, we believe we can build a $5 billion enterprise business with higher margins than PCs in 1 year. 
On the other hand, Motorola showed a good growth last quarter, so there's just the issue that they are last quarter's earnings. The launches in key markets like India, Brazil and the U.K. have been very successful. And the new Moto products, including Moto E and Moto G LTE, so -- have been very positive. We just got news from them. So after they launched the Moto G -- Moto E in India, so actually in 2 hours, they sold out all the products. So we believe, with Lenovo's scale and our operational excellence, so we are confident to turn this business around in 4 to 6 quarters after the deal close. So this is still our expectation or plan. And once we close this deal, so we aim to sell 100 million mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, in the coming year. 
So Lenovo has a proven track record that we turned the IBM PC business from losing hundreds of millions dollars a year to today, Lenovo's cash crop and the global leader. We have successfully integrated NEC in Japan, Medion in Germany, CCE in Brazil. We created a global team, global culture and a global winner. Now we will drive even stronger future growth in our mobile and enterprise business. So we understand that investing in these 2 new businesses or 2 acquisitions will impact our short-term performance, but we are very firm that we should do this to secure our sustainable growth. Balancing short-term and long-term performance is a true test of management commitment. 
In the year ahead, so our strategy, we are focused on protecting PCs and attacking in mobile, enterprise and the ecosystem cloud services. So Protect and Attack is still our strategy. Our Triple PLUS strategic roadmap starts with PC plus mobile to form our Smart Connected Devices portfolio. So in these products, we will leverage our innovation, strong channels and operational excellence across all devices. So when you add the servers and the storage, so you get our total device portfolio. Lenovo is one of the few companies that can offer a full range of products. Then we add the cloud product and the services to create a unique Lenovo experience to drive even more value to our customers. So that's our strategy going forward. 
So this last year was the most successful year in Lenovo's history, yet we are prepared to again unlock substantial growth in acquisitions. So with the combination of our existing and the new businesses, Lenovo offers tremendous value to our shareholders today, and our value will be even greater in the future. 
Thank you, everyone. Now let me turn this stage to Wai Ming, our CFO. Wai Ming, please?",1011

Good evening, everybody. I will take you through the Lenovo financial and operational performance for our quarter 4 as well as the full fiscal year 2014. Next slide, please? 
Fiscal year 2014 was a year of success for Lenovo, and Q4 was another quarter, as we continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion. Even more, I think cash flow from our operations has also improved significantly compared to that of last year. We recorded growth in all our key businesses and, at the same time, further improved our profitability. We finished the fiscal year with record-high revenue. Group revenue was up 14% to around $39 billion. PC sales, up 7% year-to-year to around $31.8 billion, driven by the shipment growth as well as increasing ASP. Sales in our mobile device business, up 86% year-on-year to about $5.7 billion. Gross profit for the fiscal year was about $5 billion, up 14%. Margin -- gross margin stayed flat year-to-year at 13.1%. Operating expenses increased 11% year-to-year to about $4 billion. This included a $79 million severance payment for the year as part of our efficiency improvement program. Even with that, our E/R was down year-on-year to 10.4% compared with 10.7% last year. Operating profit and pretax income surpassed the $1 billion mark and up 32% and 27%, respectively. It was the first time in our history that we have passed our PTI over $1 billion. PTI margin was 2.6% versus last year at 2.4%. Profit for the year was $817 million against $631 million, the gain up 29%. Profit attributable to equity holders was $817 million, up 29% year-to-year. We continue to be on track in our margin expansion program, announced about 7 quarters ago, to improve PTI margin by 1 percentage point in 3 years' time. 
For quarter 4, revenue was up 19% year-to-year to around $9.4 billion. Gross profit was up 18% year-to-year to $1.2 billion. Operating profit increased by 37% year-to-year to $231 million. Other nonoperating expenses was $19 million, mainly attributable to increased financing costs, including factoring as well as local borrowing costs as we further expand our business. Pretax income was $212 million, up 28% year-to-year. Profit attributable to equity holders was $158 million, up 25% year-to-year after netting off a $10 million noncontrolling interest from the profit recorded in the Compal JV in the quarter. 
Basic earnings per share is USD 0.0153 in quarter 4 and USD 0.0788 for the full year. The board decided this morning to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.18 per share. Next slide, please? 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Noncurrent assets as of 31st March 2014 was about $5 billion. The increase from the previous year was largely due to an increase of our in-house manufacturing and related facilities in China. Current assets were around $13.4 billion. Increase in inventory were largely due to the increase in our in-house manufacturing and our increased mix of our consumer business, which is in line with our business growth. Other changes in the current assets and current liabilities were due largely to our increased level of activities. Overall, our balance sheet remains healthy, despite quarter 4 typically being a low season for us. We have net current liabilities around $62 million as of 31st March 2014. The noncurrent liabilities were around $1.9 billion. Next slide, please? 
Our cash position remains very healthy. As of 31st March 2014, we have net cash of around $3.5 billion. We continue to do well in managing our working capital. For the full year, inventory days were 28 days, up 7 days against last year due to our expansion in the consumer business as well as in emerging markets and the ramp-up of our new in-house manufacturing capabilities. Receivable days was around 35 days, flat year-on-year. Payable days were 65 days, up 1 day against last year. As a result, our cash conversion cycle for the fiscal year was negative 2 days compared with negative 8 days the year before. For quarter 4, our cash conversion cycle changed from negative 7 days to negative 4 days, very similar to our full year trend. 
Our operating cash flow has improved significantly during the quarter. We have recorded net cash generated from operations around $1.4 billion for the full year versus $20 million outflow -- $20 million for the last year and 609 -- sorry, $469 million in quarter 4 this year. Again, a cash outflow of $679 million the same quarter last year. To further improve our financial position, we have issued a USD 1.5 billion 5-year notes with a coupon rate of 4.7% in early May. The notes were well received by the market. In fact, the issue is the largest ever unrated bond issuance by a non-Japanese Asian company. Our cash position remains very strong, even taking into consideration paying about $2.8 billion for the 2 acquisition at the closing. Next chart, please? 
Our balanced geographic exposure continue to help contribute to our top line growth. Strong performance in EMEA and AG, up 27% and 31%, respectively, despite sales decline in China. Markets outside China now account for around 62% of the group sales compared with 37% last year. In fact, our PC revenue in EMEA in quarter 4 has surpassed our PC business in China for the first time in our history. We continue to record share gain across geography, product and customer segments under our strategy. For China, we continue to outperform in the China PC market despite this decline and further strengthen our #1 position with a strong market share. Our strategy continue to work well, as both our smartphone and tablet business continue to post strong growth. Total revenue from China was up 1% year-on-year. Our overall margin in China, up 0.9 points year-on-year to 5.4%. This reflected the successful execution of our strategy to protect our China PC business, a profitable business, through tighter control of pricing and as well as expense control, while continuously, we attack into the mobile device market, which show significant growth in top line as well as improved profitability. For Asia Pacific, revenue up 12% year-to-year to about $6.2 billion in Asia Pacific. Operating profit recorded -- reached record high of $109 million. Strong performance in Japan, especially in the commercial PC segment, supported our overall improvement in the region. Our drive in smartphone and tablet in this region has also been encouraging, and our smartphone shipment surpassed 3 million units in the region for the fiscal year. Our operating margin, up significantly by 0.7 percentage points to 1.8% for the year due to the scaling benefit as well as expense control. For EMEA, we continue to see -- we continue to have very encouraging results in the region, with record-high market share. Revenue grew 27% year-on-year to about $9.6 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets and consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. We became the largest consumer PC player in the region for the first time in Q4. Our mobile business, including smartphone and tablet, in the region has also recorded strong growth momentum. The overall operating margin for the region was up 0.5 percentage points to 2%, again, due to scaling benefit as well as good expense control. For Americas, we continue to achieve strong growth in the American region. Revenue up 31% year-on-year. We benefit from the strong growth in both commercial as well as the commercial business in North America, resulting our market share gain of 1.7 points to a record high to 10.5%. In quarter 4, we became the #3 player in the U.S. market, the first time for the group. We also continue to deliver strong growth in Brazil. Operating margin of the American region was down 0.5 points year-to-year to 0.08% (sic) [0.8%], which was mainly due to the increased consumer business exposure, as well as there is an impact on the mechanical power supply interruption affecting our North American business, sadly, in quarter 3. However, the issue largely been fixed in quarter 4, and we're happy to see operating margin of our North American business has recovered. Meanwhile, we continue our investment in the fast-growing Brazil and Latin America business to build our foundation. Next chart, please?
We have a more balanced product portfolio, helped by our expansion in consumer PC and mobile device business, with growth and share gain in each of those key devices. The revenue contribution for the mobile device business increased to 15% this year compared with 9% last year, with improving profitability. I want to take this opportunity to report the status of our 2 recent corporate transactions. Both transactions are still pending approval from the relative authorities, and we expect both transactions to close in quarter 3. We have started our post-merger management work so as to ensure a smooth transaction after the closings, which will enable us to secure the planned synergy resulting from a seamless integration from day 1 after close. Looking ahead, we believe our existing business will continue to outperform the market across our key products under the solid execution of our strategy, and we will continue our margin improvements. For our PC business, we'll continue to invest in branding and innovation in order to enable us to continue to outperform the market. However, performance may vary in different geographies or regions depending on their respective general economic environment. Smartphone and enterprise business are key to enable our continuing growth, and we'll invest to build our enterprise business and accelerate our smartphone worldwide expansion and to prepare for LTE 4G products in China. In the meantime, we'll begin to invest in the ecosystem and cloud services to support the further growth of our device business. We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiative and growth opportunities of our existing business. We are very confident the trend in the growth of our existing business that we have shown in the past several years will continue to deliver the improvement in profitability. Addition to the 2 businesses, after the final approvals, will definitely further strengthen the company's competitiveness in driving a sustainable growth in the next several years.

Two questions. The first is with regard to this MIDH performance. I think previously, the management indicated that you're in product transition, but actually, if you really look into the details, it seems that the numbers actually is quite encouraging. So could you let us know how is the mix between China and overseas? And then within China, what is carrier channel sales as opposed to the open channel sales? Because there's a lot of concern about this potential cut from the subsidies and the coming impact to this overall market demand. That's my first question.",101

So thank you. Regarding our smartphone business, so last year, we shipped 50 million units. So among that, around 45 million was sold in China and 550 -- no, 5.5 million outside of China, mainly emerging markets. So actually, we are very satisfied with the progress in the emerging markets. So in some countries, we have already reached double-digit shares and make very good profit, like Indonesia -- like in Indonesia. So that's the mix of the sales last year. So overall, so we grew by 60% year-on-year. But China is lower, but the rest of the world is much higher. So probably 100 -- 200% year-on-year growth. Regarding of the China smartphone, so carrier is still -- 70%? Probably 70%, so -- than the open market. So recently, we also opened a new route to sell to the end-users, which is online channels, so -- and also in other routes. So we do both, so the surplus channels, like Jingdong; like [indiscernible]. So -- and also, we are building our sales official -- so how to say, our sales channel, so our sales official channel to sell. So we believe, in the next year, so we can sell more through the Internet channel. So now we have 3 routes to sell to the market: the carrier, open market retailers and to the Internet channel. We have 3 more doors.",231

So last year, China PC market was slowing down, so definitely. So although Lenovo continued to outperform the market, so -- but I think now the market has become more stable. So probably, it has already hit the bottom. So we can -- but probably, in 1 to 2 quarters, so -- there will be still a little bit of negative growth. But we are still confident, so probably in the second half of the year, so the market will turn to the positive. And also, we believe the cannibalization of the tablet has been very limited. So probably more cannibalization come from the smartphone. So many people use smartphone as their first Internet device. So we had a little bit of cannibalization. But we are still confident on the total China PC market. So actually, today, China, as a PC market, is still smaller than U.S. market. So that's not the right thing. So I think, at the least, they should be the same scale or a little bit bigger.",175

My first question is about margins for your overseas market. In Asia Pac and EMEA, it seems like your operating margins for the quarter were actually quite strong. Can you talk about the trend that you see over the next few quarters? And also, in Americas, you just see a margin decline, it seems. Can you talk about maybe what were you doing in Brazil and how you're improving the margins in that country?",78
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, May 21, 2014",2014-05-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3632.0,641619.0,28737828.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,18,"So in PC area, definitely, we are committed to further improve the margin and the PTI. And as Wai Ming just said, we are on track to deliver our commitment to improve the existing business PTI by 1 point in 3 years, so starting from 7 quarters ago. So over the past 7 quarters, I think we have delivered our commitment, definitely. Five more quarters to go. So we are still committed to this improvement, particularly in the PC space with our current scale, with our current competitiveness, so we are very confident we can further improve our PC margin. So actually, you have seen -- China is a good -- is a role model. So actually, last quarter, even market was very slow, but we still improved our PTI by 1 point in China to reach almost 7% PTI. So now, so actually, EMEA is improving PTI significantly. So last quarter, they're keeping [ph] with a $75 million PTI. So that's pretty impressive. So even Asia Pacific, Japan, so we are improving the profit margin. So we are confident that we can further deliver the improvement. But definitely, after we close the 2 deals, so probably we need to give you -- given the way to track the improvement but -- so more focusing on the PC will be the right thing. So this is always a Lenovo management commitment. So while we will focus on the short-term performance, we also need to build the foundation for the sustainable growth for the future. So we will invest, not just squeeze every penny into the bottom line.",267
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, May 21, 2014",2014-05-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3632.0,641619.0,28737829.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,19,"So maybe let me elaborate, give a little more color on the, I think, the margin maybe in North America. I think there are 2 reasons for primarily the significant improvement of the operating margin in Asia Pacific. I think one country which actually have been doing fantastic, very, very well, fantastically well, is actually Japan. I think, as I mentioned in my presentation, I think we continue to take out -- I think improve efficiency by taking out headcount and redeploying into the growth area. I think a lot of those actually happened in the beginning of the year, and we definitely see Japan -- I think the markets have significant year-to-year growth in Q3 and Q4, and partly due to, I think, the window -- I think exiting -- exit our -- or Microsoft lost a point in the XP-based [ph] ecosystem, as well as I think the change in the tax for consumer in Japan that accelerate, I think, the business, I think, in Q4. So you can actually see this business in a way that's very simple. If you'll be able to control your expense when you actually have your top line growth, immediately, it flow to the bottom line. So that is really generally, I think, how we -- why -- how and why we're so confident that we continue to see opportunities to see further improvement in margin in areas like AP, EMEA, as well as North America. Now commenting on the AG. On a year-to-year basis, obviously, it's declined, I think partly because of our, again, what Yuanqing said, Protect and Attack. We've been extremely aggressive, I think, in attacking, I think, the growth areas in Latin America and in Brazil. North America, I think, if you recall, Q3, we actually had some problem partly because we have some, I think, supply issue, I think, in some of the hinges in some of the factory. And that actually still have an impact on our North America business. But Q4, by and large, I think the issue resolved. I think they recover. You see that Q-to-Q. I think the AG margin actually improved, but compared with the year before. But this year, we'll obviously, I think, put a little effort in attacking and growing the business. I think you may recall that, I think, Brazil, we actually reached, I think it's probably #1. I don't have the IDC number for Q4, but you can actually see how the, I think, the overall Lenovo strategy, Protect and Attack, I think we actually get a lot more probably the protect area and then we attack and have the super growth. As a result, I think, we deliver more balance on a group basis as well as on the geo basis.",464

Can you talk a little more about what your outlook is for that segment, especially given that media reports today have said that the Chinese government is going to possibly block procurement of Windows 8 operating system for the PC?",48

So we can give the Windows 8 to customers. We can give the Windows 7 to customers. We can even give the Linux and/or Chrome to our customers based on their requirement. So we have no problem, so to sell the planned PC, the volume, to the market.",75

We're obviously, I think, optimistic in the overall, I think, personal computer, I think, industry as a whole. I think specifically, on commercial, we definitely see in mature market some very positive sign, I think, in the SMB area. I think we definitely, if you look at our results over the last couple of quarters, I think we can begin to see some relationship towards large enterprise business picking up, but we definitely are very -- sort of have a much more positive outlook on the SMB business.",98

I'm Leping Huang. So I have 2 questions. First question is about your server, the IBM server business. We see IDC say their server business, the -- I've been seeing the market share for IBM server drop quite sharply after -- I mean, in Q1. So what -- do you have maybe -- it's IBM business, but can you elaborate why the market -- why they lost market share significantly? Also, you see -- you're still showing confidence you can have $5 billion revenue. What's the -- so this business will be bring back, or can you elaborate more detail on this one?",107

So actually, so IBM is more focusing on the profitability. So if you don't have the profit, so probably they will not do the business. So that's why -- so in the past, so when they competed with HP, with Dell, so they're not strong enough, so to win the deal or to win the customer, so because that's not their strategy. So recently, become even more tough because of the competition. It's not just coming from the HP and the Dell. It's also coming from those so-called white box or OEMs because they directly sell to those high-PTC company, data center company like Google, like Amazon, with their customized models. So definitely, we understand the trend. So that's why we want to do the deal, because we can handle better than them. We can handle better than them. So we will do manufacturing by ourselves. We will do manufacturing by ourselves. We will have a more efficient platform so that not only we can compete with HP and Dell with more efficiency, but also, we can compete with those white box with a better brand, with a better technology. So that's why we are still confident, so we can build a $5 billion business with better than PC margin or PTI.",230

I think one area which IBM is traditionally not strong, which is the channel business. We obviously -- Lenovo has been very strong, I think, in the PC channel. Obviously, with the IBM product portfolio, I think with our capability in the channel, we definitely feel that, apart from what Yuanqing said, that we being more effective in competing in more commoditized business, we definitely can do better, as well as we actually have channel experience and capability, which is on top of what IBM is strong in, more direct in relationship business.",98

So you gave us quite confidence on this -- IBM's $5 billion sales, with higher margin in PC. Do you have any confidence on the Moto brand smartphone business in terms of revenue scale or the margin, higher than PC?",51
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, May 21, 2014",2014-05-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3632.0,641619.0,28737837.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,27,"So to be frank, so when we announced the 2 deals, so I had more confidence on IBM. But so you have seen the results that they just announced. So actually, last quarter, so Moto was performing very well. So actually, they exceeded our expectation of the plan that they gave us when we negotiated. So it's ahead of their plan to turn around the business, not just on the profitability. So profitability is better than what we expected, but also in the volumes, in the revenue growth, so way above our expectations. So the Moto G is selling very well, not just in North America and Latin America but in some new markets like Europe, Asia Pacific as well. Recently, they just launched Moto E, and there's a Moto G new version. So they were launching more models, so in September. The review has been very positive. So for example, Moto E, they're first launched in India. So they just told us, in just the 2 hours, they're sold out, all the -- the first batch of the products. And also, so Moto G -- both Moto G and Moto E's margin are very good. So that can help to further improve the profitability.",205

My name is Jean-Louis, and my first question is on the China PC business. I'd like to know -- the margins have been coming up very strongly. I'd like to know how structural that is, so in other words, if we continue to have a flat sales in China PC, can you maintain your segment operating profit at the high level that we are currently?",70

I think, again, if you really look at the entire what I call the personal computing device business, it's primarily, I think, comprising desktop, notebook and tablet. Obviously, if you really analyze the numbers, I think in terms of units, it's actually continued to grow. But as a total market today, I think that the business is $200 billion. I think today, we are probably, although a #1 or probably #2, if you have tablet and PC, there's a long way for us to grow our market share. So the way we look at it is, I think, maintaining or even improving profitability. Again, if you really look at the profile of the business coming out from different geography, we obviously have excellent execution ability in China, and that was demonstrated. Even the market is not growing. We'd been able to through, I think, controlling our pricing and improving our efficiency by expenses, we'd be able to improve the margin. Set that aside. If you really look at, I think, the region like EMEA, like American region or Asia Pacific, now the key for us is obviously to improve the overall operating efficiency. Now if you'll actually be able to control your cost and any additional or incremental revenue coming out from gaining share from your competitors, which we have been doing it for the last 3, 4 years, that actually will continue to improve the margin. Now again, if you really look at the EMEA margin today, American region margin, Asia Pacific margin, I think there's a long way for them to go before even close to have a China margin. So we're definitely, I think, first, very confident about overall personal computing business as a whole; and secondly, we continue to believe that, I think, the capability or the strength of Lenovo is really focused on execution. We'll continue to be able to drop to -- able to control costs or expenses, at the same time, be able to increase share. On that basis, I think if you compare with the margin differential between our, I think, best-in-class of China versus the others, there's a lot of room for us, I think, to go from that from here.",373

Looking at the smartphone, do you have a target for FY '15 to give us some sort of year-over-year growth you're expecting in units? And just by that measure, at what point do we see uplift in profitability, depending on the scale that you expect to achieve?",55

And then the current fiscal year. So smartphone and tablet are managed by our new mobile growth, so their target is selling 100 million units, 100 million units in the fiscal year. Definitely, it could include some Motorola volume, but not a full year. So we hope we can close the deal on time. So that will be our target. But this 100 million include -- includes both smartphone and the tablet, Android-based devices, let me say, in this way because our Windows-based device is in PC growth. So it's a little bit different, so because, as Wai Ming said, today, if we view PC, so we actually, I think, all 3 categories: PC desktop, laptop and the tablet. But our PC -- but when we develop the products, so we must group based on the operating system, so Android is Android, Windows is Windows. So that would be our target, definitely. So in short term, making money is not the key priority, so we still want to build the scale. So today, we have only 4-point-something market share in both smartphone and tablet, Android tablet. So that's not at the scale so you can make money. At the least, you must have the tablet in the shares so you can make the very good money. So that will be our target, so to build the scale for us. But we will not lose too much money. So actually, today, in China, so our smartphone business is a breakeven business. So outside of China smartphone business, in emerging market, is making money business. It's making a very, very, very good margin, so particularly in a market like Indonesia.",285

We actually look at the business as a whole. Clearly, I think, our key -- our personal computing device business, which is our protect us, and it will continue to drive profit. And I just explained that we are -- remain very confident that I think there are a lot more profit to be made. But at the same time, the high growth is really, I think, the smartphone business, I think, partly because, I think, other than China, we're #2. I think in many parts of the world, we begin to go into that. And therefore, for us, I think the top priority is really to do on the volume, as Yuanqing said. I think we believe that unless you actually have a reasonable market share, where you can actually leverage the synergy and then turn it into a profit. But at this point in time, our smartphone business in China, although we are #2, we still have a gap with the #1. I think we still focus on, I think, with the combination, continue to, I think, grow our top line, but at the same time, we are not -- I think our China business at the moment is not loss-making, but we begin to get into emerging markets. And hopefully, I think, by the time when we close Motorola, we'll have a much bigger business and leverage on a global basis. I think that will -- I think the profitability will eventually, I think, become a major contributor. But definitely, for the next 12 months, I don't see that as the case.",301

The competition is more fierce there. Not just other multinational player are there, but we have a lot of local players. So the competition is more there. It's very hard to make money. But in emerging markets, as I said, probably, it's easier to make money. So if you can enter the mature market, you can make even better money. But the problem is, whether you -- you can't enter the mature market because the barrier, the key barrier is IP, is IPR [ph]. For those Chinese players, if they don't have any IP, so probably they need to prepare 25% to pay the royalty to the -- no competitiveness at all, but with the Motorola deal, we think we will have the better position on the IPR. So we will be competitive in the market.",151

So more question on the Motorola side. You just mentioned IPR. I think you did this due diligence before you acquired Motorola. In terms of a IPR rate, I mean, especially U.S. and Euro market, how much royalty saving can you have after Motorola acquisition? You can give us any ballpark or wide range of the number? And then you said you can turn Motorola business around next 4 to 6 quarter after acquisition. You can turn Motorola business around in 4 to 6 quarter. But if you look at Motorola, their last year, they made a profit -- it was 2006, before iPhone launch. And they lost $5 billion non-GAAP loss since 2007, plus $3 billion restructuring costs. So today, you don't make much money with the smartphone business, but I believe there is substantial cost saving from this deal. So can you work through a little bit more detail how -- where is the best synergy you have in terms of saving through this acquisition so you can quickly turn this business around?",182

So probably, we need to factor in that 5% of our total revenue -- total sales. But with the Motorola deal, so at least 15% we can sell, so it's a sale. To say...",53
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, May 21, 2014",2014-05-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3632.0,641619.0,28737847.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,37,"Well, I can comment. I think the way to look at it is, I think if you -- assuming that you do not own any IPs, if you were to go to the mature market, just looking at the IT -- IP owners, roughly, you're talking about 25%, I think, of your ASP. Now Motorola, obviously, today, I think they have very strong cross-licensing agreement. They're probably paying around 10% or even lower than that, so that's -- so it's not a saving, per se. It's really if you don't have the IP, you have to pay 25%, I think, rather than cost saving. Now let me turn to the question on why we are so confident, as Yuanqing said, that we, I think, between 4 to 6 quarters, we can turn around. Now I think that we probably need a little bit more work in looking at the conversation [ph] with P&L. I think Motorola -- I think if you really go into detail, Motorola, last year, in fact, they actually relaunched their product. I think Motorola, under the Google ownership, rather than continue to run as a device business, they actually concentrate in developing, I think, the best-in-class Android operating system on Motorola. Rather than, as I said, rather than run on a worldwide basis, I think they cut their workforce, it used to be around 40,000, to about 3,000, 4,000. So last June, I believe, I think they believe that they actually have the best product they can actually launch in the market only initially in North America. And then this on the Moto X, which is the high end of the market, and then you have main market product, Moto G, only in Latin America. But bear in mind that Motorola, in fact, is actually global. They used to actually sell everywhere and can easily have, I think, over 10% market share. Now if you really look at the P&L, I think, let's take the margin, I think, is exactly sort of positive area. But since they're only sort of doing one country, North America, for 6 months, compare this as a global business, as well as the mainline product, I think Moto G, only 3 months in Latin America. Now obviously, this is not an expense issue, this is a scaling issue. Now as Yuanqing just said, I think when we look at their roadmap, they obviously have been growing significantly above the normal market rate. I think the way to look at it is because the comparison last year, as I said, I think if you really -- assuming that they actually do exactly the same, I think in North America, it's already double. But let alone the fact that they actually relaunched Motorola in Europe, which has been very successful. They actually relaunched in India. It was very successful. So we are very, very confident that their top line continued to grow significantly above, I think, the market. And in fact, as Yuanqing just said, I think looking at their quarter 1 results, I think their volume is already well above, I think, their roadmap. And let -- take that momentum continue, and in fact, it was well demonstrated by the successful launch of Moto E about a week ago. I think we are very, very confident that this business can be turned around. So the Motorola, I just think that is not simply an expense issue. I think this is a scaling issue, and we believe that the Motorola brand is a strong brand, is a global brand, and the revenue -- or put it simply, the revenue that we recorded last year, resulting a significant operating loss, does not represent the business that Motorola can do, I think, on a, I think, on a run rate basis.",636

I'm very happy to share our last quarter's results with you. This has been a quarter of many milestones for Lenovo. So let's jump right into it. This last quarter, our revenue grew 18% year-on-year, while our earnings increased 23% to USD 214 million. We continue to deliver our financial commitments, especially on improving profitability. Our strong performance was driven by growth across all product lines and all geos. In PCs, we gained almost 3 points of share to reach our all-time high of nearly 20%, and to strengthen our position as the worldwide leader. We gained share in every geo. In tablets, we hit a new milestone. With 67% year-on-year growth, Lenovo become #3 in the world for the first time. We are particularly strong in Eastern Europe. In Russia, we become #1. In combined PCs and tablets, we closed the gap with Apple to just 0.7 points.
As I said the last quarter, becoming #1 in the PC plus tablet category in 2 years is our goal. Well, we might not need that long. In smartphones, we become #1 in China for the first time. Our strong performance was driven by demand for our new smartphones, as China transitions to 4G and by expanding our routes to market. Even better, we saw hypergrowth outside of China at 350% year-on-year, especially in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Respectively, they grew nearly 300%, over 500% and 50%. Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia also had good profitability at 4% and 3%, respectively. Now almost 20% of our smartphone volume came from outside China, up from just 5% a year ago.
Overall, we are #4 in smartphones worldwide with sales in 36 countries. We also saw continued growth in our newest businesses. Our enterprise business had a volume growth of more than 33% year-on-year, and our ecosystem business continues to grow with the daily downloads now over 27 million. And after SHAREit, SECUREit become our second app with more than 100 million users.
Our business results have never been as balanced as today. Only 3 years ago, China was almost half of our revenue, but now even though our China business keeps growing, it's just over 1/3 of our revenue. That's because EMEA, Americas and Asia-Pacific geos, all have achieved rapid growth and gained strong momentum. In particular, EMEA volume grew more than 50% year-on-year. The last time we saw such an incredible growth rate was in China back in 2010. We only started our consumer business in EMEA 3 years ago, but now we are #1 in consumer PC there. In Americas, the U.S., was a star performer. In PC, we had a record market share. And Asia-Pacific delivered significant improvements in profitability, fueled by Japan, which has become our new profit pool for Lenovo. So even as the emerging markets faced some challenges, Lenovo's overall business is healthy, growing steadily, and you can expect the future to be even better.
These results clearly show that our formula for success, clear strategy, innovative products, operational excellence, and the diverse culture, global team continues to work. And our balance of innovation and efficiency is a core strength. We will apply our strengths to successfully integrate both Motorola Mobility and IBM x86 server business. Both deals remain on schedule for closing.
For Motorola, they are already winning in the market, and their recent results show why they can be our growth engine for Lenovo in the future. Not only is the product portfolio is strong, but also, the results are improving significantly with sellout [ph] product launches in key markets like India and Brazil and the rave reviews for the premium products that are driving growths in mature markets. Once our acquisition is complete, we will be able to bring more innovative products to more customers worldwide. We remain confident we can turn it around in 4 to 6 quarters after the deal closes.
For IBM x86, we have seen the business stabilize in the last quarter. In particular, they achieved continuous growth in China. We remain confident that once the IBM deal is closed, we can build a $5 billion enterprise business with a higher margin than PCs in 1 year. Both acquisitions will further strengthen Lenovo to grow across all lines of businesses.
In PCs, with the market becoming stabilized, we expect our strong growth to continue worldwide, especially outside of China because market share there are still lower. We will strengthen our position in every geo by leveraging both our momentum and the opportunity from industry consolidation to drive profitable growth.
In tablets, as we predicted 2 years ago, the market is squeezed by convertible PC on the high end and by a phablet on the low end. In the future, it may not be an independent category. It will be split into 2 categories, either a low-end niche PC, focusing on media consumption, which includes 8-inch or bigger, some with an optional attached keyboards or a big-screen smartphone, phablets. We are strong in both parts, and we launched a new generation of exciting products to attack both categories in the second half of this year.
In smartphones, the market continues to shift from premiere to mainstream entry segments, and we definitely know how to leverage this strength as we have done in the PC stage. In the intensively competitive China market, we are working to solidify our #1 position by our taking in premier price spend [ph] and by expanding our routes to market through the open market and the online channels. Meanwhile, we will be more aggressive in emerging markets, which is our stronghold and where we see even more opportunity.
Finally, we will integrate Motorola to make us an even stronger worldwide player. Definitely, the first quarter gave us momentum, and we are off to a strong start. We are well positioned in all product lines and geos to not only grow share but also increase profitability. And while our acquisitions close, we will be fully ready to compete across all smart connected devices, infrastructure devices and in the ecosystem space.
Thank you, everyone. Now let me turn this to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",1034
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 14, 2014",2014-08-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3403.0,683241.0,30306404.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 1. Next chart, please. We continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion by shipment growth. Even more, cash flow from our operation has also improved significantly compared to the same quarter last year. We recorded growth in all our key businesses and at the same time, further improved our profitability.
Group sales grew 18% year-on-year to around $10.4 billion. Our mobile device business, including phones and tablets, were up 32% year-on-year to $1.6 billion. PC and personal technology product-related sales were up 16% year-on-year to around $8.5 billion. Sales of other goods and services were $294 million, up about 6% year-on-year.
Gross profit for quarter 1 was about $1.3 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Gross profit margin was 13% against 13.6% last year. The decrease was due to the increased mix from faster-growing consumer business, as well as changing geographic mix.
Operating expense increased by 8% to $1.1 billion. This included $4 million severance expenses incurred for the year as part of the efficiency improvement program. Even with that, our E/R improved from 11.3% to 10.3% due to scaling benefits and strengthened expense control.
Operating profit in quarter 1 was $283 million, up 40% year-on-year. We recorded non-operating expenses of $90 million, which included interest expenses of $10.5 million accrue for the USD 1.5 billion 5-year notes with a coupon rate of 4.7% we issued in early May.
Profit for the period was to $211 million, up 24%. Profit attributable to equity holders were $214 million, up 23% year-on-year. The difference between the 2 profit lines was due to our joint venture partner sharing of loss in relation to the Compal JV.
Next chart, please. Our balance sheet remains strong. Non-current asset were about $5.2 billion, and current assets were about $15.5 billion as of 30th of June 2014. Increasing bank deposit in cash was largely due to that cash obtained from the U.S. dollar note issuance in May this year, where net current assets are around $1.5 billion at the end of June. The non-current liabilities were at around $3.4 billion.
Now let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. Our cash position remained very healthy. As the end of June, we have net cash of around $3.6 billion. The quarter-to-quarter increase of our bank deposits and cash was mainly due to the $1.5 billion cash raised from the U.S. dollar notes.
We continue to do well in managing our working capital for quarter 1. Inventory days were at 28, up 1 day against last year due to our continuous expansion into the consumer business and emerging markets and ramp-up [ph] of our new in-house manufacturing. Receivable days were 32, decreased 4 days year-on-year. Payable days were 66 days, reduced by 2 days against last year. As a result, the cash conversion cycle for the quarter was at negative 6 days, again, a negative 1 day last year. The quarter-on-quarter change is largely due to the growth of our commercial business.
Our operating cash flow has improved significantly during the quarter. We have recorded net cash generated from operations of around $378 million in quarter 1 against $140 million the same quarter last year. We remain at a very strong cash position for working capital needs to drive future growth.
Next chart, please. As Yuanqing just highlighted, we continue to record share gain across geographies, products and customer segments under our strategy. And our balanced geographic exposure continued to help contribute to our top line growth. Strong revenue growth of EMEA and AP helped drive top line growth despite China PC industry still experience a decline. And at the same time, both regions record a significant improvement in their operating margins. They both achieved their record high levels driven by strong growth.
The revenue from China was up about 2% year-on-year driven by the balanced growth between our PC and mobile device businesses. We continue to protect our profit pool, and our China overall margin fully improved by 0.3 points year-on-year to 5.5%.
Our PC revenue show a year-on-year growth of about 1%, as we further strengthened our #1 position with a strong market share and continued to outperform in the China PC market despite its decline. Our China PC operating margin improved by 0.2 points year-on-year to 7%.
Smartphone continues to demonstrate strong growth momentum. In quarter 1, we surpassed Samsung to become #1 in China smartphone market for the first time, and the profitability of our mobile device business continued to improve in the quarter. We continued to solidify our China smartphone business and focus on profitable growth in this highly competitive market. In order to enhance our competitiveness, we invest in product innovation in the 4G smartphone and further broaden routes to market.
Asia-Pacific, revenue was up 20% year-on-year to about $1.6 billion in Asia-Pacific region. Strong performance in Japan, especially in the commercial PC business, supported our overall improvement in the region. Our drive in smartphone, particularly in the ASEAN regions, has continued to be encouraging. Our operating margin was up significantly by 3.2 percentage points to a record high level of 4.1% driven by the growth in scale for both PC and mobile device businesses.
EMEA. We have excellent results in EMEA with record high market share and improvement in profitability. Revenue grew 49% year-on-year to about $2.8 billion. Strong growth in the emerging markets and consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. Our mobile device business, including smartphone and tablet business in EMEA, has also recorded strong growth momentum. And it was the first time our smartphone shipment exceeded 1 million units. The overall EMEA operating margin was up significantly by 1.9 percentage point to 3.4% due to the scaling benefit from the strong growth and expense control.
Americas. We continue to achieve a strong growth premium against the market decline in the region with record high share at about 12.5%. We continue to record strong growth in the U.S. to a record high market share of 11.3% with margin improvements. The revenue of the Americas region grew 19% year-on-year driven by growth across all products and regions. Operating margin, however, was down year-on-year, and we're still investing in Brazil and the Latin American regions.
We have a much more balanced geographic mix today. Sales mix of China dropped to 36% compared to 42% same quarter last year. We believe our strong momentum in markets outside of China will continue to support a growth above market performance. Our share in these markets are still low, and we're confident to continue to deliver strong growth and will contribute to the margin improvement, benefiting from the better scaling.
Next chart, please. We have a more balanced product portfolio helped by our expansion in the consumer PC and mobile device business. Notebook shipments were up around 17%, was a 21-point premium to the market, and sales were up 12% year-on-year, respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 12% and 20%, respectively, year-on-year. Our mobile device business continue to show strong performance with revenue grew 32% year-on-year, among which, smartphone shipments were up 39% year-on-year, and our tablet shipments were up 67% year-on-year.
Looking ahead, we believe our existing business will continue to outperform the market across our key products under the solid execution of our strategy with margin improvement. We are confident to continue to outperform the PC market, while, at the same time, we'll also benefit from the gradually recovering market. We'll continue to solidify our leadership position in the China smartphone market and improved its profitability. And at the same time, we'll grow aggressively in the emerging market.
Our post-merger management office has been on the ground in closely liaising with our counterparties to ensure the integration work of the 2 transactions on day 1 post closing can be carried out seamlessly, and the planned synergy can be delivered. We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunity of our existing business. 
We are confident the trend and the growth of our existing business that we have shown in the past several years will continue to deliver the improvement in profitability. Addition of the 2 businesses after the final approvals will further strengthen the group's competitiveness in driving sustainable growth in the next several years.

So there are many local players. Some of them are not long in the business, logically. So they just don't want to make money in the short term. So they're use the internet model. They just want to attract to the market capital, also investment to fund them. So I think, in short term, it's hard to make money in this market. But I think we do have more potential in rest of the emerging markets just with the Lenovo brand. So I don't talk about the Motorola. So you can see our result outside of China. So actually, we grow very fast in Southeast Asia by almost 300%. So we grow our Eastern Europe by more than 500%, and we grow in Latin America by 50%. So not only we grow faster in those areas -- and also, profitability in those areas are better than in China. So Wai Ming said, in China, we are breakeven. So we definitely, we focus on breakeven. We focus on the healthy business. So we'll focus on the balance between growth and the profitability. But outside China -- so we -- so like in East -- Southeast Asia, so our smartphone business recorded 3% PTI. In Eastern Europe, we recorded a 4% PTI, so very healthy business. So we will continue to pursue the profitable growth outside of China, particularly, in outside of emerging markets. So why we can have this performance -- why we should be more focused on these areas, so that's because, not only we have the right products, right product portfolio, so which can address the shifting from the premium to the mainstream and the entry level, but also, we have built a very strong brand in those markets, so with our core PC business. We also have built a very sophisticated channel network in those areas. 
[Technical Difficulty]
Okay. Good. Good. yes, so that will be our strategy. So in China, we -- it's still -- definitely, it's still the -- one of the most important market for Lenovo, but we will focus on the balance between the growth market share and the profit business. We want the business to be healthy but definitely in China. So we will try to build online model. We will try to expand into more open market and a premium -- in the premium space to ensure we can have this kind of balance, so be doing hypergrowth and profitability. But we should more focus on the rest of the emerging markets to grow, to pursue the profitable growth in those areas. Meanwhile, when we integrate -- when we close the deal with Google and Motorola, so we can have more balance the business on a positive word [ph] . We can become a pure global player because of Motorola as a business is very complementary to Lenovo in the kind of smartphone business. And as I said, Lenovo is focusing on China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, a little bit of Latin America. So Motorola's business is stronger in North America, in Latin America, in Western Europe. Probably, the only overletting [ph] area is India. So we are very complementary to each other. We will become a pure global player. So we will compete in most of the key markets and also that can give us an advantage, particularly, in the mature markets, Motorola technology, IT positions to help us to be more competitive.",601

So except -- so besides China, so most are Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Middle East and Africa and the Latin American countries. So -- and as I said, so we are growing very fast in the expanded countries. So particularly, Southeast Asia, we grow by almost 300% year-on-year; so Eastern Europe, by more than 500%; Latin America, 50%. And also, the profit in those areas are pretty good. So Southeast Asia, so 3% PTI; Eastern Europe of 4% PTI, better than in China. And so with the kind of the Lenovo brand, so if we go to the mature markets, we don't have any advantage because we have to pay a lot of IP and ROIC. So that's not our intent to expand to more mature markets with Lenovo brand. But fortunately, as you know, we announced the acquisition of the Motorola. So we are on track to close that deal. Once we close the deal, so we can have the footprint in North America, in Latin America and in Western Europe, so -- in India. So that will help us a lot to build a worldwide business, be a global player. That's a -- we will become stronger and more competitive in the market -- in each of the market.",221

So we will further focus on that area. So -- but we think to keep a healthy business is even more important. So that means, we will balance the growth and the profitability. So we want our smartphone business in China is healthy. You are definitely right. This is the most competitive market, so there are lot of local players. Some of the local players are not doing business logically. So they just don't want to make money in the short term. So they just want to attract the tablet markets to give them money to fund their business. They call it the Internet model. But I don't think that this model can last a very long time very long time. Definitely -- so Lenovo, we are improving our business model from the -- from a carrier model to more open-market model to Internet online model. So we are improving our business model. We are expanding the route to market. So that will help us to solidify the -- our leadership position in that market, as well as the profitability opportunity. So that will be our channel strength. Meanwhile, we continue to develop a more attractive product for the market. We think we should fully leverage the transition from the 3G to 4G to further grow in the market. So probably, in China, so we -- our key competitor will be the local players. But from worldwide point of view, so we still think, so those multinational players are our real competitors.

So -- and also, we're still on track to deliver our commitment. Actually -- so if you look at last quarter's performance, so in the PC, so if you only look at the PC numbers, so our PTI improved by 0.7 points year-on-year in the PC. If you counted our overall business, operationally, we improved by 0.4 points from 2.3 to 2.7. But why we reported the 2.5% PTI, that's because of the cost of the bump. You know we lend more money last quarter to prepare for the 2 acquisitions. So that, the 0.2 points of the interest, 0.2 points of the interest to our expense. So that's the reason.",116

So it seems like the competitive pressure is stronger there. So is it possible that we just try to adopt like more defensive approach in the market that's probably not growing that fast and try to deploy resources to other regions?

So you're 100% right. If we can improve the Americas, so our performance could be even stronger. But I hope you can understand the detail. So actually, our U.S. or North American business are doing very well. So not only we significantly outgrew the market potential, but also, we significantly improved the margin, the PTI. So when you give the number, I'll do that [ph] . But in Americas, in America, our only issue is not in North America. It's not in the U.S. It's in Brazil. So actually, we lost a lot of money, i.e., in Brazil. So that tracked down the overall Americas performance. So I wish you to know this detail. So we are working to fix this issue. Latin America, particularly, Brazil is very -- it's very tough. It's a very tough market. So probably, nobody can make money in that market because of some regulatory issues.

The next question is actually related to this balance sheet because you have this, the $1.5 billion borrowing, the balance sheet is quite different from the 1 year ago, and now you have like quarterly interest expense of like $15 million to $20 million. But actually, you're growing the operating cash flow so strong, and your cash conversion cycle is also improving. So I'm wondering what is your optimized -- the optimal balance sheet structure that you look for to structure your balance sheet.",106

I think your comment is, obviously, looking at the American growth overall. We don't break down the North America or the Latin America, but I can assure you that the improvement of the North American margin is as good and if not, better than overall group PC improvement in margin. So just, really, to give you some numbers in your perspective, that I think, our North American margin is actually doing very, very well. It's only the low margin, about 1.5% is -- or 1.4% is due to, I think, the underperformance of Latin America. Now according to the balance sheet, I think that I agree and disagree with you, Arthur, that the balance sheet does not change that much other than, I think, the additional $1.5 billion cash and the $1.5 billion, I think, long-term liability. You are absolutely right that, I think, our cash conversion cycle improved significantly because, I think, again, this is part of our overall strategy, is while we actually have excess cash over the past, we used the cash to build up our scale. When we reached the scale, we improved profitability, as well as the cash generation ability. I think the way we look at it is, I think, have a much better control over, I think, the account receivable, I think is -- as well as the account payable, really, getting a better term from the supply, especially when you get better scale, at the same time, trying to have a much tighter control over inventory. So you're absolutely right. And your observation, absolutely right that our cash generation capability or result actually start improving from quarter 4 last year because that is, again, I think, part of our overall strategy, is to leverage our cash to build out the scale, whether at the scale, we improve profitability, as well as operational efficiency, i.e., cash generation -- generating capability.",328

So actually -- so in my memory, it's historical high. So we delivered the more than $65 million PTI in North America. But very unfortunately, we are not doing well in Brazil, so only Brazil.

We didn't sacrifice the profit to gain share. So why we gained share? That's because of our over competitiveness. So you should have this impression. So while -- so in EMEA, so not only are we significant. We outgrew the market, but also, we significantly improved the margin. That's because we have already reached the turning point. So when the scale reached to a certain level, so that will be easy for us to get a return, to make more money. So over the past 3 years, we -- our strategy is we protect our commercial customers. But meanwhile, we should significantly tap the consumer business. So we have executed that strategy very well in EMEA. But definitely in the first 2 years because we haven't had enough scale in the consumer space, so we couldn't make money. But now with the current scale, so I think we can make money.",152

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3057.0,721875.0,31854558.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. We just completed a historic month, closing both the IBM System x and the Motorola acquisitions. But before I discuss that, I first want to share our strong second quarter results with you.
This quarter, our revenue grew by 7% year-on-year, while our earnings increased almost 20% to USD 262 million. We continue to deliver our commitment to improving profitability, thanks to strong performance across our entire businesses.
In PCs, we gained more than 2 points of the share to reach an all-time high of nearly 20% and strengthened our position as the worldwide leader. In tablets, we gained almost 1 point of the share year-on-year and are now #3 worldwide. Actually, just a few weeks ago, when a company from Cupertino launched these new tablets, they talked about how they sold more tablets than any manufacturer sold PCs. But this is not a fair comparison. You could say this is comparing apples and oranges. You could compare apples to apples. You could compare oranges to oranges, or if you want to reflect the overall, you could compare the far apple plus oranges.
A couple of years ago, when the same company talked about how tablets would cannibalize PCs, we predicted that tablet would actually be cannibalized by convertible PCs and the large-screen smartphones. So we doubled down on these 2 areas and set the target to win in both smartphone and, separately, broad PC, tablet plus PC.
At the end of last fiscal year in May, we told you our next milestone was to become #1 in broad PC in 2 years. Instead, we did it in 2 quarters. This is the latest IDC data, so you can see not only how the market has evolved and responded, but also how Lenovo has performed even better than planned. In smartphones, we remain the #4 in the world. But of course, once we add the Motorola, we will be #3. Although we are facing some challenges in China, we still achieved a record sales volume because of our rapid expansion outside of China over the past 2 years.
Today, our smartphones are selling in more than 45 countries. India and the Southeast Asia, Russia and the EMEA emerging markets, Latin America were all our stars. Respectively, their unit grew about 120%, 400% and 150%.
Overall, 1/3 of our revenue -- smartphone revenue comes from outside of China, more than doubled from a year ago. We also continue to drive growth in our enterprise business, where volume increased by 35% year-on-year. Finally, our ecosystem business also continue to grow as the daily downloads are now over 30 million.
Our strong results show that our formula for success, clear strategy, innovative products, operational excellence and a diverse team global culture continues to work. And we have proven our unique ability to balance innovation and efficiency across all our business groups.
Now we will apply this strength to drive even greater growth. As we integrate both Motorola Mobility and System x, the success for closing of these 2 big deals gives Lenovo a strong position in 2 new areas: mobile and enterprise.
Last year, we had a vision and a strategy to grow beyond PCs, but not all the PCs we needed. Now we will go to all of them. With these 2 deals, we are now #3 in both businesses, but we are not satisfied. We will replicate our success in PCs by outgrowing the market to challenge the top 2. Mobile and enterprise are now our new growth engines. And over time, they will become our profit pool as well. In enterprise, we are focused on growing revenue and leveraging Lenovo's efficient supply chain to reduce cost. We remain very confident that we can build our $5 billion enterprise business with profits higher than PCs in 1 year.
For smartphones, it's the perfect time to close Moto. Over the years, we have owned in China, we actually have been in the top 2 for 10 quarters in a row. But now the China market is not hyper growing any longer. It has been saturated. If you want to win, you must find a new growth area. You must become a true global player. This is what we have now become with Motorola. We will operate in all key markets, including mature markets, the U.S., Western Europe; and the emerging markets, India and the Southeast Asia, Russia and the EMEA emerging, Brazil and the rest of Latin America.
At the same time, we are still very committed to the China market. To address changes there, while still maintaining our advantage in traditional channels, including carrier market, we are building a new Internet-based company to capture the new market opportunity there. Our execution, acquisitions and the new business initiatives will drive growth.
We will also grow through innovation like we did when we created the Yoga notebooks and tablets. We launched the latest generations last month. With these new star products, we will continue to lead in convertibles and drive growth in tablets. And we are heading even more innovative products, including the new Lenovo VIBE smartphones; System x's server lines; and Moto's impressive new family of products, the new Moto X, Moto 360 watch android [ph] and a stylish Hint Bluetooth device.
Our strong performance demonstrates our clear momentum. Now the additions of Motorola and the System x teams allow us to compete and to grow across all smart connected devices, infrastructure devices and in the ecosystem space. 
Thank you, everyone. Now let me turn this to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",934
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3057.0,721875.0,31854559.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I would take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q2. Next chart, please. We continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion. Moreover, cash flow from our operations has also improved compared to the same quarter last year. We recorded growth in most of our key businesses and, at the same time, further improved our profitability. Group sales grew 7% year-on-year to around $10.5 billion. PC and other nonmobile device personal technology products-related sales were up 10% year-on-year to around $8.8 billion. Our mobile device business, including phones and tablets, was down 6% year-on-year to $1.4 billion. Sales of other goods and services were $292 million, declining about 9% year-to-year.
Gross profit for quarter 2 was about $1.5 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Gross profit margin was 13.9% against 12.9% last year. The increase was mainly attributed to the increased mix of higher-margin PC products and the shift in geographic mix. Operating expenses increased by 11% to around $1.1 billion. The increase was primarily driven by the one-off M&A expenses related to System x and Moto transactions. Hence, the E/R ratio increased from 10% last year to 10.4% in quarter 2.
Operating profit in quarter 2 was $365 million, up 29% year-on-year. We recorded nonoperating expenses of $36 million, which included the interest expenses of $18.1 million accrued for the USD 1.5 billion 5-year notes we issued in early May. Profit for the period was $272 million, up 27%. Profit attributable to equity holders was $262 million, up 19% year-on-year. The difference between the 2 profit lines was due to our joint venture partners sharing of gain in relation to Compal's joint venture versus losses recorded last year.
Basic EPS improved to USD 0.0252 from USD 0.0212 last year. The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.06, represent the same level of interim dividend paid last year.
Despite the additional charges arising from the amortization of intangible assets of the 2 acquisitions, we contemplate to maintain our level of dividend payments. Next chart, please.
Our policy remains strong. Noncurrent assets was about $5.2 billion, and current assets were about $16.4 billion as of 30 of September 2014. The increase of current assets were attributed to the increase in receivables, which was largely in line with our business growth. We had net current assets of around $1.6 billion at the end of September. The noncurrent liabilities were at around $3.8 billion. Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart.
Our cash position remain very healthy. As of end of September, we had net cash of around $3.2 billion. The quarter-on-quarter decrease of our bank deposits and cash was mainly due to payment of final dividend for fiscal year '14 in our Q2. We continue to do well in managing our working capital for quarter 2. Inventory days were at 30, up 2 days against last year due to our continuous expansion into consumer business in emerging market and the ramp-up of our new in-house manufacturing. Receivable days were at 34 days, which remained flat year-on-year. Payable days were at 69 days, increasing by 4 days against last year. As a result, the cash conversion cycle for the quarter was at negative 5 days. Again, negative 3 days last year. The slight quarter-on-quarter change is largely due to the strong growth of our consumer business.
We have recorded net cash generated from operations of $280 million in quarter 2, against, net cash outflow of $189 million in the same quarter last year. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter changes are mainly due to changes in net working capital and relevant foreign exchange impacts. Our cash flow from operation remain healthy to continue to drive our future growth. Next chart, please. 
Our geographic exposure is even more balanced to support our future sustainable growth. 
China. Despite a strong performance from our PC business, which recorded a 6% year-to-year increase of our revenue against the market shipment decline of 3%, the total revenue from China was down 2% year-on-year, primarily driven by a decline of non-PC business. Despite the challenging market conditions, we continue to protect our profit pool, and our China overall margin further improved by 0.5 points year-on-year to 5.8%. We recorded a market share of 37%, and we further strengthened our #1 position in China PC markets. As a result, our China PC operating margin improved by 0.02 points (sic) [0.2 points] year-on-year to 7%. Revenue of non-PC business, consist of smartphone and tablets, were down. This was attributed to the following 3 factors: One, we have more shipments towards the end of the quarter, partly due to the launching of 2 new products, VIBE X2 and S90, in late September as well as preparing for a better business in Golden Week in October. These shipments would not be recorded as Q2 revenue as a result of our accounting policy on goods already shipped, but not received by customers. Number two, during the quarter, our mix of sales in Tiered 4 to 6 cities increased as a result of our stronger partnership with carriers. This resulted to a longer lead time between sell-ins and sellouts. Under our accounting policy, we do not recognize revenue when a channel holds more than a reasonable level of inventory. And the third factor, the average selling price declined in the quarter as a result of having a larger mix of lower-priced products in the Tier 4 to 6 cities. Going forward, Lenovo new products, like VIBE X2 and S90, were well received. And together with the relaunch of Moto brand products in China, we believe we can further drive sales momentum. Finally, to address the smartphone market challenges, we will continue to broaden our risk to market, develop online channels, in addition to building the open market.
Asia Pacific. Revenue was up 3% year-on-year to about $1.6 billion in Asia Pacific. Strong performance in ASEAN's PC market supported our overall improvement in the region. We continue to see improvement in both turnover and profitability for most of the countries both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter. Our drive in smartphone, particularly in the ASEAN region, has continued to be encouraging. Our smartphone shipment has achieved 1.5 million units in the region. Our operating margin was up significantly by 2.7 percentage points to a record high level of 4.4%, driven by growth in scale for both PC and mobile device businesses.
EMEA. Our performance in EMEA is outstanding with record high market share and operating margin expansion. Revenue grew 33% year-on-year to about $3 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets and the consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. Our mobile business, including smartphone and tablet businesses in EMEA, has also recorded a strong growth momentum with our smartphone shipments reached 1.6 million units. The overall EMEA operating margin was up significantly by 2.3 percentage points to 3.8% due to a scaling benefit from strong growth and expense control.
Americas. Our North America business continued to perform well and outperformed the market with market share gain. Our operating profit increased almost by 45% year-on-year. However, our business in Latin America, primarily Brazil, continued to be impacted by the weakened markets, driven by the local macroeconomic and political conditions, which dragged down our overall performance in the Americas. The new local management team has already taken actions to stabilize the business. The revenue of the Americas region was roughly flat year-on-year. Operating margin, as a result, was down year-on-year. Excluding the impact from Brazil, Americas recorded an improvement of over 12% year-on-year in revenue and recorded a 4.1% PTI margin, which represent 2 percentage points gain year-on-year. Next chart, please.
We had market share in notebook at about 21%. Notebook unit shipments were up around 14%, growing at a 13-point premium to the market. And sales were up 9% year-on-year. Our desktop PC volume also achieved a record high market share at about 18%. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 6% and 11%, respectively, year-on-year. Our mobile device business continued to show strong performance. Despite the China market continued to be challenging, our smartphone expansion in markets outside China has also been strong. Shipments were up more than 2x year-on-year. Our non-China business now account for 20% of our smartphone shipment compared to only 9% a year ago. I explained earlier about the smartphone business in China that dragged down the sales revenue in short term in quarter 2. Our tablet shipments were up 31% year-on-year, and its performance in markets like EMEA was particularly impressive. Looking ahead, we are confident that our existing business will continue to outperform the market across our key products to drive profit growth with margin expansion.
With the completion of our acquisition of the System x server business and Motorola Mobility, we will now focus on integration of the 2 transactions in the near term in order to build a solid foundation for our business. We believe these 2 transactions will sharpen our competitiveness in the mobile and enterprise business, which will become growth engines for the company over time, in addition to our core PC businesses.
We will continue to stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives to ensure profitable growth. We've closed the 2 major transactions in October. The results of the 2 businesses will be included in our coming Q3. Under HKFRS, out of the total consideration of $5.2 billion, approximately 50% will be classified as intangible assets, such as patented technology, customer relations, trademarks and others, which will have to be amortized over the estimated useful life. Currently, such amortization expenses are estimated to be approximately $230 million to $300 million per year, which will be recorded as an expense item. From Q3 onwards, we will provide additional disclosure on these items in order to help the market better understand about the company's underlying operational performance.

So we definitely believe we have become stronger, and I think that -- in this industry, we will further consolidate. So we are definitely leading the trend. So although we have already reached a 20% share, I don't think we should stop there. So we definitely have a good opportunity to further grow share to 25% or, if possible, 30% even so -- in the future. Because in China, now we have 37% share. But outside China, we have much less share in. So actually, EMEA is a good story. We grew our share from 6%, 7% to today 20% over 2 years. We grew our consumer business from nothing to today more than 20% share. So that's definitely a good story.

On the positive side, we believe that it still can help you get market share, especially in China. However, IBM continues to lose market share in servers globally and also in China because they're basically in competition from other local server Chinese brands. In the previous presentation, I think you mentioned that you target to build the server business with higher margins than PC in 1 year after the closure of the IBM deal. And I'm wondering, do you still maintain this target? Because I understand that IBM x86 server business seems to be -- is still running a little bit of loss or breaking even.

So we will build a $5 billion business with better than PC margins. So definitely, we understand it's not easy, but we still are confident that we can deliver that. So for the next phase, we definitely are focusing on stabilizing the business and growing the business. So all kind of Lenovo resources will help the System x team to reach their target. So that's the first part. The second, so we definitely will share our Lenovo more efficient operational platform with the System x team to help with that, to reduce the material cost, reduce the supply chain cost, to significantly reduce the expense to revenue so that we can have the good share to competing in the market. So that's why we are still confident that we can deliver a $5 billion business with a better than PC margin in 1 year. So that's the answer. Thank you.",155

Maybe you'd just let me add 1 follow-up question. In the China market, we see there are many -- there are several local server Chinese brands. They are very aggressive in pricing, and they grew very fast. I know Lenovo has a higher margin target, so how would you view the competition from these local server Chinese brands?",59

So it's not that easy to do business with -- instead on the enterprise and the government. So -- but in the future, this is not a real problem any longer. And also -- so in the past, Lenovo, we don't have the full range of the product portfolio. So we -- it's not that easy for us, for Lenovo, to get more enterprise customers as well. But now the situation has changed completely. So with the combination of System x's product portfolio and the Lenovo ThinkServer product portfolio, we have the full range of the product and also -- so we can do business with any Chinese customers. So that's the difference. And so I don't think, so in the future, it's a problem. So we will become more aggressive in the China market to fight back the market share and the customers.

I think, in the September quarter, you have increased your overseas exposure. And I think, in the past, when that happened, actually, it's helpful to the overall profitability. So it seems like it didn't really help much in this September quarter. Could you let us know what happened there? And also, along the line, on the handset business, seeing Motorola was able to reduce in loss for 2 quarters, but in its December quarter results, it seems like the loss has expanded. So how should we look at the profitability after the inclusion of the Motorola business for the coming quarter? That's my question.",112

So Arthur, this is Wai Ming. Let's start with the easier one, which is Motorola. We definitely see the Motorola momentum, I think, continue, I think, since we announced the transaction earlier in the year. I think their revenue obviously went up, I think, becoming -- I don't know in which quarter, it probably nearly doubled, I think, every quarter. We definitely feel very confident that will continue after our ownership. Now when you refer to Motorola, I think, reporting a figure of losses, I think you have to read the accounts first very carefully because this is -- the number was disclosed in the Google set of financial statements under discontinued businesses, and in which, apart from the operational performances, I think it also includes, I think, costs such as restructuring, so on and so forth. I think, without the benefit of seeing how Google prepared the numbers, but based on our understanding or based on -- we definitely see that, I think, Motorola continued to improve, especially, I think, when the top line's been at lift and improving in a very healthy -- in a healthy manner. So that's number one. Number two, you asked about our overseas business. Yes, our overseas business definitely as a percentage, I think, to the overall, actually increased, i.e., in February when we start our smartphone business outside China a few quarters ago. Nevertheless, it's still relatively small as a percentage to the turnover. I think -- as you may know, I think, after achieving a significant market share, we really are striking for a balance between, I think, top line and bottom line growth. And although the overseas business has actually been increasing, from a volume perspective, very, very healthy year-to-year, I think it does not necessarily have a material impact on the bottom line. So -- but going forward, especially, when we'll be able to buildup the scale of our phone in the overseas markets, you will begin to see the improvement in a material way, I think, financially, which is exactly the same way that we started our consumer business outside China a few years ago. In the beginning of the year, I think we are very aggressive and active in building up the volume. And once we reach a certain volume and scale, then we actually have the scale benefit, and then you can see the benefit that brings to the whole group. So have I answered all your 3 questions, Arthur?",415

For the September quarter, the number, actually, it's probably smaller than what we have seen from the Google results. And going to December quarter, then I'm worried that possibly going to be even smaller.",57

And definitely, we continue to see the trend is actually improving. So that's the best I can give you by way of, I think, guidance. I think it will not be possible, Arthur, as you can imagine, that I give you the exact numbers.",101

Wai Ming, when you guys announced the deal, at that point, you had made a remark that Motorola gross margins were running at close to 20% for their flagship products. Is that kind of the run rate gross margins they are still running at? And is that something that we should be thinking about in terms of the profitability of that business even now, given that the product mix has also changed quite a bit over the last 6 to 9 months? And secondly, I also wanted to understand, I think, previously, you guys have talked about 4 to 6 quarters of a turnaround plan, reaching breakeven in 4 to 6 quarters. Could you give a little bit more detail on how that is likely to be achieved? Is it primarily going to come through revenue growth, given that the competitive dynamics of the smartphone market seems to be becoming a bit more tougher?",169
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3057.0,721875.0,31854583.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,26,"So Gokul, I think, to answer your questions, I think the 20%, as we -- I think, at -- the 20% you mentioned, that was primarily reflected in the financials of Motorola, I think, last year. So if you look at it, I think, last year, they actually really launched Moto X for 6 months and, primarily, Moto G, I think, for 2 months. And as you know, Moto G has been a fantastic success, I think, in the market. I think it's actually hit a very high market share, I think, in Brazil, and I was -- I know that in the U.S., they are actually hitting even 10% market share, I think, in the last quarter. So they also -- have been also successful in, I think, in countries like India. Definitely, the -- I think the margin of Moto G and the margin of the previous years of 20% probably will have a difference, but that's not a significant difference. Because I think when you really look at the overall P&L, I think when you launch a higher-premium product, you obviously will come along with higher advertising and marketing cost. When you actually launch Moto G, which I think the market immediately see the value because of the quality of the product, I think the better user experience. I think, although the gross will -- gross margin will come down a little bit, but the net-net is actually not necessarily that different. So overall, I think we are still very, very -- I think the key for us is really looking at the growth in top line as well as the control of the expenses, and that's really the way to lead to a breakeven. I think we continue to believe and to execute that. I think the Motorola business will become breakeven in 4 to 6 quarters, I think, really from 2 areas. I think one is I think the continued growth in the top line as far as controlling expenses. More important is I think the synergy that's derived out of the ownership because we obviously will have a much bigger overall smartphone business, and there will be improvement in terms of material costs as well as, I think, the back-end of the operation with a very efficient operating platform of Lenovo as reflected in our legacy business. You definitely can see that we'd be able to, I think, improve the gross profits, I think, if you want to be very specific, without really -- without necessarily increasing the expenses. And as a result of that, I think it would drive to a breakeven, and the plan will remain, I think, with the sort of 4 to 6 quarters. So I don't know whether Yuanqing wants to add any comments on the 4 to 6 quarters.",471

We are very confident we can deliver that. So although the gross margin probably is not expected at 20%, it could be a little bit less because of this Moto Gs and then the premium Moto X product. But you can see the expense to revenue change over the past couple of quarters. So actually, 1 year ago, when we did the due diligence, so I thought the E/R ratio is -- was more than 40%. But last quarter, it was just 23%. It was just 23%. So definitely, so with the synergy up, with the more efficient operational platform in Lenovo, so we are very confident. So from what I explained, we can help them to improve the GP margin from the other side. So we can help to reduce the E/R ratio, so further growing. So we are definitely confident to turn around the business in 4 to 6 quarters.",160

And Motorola, in fact, if you really look at their portfolio, they are particularly a success, so as I said, Moto G, and really been winning market, especially winning in countries where we actually see hyper growth, such as in the Latin America, such as in India. While on the other hand, if you really look at the mature market, well, China market is still growing, but do not have the hyper growth and probably a lot more competitive. But on -- in other markets, that is definitely our experience of the Lenovo phone, have been extremely, I think, positive. And Motorola is an extremely nice sort of addition to the Lenovo family. That will be able to capture the opportunities. I think, definitely, in the next few quarters, we see it's very, very positive. And therefore, on a top line basis, we remain very confident that they will continue to outgrow the market in a big way. Again, if you really look at the last 3, 4 quarters, they've been literally beating, I think, on a year-to-year basis, nearly 100%. So we will -- well, not necessarily 100% forever, but we definitely will see a very, very high, I think, year-to-year increase. And coupled with our ability to have an efficient operation, I think we are very, very confident to achieve, I think, what Yuanqing just said, to achieve a breakeven in 4 to 6 quarters.",264

So we see quite a big volume -- or revenue decline last quarter. So what -- and then now Moto coming in, so what do you see your strategy in China smartphone market? So do you target certain market share or maintain a #2 position, together with the Motorola and the Lenovo brand, or let's say, you are more focused on the profitability? We know that your competitor are quite aggressive in terms of gain additional of this type.",86
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3057.0,721875.0,31854594.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,37,"So we definitely are still committed to the China market. We are definitely confident that we will keep in the top 2. So definitely, we shouldn't be -- it's certainly why we'll keep in the top 2. So we all want to become the #1 in the market. So we have to work out our strategy. So we will further protect our stronghold in the carrier market. So -- but in the meanwhile, we need to be more aggressive in the open market and in the Internet model. So that's why last month, we announced that we will build a new company, so a stand-alone, independent company to drive the Internet model business. So definitely, that would help us to get in this leadership position. Meanwhile, we have a very clear strategy. So Motorola, we'll come back to China again. So we are working on that. Both Moto team and Lenovo and BG team are very excited about that. So Motorola is still very respected brand in China. So why they left China, I think that's because of Google's strategy. So now many Chinese still remember this brand, still respect this brand. And the carrier, they still view this brand as a premier brand. So actually, although, in China, there are a lot of domestic players, but they are just focusing on the mid- to low-end price band. So in the high-priced band, now there are only 2 brands, so Apple and Samsung. So even for the carriers or for the public, so they like to have the third brand to address the -- from mainstream to the high-end price band. So we believe Motorola will -- would have the chance to play this role. So that's about China. But I wish you could understand that Lenovo's overall mobile strategy. China is important, but it's not the only. So actually, in the future, so we probably will be more focusing on the outside China rather than just the China. So you can see our results in the rest of the world. So we grew our volume in India and Asia by 120%. We grew in Russia and the rest of EMEA emerging markets by 400%. We grew our volume in Latin America by 150% last quarter. So that's the proof. So although we still cannot make a lot of money from those markets, but just like our PC, just like our PC. So once we can reach a certain level of the market share, so we have a good chance to make money. So here, I want to emphasize our PC profit improvement. So actually, last quarter, you could see across the world, across the geographies, we significantly improved our profitability in the PCs. So in EMEA, we grew by $83 million. In North America, we grew by $26 million. In Asia Pacific, we grew by close to $40 million. In China, we grew by $20 million. So the only country we lost money is Brazil. So why we continue with these results, that's because our market share expansion has reached into a certain level. Now that's the time to harvest to get the return. So like in EMEA, so our consumer business grew from nothing to 20% share. So our -- so even 1 year ago, so we still lost money in the consumer space in EMEA. But now, we can make a lot of money from that as well. So I believe we will replicate our story -- our successful story in the mobile space as well in the future. So now we are -- with the Motorola deal closing, so we are very decent server players. We can play globally, so in North America, Western Europe, in India, Russia, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, everywhere.",631
