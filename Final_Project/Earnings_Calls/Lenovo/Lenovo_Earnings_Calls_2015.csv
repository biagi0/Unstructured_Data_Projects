Welcome to Lenovo's Q3 result webcast. This is Gary Ng, VP in Investor Relations at Lenovo. Before we start, let me introduce our management team with us today.

Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing.",70
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,753188.0,33016083.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. I hope your new year is off to a good start. This is a receding quarter for Lenovo. Many people, including myself, were curious to know whether our core business is remaining strong and even more, whether our private business is dragging our overall performance significantly behind. To be honest, this quarter's results are relatively complex. Even I spent more time than before to understand it, so I hope everyone here can be more patient when trying to understand. But after I fully understood it, I feel more confident than ever for Lenovo's future.
Our performance shows that not only we set a right strategy, choose the right acquisition targets but also executed it effectively, and it drove our overall business forward to hit our preset targets. Our core business, PCs, despite the unfavorable market conditions maintained its leading position and significantly improved profitability. Even more, our 2 newly acquired businesses have shown greater momentum in the first quarter of integration and that we have already started to see the synergies building to our plan start to deliver savings. This will become even more significant next year.
So this quarter, our revenue grow 31% year-on-year. And when you take out the M&A expenses such as intangible assets and interest expenses, our PTI was $348 million, up 8% year-on-year. Lenovo is now a far more balanced and diversified business. PC now accounts for only 65% of our overall business, mobile now at 24% and enterprise at 9%. The strong results from our new businesses make us even more confident that these 2 businesses will be our strong growth engines for PCs.
Although last quarter's market growth shifted from China emerging market to U.S. mature markets, we still kept our leadership position with a record 20% worldwide market share and significantly improved our profitability by 2 points year-on-year. Despite the challenges in Brazil, we achieved the profit growth in all other regions, particularly EMEA. Next, we will grasp the industry consolidation opportunity, and we are expanding more aggressively in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific consumer markets to gain even more market share. Back in fiscal year 2012, we committed to improve profitability by 1 point in 3 years with our core business. We are fully confident that we can achieve this target.
For mobile, we have challenges in China as the market shifted from carriers to open market, and the online sales continued to disrupt the market landscape and the business model. But our acquisition of Motorola proves our insights. Last quarter, Motorola, not only topped the sales volume from a year ago, sold over 10 million units in a quarter for the first time but also improved profitability at better-than-expected speed. Just last week, we announced the Moto's comeback to China. It will significantly enhance Motorola's overall performance. Even more important, Motorola will help us to become a true global player.  Overall, we are already the #3 smartphone company in the world. Last quarter, of our almost 25 million units sold, almost 60% of our volume come from outside China. Not only Motorola already covers over 50 countries, but the Lenovo brand has expanded into many European, Asia and American markets as well.
Just a few weeks ago, we launched our phone business in Turkey, which become the 67th country selling Lenovo smartphones. Definitely, China is still the most important smartphone market in the world, and we will keep fighting at a full force. We will significantly expand our online business whilst speed up the transformation of our traditional offline business. The first -- the online smartphone, Lemo receives very positive market response. We also established the Internet-model-based company, ShenQi, to fight the competitors head to head. At the same time, we will fully leverage Moto's China comeback to enhance our competitiveness in mid- and higher-end segments to further grow our business. And in tablets, we continue to grow share worldwide with EMEA leading the way, and our new Yoga tablet launch definitely created an excitement in the market.
In enterprise, although System x was affected by the acquisition and the market shift, our original ThinkServer business is very strong, grew 67%  year-on-year and partially made up the gap. Now we are #3 worldwide and the #1 in China. We have and will continue to quickly integrate our new global teams, build confidence in the market and with customers. And at the same time, we'll fully leverage the synergies and Lenovo's efficiency in supply, in R&D and in channels to enhance System x's competitiveness to achieve stability and the future growth target. We are confident that we will have a $5 billion business with a decent margin in 1 year.
Our ecosystem business also continued to grow. Lenovo store continues to go strong at 30 million daily downloads. Our most popular app, SHAREit, surpassed the 200 million users this quarter. In addition, our business transformation is strengthening our entire business from interactive product development to digital marketing, social media marketing and defense [ph] marketing. From expanding online sales and promoting China O2O transformation to build engagement service through community forums, every part of our business model is changing by leveraging the Internet.
Our product developers are engaged in customers each day to enhance our customer-centric innovation capability. Just last month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we won a record 77 awards for our broad range of products and apps. Looking forward, our 3 business engines will all run at a full speed. We will deliver top line growth as well as profitability improvement to make our shareholders and customers proud.
Thank you everyone. Wish everyone a great Year of Sheep. Now let me turn this call to our CFO, Wai Ming.",951
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,753188.0,33016084.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 3. Next chart, please. This is the first time we have included a full quarter of System x and 2 months of Motorola performance in our Q3 results. Our group revenue increased 31% year-to-year to $14.1 billion. The group PTI before noncash M&A-related accounting charges was $348 million, up 8% against last year. The noncash accounting charges related to the 2 M&A transactions was $74 million, which include intangible asset amortization, included interest expense of the 3-year promissory note issued as part of the Motorola transaction and others. Group PTI was $274 million, and group net income was $253 million, down 15% and 5% year-on-year, respectively. Group net income before noncash M&A-related accounting charges was $327 million, up 23% year-on-year during the quarter.
In addition to the noncash accounting charges, we have also incurred approximately $80 million in M&A-related cash expenses in Q3, comprises of $30 million loan interest expense, $40 million severance expense and a $10 million post-merger management expense that are aptly included in the USD 348 million in PTI before noncash M&A-related accounting charges. We have provided a bridge reconciling different financial figures in the chart after the financial summary page. We delivered solid performance with growth drivers from our new businesses, and we continue to be on track for our commitment to drive sustainable profitability improvements.
Next chart please. This slide gives you a more detailed view of our financial performance for the quarter. As mentioned in the previous slide, our group revenue gross profit and adjusted PTI improved year-on-year driven by solid growth of our core PC business and the 2 acquired businesses. Gross profit increased 54% year-on-year with margin improving to 14.9%. Operating expenses increased by 72% to around $1.8 billion. The increase in sales and E/R ratio in Q3 is mainly driven by the 2 new M&As. We recorded net other nonoperating expenses of $51 million, which mainly included the interest expense of $16 million accrued for the USD 1.5 billion 5-year note we issue in early May, factoring cost of $16 million as well as $7 million of the 2-month included interest expense for the promissory note related to the Motorola transaction. PTI was reported $274 million.
The effective tax rate for Q3 was 6.3%. This is lower than last year largely due to the tax benefit associated with the newly acquired businesses. Profit for the period was $257 million, and profit attributable to equity holders was $253 million. The difference between the 2 profit lines was due to our joint venture partners sharing gain in relation to the compound joint venture recorded in Q3. Basic EPS was USD 0.0232 compared to USD 0.0256 last year. 
Next chart, please. In this chart, we have provided a bridge to reconcile different financial figures that I mentioned earlier to give you an overview and how these figures are calculated.
Next chart, please. Our balance sheet remains strong and include System x and Motorola. The key difference compared to the quarter that ended in September is largely due to the inclusion of the 2 transaction closed in quarter 3 and our normal business activities. The noncurrent assets were about $11.4 billion, and current assets were about $17.8 billion as of 31st December 2014, where net current liabilities of around $1.3 billion at the end of December and noncurrent liabilities was around $5.9 billion.
Let's go through the cash and working capital on the next chart. Our cash position remained very healthy. As of the end of December, we have net cash of around $1.3 billion. The quarter-on-quarter decrease of our bank deposits and cash was mainly due to the payment of cash consideration of about $2.3 billion for the acquisition of System x and Motorola in quarter 3. We also drew down a loan amounting to $600 million from our existing loan facilities in December 2014, which resulted in our increase of total bank borrowing levels. If we add back cash consideration pay for the 2 M&A transactions, our net cash position in Q3 is even better year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.
We continue to do well in managing our working capital. The cash conversion cycle quarter 3 was negative 2 days, flat year-on-year and against negative 5 days last quarter. The cash conversion cycle of our core business continue to see gradual improvements. The newly acquired businesses had a slightly positive working capital in the first quarter of integration, and we expect this to improve over time. We have recorded net cash generated from operation of $738 million in quarter 3 against $1 billion the same quarter last year. The year-on-year quarter-on-quarter changes are mainly due to the change in net working capital. Our cash flow from operations remain healthy for supporting our drive for future growth.
Next chart, please. This slide shows the revenue mix of our business by business group and geography. We now have a much more diversified and balanced business portfolio to drive sustainable growth. From a business group perspective, our PC business now account for about 65% of our total revenue compared to 81% the same quarter last year, the high contribution from faster growing new businesses, including mobile and enterprise, which accounted for about 24% and 9% of our total revenue, respectively. From a geographic perspective, businesses outside China accounted for about 71% of our total revenue compared to about 63% last year.
Next chart, please. As Yuanqing mentioned earlier, our overall business is much more diversified. We want to give you more color on the business group performance. For our PC business group, despite challenges in Brazil, we achieved profit growth with share gain in all geographies, particularly in EMEA. Our PC revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $9.2 billion with a record high pretax income of $494 million and pretax margin of 5.4%, which is up 2 points year-on-year, while we kept our leadership position with a record 20% worldwide PC market share. We will grasp the industry consolidation opportunity and expand more aggressively in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific consumer markets to gain even more market share.
Mobile Business Group includes Lenovo mobile business that consists of phone, tablets and TV businesses and 2 months of Motorola's business. The revenue of this business group increased 109% year-on-year to $3.4 billion driven by the strong growth of Motorola business. Our mobile PTI recorded a loss of $89 million, and pretax margin was negative 2.6%. Motorola performance continued to gain momentum and assuming even more than double year-on-year in Q3, while market growth is 28% year-on-year. In addition, Moto operation result was positively impacted by having over 80% of its volume slowed in the last 2 months of the quarter. While monthly expense do not generally have significant variation within the quarter, this positive impact on financial result in Q3 will not repeat in Q4.
Our smartphone business in China continue to be challenging as various subsidies were cut, driving shipments through carrier channel down nearly 30%, while Internet sales took off. Both factors disrupted the market, and this affected negatively our phone business in China. With the addition of Motorola to the smartphone portfolio, it enhances our overall markets coverage and create a much more balanced mobile business on a global basis. Moto back to China will also address the high-end segment opportunities and hence, improve the overall profitability.
As we enter into the full quarter, which is 4Q financial year '15, which is typically a low season for Lenovo and Motorola, both businesses will have a low seasonality sales, will usually be down 20% to 30% quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, margin typically will be low. We remain confident we will turn around the Motorola business within 4 to 6 quarters from close.
As in tablet, our new Yoga tablet launch definitely created excitement in the market. In Q3, we continue to outgrow the market with EMEA leading the way. Our worldwide tablet shipments were up 9% year-on-year being the worldwide #3 and the fastest-growing vendor among the top 5, while our market share continued to expand.
Revenue of the Enterprise Business Group showed an increase of 6.9x year-on-year to $1.2 billion, which include a full quarter of System x business. Our ThinkServer business was very strong. The System x business continued to record decline during the first quarter of integration. PTI of the combined server and storage business recorded a loss of $42 million, and pretax margin is negative 3.4%. We fully leveraged the synergies and Lenovo efficiency in supply chain, R&D and channel to enhance System x competitiveness to achieve stability and future growth targets. At the same time, we will improve its efficiency and ensure its cost structure is competitive.
In Q3, we announced a voluntary buyout program to rightsize the workforce. Our commitment in EBG to drive $5 billion sales revenue with a margin better than our PC business remains the same.
Next chart, please. Our geographic exposure is also very balanced to support our future growth. Our business now have a more diversified product portfolio with high mix of non-PC business in each of the geos. As such, we have modified the presentation in the chart slightly from this quarter onwards to review our performance in each geography from an overall perspective.
Total revenue from China geography was slightly up year-on-year. Profit went up 7% year-on-year. Our overall margin was up 0.3% -- point year-on-year. Our PC business continued to perform well despite market decline and achieved a record market share of 38.2% while holding up its margin well. Even though competition in China smartphone market is very keen and the market is no longer seeing hyper growth as we mentioned earlier, it is still the most important smartphone market in the world. We are fighting back in China with plans Yuanqing mentioned earlier. For Enterprise business, combining our existing business and System x, Lenovo has become the largest server maker in China. Integration of System x so far has been smooth. We will continue the integration work to ensure the planned synergies can be delivered.
In Q3, AP geo revenue was up 7% year-on-year to achieve $1.7 billion in Asia Pacific. Profit went up 271% year-on-year. Our overall operating margin improved substantially by 3.9 points year-on-year to 5.4%. We strategically protected Japan PC leadership despite a declining Japan PC market while improving margin to achieve record high operating profit for the quarter. At the same time, we attacked India PC market with shipment growth as well as overall operating margin improvement. Therefore, our PC business continued to gain share and achieved record high market share at 16.1%. During the quarter, the 2 newly acquired business also helped the overall top line growth of the AP region. Motorola performed very well in the region, especially in India, which helped the strong growth of the combined smartphone shipment of Asia-Pacific region. For enterprise, we continue to leverage Lenovo channel expertise and supply chain efficiency to accelerate the enterprise business in the region.
EMEA revenue was up 40% year-to-year to above $4 billion. Profit was up 135% year-on-year. Our overall margin improved by 1.2 points year-on-year to 3%. Our PC and mobile business continued to record strong momentum before Motorola and System x. Our PC business continued to gain share and achieved record high market share at 19.6% driven mainly by the consumer business in Western Europe and Middle East and Africa. In smartphone, we recorded strong growth in EMEA driven by the momentum both from Motorola and Lenovo, thanks to the strong shipment performance from Lenovo brand in the Eastern Europe and Middle East and Africa regions. On Enterprise business, we will be more aggressive in attacking growth in the region's enterprise segment.
Americas revenue was up 88% year-on-year to about $4.3 billion largely due to the adding of System x and Motorola business. We recorded a loss of $22 million in the region largely due to the challenges in Brazil and ramping up of newly acquired businesses. For PC, we continue to deliver solid growth in PC business in North America region driven by the balanced growth in both consumer and commercial businesses. PC unit shipment in North America increased 6% year-on-year with margin improvement year-on-year. With the contribution of strong shipment performance from Motorola, our smartphone shipment grew substantially in AG this quarter. For Enterprise, we are preparing our foundation to attack and capture more enterprise customers in future. However, our performance in Brazil is still impacted by the weak market environment affected by the local macroeconomic issues that resulted in weak demand and high inventory in the industry. Currency fluctuation also negatively impacted both Lenovo and Motorola performance despite the strong revenue momentum. We have been refining our business strategy in PC, and actions are in place to stabilize the Brazil business. Proactive actions taken to improve our performance include simplifying product portfolio, improving operational controls and improving supply chain efficiency, and a new local leadership is in place to execute our strategy.
Looking ahead, we are confident that the group business will continue to outperform the market across our key products to drive profitability growth and margin execution. We are building a solid foundation for transforming us into a truly global and diversified company with 3 group of businesses. We will continue to leverage Motorola to accelerate our phone expansion and enhance our MBG performance and to take actions to stabilize the EBG business and optimize its expense structure to improve its operating efficiency. We now have a much broader product portfolio, and we'll continue to leverage our extensive channel network already established in the past several years to drive future growth. We're devoted to driving growth and outperform from scaling and operating efficiency enhancement and in turn, enhancing our profitability over time.

First of all, on the Motorola side, looks like the profitability is getting a bit better, and the volume momentum is also quite strong. Could you also outline what are the strategies for Motorola especially on the cost side of things since you mentioned that you have some actions over the next 12 months to get the business back to breakeven? Could you outline what exactly those actions are likely to be? And I have a follow-up as well.",85

Thank you. So definitely. So Motorola is -- so performance last quarter proved also that this is the right acquisition plan -- so target. Not only -- so not only last quarter, they grew their volume by more than 100%. And the first time reached the 10 million volume worldwide. Actually, it's 10.6 million. But also, they significantly improved their profitability. So that gave us more confidence, so we can turn around this business in another 3 to 5 quarters that we promised. So we -- now we understand this business better. So actually, Motorola has much better gross margin than the normal smartphone or even the Lenovo PC. But unfortunately, today, their E/R ratio is higher -- much higher than Lenovo smartphone and Lenovo PC. So that's why it can give us more confidence that we can, I think give us a better profit in the future. So we -- definitely, we are fully leveraging Lenovo more efficient operational platform and so -- particularly in the supply chain side. So we are very confident we can help them to reduce the material costs. So actually, by now we have identified probably $0.5 billion, so majority cost of synergy, so over next 12 years -- 12 months, I'm sorry, over next 12 months. So that's one thing.  Definitely, we can further help them to reduce the E/R, so through the better manufacturing cost and other also operational cost. So that will be our strategy. We will -- and by the way, we will maintain Motorola as an independent brand and organization so that they can keep this strong momentum. So actually, Motorola has a strong presence in North America and Latin America. So a reason that -- so we have seen the first established success in India. So over the past 10 months, actually, we sold 3 million units in India through our main [ph] channel. So we have become a very decent player in that market. So -- and also, definitely, another important action is we bring Motorola back to China. So we launched that last week. So actually, we will start shipment a couple of days later. So that will help Lenovo to strengthen our product portfolio in the high end -- in the middle to the high end in China. So we have got a lot of positive feedback on Motorola product in China. So actually, in -- within just 1 week, so now we have already received 1 million [indiscernible] received the order from the consumers, but definitely not 100% will be converted to the real sales. But it's very strong momentum. So definitely, we can count on Motorola to help strengthen our smartphone position in China as well.",454

The PC margin was much higher than what we have seen in the recent quarters, probably 1 to 2 percentage points higher than what we have seen. Could you explain a little bit more, especially in Asia-Pacific, what drove this big change given that you also had some currency-related issues? Also, how much of it is at a scalable kind of margin level? Are we going to be at that 5% kind of pretax margin for PC going forward?",89

So our PC performance last quarter was pretty strong, so although the market is not in favor to us. So actually, China and the emerging market actually what we are thinking, so U.S. and the mature market are growing. So that's actually favored to our competitors, which are based in U.S. But we performed very well, so very [indiscernible]. Actually, I mean, we keep our #1 position, but also we improved our PTI ratio by 2 points. So now we -- for the first time, we delivered more than 5% PTI, actually, 5.4% PTI. So that's -- that is 2 points year-on-year improvement. So that's amazing improvement. So why we can deliver that? Because -- I think mainly because our strategy. So if you still can remember, so a couple of years ago, we set a strategy to attack the consumer market particularly in EMEA. So actually, when we executed that strategy, after the first stage, we lost money. We lost money. But when we reached certain -- a percent of the market shift, so the profitability will be improved significantly, actually, so like in EMEA. So things basically are just the same this fiscal year. We started to make money from the consumer space but over -- past 2 to 3 years, we lost money. So that's a significant headwind to improve the overall profitability in the PC space. So with this strategy, I believe, so more and more regions will gain 10%, 15% or even 20% market share. But probably, today, if you cannot reach 15% to 20% market share, it's hard to make money, particularly in the consumer space. But we believe more and more region and countries that we have reached that target. So that will help us to improve the profitability, so we are still confident that so we can -- but definitely, last quarter was a fantastic quarter, but we are confident that we can maintain like the 5% PTI in the PC space.",331

I just gave you -- think Yuanqing gave you a perspective of the, I think, the overall business. So I'll give you a perspective from a numbers point of view. I think the excellent execution of my colleagues actually enabled -- a lot of the margins is actually really derived from the scaling benefit, meaning that we continue to grow top line, but we actually be able to manage expenses in a very, very good way. And therefore, I think a large part of the improvement, I think, is really coming out from the scaling benefit. And really, from a geography perspective, I think literally, I think, all regions, I think except Brazil, which we already called out, which we mentioned about the issues, more -- all regions, in fact, actually increase market share as well as profitability. It's actually a worldwide scale. And again, really want you -- sort of, I think, go back to Yuanqing's point that I think the execution, the scaling benefit, I think building up market share is absolute critical and also, I think also from my [ph] view that I think the PC business is actually a very attractive business, and the strong performance actually give us, I think, the result that we reported today.",217

So thank you, Kirk, for the question. So actually, so now the System x business that we bought from IBM, so the key issue is not on the bottom line. It's on the top line. So actually, so last quarter, their revenue declined by more than 20%, more than 20%. With that decline under the sudden [ph] expense, so definitely, you cannot expect the good PTI. So the reason -- the first challenge so are in twofold. The first is -- the first thing is the cost competitiveness. So IBM always run the business at a very premium level part, not just product but also the cost structure. So that makes their business not competitive in the market. And the second one is actually those -- there's a new business model, so -- which is the ODM -- OEMs that direct the sale to the -- those Internet companies, particularly for the data center part. So we call it the IPDC market. So actually, this model is disrupting not just IBM but also -- actually, and Dell as well. So actually, you can see Dell server business actually declining as well. So that's the reason. So -- but meanwhile, so I wish you could see another result. Actually, Lenovo ThinkServer business are growing much faster than that. So actually, last quarter, we grew by 67% year-on-year, so that partially compensated the revenue decline of the System x. But our server business space is very limited, so -- and we only sell in very limited countries. But now with the joining of the System x not only we can have the full product portfolio. In the past, Lenovo's product portfolio only covered the low-end servers. But IBM definitely can cover mid- to high end. So now we have the full range of the product portfolio. And also, System x also covered more regions and countries, so that gave us more coverage. They have a good brand. They have good technology. They have good customers. But now the only problem is they are not competitive. They're not competitive. But efficiency has always been Lenovo's stronghold, so we definitely believe we can help this business to be more competitive with more efficient procurement, manufacturing, logistics or even in R&D area. So we have a lot of room to improve. So we have already made the plan. We will take the action quickly to improve the competitiveness to stabilize the business. Over time, we even should grow the business, so it's definitely. So that's still our commitment, to build a $5 billion business with a better PC margin. So if we can hit the top line, so I don't think the bottom line is a problem -- is the issue.",457

First is just wondering in management's mind what would you consider as a successful relaunch of the Motorola brand in China. The reason why I'm asking is because China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and looking at MIDH, even though it's already #1, it was not really profitable. I mean, it was maybe slightly profitable. But with this new investment of Motorola brand marketing in China, potentially this could be further burden in terms of the cost. So I mean, how important is the relaunch of the China business for Motorola? Or actually, is more of a marketing and real profit could more come from the overseas expansion? That's the first question.",120

Thank you. So I think Motorola back to China is important for both Motorola business and our China smartphone business. We definitely would not sacrifice the profit part to expand the market. So we still -- actually, we also have the good margin in China, so -- but Motorola will help our China  smartphone business because, in the past, with the Lenovo brand smartphone, we can only cover low-end products, so actually, we sell more product through the carriers. We are very hard to enter into the market above RMB 2,000 -- about RMB 2,000. But with Motorola brand, now it definitely could be chance for us to address the mid- to high-end market. So actually, Moto X will sell at about RMB 3,000. So Moto G will sell at around RMB 1,200 to RMB 1,500. So that's a good complement -- that's a very good complement. So that's why -- so that will help our China smartphone business. We will -- by the way, so we will mainly sell Motorola through the online, so that we'll help us through online retailers. So that will help us to strengthen our open market coverage and the online coverage. So that's for China, definitely for Motorola overall business because we don't sacrifice the GP margin. So with the large volume -- with the addition of the China volume, so definitely, that will kind of further help Motorola to improve their profitability. So that's why I said that for both China smartphone business and the overall Motorola business, this strategy is critical.",260

I think in terms of the currency, it was very unfavorable in the last quarter, but you still managed to deliver both sales and earnings growth there even with the slight margin downside. The question is how much more potential room in terms of a share gain there. And how is the currency outlook potential impact to this business? Is there going to be further impacted margin? Or potentially, you could stabilize around like 3%, that kind of OP margin in that region.",91
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,753188.0,33016103.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,21,"So Arthur, this is Wai Ming. I think the EMEA -- I think -- well, first of all, to answer your question, I think foreign currency only impacting EMEA is really impacting, I think, very generally, I think, the non-U.S. dollar sort of geographies. I think from a margin perspective, we actually put in place a hedging process for us to protect the overall margin, so -- but I actually would want to sort of maybe repeat my answer. I think very generally in particularly EMEA, I think that we've been actively been growing the business, I think, very, very, I think, significantly. Definitely well above the market growth. So by building that volume, I think we begin to see the scaling benefits. And my comment earlier today to another question was -- is I think if really look at it on a global basis, definitely, that covered EMEA. I think we've been actually holding our expenses very nicely, but at the same time, really, all the top line growth, I think, with the gross margin actually sort of flowed to the bottom line. And that is the main reason why we actually see a 2 percentage growth, I think, in our PC business. So definitely on a translation perspective, because our reporting currency is U.S. dollar, I think that obviously will have an impact. But in terms of margin, we actually have a very, very good execution, I think, cadence so that I think our margin is actually sort of be able to protect it rather than being exposed.",260

So I think, very important reason is we have very strong team there. So definitely, another reason is we set the right strategy as I mentioned before. So not only we protect our commercial business, improve the profitability there, but we're very aggressive to attack the consumer market. So once we hit a certain percentage of market share, then that will help us to improve the profitability. Actually, last quarter -- so our -- not only our EMEA business grow by 24% on the revenue, so profit improvement is even more impressive. So actually, year-over-year, we improved by USD 88 million [ph]. So now we have almost -- we're close to 4%, 3.8% PTI in EMEA with -- so in the PC business, PC Plus tablet I think. PC Plus tablet, yes.",139

I think Wai Ming, you had talked about keeping margins -- PTI margins for that business about 5%. Can one make the argument that over the long term that if you're successful on the IBM side, the improved profitability there, that actually PC margins can actually rise over time, but the reason why you might be maintaining to a 5 percentage that you're reinvesting that profit to grow other aspects of the business? I think we've seen that before on your China business before. Is that something we can think about also for the PC side?",113

One, is obviously controlling the overall expenses so that we see the scaling benefit. And obviously, if we continue to grow our market share, which we believe that there are definitely opportunities for us to do that, I think the margin will, I think, gradually improve. But we -- I think from a group perspective, protect and attack. I think PC is our protect and it is going to be the profit pool for us, I think, to support the attack of the 2 new growth drivers, I think, currently, obviously, I think of the integration. So I think PC is still to be -- continue to be important. I don't think that will deliberately depress, I think, the sort of PC margin per se. We definitely go through execution, and that I think improve our top line, I think to see the opportunities to continue to grow our market share, as a result, will provide better profitability. So that will be a very strong base for us to support the growth of the 2 other drivers.",198

So I don't want to you to have too high expectation on the PTI ratio part, so -- because if we want to further grow -- improve that number, so it will -- probably, we have less chance to further grow market share, and also, probably our competitors will use that to attack us. So we should keep a certain flexibility in that aspect. So we must know how to balance the top line growth and the PTI ratio.",80

So definitely, for the current quarter, so it's a lower season, so probably -- so quarter-to-quarter, so the volume will decline.

Hello, everyone. [indiscernible] because now it becomes a once-a-year event to see you in person. But I'm very excited to share our performance in a historical year and discuss about our future strategy.
Last quarter, we again delivered strong results. Our revenue grew 21% year-on-year or, actually, 28%, if we're excluding exchange rate impact, reaching $11.3 billion. Earnings before M&A accounting charges increased 23% year-on-year to USD 194 million. We had a strong performance in all our businesses, led by our PC Group, which has now held the #1 position for 8 straight quarters. We gained share in every geo an improved margin by 1 point year-on-year and reached 5.5%.
In smartphones, we gained more than 1 point of share, actually, 1.2 points year-on-year, led by Motorola, which grew more than 23% year-on-year, although it's not as fast as previous quarters, but this is still a very decent growth; and also by rapid growth outside of China, where our volume was more than 5x the previous year. Volume outside China this quarter was 56% of our total smartphone volume. In tablets, we gained more than 1 point of share, so actually, 1.3 points, and we remained the #3 worldwide in both smartphone and tablets. 
In Enterprise, our legacy ThinkServer revenue grew more than 40%. System x, which was bought from IBM, revenue decline narrowed to 5%, but the operational margin improved by 4.2 points, reaching 2.7%. So last year, it was a loss business. But this year, our -- so we successfully turned it around. And our Ecosystem business continued to grow and now has 70 million monthly active users. Our strong quarter finished the record fiscal year.
For the fiscal year, our revenue reached a record of more than USD 46 billion, up 20% year-on-year. Excluding M&A accounting charges, we had a record net income of almost $1 billion, up 22% year-on-year. In the fiscal year, we shipped almost 60 million PCs to reach an all-time high share -- market share of 19.7% and grew at an 11-point premium to the market.
In Mobile, with Moto joining, we achieved a record volume of 76 million. And in tablets, we gained 1 point of share year-on-year, outgrowing the market more than 24 points. In Enterprise, ThinkServer revenue grew almost 50%. System x showed the first steps of success of our thorough and quick integration with revenues stabilizing gradually and the profit improved. Ecosystem business has generated 400 million users worldwide, up 300% year-on-year, and it generated USD 167 million revenue.
3 years ago, we made a commitment to improve our operational margin of legacy business, that's excluding Motorola and System x, by at least 1 point. We have overachieved that commitment, actually increasing this number from 2% in fiscal year '11/'12 to 3.2% in year '14/'15. These strong results show the formula for success that I always talk about: clear strategy, innovative products, operational excellence and a diverse global team and culture. It's clearly working, yet we are not satisfied and have a clear strategy for growth in the year ahead.
Motorola and System x integration are both on track. For both of these businesses, we are definitely confident in our strategic direction, while we also recognize we are still building a foundation for the future. It will take time for these to become additional core business for Lenovo. But we remain confident to build our $5 billion Enterprise Business with a stronger profit 1 year after closing, and we remain firm on turning Motorola around in 4 to 6 quarters after closing.
Our balanced growth and our acquisitions make Lenovo a significantly more diverse businesses. In products, PC has gone from more than 80% of revenue in the first half of the fiscal year to 64% in the second. Even with record PC performance, Mobile and Enterprise Business each accounts for 25% and 9%. And in geographies, China now only accounts for 32% of our total revenue; EMEA, E-M-E-A, 28%; Americas, 26%; and Asia Pacific, 14%.
In the year ahead, we will continue to execute our ""protect and attack"" strategy with the updated forecasts. In PCs, we will fully leverage the industry consolidation, leverage innovation and leverage our scale and efficiency to grow our share and protect our profit pool. In Enterprise, we will leverage synergies between System x and ThinkServer and between PC and Enterprise to fund the growth. We will further reduce costs, protect our leadership position in China and expanding into global data center and cloud service market.
In smartphones, we will grow with our dual-brand strategy. Motorola brand will enhance this position in North America, Latin America and Europe by significantly improving efficiency, and the Lenovo brand will focus on China and growing other emerging markets. In tablets, we will drive sales globally by leading in innovation. Ecosystem will continue to expand the Lenovo's user base and provide greater applications and user experience.
To ensure better forecast, we reorganized the company, combining PC and the Enterprise Businesses to leverage the synergy in R&D, supply chain and procurement, and opportunities in channels and customer base. Our President and COO, Gianfranco, focuses on overseeing that part of the business. Mobile, ECS and IoT are more interrelated and have untapped growth potential, so I am focusing more on these areas.
In this Internet-plus [ph] era, Lenovo will embrace a new vision to transform from a product-centric to a customer-centric company. To do that, first, we are moving from making mostly hardware to a fusion of hardware, software and cloud services. With our devices and our infrastructure and cloud capabilities, users can better connect with their devices, personal data and services, and the devices can better connect with networks and other devices in a most reliable, smooth and secure way.
Second, we are moving from onetime purchase to multiple touch points with customers, even in just the individual consumer customers. So these touch points will be before, during and, more importantly, after purchase. These are bold aspirations, but we are determined and have aligned the company to work towards this direction.
Before I close, I want to mention that Lenovo will showcase its innovative products, prototypes and overall picture of innovation direction at the Lenovo Tech World in Beijing on May 28. We also will reveal our new brand, our younger look and feel, more energetic and vibrant. Many Lenovo fans will be there to share our excitement.
Last year was a record year for Lenovo, but we will never stand still. Now we are prepared to unlock substantial growth across our company, which is now more diverse and balanced than ever before.
Thank you, everyone. Now let me turn this to our CFO, Wai Ming.",1119

Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo financial and operational performances in Q4 and our fiscal year 2015. Next chart, please. Fiscal year 2015 is another record year for Lenovo. Group revenue increased 20% year-on-year to a record high of $46.3 billion, which obviously included the 2 quarters of System x and 5 months of Motorola financial performance. If we exclude the currency impact, the group revenue will have increased 23% year-on-year.
Group PTI before noncash M&A-related accounting charges was $1.139 billion, up 12% against last year. The noncash accounting charges related to the 2 M&A transactions were $168 million, which include the intangible asset amortization, the imputed interest expense on the 3-year promissory note issued as part of the Motorola transaction. Group PTI was $971 million, down 4%; and group net income was $829 million, up 1% year-on-year. Group net income before the noncash M&A-related accounting charges was $997 million, up 22% year-on-year for the fiscal year, the record high level for net income in our corporate history.
In addition to the noncash accounting charges, we have also incurred approximately $197 million in M&A-related cash expenses for the year, comprised of expense, mostly the loan interest expenses, severance payment as well as the postmerger management expenses that is included in our PTI before the noncash M&A-related accounting charges. We have provided a bridge reconciling these different financial figures in the chart after the financial summary page. We delivered a very solid performance with growth drivers from the new businesses, and we continue to be on track for our commitment to drive sustainable profitability improvement.
Next chart, please. This slide gives you a more detailed view of our financial performance for the fiscal year and quarter 4. The results reflected this -- the results reflected a solid growth of our legacy PC business and the 2 acquired businesses. Gross profit increased 32% year-on-year with margin improved to 14.4%, driven by the higher gross margin, the Motorola and System x businesses.
Operating expense increased by 39% to around $5.6 billion. There's increase in E/R ratio for the fiscal year, and that is primarily driven by the 2 acquired businesses. We recorded net other operating expenses of $137 million, mainly included the interest expenses accrued for the USD 1.5 billion 5-year notes issued in early May last year, the interest -- the imputed interest expenses on the promissory notes, as well as some factoring cost and foreign currencies expenses.
The effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 13.8%. It's lower than last year, again, due to the tax benefit associated with the 2 businesses we acquired. Profit for the period was $837 million, and profit attributable to equity holders was $829 million. The difference between the 2 profit lines were due to our joint venture partner sharing of the gain in relation to our Compal joint venture recorded in the fiscal year.
In Q4, we have included a full quarter of Motorola and System x financial performances. Revenue is up 21% year-to-year to around $11.3 billion. Excluding the foreign currency impact, the group revenue will have been increased by 28%. Gross profit was up 43% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Margin increased by 2.4 points year-on-year to 15.7%, again, with the help of the 2 M&A transactions -- 2 M&A businesses.
Operating profit decreased by 45% year-to-year to $127 million due to the high E/R of the 2 businesses that we acquired. Other nonoperating expenses was $23 million, mainly attributable to the increase in the bond interest, again, the imputed interest from the promissory note and the factoring cost.
If we exclude the noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $94 million for the quarter, the pretax income was $198 million, down 7% year-to-year; and profit attributable to equity holders was $194 million, up 23% year-on-year. The reported pretax income was $104 million, and the reported profit attributable to equity holders was $100 million. Basic EPS for the year, USD 0.0777 compared to USD 0.0788 last year. The board declared in the meeting this morning to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.205 per share.
Next chart, please. Now this chart actually will provide a bridge to reconcile all the different financial figures that I mentioned earlier to give you a much better view on how our performance include -- after excluding those M&A-related cash or noncash expenses.  
Next chart, please. Looking at the balance sheet. The main driver for the change in our balance sheet is the inclusion of the Motorola and the System x businesses. Noncurrent assets were about $11.7 billion, and current assets were about $15.4 billion as of 31st of March 2015. We have net current liabilities around $1.7 billion. The change was due to, again, the inclusion of the 2 M&A businesses. The noncurrent liabilities was around $5.8 billion.  
Next chart, please. Looking at the cash and working capital. Operating cash flow for the year is $238 million, was net of an investment in working capital for our Motorola and System x businesses. Both acquired businesses currently are not run on a negative cash conversion cycle basis. We are taking actions to bring both businesses to be in line with our existing business model, which is -- are run on a negative cash conversion cycle. We will continue to drive improvement of our balance sheet by rearranging part of our short-term borrowings into long-term facilities. 
At the end of March, we had net borrowings of around $28 million, but that exclude the $1.5 billion promissory note that we issued to Google. The change was due to working capital and also capital expenditure. Cash conversion cycle for the fiscal year was negative 2 days, flat year-on-year. The cash conversion cycle for quarter 4 was positive 3 days against the negative 4 days same quarter last year and negative 2 days last quarters. Again, the deviation is primarily driven from the 2 businesses we acquired.
Next chart, please. Our overall business is much more diversified. We continue to drive profit improvement from our core PC business and drive top line growth through our Mobile and Enterprise Group, which are our new growth engines. For the PC business, despite the challenges in Brazil, we achieved profit growth with share gain in all geographies, particularly in EMEA. For the fiscal year, our PC revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $33.3 billion with a record high pretax income of $1.8 billion and pretax margin of 5.3%, up 1.6 points year-to-year. The group continue to leverage the industry consolidation and enhance our leadership position, with better scale helping the PC profit margin.
On Mobile Business Group. That includes our legacy phone, Lenovo phone, tablet and our TV business and 5 months of Motorola businesses. The revenue of this business group increased 71% year-on-year to $9.1 billion, driven by the inclusion of the Motorola business. PTI recorded a loss of $370 million, and the pretax margin was negative 4%. Our legacy smartphone business continued to see tremendous growth in markets outside of China, growing by 126% year-to-year for the fiscal year. Our smartphone business in China, however, continue to be challenging as the carrier subsidies were cut, driving shipments through carrier channel to trend down, while the Internet sales increased with income addition from other plays. Both factors disrupted the market and negatively affected our phone business in China.
Integration of Motorola was on track to turnaround in 4 to 6 quarters since the deal closed. Motorola enhanced its position in its core markets, such as in Latin America, U.S. and India. In quarter 3, Motorola operating result was positively impacted by the higher volume sold in the last 2 months when we consolidated the accounts. In quarter 4, however, Motorola operation result were back to its normal full quarter run rate and continue to see -- and we continue to see profitability improvements. And for tablets, our worldwide tablet shipment was up 26% year-on-year with strong growth in markets outside of China. Tablet shipments outside China now represent approximately 87% of our global volume.
Enterprise Business. Revenue showed an increase of 4.2x year-on-year to $2.6 billion, which include 2 quarters of System x businesses. Our ThinkServer business continued to show strong growth, while System x business started to show signs of stabilization during the first 2 quarters of integration. PTI for the combined server and storage business recorded a loss of $121 million and pretax margin of a negative 4.6%. We will fully leverage the synergies and Lenovo's strength in the supply chain, R&D and channel to enhance the System x competitiveness to achieve stability and future growth targets. At the same time, we will improve its efficiency and ensure that its cost structure is competitive. Our '15/'16 commitment in the Enterprise Business Group is to drive $5 billion sales revenue, where the good margin remains exactly the same.
Next chart, please. Performance by geography. Our geographic exposure is also very balanced to support our future growth. Looking at China. Total revenue from China was down marginally year-on-year. However, profit was up 1% year-on-year. Our overall margin in China was flat year-on-year to 5.4%, as China's smartphone industry challenges negatively affected our Mobile Business in the country. And we had also invested this year to bring the Moto back to China to drive sustainable growth over time. Our PC business continued to perform well despite the market decline, with the market share improved year-on-year by 1.5 points to 36.6%, while holding up its margin well. For smartphone, we are charging back in China by continuing to expand this business through more routes to market, including online and also new channel from ShenQi and also a broader portfolio of Lenovo and Motorola products.
For Asia Pacific. The revenue was up 6% year-on-year to about $6.6 billion in Asia Pacific. Profits was up 1.8x year-on-year. Our overall operating margin improved substantially by 2.8 points year-on-year to 4.6%. PC business continued to gain share and achieve record high market share. The better operational efficiency from scaling benefits helped to -- the profitability improvement of the geography. Motorola performed very well in the region, especially in India, which helped strong growth of the combined smartphone shipment of Asia Pacific region to double in the fiscal year.
For EMEA. EMEA, the revenue was up 34% year-on-year to about $12.8 billion; profit, up 1.2x year-on-year. Our overall margin improved by 1.2 points year-on-year to 3.2%. Our PC business continued to gain share and achieve record high market share. In smartphone, we record a strong growth of 3.4x year-on-year in EMEA, driven by the momentum from both Lenovo and the Motorola brand.
In America. Revenue was up 49% year-on-year to about $12.2 billion, largely due to the addition of the System x and the Motorola businesses. We record a profit of $8 million in the region, largely due to the challenges in Brazil and the ramping up of the newly acquired businesses. For PC, we continue to deliver solid growth in the PC business in North America region and achieve a record high market share with margin improvement year-on-year in the fiscal year. With the continuation of the strong shipment performance of Motorola, our smartphone shipment grew about 30x year-on-year in the American region for the fiscal year. For Enterprise, we're preparing the foundation to attack and capture more Enterprise customers in the near future. 
However, our performance in Brazil was still impacted by the weak market environment, which resulted in weak demand as well as relatively high inventory in the market. Currency fluctuation also negatively impacted Lenovo as well as the Motorola performance despite its strong revenue growth momentum. We have been refining our business strategy in PC, and actions are in place to stabilize the Brazil business. Proactive actions taken -- are taken to improve our performance, includes simplifying our product portfolio, improving operational control and supply chain efficiency, as well as we actually have a new local leadership team in place to execute our strategy.
Looking ahead, it is clear that the Internet will continue to impact the market as far as the industry. As Yuanqing just mentioned, we are now taking proactive actions to transform ourself from a product-centric to a customer-centric company so as to actively engage customer, thus to improve the overall customer experience and operational efficiency over time.
In the short term, we will continue to see the PC industry will be relatively -- the PC market will be relatively soft. We will, however, continue to leverage the ongoing consolidation trend in the PC industry to grow both share and improve profitability while scaling our operation.
For the Mobile Business Group, our legacy phone business remains challenging. With the strengthening of our online model and the launch of the new Internet start-up, ShenQi, we expect some initial results later in the year, although its contribution will not be significant financially in the early stages. Outside China, we will continue to drive our business, as we see more opportunity in the rest of the world. We expect ""rest of the world"" growth will continue to be stronger than that in China.
As a result of a difficult economic environment, I think, in markets where Motorola has significant business, Motorola will -- has to deal with significant challenges, including a significant depreciation of the local currency, foreign currency exchange control and also imported duties on imported products. Motorola, as a result, may not be able, in the short term, to continue to grow at a significance to the market that we saw in the last few quarters. 
In the meantime, in order for us to drive operational efficiency of the entire Mobile Business Group, we plan to accelerate the integration of Motorola operation into the Lenovo smartphone businesses. However, we are -- remain confident that we can achieve breakeven in 4 to 6 quarters after the close, as we previously planned. Actions planned to execute in the short term will only generate returns in the second half of the year.
Likewise, we are very confident of our Enterprise Business targets. The System x -- we will build System x into a $5 billion business with good margin, which we are actually on track. We expect to see continuous growth in our operational profit, that is excluding the noncash, the M&A-related accounting charges, that will be driven from scaling as well as operating efficiency enhancements. We are devoted to drive growth and outperforming the industry and, in turn, enhance our profitability over time. We are very confident in delivering the year-to-year profitable growth of the group in the new fiscal year.

Could you talk a little bit about what are the steps you are taking to address these challenges? Also, second question is, like Wai Ming mentioned, you're accelerating the Motorola integration back into the Lenovo parent. Last time, I think Yuanqing has mentioned $500 million potential cost savings target. Could you give some indications about how the cost savings is coming through and when should we start expecting some of these benefits coming through?",99

So currently, the challenge is the market is shifting from the carrier market into the open market and to the online market. So actually, carrier market or subsidy model dropped from more than 50% to now less than 38%. So we were very strong in the carrier market. So we -- now we need to build our strong position in the open market and in the online market. So actually, we have realized this challenge 1 year or even more before. So we have started to build our capability in the open market and in the online market. So actually, we launched our Lenovo smartphone with JD.com. We will launch another product called the VIBE Shot. We actually showed at the MWC in Barcelona. So soon, we will launch that with the Tmall of Alibaba, so very, very, very soon. We have seen very -- some very positive results, although it's very unusual. First step of success, but I think it's a good signal. So we are moving faster and are determined to the online -- to the open market. Definitely, ShenQi is another weapon. We have worked there for quite a while, so of that team [ph]. So probably, they will launch another product with a different brand, so more Internet-related model, so very soon. For the carrier market, we still -- we will not give up that market, but we will more focus on the profitability. So with this strategy and change, so we are very confident. So by the end of the year, so we can have the positive profit as we'll recover the growth in that market. But to be frank, so China market now is not as attractive as the rest of the world. From the 1 aspect, the growth is very limited or is declining. From the other aspect, the competition is very fierce. I will say, it's not reasonable, it's not reasonable. Some players just disclosed their ball [ph], so -- and clearly tell you, we don't want to make money, so we see all the costs. So that's not reasonable competition. So that's why we pay more attention to the rest of the world. Actually, we have seen a very good result, very positive results. Outside China now accounts for 56% of our total volume last quarter. It will further grow over time, particularly with the Lenovo brand in emerging market. We grow faster, and we make money, like in India, in Indonesia, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe. So our growth are pretty dramatic, and the profit are pretty good. Actually, this is Lenovo's unique advantage after we acquired the Motorola business. We don't have an IP issue. So that's different from most of Chinese players. So they cannot go overseas. So that's our -- another strategy. China is still very important. We will fix that, but we should pay more attention to the rest of world rather than just in China. Lastly, Motorola, I think, definitely, we will realize that $500 million synergy, so through the procurement and some other areas. But only relying on this is not enough to turn around the business. So actually, Motorola enjoyed faster recovery from the faster declining of the Google broadband last fiscal year. So they have built the strong base in U.S. and Latin America, but not somewhere else, not somewhere else. So to further grow with the Motorola brand, so we will see some bottleneck, we will see some bottleneck. We must take some action to help this business to build more competitive, more solid foundation, core competence in terms of products, business model and cost structure. Otherwise, we will not be able to deliver our commitment to turn around the business in 4 to 6 quarters. So I think our next step is to have the solo [ph] and the faster integration with the Lenovo business so that we can help them to improve in these aspects: product portfolio, competitiveness, cost structure, business model. So that's our plan. So we are still firm. We are -- our commitment is still not changed. We are still firm to turn around this in 4 to 6 quarters. Actually, by now, only 2 to 4 quarters left, so we understand that.",716

I'm from SocGen Haitong. I got 2 questions. Firstly, on the P&L, I would say that from Q4's P&L, 2 things surprised me. One, the GPM was higher perhaps by over 1 percentage point versus consensus. Secondly, operating expense is also pretty high. So want to know if the OpEx thing is sustainable, so should we expect higher OpEx going forward than perhaps some of the analysts have so far expected for the next year? And is the GPM also sustainable above 15%?",88

It's very easy to understand because both System x, so IBM server business, and the Motorola business have a higher GP. So that helps drive the higher GP. So E/R higher is also easy to understand because both of these business lost money. So that means they have an even higher E/R. But I think this is not a bad thing. This is actually a good thing for us. So you can easily understand, though, what's the next step we should take. So definitely, we need to cut the expense to make sure we can turn around the business or to make better profit. So actually, we have already taken action in the Enterprise space. So Gianfranco, you can share something here.",126

No. Yes, on -- the margin, as Yuanqing said, is very, very easy to understand. Of course, if you take Enterprise, they are running a very -- at a very different margin than PC, which is an industry standard. I know that we are -- we are not different than the rest of the industry. But also, our OpEx are running at a very different index than PC, and this is not industry standard, frankly speaking. We are a little bit higher than industry. So what we are going -- well, what we are merging together, PCG and EBG, as you have seen during Yuanqing's presentation. We will -- we are looking for a lot of synergies, synergy on the supply chain, synergy on manufacturing. We can combine supply chain, and we can combine part of the manufacturing. We even can combine part -- we are combining part of the R&D because between developing a workstation or developing a tower, there is not too much difference. We are simplifying -- not simplifying, optimizing the product portfolio. There was some overlap. We are looking at the overall infrastructure, structure in terms of OpEx, for back end mainly. So I think that by the end of -- within the next couple of quarters, you will see, at least on Enterprise, OpEx going down to industry standard, which is something in the range of 15% [ph] to 16% [ph] and not the current more or less 30% [ph] we have.",253

I think that you already addressed a lot in the update. And I also noticed that the PTI margin in the PC side, actually, it was very high, like a 5.5%. Regardless, the revenue actually is in -- was in the softer season. So my question is how the company achieved this high PTI margin, and should we expect this PTI margin to continue in the second quarter -- June quarter and the second half? And also, I also noticed that actually, India becomes a big part of the PC market. So -- and we all know that the country actually increased their tariff fee. So how is the India strategy? Will we increase the manufacturing domestically?",125

I think we continue to be relatively soft. The real difference, I think, is coming from scale in the sense that we see most of the second-tier player, let's say, really suffered. And so we see the top 3, that they continue to be strong and maybe even stronger. But on the other side, most of the Tier 2 players, so #4 -- not really 4, let's say 5, because there is also Apple in the top 4. So number 5, 6 and 7 that are getting really, really weak, which from our side, it means that we can continue to grow revenue, and we can continue to improve our scale in the sense that we don't need to add too many OpEx if we want to increase market share. I think we have a very solid -- I think we spent most of last year to build up a very solid foundation in terms of PC Group and also in terms of geo. Today, we are running [ph] consumer almost everywhere without losing money, for example, but it was not true 1 year ago. And this is why you see much better profitability than before.

From 1 side is to develop the right product because, of course, product is very different when you talk about -- this kind of solution are quite different than traditional server and storage. So high density is very different than the standard traditional server and storage. We are also looking, from a manufacturing point of view, what we can do in terms of manufacturing in-house because, today, we have -- most of the big players, when you talk about this kind of segment, are ODMs. What is the strength of ODMs manufacturing? But if you look, we are exactly in the same position as any other ODMs. So we manufacture today -- a big quantity of our notebooks is manufactured in-house. A big portion of our PC is manufactured in-house. All our servers are already manufactured in-house. We just need to strengthen these kind of things and becoming more competitive in terms of product design, which is something we are addressing, and manufacturing -- MDA on the other side. In terms of components, in terms of the supply chain, I don't think we have an issue because we are as big as any other ODMs, probably bigger than any other ODMs there.",208

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3545.0,858316.0,36982284.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will firstly discuss our last quarter results and then talk about some important strategic initiatives. Last quarter, we faced severe challenges in the market. The PC market declined significantly and faster than expected because of lower inventories ahead of Windows 10 launch and the currency depreciation. The currency fluctuations and the broad macroeconomic issues in Brazil and in the entire Latin America constrained the growth and impacted the profitability of Motorola because of the higher concentration of its business there. 
In China, smartphone market shift from more carrier speeded up, and the competition become more intensified. In fact, it was perhaps the toughest quarter, especially for PCs, since the 2008 and the 2009 global financial crisis. But Lenovo continued to deliver solid performance despite these challenges. Our PC business, still our solid core business, reached the record worldwide share while improving margins year-on-year, although revenue and profit declined with the market. 
In tablets, we outgrew the market by 12 points and narrowed the gap with top 2. In our Enterprise Business, Lenovo ThinkServer business grew faster with revenue up 41% year-on-year, especially in China where ThinkServer revenue were up 56% year-on-year. Lenovo regained #1 in China's x86 server market. We have delivered the operational profit in the combined enterprise business for the third straight quarter. 
In smartphones, our strategic shift from China to rest of the world has paid off. Our volume outside China is now 65% of the total compared with 18% a year ago. Lenovo-branded smartphones outside of China grew volume by 68% year-on-year, and it was profitable. 
Our overall phone volume grew in Middle East and Africa by 380%, Asia Pacific by 82% and the Eastern Europe by 36%. In the biggest emerging markets, Brazil, Russia and India, our overall market share reached the 21%, 10% and 6%, respectively. And we ranked at #2, #2 and #5. But our Motorola business was affected by the macroeconomic issues in Latin America and other markets. This, coupled with the higher cost structure and the longer product life cycle, has resulted in worse-than-expected losses and impacted our overall performance in profit. We will talk about our actions to fix this later. 
For Lenovo overall, revenue grew 3% year-on-year, or actually 10% if excluding exchange-related impact, reaching $10.7 billion. Net income before M&A accounting charges was down 8% year-on-year to USD 196 million. Although these are pretty solid results in a tough environment, we realized we must act quickly, proactively and decisively to meet these market challenges. Our core PC business is strong and competitive and our foundation is solid, but we must react to the faster-than-expected market decline and reduce the fixed expenses in order to leverage industry consolidation to gain more share. We will keep raising the bar of efficiency for the industry and continue to deliver margin improvement so that this business can provide the capital for the growth of the new businesses. 
Mobile and Enterprise businesses are new growth engine for our future, and their strategic importance remains unchanged. We are still in the process of aligning elements of the acquired businesses with our legacy business and building the right business model and cost structure. On one hand, I want you to understand that turning them into our profit pool still needs more efforts, and it will take some time. On the other hand, we are fully aware that we must take immediate actions to deliver our commitments. We have made progress integrating Enterprise business. But with the challenges in U.S. and other mature markets, we will do more and ensure we build a highly efficient cost structure to deliver the growth and the profitability. We will invest in the fastest-growth segments, high-volume servers, hyperscale and the converged systems, while improving our global sales force.
We will further drive the hypergrowth in China and other potential markets. In smartphones, it's time, it's necessary to further align key elements of Motorola with Lenovo to leverage our complementary strength, to reduce redundancy, to cut cost and the expenses and to improve efficiency. We will build much simpler, more efficient organizations and processes, which will become our solid foundation to success. Motorola will take the lead in product development, design, engineering and manufacturing, while Lenovo will fully leverage our global sales force to drive growth. We will have a much simpler product portfolio and eliminate redundancies. After finishing this, it will help us save around USD 850 million per year. 
Totally, with these actions, Lenovo will reduce its workforce by about 3,200 people in nonmanufacturing workforce worldwide, which equates to 10% of our total nonmanufacturing workforce and 5% of our total population. Most of this will be completed in fiscal Q2. When this action is completed, we expect to deliver $1.35 billion of annualized savings in operating expenses with our restructuring costs of about $600 million and a materialized $650 million in savings for the second half of this fiscal year. This is tough but the right decision to improve our competitiveness and to better focus our resources in this fast-changing market. We expect these efforts to help achieve our previous commitments. In PCs, our goal is still to achieve 30% market share. And in Enterprise, starting from $5 billion yearly business, we want to deliver sustainable growth with good margin. In Mobile, we remain firm to our goal of achieving breakeven in 2 to 3 quarters, and we aim at being a solid #3. 
More broadly, throughout the company, we are working on Lenovo's transformation through developing our unique competitive advantages. We are building our direct sales capabilities. We are combining our offline channel and service capabilities with online sales opportunities. We are exploring innovative ways of providing personalized and customized services to our customers. I believe this is the right decision, and I have confidence in the team's ability to precisely execute. And we will continue to deliver meaningful innovation in our products after showcasing our forward-looking technologies at the Tech World such as Smart Case and the Magic View. We will launch the new wave of mobile phones, and you can look for us to make a splash at the IFA next month in Berlin with a wave of new holiday PCs, tablets and the wearables. When we emerge from these actions, the short term and the long term, we will be a stronger company that has built unique competitive advantages, not only in efficiency but also in innovation. 
Now let me turn you to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",1093
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3545.0,858316.0,36982285.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2016. Next chart, please. Our group revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $10.7 billion. Excluding the currency impacts, the group revenue was up 10% year-on-year. Gross profit increased 22% year-on-year with margin improved to 15.4%, driven by better PC margin benefited from scaling and higher gross margin of newly acquired businesses. Operating expenses increased by 47% to around $1.6 billion. The increase in E-to-R ratio for the quarter is mainly driven by the 2 acquired businesses. We recorded net other nonoperating expenses of $44 million, which mainly included interest expenses from USD 1.5 billion 5-year notes we issued in May last year, the RMB 4 billion notes issued in this June and the included interest expense from Motorola deal-related promissory notes. 
PDI was $52 million. We recorded a tax credit of $50 million for the quarter associated with the losses incurred in Motorola and System x businesses. Profit for the period was $102 million, and profit attributable to equity holders was $105 million. The difference between the 2 profit lines is due to the sharing of operating loss in relation to the Compal joint venture recorded in the quarter.
Next chart, please. In this chart, we have provided a bridge to reconcile different financial figures to give you an overview and how these figures are calculated. The noncash M&A-related accounting charges related to the 2 M&A transactions were $91 million, which include intangible asset amortization of System x and Motorola, included interest expense of the 3-year promissory note issue as part of the Motorola transaction and others.
Next chart, please. There are no significant changes to our balance sheet since 31st March, 2015. The noncurrent assets were about $11.8 billion, and current assets were about $14.9 billion as of 30th of June, 2015. We had net current liabilities of around $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which was slightly lower than that in the March end. The noncurrent liabilities were around $6.4 billion.
Next chart, please. We reported an operating cash flow of $310 million, which was driven by payments in Q1 for expenses accrued in last financial year, including year-end bonuses, taxation and business partner incentives. The cash conversion cycle for the quarter was positive 5 days against negative 6 days the same quarter last year and positive 3 days last quarter. The positive cash conversion cycle was driven by a higher mix of mobility and consumer businesses, which normally have longer receivable dates. We will take necessary actions to tighten up the credit periods for those businesses in order to achieve a better working capital performance.
Next chart, please. PC business group. We continue to outperform the markets, even though the market continued to slow down, and gained share in all geos. Our PC revenue decreased by 13% year-on-year to $7.3 billion. Excluding currency impacts, the revenue decline would be about 5% year-on-year. Pretax margin was up slightly to 5.1% and benefited from the effective margin management and scaling benefits, while our PC ASP remained stable. 
Mobile Business Group. Our smartphone business outside China, especially in the emerging markets, continued to record strong growth, but our legacy business in China was impacted by overinvesting in the carrier channels as well as intense competition in tough market environments. Motorola has a significant business in Brazil and Latin America, and this business was significantly affected by the weak economy as well as the depreciating currency in those markets. We remain #3 tablet player worldwide. Shipment grew 4% year-to-year to 2.5 million, and our market share was up 0.7 points to 5.6%. 
For MBG, revenue increased 33% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, helped by the inclusion of the Motorola business. We recorded loss before taxation of USD 292 million and a negative 13.8% pretax margin, largely due to the softness in markets where we have significant business as well as the relatively high fixed cost. 
Enterprise Business Group. Revenue of Enterprise Business Group showed an increase of 5.8x year-on-year to $1.1 billion, helped by the inclusion of the System x business. We recorded operational profits before the noncash M&A accounting charges in the combined Enterprise business for the past 3 straight quarters.
Next chart, please. China. Revenue from China was $3.2 billion, down 16% year-on-year, while PDI was $153 million and operating margin was 4.8%, declined by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year, largely driven by the weak smartphone performance. We maintained a strong #1 position in China PC, despite market challenges, while holding up margin. Our EBG revenue grew 235%, and we regained the #1 position in the x86 server markets in China.
Asia Pacific. Japan is a principal driver for the decline of the AP PC market. Not only the market was affected by the weak economy, Japan also enjoyed the benefit brought from having help from the Window XP refreshment in quarter 1 last year. We continue to grow PC units in other AP regions and gain share, particularly in ANZ. Our smartphone business achieved strong growth in this region, including ASEAN and India, driven by substantial growth of the Lenovo brand phones and inorganic help of Motorola. As a result, our revenue in AP continued to grow year-on-year. While our PC margin improved year-on-year, the overall AP margin recorded a decline, mainly due to the challenges from Motorola. 
EMEA. The PC market in EMEA recorded a decline in quarter 1 as demand was impacted by the macro challenges and currency fluctuation. Our PC shipment and revenue were down as a result, even though we continue to achieve share gain and year-on-year margin improvement. Our smartphone and Enterprise business are still in the investment phase. We are seeing good progress in our Lenovo brand phone in EMEA. Our EMEA revenue was down by 5% to $2.6 billion. Profit before tax was $40 million, and operating margin was 1.5%.
Americas. Our PC unit shipments in North America remained strong with record high market share, driven by strong growth in consumer business. However, this strong performance was offset by slow performance in the challenging Brazilian market. This weak macroeconomic environment in Brazil has also impacted our smartphone businesses, particularly the Motorola business in Latin America and Brazil account for a substantial part of this business. 
Americas revenue was up 46% year-on-year to about $3.3 billion, helped by the addition of System x and Motorola businesses. We recorded an operating loss of $131 million in the region, mainly attributable to the losses in Brazil and Motorola businesses. As Yuanqing mentioned, we announced today our business realignment plan to enhance the company's overall competitiveness and to drive consistent, healthy profitable growth in all of our businesses. The business realignment plan aims to reduce our annualized operating expense by approximately $1.35 billion, and we expect approximately $650 million of such savings realized in the second half of the fiscal year. As a result of the realignment plan, there will be a onetime expense expected to be charged in quarter 2, which comprises of approximately $600 million restructuring charges and approximately $300 million additional spending to clear our smartphone inventory. 
The actions taken under the business realignment plan will enable us to continue to maintain our profitability and gain market share for our PC business. For EBG, we are on track to drive good operating margin with $5 billion annual turnover going forward. We continue to manage our MBG business to drive more efficiency and believe that the business can achieve an operational breakeven position in about 2 to 3 quarters. We will continue to invest in areas we believe are important to us, and we remain committed to our protect-and-attack strategy to drive better return to our shareholders. Thank you.

I think the decline in the current quarter was primarily driven by I think the smartphone business in China. And going forward, obviously, as you mentioned, I think the China economy remains slow. But we obviously will continue to, I think, have a very strong PC business. And that probably will not -- well, I think the -- looking at our China business as a whole, I think, in some way, it depends on, I think, the PC market outlook. We definitely do not see significant further slowdown of PC. And therefore, I definitely will -- do not see that there will be further significant decline in our PC -- in our business in China as a whole.",124

So in the PC area, definitely, we -- our competitiveness is no problem. We keep growing share and improving the profitability. So that's still the very strong business. So -- but definitely, for smartphone market, because the market is shifting from the carrier to the open market, so our carrier market, the mix is much higher than the market average. So definitely, it's more than our competition. So we are trying to build the new capability in the older market and the online model. So we're definitely have seen the first steps of success to our Lenovo [ph] product line. That's worked with the JD.com very well. So in the first half year, so actually, we sold 2 million units through this channel. And also, we work with Alibaba for the product line of VIBE Shot. So -- also, we have seen the good results. Yesterday, we just launched the ZUK, so which are an independent company and an independent brand. So -- but Lenovo owned majority of the share of the company. So we had a very successful launch. And so actually, in just 24 hours, we have about more than 500,000 units orders -- pre-orders. So that's our effort to drive the smartphone sales in China. But actually, in China, we have another opportunity, which is Enterprise. So actually, our Enterprise business is very -- it's growing very fast, and it's very strong business actually. So Lenovo ThinkServer business grew by 56% year-on-year last quarter in China. Our overall Enterprise business grew like 15%, 16%. So that's a very encouraging business. We actually regained that #1 in the server area in China. So definitely, China is still Lenovo's strong bet [ph]. So we will make more effort to ensure how we can grow in that market further.

Because I'm actually kind of confused with this introduction of the new brand, ZUK, because you now have not just Lenovo. You have Motorola, and then you have a new brand. I think apparently, with the new brand, you need to make more investments to build that brand. And how are you going to really integrate the resources and try to bring down the cost? So really, what's the plan to turn around the Mobility business, if you can share?",112

So we are very confident so after this realignment action, so we will turn around the -- not just the Motorola business, but the entire Mobile business in 2 to 3 quarters. So we're committed when we close the deal with Motorola. So actually -- so last quarter, we've had a challenge in Latin America, particularly Latin America, and so because of the macro economy was not that strong and currency was very weak. So the Motorola business -- so Latin America accounts for 50% of volume. So that's definitely a significant and feeds the performance, particularly the profit part. So meanwhile, another issue is Motorola product life cycle is too long. So by the end of the life cycle -- so actually, the product is not competitive, particularly for Moto G and Moto X. So definitely, after this realignment, so we will improve our product development cycle to ensure in every period, so our product will be competitive. The third one definitely is our cost structure. So it's way too high. So our Motorola business actually has pretty good gross margin, but the E-to-R ratio is also very high. So we think after this realignment action or restructuring action, so we can save USD 850 million on a yearly basis. So that can definitely help us to improve the profitability. So we still believe we have the good chance to turn around with this business in 2 to 3 quarters. But definitely because of -- we will realign the majority of elements of the Motorola with the legacy Lenovo business. So you can check our overall mobile business in the next couple of quarters. Regarding of the ZUK part, so we have to use the different way to attack the China online market and definitely open market. So we try to use the company's Internet [indiscernible] to do that. So actually, that have more attention to the -- to a software, to the application, to the user experience. And so -- and also they are a start-up company. They try to use the capital market to fund their business in the future. So that will be additional business. So it's not the Lenovo traditional business [indiscernible] focus of area. So -- and also, we are only focusing in China.",381

Well, I think we have -- let's say, the slowdown is mainly coming from some geographical areas. I would say it's mainly coming from EMEA, where we have seen the market slowing down by 20% last quarter. We see there's some good premium, but the situation in EMEA is probably a little bit worse than expected on some channel inventories, not only in [indiscernible] but mainly from competition. Very weak situation in Russia and the east overall. And you see ruble is still deteriorating even the last couple of days, from RUB 50-something to RUB 63, so the situation is not going to improve. And this were the area where we were particularly strong. So we are taking action because -- we are taking action. On the other side, we are -- we'll start to see a very good momentum in U.S. where we have gained more than 1 point share. And I think we will continue to gain share this quarter as well. We're also taking action in some other areas. I think that this quarter, when we come back with good premium to market better than last quarter. But I think in Q1, we've also been very, very cautious in terms of inventory due to the transition to Windows 10. And so we need to push to watch in terms of loading the China on the inventory side. So our overall situation on inventory is probably better than competition today. But -- and there, we also have been very, very careful on managing -- or let's say, balancing between share growth and profitability. Because we are still running with over 5% profitability. And I would assume -- we didn't see yet the competition result, but I would assume it's by far better in the industry today.",300

So I think why we do this restructuring, so there are 2 reasons. The first is because the PC market is declining significantly. So although our PC business is still very strong, it's very -- it's still profitable. But we think we should do the priority of reaction to the market. So we must cover the fixed expense, and so that we can be more competitive in the market. We believe some players were quicker than the industry. So we definitely should leverage our advantage -- our strength to gain more market share in the market. So that's the first part of the restructuring, so it will be related to our PC growth and our corporate function -- corporate headquarter function. The second part is related to our new acquired businesses, so Motorola and System x, particularly for Motorola. So because -- so this business, firstly, is affecting -- challenging in Latin America, as I just said. So last quarter, because the Latin American macro economy is very weak and the currency is weak as well, so it significantly impacted the demand in the market as well as the profitability. So because the -- more than 50% of the Motorola volume comes from that area, so that hits the Motorola business significantly. That generate the more than $200 million loss in the business. Meanwhile, so we think Motorola cost structure is way too high. So when the business is not growing, it will become -- it becomes even more obvious. So if we don't take action, so we will miss our commitments to turn around the business in 4 to 3 -- 6 quarters after the acquisition. So we -- so that's why we will do this restructuring. So we -- actually, after restructuring, we can save more than USD 850 million a year. So that will benefit to turn around the business. So we are still confident we can turn around that in 2 to 3 quarters after we take out the expense and the costs. For the Enterprise business, although we have integrated with the Lenovo legacy business, we have saved a lot of money, so more than $500 million. But given we are facing challenging U.S. and other mature markets, so I think definitely, we'll have the room to further strengthen the competitiveness in this business. So these are the 2 reasons, so we do the restructuring work. So overall, we will save $1.35 million -- we will save [ph] USD 1.35 billion a year. So among that, so you can see the $650 million will be booked in the second half of this fiscal year. So the cost will be around $600 million.",449

But we still see big opportunities in terms of growth despite being #1 because I think we are #1, but we have a very strong position on rack and tower. We still see huge opportunity on hyperscale on the other side. We are starting to do some -- we are starting to see some good results. But opportunity is still big. The other big opportunity, in my opinion, is the storage where we are working and we start to see also some good result. Talking about converged, let's say, integration between server, storage and networking, we are working on different possibility and different solution, not only for China but even for worldwide, because we recognize this is another area where we need to be, and we need to invest for the future. But it's a little bit too early to talk about what we are going to do in the future. For sure, we are going to invest in that area. No doubt. I think, we will continue to be strong on the rack and tower. We will invest on hyperscale, and we will invest in converged in order to make sure that we have -- we build up a solid foundation for the future growth.",215

So when the acquisition of Motorola and x86 was done a year ago, we were under the impression that there's no major restructuring events going to take place. So what's driving the change now? Because we always know that Motorola's business, a huge part is in [indiscernible]. Could you...",59

Actually, I just talked about that. So definitely -- so Motorola, last year's momentum was very strong. So actually, they're almost doubled their business over the previous year. So for this momentum can continue, so definitely, we don't need to do the restructuring. So we can digest the expense. So with the hypergrowth, we can reduce the E-to-R ratio. But things are -- doesn't look good to the -- what we expected. So as I said, so because Motorola business is facing a huge challenge in Latin America because of the macro economy and the currency issue, well, accounts for 50% of their business, so we can also see the hypergrowth. So actually, the Motorola business, the top line declined in the last quarter. So that's the -- definitely the key driver part of -- to do this restructuring work. So actually, we think we have a lot of room to improve the efficiency with the Motorola business. So if you can look into the details, so actually, our Lenovo phone business almost has the same volume as the Motorola does. But we may spend 1/4 or 1/5 of the Motorola expense. So definitely, that gave us a lot of room to improve the efficiency and to improve the competitiveness in the Motorola side. So -- but these actions will not be just a headcount cut. So actually, we decided to completely realign the Motorola business with the Lenovo business. So that's -- we can save a lot of redundancy and overlap functions of jobs. So with -- so the -- that's why we do a restructuring for the Motorola. So definitely -- so another point I need to point out is actually, in the past, Motorola's product life cycle is to too long. So that by the end of the life cycle of the product, the competitiveness is not that strong. So that generates a lot of image [indiscernible]. So that's why this time, we want to clean this image, particularly in Latin America and in North America. So that will generate some onetime write-offs. So -- but definitely, in the future, we will improve our product development cycle, so that in every moment, so our product will become competitive. So probably -- so for those mentioned [ph] and the low-end product, so you cannot last 1 year. So every 6 months, you must change the configuration, you must change the model part so that the product is still competitive. So those are the area we want to improve. Thank you.",423

Just 2 questions here. On your breakeven targets, which are now, I guess, 2 to 3 quarters from now, can you elaborate a little bit on the share momentum -- the growth momentum that you expect, that you've baked in to get to this breakeven target? Or is this target purely coming from cost savings on a current scale? And my other question had to do with the smartphone inventory. Did I just hear correctly that inventory write-downs coming primarily in Brazil and North America? And I thought there is -- how much of that inventory is going to work down through the September quarter?",119

So let me talk about the growth issue, then Wai Ming will address the inventory issue. So as I said at the beginning, so definitely, cover the expense is not the ultimate purpose. So we still want to build a growth engine for our company. So we still want to be a very strong member [ph] in the worldwide smartphone market. So we will continue our strategy. So actually, after the restructuring -- so Lenovo smartphone will become stronger, will become more competitive. So that will give us opportunity to grow. So actually, on my chart, so you can see -- actually, outside China, our growth is pretty good. It's pretty strong. So with the Lenovo -- so with online Lenovo, so we grew significantly in Middle East, Africa, in Eastern Europe and in Asia Pacific. So we grew 380% in Middle East and Africa. We grew 82% in Asia Pacific. We grew 36% in Eastern Europe. Now I -- particularly in some -- in the largest emerging market, we have gained a very decent share and [indiscernible]. So it's like in India, so we have a 6.4% share. So we are #5. In Russia, we get a double-digit share, and we are #2 in Brazil. So definitely, Brazil is mainly a Motorola product. So we have 20% market share, and we have a very strong #2 in that market. So we definitely will continue this strategy to grow the smartphone business in worldwide, particularly outside China. So we think outside China -- so we have very good chance to become a very strong #3 player. So because only Apple and Samsung are strong in those markets, so no very strong other multinational brands. So Lenovo is more efficient, so we have the global brand. We have the channels, and we have the needed IP. So we are ready to growing worldwide market. So that's the plan. So Wai Ming, you...",323

So you're -- I think of the business realignment plan, apart from the over $600 million restructuring cost, I think those -- also there is I think additional funding for us to clear the inventory in smartphone, I think, in the region of around $300 million. So I think the $300 million additional funding is -- are relating to, I think, some of the inventory that will obviously, I think, built and remain in the channel and also want to clear those so that I think in -- after the business realignment plan, I think we are in the very solid foundation, I think ready for the growth in the second half of the year.",126

I think that we definitely -- I think the business realignment plan obviously is to build a foundation for us to regain the growth. I think looking at quarter 1 and probably, I think, really looking at, I think, the current quarter 2, I think definitely the -- our Mobility business, I think recorded a decline year-to-year. But definitely, I think the trend will reverse, I think, to a small growth in the second half of the year with a much more, I think, efficient operation so that we will drive back to, I think, where we target ourselves, which is 2 or 3 quarters as from now, I think, which is exactly the same when we make the Motorola acquisition is to run the business at the breakeven to 6 to -- 4 to 6 quarters is, as we expected, the same commitment we make to the market.",157

So actually, so although we are facing challenge in China smartphone market, as well for Motorola business. But actually, the Lenovo phone outside China -- so it's very healthy, it's very healthy. [indiscernible] we grow faster in those regions I just mentioned, Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Asia Pacific, but they are profitable. They are profitable. So we think we have the benchmark so how to make this business the best part. So that's why we take the action to do the restructuring, particularly with the Motorola business. So today, the total Lenovo phone business yearly expense is just $400 million. But Motorola, that's $2 billion expense. So basically, it's way too high. So that, to me, was a lot of room to cut the expense. So that's why -- so we think we can save $850 million, so after the restructuring. So that will help to improve the competitiveness significantly in the Motorola business. So with that competitiveness, we definitely can grow even faster in -- with the Motorola brand and the Motorola product. But definitely, in the future, we will complete the -- integrate the Lenovo phone and Motorola together. So that will -- so we will have a much simpler product portfolio.

Here in Beijing, we already had our first snow, so winter is coming. But I believe for Lenovo business, we are actually entering a greater season. So I'm glad to update you on our progress so far and share our confidence for the future.
Last quarter, we faced double challenges: integrating and digesting our 2 major acquisitions; and dealing with a tough market, with slower global economy, currency fluctuations in some key markets and our declining PC and tablet demand. We made the decision last quarter to do the biggest restructuring in Lenovo history across all businesses to reduce costs and expenses and improve efficiency.
And to align the key elements of the acquired businesses to build a simpler, more efficient organization, I'm sure you want to know how we executed the plan and whether we are on track to continue to deliver our commitments, continue to execute our strategy and continue to grow rapidly. Today, at the least, I can answer some of these questions, although not all of them yet.
Our financial results are definitely the first proof. Last quarter, we delivered a solid performance. Our revenue grew 16% year-on-year to USD 12.2 billion. Excluding restructuring, onetime and M&A accounting charges, our run rate PTI was USD 166 million, down close to 50% year-on-year but up 16% from last quarter. It's important to point out that this was achieved when the restructuring was not completed and the cost savings were not realized yet.
Our PC business again reached the record worldwide share with strong margins. We also reached the record share in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, each outperforming the market by around 20 points. Our worldwide consumer share reached around 20%. 
In tablets, while all other top 4 players' market share declined, we outgrew the market by almost 14 points to achieve record market share.
In Enterprise, we reached an important milestone, as the revenue increased year-on-year on a comparable basis for the first time since acquiring IBM System x. The revenue growth of 9% from last quarter indicates the business has stabilized and entered attack mode. Deals with hyperscale clients such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu all indicate major breakthroughs. In China, our Enterprise revenue was up 210% year-on-year. Even more, our Enterprise business had its fourth straight quarter of operational profit as margins continued to improve.
In Mobile, our volume grew 11% year-on-year, and the strategy to shift the growth focus to outside of China continued to pay off. In the first half of this fiscal year, Rest of the World accounted for 70% of our volume compared to only 19% a year ago. In key emerging markets of India, Indonesia and Russia, we outgrew the market by an estimated 50, 12 and 180 points, respectively, and our share grew to 9%, 6% and 21%. In Brazil, we have 22% market share. So now in these largest the emerging markets, we all have greater performance. Although exchange rate fluctuations in some key markets continued to impact our profits, MBG PTI margin improved by almost 6 points over last quarter.
We took a number of strategic actions to solidify our foundation for long-term growth while keeping solid operation of the 3 growth pillars. First, we have finished the integration of System x businesses and completed aligning the organization and the brands with the Motorola Mobility. So now we are one organization, one team, ready to attack.
Second, we executed the restructuring plan announced last quarter and are on track to achieve the restructuring savings. We will deliver more than USD 1.35 billion in annualized savings, including over $650 million in savings for the second half of this year. Most importantly, our cost structure is now among the most competitive of the industry in all our businesses.
Third, in Mobile business, we are on track cleaning up aged inventory, streamlined product portfolio and launched the competitive new products. Our development cycle will now ensure our products will be competitive every season and every quarter.
Fourth, we launched the new products and received a very positive market response. We will continue to lead with innovative products, such as the newest Yoga family: Yoga Tab 3 Pro, Yoga 4 Pro and the Miix 700 convertible. The new Moto X Force, which has the industry's first unbreakable screen, is getting greater reviews as our Moto 360 and the Vibe P1. 
Finally, in our Enterprise business, after finishing the integration of System x, we now have a more complete product portfolio and a lower cost structure. In traditional IT, we are ready to attack our traditional competitors. In a faster-growing hyperscale market, what we have achieved in China market has laid a solid foundation for stronger competitiveness. In the emerging hyperconverged market for technology, the Dell-EMC deal actually created an opportunity for us as it pushed those new technology companies that represent the future to work more closely with Lenovo. The best example is our recent partnership agreement with Nutanix. And you can expect we will soon announce more partnership with other companies. We are also strengthening the relationship with IBM in storage, including in China. Definitely, we are now in our attack mode in Enterprise business.
I wanted to point out that we completed all these actions above while delivering better than previous quarter's results. This is as difficult as changing wheels while the train is running at full speed, but we did it. We executed it well.
Although this is not the time to show you the final results, I do believe that for Lenovo, the worst is over. We are fully charged, ready to resume the momentum in the second half of the year and to grow in the longer term. And we are confident that our company will enter a new era of strong growth. Strategic transformation and integrating acquired businesses are not overnight efforts, so I appreciate the market's patience as we work through them with solid progress.
After last quarter's earnings, some people concluded that our acquisition of Motorola had failed. I guess those people are perhaps disappointed now when they see our performance last quarter and our preparation for the future. 
The Lenovo team has fought extremely tough battles, and we will not only overcome these challenges but also emerge out of them stronger than ever. Completing last quarter's restructuring actions so quickly once again proves our execution capability. 
Let me reaffirm that we will deliver our previous commitments: in PCs, achieve 30% market share with a strong profit; in Enterprise, start from $5 billion annual business and attack aggressively; and in Mobile, turn the business around in 1 to 2 quarters and enter a new era of profitable growth.
Now let me turn it to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1133

I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q2 fiscal year 2016.
Next chart, please. First, I will give you some highlights for the quarter 2 performance. As Yuanqing mentioned, despite a very challenging market environment, we achieved strong top line growth with solid momentum across our businesses in Q2, and our run rate PTI improved quarter-on-quarter after executing our realignment plan announced in last quarter.
Our group revenue increased 16% year-on-year to $12.2 billion. In quarter 2, we booked a total of $923 million of restructuring and onetime charges, which resulted in a reported pre-tax loss of $842 million. Excluding the above charges and noncash M&A accounting charges of $85 million, the group run rate PTI was $166 million, up 16% quarter-to-quarter but down 50% year-on-year. Group loss attributable to equity holders was $714 million. The smaller net loss was due to the net tax credit from the 2 recent acquisitions and restructuring.
Next chart, please. Gross profit increased 8% year-on-year, while gross margin declined to 13%. Gross profit increase was the result of including the 2 acquired businesses for the entire quarter, and the decline in margin is driven by the additional spending to clear smartphone inventory. However, gross profit margin declined quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the competitive environment in EMEA and the AP regions.
Operating expenses increased by 116% year-on-year to around $2.4 billion, mainly attributed to the restructuring and onetime charges. Excluding these charges, operating expenses were $1.6 billion, increased by 44% year-on-year, mainly driven by the 2 acquired businesses.
We recorded other non-operating expenses of $58 million, which mainly included the interest expenses from the notes we issued and included interest expense for the Motorola deal-related promissory notes.
We recorded a tax credit of $125 million for the quarter. Tax credit in the second quarter significantly increased quarter-to-quarter as a result of the tax credit from restructuring and the onetime charges. Loss attributable to equity holders was $714 million. Basic loss per share was USD 0.0643. The Board of Directors, in today's meeting, declared interim dividend of HKD 0.06, representing the same level of interim dividend paid last year.
Next chart, please. In this chart, we also prepare an analysis on our run rate financial performance from an operational perspective for your reference by excluding the impact from restructuring and the onetime charges. These performance figures are provided to enable analysis of the like-for-like performance of the underlying business. As you can see from the chart, the run rate PTI and the margin improved quarter-to-quarter but declined year-to-year. 
Next chart, please. In this chart, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the different financial figures to give you an overview of how these figures are calculated.
Next chart, please. The main driver of the change in our balance sheet is seasonality and the restructuring charges. The non-current asset were about $11.9 billion, and the current assets were about $15.4 billion as of 30th September 2015. We had net current liabilities of around $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which was higher than that in the June end, mainly from the higher payable due to seasonality and restructuring reserve made during the quarter. The non-current liabilities were around $6.2 billion.
Next chart, please. Our cash flow from operations improved significantly to $909 million in quarter 2 against an inflow of $218 million last year and cash outflow of $310 million last quarter. The better cash position against quarter 1 was largely attributed to improvement in working capital by having both new businesses adopting our own working capital discipline.
Net cash reserve was lower than last year as payment for the 2 acquisitions were made in quarter 3 last year. The quarter-on-quarter improvement was due to the better cash generated from operating activities despite we repaid bank loans in quarter 2.  
The cash conversion cycle for quarter 2 was negative 1 day, better than positive 5 days from Q1, thanks to better inventory turnover, but against negative 5 days last year. We'll continue to bring the credit policy of 2 new acquired businesses close to our legacy business in order to achieve a better working capital performance.
Next chart, please. Our strong top line growth in quarter 2 was driven by solid performance across the business groups and geography. 
PC Business Group. Even though the market continued to show a decline, we continued to outperform the markets. We remain #1 player in the worldwide market for 10 consecutive quarters. Our PC revenue decreased by 7% year-on-year to $8.1 billion. Excluding the currency impact, we actually grew 1%. Pre-tax profit increased by 10% quarter-on-quarter but registered a decline of 17% year-on-year. Pre-tax margin declined quarter-on-quarter by 0.1% and 0.6% year-on-year to 5%, driven by the challenges from the EMEA markets.
Enterprise Business Group. Our Enterprise business continued to strengthen with revenue growth and continued operational profitability improvement. Revenue of the Enterprise Business Group increased 5.5x year-on-year to $1.2 billion, helped by the inclusion of System x business. On a pro forma basis, it shows, for the first time, year-on-year increase of 2%. We continue our strong growth in China and obtained major projects win from hyperscale market. We have now completed the integration with System x worldwide. And together with partnership with industry leaders, we are ready to attack the Enterprise business and stay very committed in our target of building a profitable $5 billion Enterprise business. We recorded operational profits before the noncash M&A accounting charges in the combined Enterprise business for the fourth straight quarters, while the margin continued to improve.
Mobility Business Group. Our Mobility business continued to improve, driven by our strong growth in markets outside China, where our operating margin improved quarter-on-quarter. We continue to expand aggressively in markets outside of China. Shipment grew 2x for Lenovo phone, especially in emerging markets like India and in Indonesia, while in Russia, we obtained breakthrough market share gain, hitting more than 20%, thereby improving our revenue growth momentum for quarter-to-quarter. 
Our new products recently launched have been gaining good market response. Moto X Play and Moto 360 saw solid activation rates since their launches. Our recently launched Moto X Force with shatterproof features received very good market traction. For tablet, we remain the #3 player worldwide. Despite the market decline, our shipments outperformed the market and remained flat year-on-year and increased market share. 
For MBG, revenue was up 27% quarter-on-quarter. We recorded an operating loss of $217 million and a negative 8.1% pre-tax margin. We improved our margin by about 6 points quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by the improved business outside of China and better expenses control. We remain confident in turning around the Mobile business in the next 1 or 2 quarters.
Next chart, please. Our solid performance were also seen across geographies. 
China. We maintained a strong #1 position in China PC despite market challenges while holding up margin. Our EBG revenue grew more than 210%, and the group has won a few key hyperscale opportunities from Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. 
However, China smartphone market remains challenging as it continues to shift to open and online channel through realignment initiated to improve our smartphone cost structure, along with simplifying product portfolio and global supply chain. We have broadened our routes to market. And together with new products such as Moto X Force and the shatterproof features and the others, we are attacking the market from broader price bands. Nevertheless, the margin was limited as we cleared aged inventory and market competition. 
Our revenue from China was down 12% year-on-year to $3.3 billion, resulting in a PTI at $136 million, and operating margin was 4.1%, a decline of 1.7 percentage points year-on-year.
Asia Pacific. An attacking strategy in PC worked effectively in Q2 in the region. We continue to grow PC units and achieved a record-high market share in the region and in key countries such as India. Our smartphone business also achieved strong growth in this region, including India and Indonesia, driven by substantial growth of Lenovo brand phones and inorganic help from Motorola. As a result, our revenue in AP grew 27% year-on-year, while the overall AP margin recorded a decline of 1.1%, mainly due to the Japan macro challenges and from Motorola.
For EMEA. Our PC business in the region continues its share gain amidst challenging macro environment and currency fluctuation, thus our margin was also impacted. Our smartphone business achieved strong growth in this region, driven by substantial quarter-on-quarter growth of Lenovo brand phones and stabilizing Motorola business. Our EMEA revenue was up by 6% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter to $3.2 billion. Profit before taxation was $23 million, and operating margin was 0.07% (sic) [ 0.7% ]. The margin decline was mainly due to currency impact in our PC business.
For Americas. Our PC unit shipments in North America remained strong with record-high market share, driven by strong growth in consumer business. However, this strong performance was offset by slow performance in the challenging Brazilian market. This weak macro environment in Brazil has also impacted our smartphone business, particularly the Motorola business, as Brazil account for a substantial part of this business. Nevertheless, Motorola performance has seen improvements quarter-on-quarter, driven by the launch of its newest generation of products. With the business alignment actions taken set to improve our cost structure and our efforts in clearing aged inventory in the market that brought us healthier inventory position, we are confident in driving the growth of our PC and Mobile business in Brazil and, in turn, improve our profitability in the near future.
American revenue was up 70% year-on-year and 12% quarter-on-quarter to about $3.7 billion. Helped by the addition of the System x and Motorola business, we've narrowed the operating loss to $73 million in the region from quarter-to-quarter, thanks to a strong shipment growth from Motorola in North America region.
Next chart, please. As Yuanqing mentioned, we are on track to realize the planned annualized savings of $1.35 billion, and we expect approximately $650 million of such savings to be realized in the second half of the year. 
In quarter 2, we also booked $599 million restructuring cost, which comprised of mainly severing cost and write-off and disposal of assets. And we also booked $324 million onetime charges for clearing smartphone inventory, mainly in China. Together with restructuring cost, we booked a total of $923 million charges in quarter 2. We believe the action will help us to become an even faster, stronger global company to drive revenue and profit growth. It will help us maintain a more efficient cost structure and enable us to attack the market with a new product portfolio across all business groups. 
Our Q2 results fully demonstrated our solid performance in a challenging market environment. And the quarter-on-quarter business stabilization led us with the optimism and confidence that our business realignment actions will begin to show results in the second half of this fiscal year. 
For PC, we believe the market will further consolidate, and we will leverage such trend to further gain market share and drive top line growth. And the lower cost structure will help us compete and hold our current profitability. 
For our Mobility business, the successful completion of combining Motorola and Lenovo and the realignment actions has given us a solid foundation to commence profitable growth of the business. We have recently launched new products such as Moto X Force and Vibe P1, which have been well received by the market and received industry endorsement. 
For EBG, we have completed our System x integration, which has given us an effective cost structure to compete in the market. Together with our recent strategic partnership with industry leaders, we are on an attack mode to drive growth.
Although the market environment remains volatile and challenging in the short term, we are confident to deliver the targets we shared with you before and bring the company back to the profitable growth track. 
Thank you. Now we'll take your questions.",2003

My first question is that -- you made great improvement in the Enterprise and Mobile Business Groups, but profitability for the PC business dipped a little bit. But when we look at the geographic performance, it seems only the Americas group made improvements, but China, AP and EMEA all deteriorated. Could you elaborate the deterioration in those 3 regions? Was that mainly because of the pressure in the PC business? And I remember when you made the comments earlier, there is some competition in EMEA and the APAC, so how do you see the situation now? And how do you address that? That's the first question.",113

So Arthur, thanks for the question. Let me just answer the numbers, how we should read it, and then I'll let Gianfranco give you the comments on the EMEA and APAC. I think the region P&L or the geo P&L is actually a combination of our PC, Enterprise and Mobility business; and hence, you actually see that there's the impact there. I think the overall PC business, obviously, from a PC Group perspective, I mean, from an estimated profit point of view, I think it comes down a little bit. But on the other hand, I think we actually outgrew the market, and we're able to do it in a very efficient way, maintaining approximately similar margin. So I will let Gianfranco to answer, I think, your question on PC competition in EMEA and AP.",143

Now on PC view, but PC, the overall, I think it's 5% against the 5.1% the last quarter. So quarter-on-quarter, it's almost flat. The real difference is probably about the regions, in EMEA, the market was down 23%, so almost 1/4 of the market disappeared in the last quarter. And of course, in that situation, we have been spending more the entire quarter in terms of cleaning inventory and making sure that we ended the quarter with a good level of inventory. On top, there are regions in EMEA that we are still struggling much more than the others. If you take -- it's almost close to 30% decline. And even Middle East and Africa. In AP and on top of it, the deterioration of the currency, that euro continue to slow -- weaken, to depreciate against the -- in U.S. dollar. And it's not finished yet because I think now it's already at close to 1.07 [ph]. And all the expectation is that it can be very, very close to 1:1. China is doing well because China is doing well both in terms of market share and profitability when I look at PC, despite the market is also not great. In Asia Pacific, as always, share did really well, except Japan, where we are stable in market share, but the market, again, it's very similar to India in terms of market decline. On the other part, we have seen such strong growth in India, Southeast Asia, almost everywhere, in terms of share. But Japan, that was -- the past contribution last year was -- the market is extremely weak.",271

So my second question is on the partnership with Nutanix. I think Wai Ming mentioned earlier there could be some further announcement later. But before you get into that, could you elaborate how you benefit from the partnership? And is there any need for more M&A, especially in light of the potential merger between Dell and EMC?",58
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,902050.0,38593476.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,9,"So actually, in the Enterprise segment, so there are 3 parts. Firstly, is the traditional IT part. So actually, data area, and with the combination of the System x and the Lenovo Nexi [ph] ThinkServer business. So, we are definitely more competitive because now we have the technology and the portfolio. And also, so we can leverage the traditional Lenovo efficiency part, so definitely, at this kind of issue, we can compete with our traditional competitors, which are actually in that market. So that's for sure. So we are now in attack mode because our competitors are in -- these are on the splitting mode or on the integrating mode. So we definitely should be on the attack mode in that area. The second area is the hyperscale part. So which are other so-called the IPTV market. So that's really a -- that is in the market, that big players [ph] in the market, so Google, Facebook, [indiscernible]. So in that area, we are strengthening our capability. As you know, over the past couple of quarters, we have won all 3 [indiscernible] companies. So that have -- our China business post up so more than 200% year-on-year. So we definitely should have leveraged the foundation to further expand to the Rest of the World now. In particular, we should look at the opportunity to enter into the U.S. market. So in this area, actually, our key competitors are not actually under there, so those are currently the OEMs -- ODMs and OEMs. So actually, in the third area part, actually, I think that represents the future technology, okay? It's what we call the hyperconvergence technology or hyperconvergence market. So in that area, definitely, Nutanix is a leading technology company. Actually, we think the Dell-EMC deal helped us in that area, so -- because the deal pushes these companies to us because, before, so like Nutanix, 50% of their business is with Dell, but now they definitely feel threatened by this deal. So they're very eager to cooperate with us. And actually, there are more companies. So I think Nutanix executed. So that's why we are confident about there more partnership. We are [indiscernible]. But definitely, in terms of we needed M&A, so partnership and cooperation is a good way as well. So that's how we drive the Enterprise business in the future. And also, by the way, so we are strengthening our relationship with IBM on the storage as well, particularly in China. So state of our partnership with EMC before. So Gianfranco, do you want to add something?",429
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,902050.0,38593477.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,10,"No. I think the only thing that we can add is that when you look at the data center, they are moving from traditional architecture to new architecture. Traditional architecture, it was the traditional server operations working together. Now it's hardware from one side and software managing all the hardware together. It's still small, but also I think, this year, it's going to be something in the range of $800 million, $1 billion worldwide, but it is expected to be something between $4 billion to $5 billion in 5 years from now, so growing very, very fast also because, in terms of cost and in terms of the overall PC, it's totally different than traditional in infrastructure. We are investing in data-ration [ph] because we think that it is going to be the future of the data center infrastructure. And we are working also on other things, of course, because it's software defined anything, it will become big in the next 2, 3 years. And I think that when we look at the agreement with Nutanix, we provide the hardware on one side; they provide the software. And we have the -- a common approach for the go-to-market together.",199

So Wai Ming mentioned in the presentation that the impact to -- the  currency impact to your PC business. Could you give us more details regarding to -- if we exclude the currency impact, what would the revenue growth and the profit, the PTI margin looks like in the quarter?",63
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,902050.0,38593482.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,15,"Yes, I think, first of all, the currency impact is about 8%. I think if we have anticipated constant currency, it will run 8%. So that's the -- really, the impact of currency on us. Now as to the foreign currency on the margin of our business, we have always been having a consistent and prudent hedging policy, I think, which, by and large, is about 3 months rolling forward in other income before tax and short-term fluctuation. And when the currency continuing to depreciate, obviously, we need to do pricing -- I think repricing as far as improve your efficiency in order to maintain your overall profitability.",108

I never saw ASP going up. If it is up, and they're not going up, unfortunately. But -- so ASP is -- but the good thing is only that it -- the deterioration of ASP has been very, very small, which is almost a good figure in terms of healthy business. I think that's in the range of 2%, 3% deterioration only in terms of ASP, which is good. Repricing, of course, we do some repricing because it depends geography by geography, country by country. We have country where we have seen the deterioration of the currency in the range of 15% to 20% in 2, 3 months ago. Of course we do -- you do repricing. And then in PC, very often, you don't really reprice, very often is you change your configuration. And the customer, for the same amount of money, they can buy something that is less powerful with less memory and less [indiscernible]. It is more or less changing the offer to the lineup and the offer to the gut [ph]. We do some repricing -- repricement with the Enterprise, of course, but then it's a different business model.",198

And my last question is regarding to your restructuring savings. I understood that we are looking for a $650 million cost saving for the next 2 quarters. Could you give us some idea about how we should expect -- I mean, if you are able to give us the quarterly split as well as like in terms of the areas of the -- more -- in terms of the more details, where the savings are going to come from for next quarter and for the coming 1 year?",90
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3501.0,902050.0,38593487.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,20,"So Jenny, I think the $650 million will be spread over the second half. I think on a very, very high level, I actually would say that maybe, I think $350 million to $400 million, I think, in Q3 and probably $200 million or thereabouts in the balance, in Q4. Now the most area in terms of cost savings coming out from headcount reduction as far as I think the space reduction. I think take for example, we'll obviously take out a lot of spaces, I think, in our Mobility business, I think, from the Motorola, I think, we'll reduce or we have plans to reduce the number of floors in Merchandise Mart in Chicago. We actually closed up a few sites, I think, in the U.S. So those are really the 2 primary, I think, sources of cost reductions. So I think the best way for you to be able to examine how impactive our, I think, reduction is, is really looking at the year-to-year, I think, expenses. Definitely, on a half year basis, we are very confident that we can deliver and, hopefully, be able to exceed target. But at the moment, our estimate is, I think, at least $650 million, I think, we'll be able to achieve in the second half of the year.",217

So actually, so basic restructuring actions will happen at Lenovo to improve our overall competitiveness in all 3 businesses. We believe we will have the best-in-class cost structure. So even -- so for PC, even with the current weak market situation, so we think we still can deliver a better than last year expense-to-revenue ratio, so with this restructuring action. So definitely, it's a success [ph] in Mobile and Enterprise business as well.",93

Thanks for the question. I think that the -- I think to be absolutely precise, we didn't actually sell the CCE business back to the owners. We only sell the manufacturing facility in Manaus, I think, back to the owners because, obviously, they have more sort of knowledge locally. They're going to manage, I think, the businesses. So it's only the factory that we actually sell back to them. I think we continue to sell -- we obviously, I think, also, I think, rationalize our Brazilian operation by really focusing on one brand. But we continue to sell, I think, PC to their distributors. So the whole business, I think we are not selling back the entire business to them. We are just selling back the manufacturing facility to them. And the financial impact is already included in the restructuring because that is part of our overall restructuring or streamlining our overall Brazilian operation.",159

I think the bottom line is, again, we don't, I think, break down the, I think, North -- the American group. I think as you can see from the chart, we only disclose AG. And one of the sort of big improvement, I think, quarter-to-quarter, obviously, is our improvement in the Brazilian operation. Now on a very high level, I think we still target to hit and lead a cash flow break-even operation, I think, for Brazil in Q3. I think we are definitely aiming to achieve that, but bearing in mind that the Brazilian market is very, very volatile. I think it's always going to have a lot of challenges, but this is, again, still our overall objective, I think, to hit that operational objective.",127

And this is the factory that we sell back to CCE. And then we have another factory where we do PC assembly, and this will continue to run as before under Lenovo.

Gianfranco, very clear. If I can switch questions and just follow up on the Enterprise Business Group with respect to your wins in Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, is it possible for you to share if these wins are specific to one data center? Or are these data centers only within China? Does it potentially include data centers outside of China? And if possible, can you also share with us the vendors that you see yourself displacing?",78

So our question was investor interest as to -- I want to understand the pricing environment on the Enterprise segment because you are migrating to a hyperscale in cloud and also going to face the China declines, like VAT. Do you feel that pricing environment is getting -- facing a stronger pricing pressure? This is question one. And question two is do you sense the demand for the server has slowed down because the data center -- there is some concern that data center is overcapacity. This is 2 questions from investors.",110

As Yuanqing said before, most of competition is not coming from traditional competitors. HP and Dell, that is coming from Taiwanese ODM. I think what we did very clearly is that, we set up our cost structure in order to be competitive with the -- with this level of competition, so we are able to do [ph] this deal of making some money. Of course, the profitability is different than when you run hyperconverged or traditional IT. And -- but we are competitive, and we can play, and we can win. Talking about -- frankly speaking, we don't see any signal that the center demand is going down. Probably, we'll continue to go up for 2 reason. One is because with the increase of mobile or smartphone, if you need more -- you need to manage more data, and so you need more data center. The other thing is we also expected to see some growth in Europe based on the European Union definition last month when they said that data of European people need to be stored in Europe and cannot be stored outside Europe. So we will see the growth of demand in Europe because Europe was not a place where [indiscernible] data center. But now, particularly with -- they will start to build data center in Europe to store the data of the European people in Europe. Same thing we are seeing in Russia, data of people in Russia needs to be stored in Russia. And even if it is -- and doesn't matter if from the East or from the West, it doesn't matter who is the owner of the data. So we really don't see any signal that the data center demand or capacity  -- there is overcapacity today.",305

The market remains challenging, and we definitely feel that -- as Yuanqing just said, I think taking off on an annualized basis, this is really $1.35 billion. And hopefully that we can overachieve that cost-saving target. I think, with that, we are really -- based on the -- our current assessment of the markets, I think we definitely feel that we are -- probably have the best-in-class and [indiscernible] for us to be able to grow the business profitably and to attack the business, I think, in a very aggressive way.",106

But can you just give a little bit more color, more pictures about the smartphone strategy, how to improve the margins quickly? Things are currently -- even some China vendors, they will be more aggressive to leverage their ecosystem over equipment, telecom equipment products to support the smartphone aggressively. So how Lenovo win the -- I can say, the games going forward?",76

So this is my favorite question. So actually, so I think our smartphone strategy has been very simple and clear. So actually, probably a couple of quarters ago, so we decided to shift our smartphone from China to rest of the emerging markets. So this will be our first strategy -- our first priority. So we will grow our business in the rest of emerging market. So you -- actually, so you can see the results in the last quarter. So we grew our India smartphone by 7 -- more than 70%; so Russia, more than 165%; so Middle East, Africa, more than 200%; so Asia Pacific emerging markets, 36%; Eastern Europe, 115%. So combining with our 22% market share in Brazil also, obviously we are almost the performance -- by the way, all the emerging -- rest of emerging markets part, so that's definitely still our personal priority and we will pursue in the future, grow the emerging markets. Then we want to -- the second point is we want to break through in mature markets, including U.S., next year with our latest products and so I would say more exciting products. So that's our next step. But meanwhile also, the third point is we work hard on our China business. We will not focus on that. That doesn't mean we will give up the business. We will still turn around with the business. But how to turn around as a business? We would not focus on the -- [indiscernible] competitiveness, online market -- online channel or online market. We will focus on the traditional market, which are our operators' market and the retail open market. That's Lenovo's traditional strength area. So -- and also, I wish you could know, although now in China, there are many so-called Internet online companies, so like Xiaomi, LeTV, Meizu and then Qihoo. But actually, online market only accounts for 20% of the total smartphone volume. 70%, 80% are still in the traditional channels, retail and the carrier market. So definitely, so we will fully leverage our strength in those areas to recover, to turn around our China business. So that will be our very clear strategy, so grow in emerging markets, breakthrough in mature markets and turn around the China.",380
