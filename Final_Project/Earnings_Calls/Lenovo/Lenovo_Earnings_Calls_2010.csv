410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2010",2010-11-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4024.0,141802.0,9149213.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,0,"Hello, everyone. I'm Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo. Thank you for joining us. I will start with an update on our key business and the strategic items. Next, our CFO, Wong Wai Ming, will share the financial highlights. And then, our Chairman Liu will finish with some remarks. Later, our COO, Rory Read will join us to tackle operations.
Next slide. Last quarter, we continued to achieve good results across the world with all of our geos, outgrowing the market. For the fourth straight quarter, Lenovo is the fastest growing major PC company. We grew at 33% year-to-year, more than 3x  as the market rate. We had a strong growth, led to another historic high in Lenovo's worldwide market share of 10.4%, of 1.8 points year-to-year. 
Our profitability also improved significantly with our PTI of USD $102 million, an improvement of USD $37 million year-to-year. This is the first time we exceeded USD $100 million since the economic downturn, improvements coming at all geos. And particularly, I want to highlight our mature markets started contributing to our profitability. 
While strong growth in all geos was the primary factor in improving our profitability, the refinement of our lean cost structure also made key contribution. Our E/R ratio reached yet another record level since the acquisition at 8.4%, a total of 1.1 points year-to-year. In terms of volume, revenue, profitability and E/R, we've achieved outstanding performance last quarter.
Next slide. These results demonstrated that we have the right strategy and a strong execution. Our strategy provides focus, protect our leadership in China and the mature relationship to drive profitability and attack emerging markets and the global transactional sales to speed up growth. 
Last quarter, all of our geos' performance assured the effectiveness of our dual engines. Our China business is our profit engine as is our synch and the relationship of business. Meanwhile, our Idea and the transactional business, our emerging markets, our growth engine. Depending on the focus of the particular market, we use these 2 engines to complement each other and to drive balanced growth.
Our results last quarter showed that our execution is effective. What makes these results different from the past years is that all of our geos, not just in China, gained share and improved profitability. Just as importantly, we outgrew the market in all product types and customer segments. This is why although China's growth in Q2 was moderate compared to the first half of the year, overall, we still significantly outgrew the market.
Next slide. Next is about our China business, which had been very strong. By segmenting China into mature and emerging areas and applying customer tactics, we continued to expand our business in China. We grew volume by 21%, easily outpacing the market rate of 12%. This led us to grow our market-leading share up to almost 29%, a gain of 2.3 points year-to-year. Lenovo continues to sustain a wide gap with the competition. At the same time, our segment operating profit grow by USD $56 million year-to-year.
Next slide. Invest on the emerging market. Growth is our focus. Our tax strategy continues to deliver revenue growth in this regions. By fully leverage our Idea products and transactional model, we grew shipments by 65% year-to-year, more than 3x the market rate of 18%. We gained 1.8 points of the market share year-to-year to 6.4%. Particularly, we achieved the year-to-year growth in key emerging markets around the world. 
Russia reached our historical high of 8.3%, up 3.6 points. India also achieved a new record of 9.2%, up 1.9 points, and Brazil and other Latin American countries gained 1.6 points. While maintaining such a strong growth, we also improved segment operating profit by USD $3 million year-to-year.
Next slide. For mature markets, the priority is in returning to profitability and becoming a profit generator. In the last quarter, we are pleased to see that profitability improved in the mature market significantly, with a segment operating profit of $20 million, an improvement of $35 million year-to-year. In particular, North America's strong improvement in profitability was a key contributor to mature markets in terms of profitability. Even more exciting was mature markets' fast growth. 
Strong performance in both the relationship and the transactional business reached these achievements by almost 40% year-to-year, 10x faster than the market rate. This led to our highest-ever market share in mature markets since the acquisition. This is a solid momentum that we have not seen in the past 5 years since the acquisition.
We gained substantial share in several key mature markets. Germany become the first of major mature market country to achieve double-digit market share. We built the foundation for transactional sales there a few years ago, and it is now paying off with a strong growth. In Japan, Lenovo was the fastest local PC company. For the fifth straight quarter our market share reached 7%, a gain of 2 points year-to-year. North America's performance also was outstanding, with the volume increasing by 41%.
Next slide. Beyond our computing business, our new Mobile Internet business continues to grow. Since its May launch, LePhone has established a strong position in China at the high-end Internet market. The earlier screen supply problem impacted sales but this issue was relieved in later September after we introduced our latest model. 
LePhone is on track to grow according to plan. We are now increasing our efforts to grow even faster. We will invest more in marketing to drive higher volume in the next few quarters. In addition, we will increase our efforts to drive more applications and content. As an example, 2 days from now, we will hold our application developer conference in Beijing. We are committed to the mobile Internet, and we expect continued growth in this space.
Next slide. The balanced growth that we are having comes from strong execution of our strategy and our continuity investment in our competitiveness. That's why we will continue to invest to improve our innovation capability. We also will continue to optimize our business model and invest to further improve efficiency. 
One example is our recent investment in Chengdu. On this site, we housed manufacturing, research and the development and the sales operation, thereby expanding our innovation and improving our efficiency. In addition, we will invest in branding to increase our brand recognition around the world. We believe this investment will improve our long-term competitiveness and build a stronger foundation for future growth.
Next slide. Looking forward, we see both challenges and opportunities in the global economy and the industry. In terms of challenges, the global economy is still recovering, and compared to the revenue gains of the first half, the worldwide PC market is growing slower. Even the China market growth has moderated. 
However, there are also many opportunities. Commercial replacement demand is growing strong in mature markets. Emerging markets continues their rapid growth. Furthermore, we believe in the mobile Internet space, where we feel strong growth for years to come.
Our balanced growth means we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. We will invest in key priorities to drive future growth. We are confident that we will maintain our solid momentum and deliver long-lasting return to our shareholders. 
Thank you. And now, I will turn the meeting over to Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1219
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2010",2010-11-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4024.0,141802.0,9149214.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance for the fiscal second quarter. 
Next chart, please. Yuanqing just shared with you that we have another strong quarter, with balanced growth across geographies, customer and product segments brought by the solid execution of our strategy. Group sales in quarter 2 were at $5.76 billion, up about 41% year-to-year. PC Sales were up 36% year-to-year to $5.54 billion. Sales from the Mobile business in quarter 2 were at $217 million, up 58% year-to-year. If we compare this to its own performance last year prior to acquisition, this is also the second quarter we recorded a full quarter contribution for our Mobile business. 
Gross profit was at $593 million, up 37% year-to-year. Gross margin was 10.3% in quarter 2 compared to 10.6% in quarter 2 last fiscal year, just slightly up from 10.2% last quarter. The drop in gross margin year-to-year was primarily due to change in our business mix. The quarter-to-quarter improvement is a result of falling key component prices, as well as our strategy in growth ahead of the market to gain share. 
Operating expenses increased 24% year-to-year to $485 million. This figure has included our mobile operation expense that we did not have in the last year results. Apart from this, increase in expense was largely from increased promotional and advertising activities and employee benefit cost.  As increase in expenses was smaller than our sales growth, the operating expense to revenue ratio continued to trend down to 8.4% in quarter 2, which is another historic low level for us. 
This scaling effect helped mitigate decline in the gross margin year-to-year. Operating profit was up more than 1.5x year-to-year, but the operating margin improved to 1.9%. We have a net financial cost of $5 million, comprising the interest rate differential between deposit and interest rate and factoring cost. Pretax income was $103 million, up roughly 2.4x year-to-year, if excluding restructuring cost. 
The tax income margin improved to 1.8%. Please note that we had in last year a one-off share disposal gain of $38 million recorded under other income category. The group taxation was $25 million, and the effective tax rate was around 25%. We expect that effective rate to stay within 25% to 30% in the short term before our operating margins show a significant improvement. Accordingly, we reported a net profit of $77 million for the quarter, up 45% year-to-year. Basic EPS improved to USD $0.81 from USD $0.59 last year. The Board of Directors have today declared an interim dividend of HKD $0.26 per share. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet in the next chart. Our balance sheet in quarter 2 remains strong. The noncurrent asset we're around $2.7 billion, as of the end of September 2010, which was similar to our last fiscal year-end at 31st March, 2010. Current assets were around $8.3 billion against $6.2 billion in last year-end due to an increase in receivable, which was in line with the increase in our sales. 
Current liabilities were at $8.4 billion against $6.4 billion at the last year-end. The increase was largely due to increase of our payables resulting from an increase in sales and our outsourcing to ODMs. As a result, our net current liability was at $82 million in quarter 2 compared to $183 million at the end of March. 
Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. Net cash reserves continue to improve to $2.3 billion against $1.8 billion last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue and good cash conversion cycle performance. Our working capital management performance remains strong. Days of inventory increased 5 days year-to-year to 19 days. Day receivable increased 7 days to 28 days year-to-year. 
The increase is largely due to our continuing expansion into the emerging market, particularly consumer products through our transaction model, which tends to have longer credit period and high level of inventory. We have also increased ocean shipment to reduce cost, which also contributed to a higher inventory level. Meanwhile, we have included the mobile operation, which was not in last year's results. Typically, it has longer receivable level compared to PC. Days payable also increased 8 days to 73 days year-to-year, largely due to increase in our outsourcing to ODMs. Next, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 2 was negative 26 days against a negative 30 days last year or a negative 23 days last quarter.
Next chart, please. This chart summarizes the performance by geography. We have excluded restructuring charges and one-off items from the operating profit and margin so that you can better assess our operating results. China accounts for approximately 46% of gross sales. 
Sales in China were up 32% year-to-year to $2.6 billion or 5% quarter to quarter. PC sales were $2.4 billion up 21% year-to-year. We have recorded $217 million sales from our Mobile business, which was not in the last year results. Lenovo feature phone business continue to do well, and it has a market share of 4.7% at the end of September being  #1 local brand in the China market. Operating profit was up 39% year-to-year to $151 million and operating margin was up 5.7% from 4.8% year-to-year, and up from 5.5% quarter to quarter. Operating margin for PC business were 6.1%, up from 4.8% last year and 5.9% last quarter. 
As Yuanqing shared with you, our LePhone sales in quarter 2 was affected by the display screen shortage, but the issue is now resolved. We would therefore invest to accelerate the sales growth, and our expenses in China will likely to increase in quarter 3. Emerging markets, excluding China, accounted for approximately 18% of the gross sales.  Lenovo continues to show a strong unit shipment growth and share gains across the board in these regions. 
Sales were up 77% year-to-year or up 31% quarter to quarter. Financial performance continue to improve, and operating loss reduced by $3 million year-to-year and $8 million quarter-to-quarter. We will continue to invest in this region to drive shipment growth and market share to close to 10% in key markets, to establish optimal market position and sustainable profit in the future.
Mature markets accounted for approximately 36% of gross sales. We also recorded strong growth and share gain in all major markets in the region. Sales were up 38% year-to-year or up 13% quarter-to-quarter. All markets in the region recorded operating profit except in Western Europe. But it has reduced its operating loss quarter-to-quarter. With the continuing improvement of our business in mature market, we are pleased to report that the mature market returned to profit in quarter 2, the first time after the financial crisis at the end of 2008. The region recorded $20 million operating profit for the quarter, with an operating margin of 1%. 
Next chart, please. This chart summarizes the performance by product segments. Lenovo continues to translate strong growth momentum through our winning product portfolio. Unit shipments grew 38%, and sales were up 40% year-to-year and accounted for around 60% of our sales. Our worldwide market share increased 1.9 points year-to-year to 10.5%. We remain the fourth largest notebook player in the world. At the quarter close, Lenovo announced it has sold its 60 million ThinkPad, a milestone achievement for an iconic product. 
Desktop also performed well in quarter 2. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop were up 26% and 27% year-to-year, respectively, and has accounted for approximately 33% of our sales. Our market share in worldwide desktop market increased by 1.8 points to 10.2%, and remains third largest desktop player in the world. Our all-in-one product and our SMB targeted desktop continue to see quick growth momentum. 
Finally, mobile Products also showed strong growth during the quarter. If you compare to its performance last year, unit shipments were up 41% and sales up 38% year-to-year. Lenovo mobile feature phone business continue to show strong shipment growth at 36% year-to-year and remain the third-largest mobile player in China. 
Further to our cooperation with China Unicom in May this year, we have teamed up recently with China Telecom to further broaden our distribution coverage in China. This will help strengthen our platform  sales in the next few quarters. 
Next chart, please. I'll only give you an update of our share repurchase, which began in June this year. Lenovo repurchased 55 million shares in quarter 2 for a consideration of approximately $31 million. We have repurchased a total of 89 million in the past 2 quarters for a consideration of approximately $50 million. The average price paid for share is around HKD $4.35. We view share repurchase as one way to enhance shareholders' return. This also demonstrates management's confidence in the company's prospects. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you more color on the market outlook. We remain optimistic with the worldwide PC market outlook in spite of macro challenges. China market will continue to show moderate growth in quarter 3, and it is likely to continue to grow faster than the worldwide PC market. The corporate replacement demand, which has already shown strong growth momentum in the past quarter, will continue to pick up especially in mature markets and in global accounts. 
Growth momentum in the emerging markets will likely continue as we execute our share growth strategy. As the pricing of key components, such as memory chips, has come down from recent peak levels, we expect the gross margin to show gradual improvement, as we'll continue to execute our attack strategy. To drive growth in consumer and in emerging markets, we believe the scaling impact from the high volume growth will help improve our operating margin. 
In addition, we will continue to invest in R&D, branding and global supply chain, such as our new operation center in Chengdu. This will bring us sustainable future growth, although our total expense will increase in the short term. However, we will continue to manage our expenses-to-revenue ratio well and enjoy the scaling benefits. 
With a healthy balance sheet, we'll continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders' value and look for M&A opportunities within the PC industry to accelerate our growth. We are confident that with our well-defined strategy and action plan in place, Lenovo will continue to improve its performance and profitability this year. 
Now, let me turn to Chairman Liu.",1733

No matter if it is the growth of shipment volume, new market share earned, control on cost or stabilization of average unit price, the substantial increase of pretax income, the report card is encouraging and is satisfying in every way. 
The highlight is the balanced development of our business in line with the Protect & Attack strategy developed by the management. Our China, mature markets and emerging markets have been growing fast, equally. I remember that during the worldwide financial crisis, Lenovo had big financial losses. One explanation provided to the board was that in that point, markets outside of China outgrew China market by 1 percentage point, and a high proportion of our business was in China. Therefore, we had big losses. 
For this quarter, China saw more moderate growth, only outgrowing markets outside of it by 2 percentage points. But this time, the results for Lenovo was totally different. The reason is simple. The management got an accurate understanding of opportunity [ph] environments, developed the Protect & Attack strategy with the right approach, balancing different deals and business lines and finally, executed the strategy with determination, which led to satisfying outcome. 
There are 3 facts which the board feels very satisfied with but are invisible in this report card. First, the management has decided to increase the investment in R&D and brand building to get prepared for future transformations in the industry. The board thought this decision was right and visionary and has offered full support for the budget. 
I believe the right decision by the board will bear fruit in the future. This year, when I gave a presentation to some investors about Lenovo's history, I made it clear on behalf of the board that we would now pursue hyper growth of profits and sharp rise of stock prices in the short term. In fact, we would move forward with firm and steady steps. We have to take a long-term view and understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint.  The management is implementing the board's decision in a decisive and innovative way, with concrete actions. We are satisfied about this. 
Secondly, we are satisfied with the way the top leadership team, LEC, led by CEO Yang Yuanqing has been working and operating. They are working in the correct and efficient way with good rapport. This leadership body has been in existence for 1 year and 9 months, operating and functioning very successfully. The work mode of the leadership team is a key for Lenovo's success. 
Thirdly, Lenovo's culture of meeting commitments, taking ownership and putting people first is being embraced and fully adopted by the whole staff. In the beginning of this year, I attended the key cusps of our major geographies. My feeling was that our employees started to have confidence in this company. Recently, I visited Europe again and attended 4 roundtable sessions with the employees there. I think we can say our employees all around the world have started to love this company. 
Some Chinese journalists who traveled together with me were surprised by one observation. There was no Chinese on our West Europe leadership team but employees there were talking about the same things, such as the company's strategy and culture in the same way as their counterparts in China. It shows that Lenovo as a global company has embarked on the right track. 
Finally, I want to say a company's performance sometimes can fluctuate due to impacts from external environments. Despite that, this company has a solid leadership team who treat themselves as owners of the company. If they have the right approach of developing strategies, complemented by the staff who love the company, plus strong corporate culture, this company will be sustainable and enduring. 
Lenovo is marching towards that direction. Thank you.",648

What we're seeing with LePhone and the whole mobile Internet space is really an entry into what's going to be an important segment. Where we saw the netbook phenomenon a couple of years ago, that's already begun to fade. But this mobile Internet space is going to expand. Our netbook -- no, I mean our pad solution around LePad will be introduced first here in China in the next -- early in the next quarter. And what's exciting about that, I think, is that we're building off of our number one share position in China, where we have a power brand. This allows us to enter into the market with the support and strength of our channel and around our business partners who are tailoring specific solutions around the mobile Internet for both LePhone and for LePad. I think the pad technology that will be introduced will first come in China at the beginning of next year and then, shortly after, into the second quarter around the rest of the world. But our focus here is really to take advantage of the Android marketing -- operating system and leverage what we believe is crucial: an excellent customer experience. If we introduced LePad or LePhone earlier, we believe that we have an experience that wasn't robust enough for our customers' expectation. We think at the timing that we put in place, we can deliver an excellent customer experience, combined with our channel reach and our brand positioning here in China that will leverage the base that we've created around LePhone to give that customer experience that we know that will match the expectation of those customers. That's around the time frame that we'll introduce it.",301

By leveraging our significant brand position here in China and the ecosystem that we have tailored specifically to the mobile Internet, that'll give us the basis in which to build that foundation and then expand across the planet. It's, again, build that scale and then expand across there. We think we're just at the beginning of this technology, and over the next 2 or 3 years, this space will continue to grow. But here in the initial phases, it's most important that we match the customer experience with a tailored solution that delivers to their expectation. That's what we're doing by matching up to the Android operating system delivery in this time frame.",150

I got 2 questions for you. The first question is about your China strategy. It seems to me even though you said it protect but it seems to me, it's more like an attack because China is even bigger than the emerging markets. So you just mentioned you're going to invest in Chengdu, Sichuan but I believe Lenovo already has the leading edge in the Tier 4 to Tier 6. So could you elaborate more in terms of the need to invest more in the inland region? What do you mean that you wanted to do more there, especially given that you're already leading among the competitors? That's the first question.",116

Very likely you're saying. So actually we think that the best defense is attack, so absolutely. So when we defined the protect, we mean we want to protect the leadership position and our profit pool. So I think we executed that strategy very well. So actually, we split our China figures by mature cases and the emerging cases. For those mature cases, we want to protect our market share. Actually, for those emergency cases, like Tier 4 to Tier 6 business, actually, we are developing the market. We are nurturing the market so that we could become the pioneer to develop the market, so to have the high market share than our competition. So this is exactly our strategy in China. That's why we not only can protect our leadership position, protect our profitability, but also we can further improve -- further gain market share and improve the profitability. In terms of the Western regions strategies, certainly. So we're not expecting that we need to develop the market. From the other side, we should fully leverage the Lenovo costs to give us more competitive position. So that's why we announced that we will build a new factory in Chengdu. So that would not just be a manufacturing facility. We also want to build our R&D center there to fully leverage the tenants in that area, to build a stronger competitive position.",232

These results are really all about balance. And the name of the game here is growth. By adding the 2.3 points of market share in China, building on our number one position, you can see we're rapidly expanding in all the segments, in all regions across the planet. By introducing the new plant capability in Chengdu, it gives us a competitive advantage. It opens up the West region with more effective and better cost distribution, and we need to add capacity because it's our plan to continue, and our objective to continue to grow faster than the market. This quarter, we delivered 3x the market rate growth that over 30% on a market of 10. It clearly shows Protect & Attack strategy is working. And-by adding that capacity in Chengdu, we can reach better supply chain solutions that allows us to react to customer needs more effectively and giving us better cost position and giving us an enduring competitive advantage. That's what we're after there, and that's what we're delivering.",178

But look at the growth rate. We're seeing almost 40% growth rate across the mature market, almost 10x faster than the marketplace. And what's great about those result is we see it consistently across the consumer, the small and medium business, as well as the commercial segment. This is giving us the foundation in order to expand. And we've set a new level of market share in the mature market. We have seen market share gains in virtually all our regions across mature. And the profit is driven by our focus to gradually improve our profit quarter on quarter, on quarter. How are we driving that? We've been focused on our mix management. We've seen strong performance out of our Think group. Our Think products are being leveraged in a corporate refresh that we continue to see, move forward and actually accelerate. Our acceptance and our commercial notebook share has continued to gain and acquire new customers. And we also see a favorable component environment that allows us to deliver very good value on our highly innovative, high-quality product that the mature market creates. I think our focus is to continue to grow significantly faster in this marketplace across all regions. And it leveraged this corporate refresh to allow us to use that momentum there to make inroads in the consumer and the SMB segments as well. Our results are focused on balance, and these results today are balanced, demonstrating that Protect & Attack truly working.",273

Because what we have heard so far from the different industry players is that in U.S., the market I think would be relatively weaker. But western Europe seems to be doing okay. But from Lenovo, we have seen a different kind of results, it seem that in Western Europe we're seeing a loss, but then U.S. is -- I mean, not just the U.S. but North America is the biggest contributor to the overall earnings improvement. So what would you say why is the results so different in terms of the different geography within the mature markets?",104

What I think they are is very valid. Every one of those regions saw quarter-to-quarter improvement in their profitability. And what we saw is very strong growth rate. That growth rate across these segments has given us the base to move forward and build on it. The fact that we're seeing almost 40% growth rate on a market of 4% says, ""I think we're meeting the customer needs in an effective way by delivering that high-quality innovative product at a great value.""  And I think when you listen to the -- when the customers speaks, you need to listen to them. And that's what we're trying to do. Also, I highlight, we focus very significantly on building a deep relationship with our channel partners across mature. And it's really an important factor in these results. Our partners, in fact, want us to win. They're seeing a different and exciting Lenovo that's significantly gaining share. And that's the basis for that partnership to expand.",172

Would you be able to comment on their competition and on the competitor? And are you sensing further threat since it seems like the momentum seems to be quite strong? That's my first question.

Because in your quarter 1 numbers -- I mean the chart came from IDC. It reflects that you had 28.7% as of quarter 1, and you have now 28.8%. While Dell had 8.2% then and is now 9.1%.

The next competitor is under double-digit and single-digit levels. What we've done is year-to-year increased our market share by 2.3 points, which is the best of each region. Think about it, the key though in terms of that focus is around breaking up the China geography into a mature section and an emerging section. In the larger cities, a mature strategy of protecting and growing that segment and then across this year 3, 4, 5, 6 levels to these leveraging our very strong distribution and channel base to continue to attack and gain market share there. I think, we're seeing good performance. What we see year after year and quarter after quarter, it changes in who's #2. The #2 usually bounces around from several players. Our focus is to continue to deliver high-quality, highly-innovative products at a great value and do it in a distribution model with these partner channel relationship that allows us to react and deliver more effectively, faster time-to-market than our competition. And by adding 2 points, 3 points year-over-year, I think that says that Protect & Attack strategy is clearly working. Now on your second question, you wanted to talk about E/R. Our E/R trends have been trending down significantly over the past 6-plus quarters. And that reflects our very strong focus on growth and our scale that we've improved. We have a maniacal and detailed focus to manage our expense. We want to manage that expense to allow us to deliver these highly innovative quality of products at a great value. Right now, though, is the time for us to continue to manage that expense but also look at 3 key areas for investment to drive future growth and to prepare and allow our growth to be enduring. You'll see us make investments in terms of our product set, both in the traditional PC segment, as well as the mobile Internet, same time make additional investments in our branding efforts here across China, but in 6 or 7 key countries across the planet. We'll also make investment into our business model to ensure that our business continues to scale with this rapid growth. Considering our volume growth rate is nearly twice that of what it was 2 years ago. That's our focus in E/R, to gradually improve it, slowly quarter-on-quarter. While we've had some very significant declines over the past 6 quarters, we ought to manage it here and gradually improve it by enabling us to make those investment that allow us to drive growth, not only in the next quarter, but the next year and the year after that.",457

The worldwide PC growth rates have been moderating from some very rapid growth rates several quarters ago, now in the low double-digit level. But we expect that's potentially continuing next year based on IDC's forecast. But our focus is to drive balanced business results with share gains in all our key segments. Our objective is to continue to grow faster than the market. So whether the market grows at a high single-digit or low double-digit or even mid-double-digit, our focus is to grow faster than the marketplace. You can look at IDC to get a sense for where that's going, but we're trying to leverage our Protect & Attack strategy to deliver balanced results across each segment, consumer, small and medium business, as well as commercial, to allow us to react more quickly to customer demand to drive faster growth in the market.

The first one is regarding your China operation, especially in Chengdu, basically, for the operation center as well as the manufacturing base. But we also noticed that most of your competitors, including Dell, HP, Acer, even ASUSTek, they either chose Chengdu or Chongqing to follow up exactly the same thing. So in other words, almost everyone deeply located in the similar model. So going forward, when everyone follow the similar strategy, how Lenovo could do further, in terms of differentiation? I think that will be my first question. And the second question is regarding the ASP trend. I know this past quarter, the ASP is quite sustained. It's quite good, actually improved slightly given that the revenue growth is slightly better than the unit growth. But at the same time, we notice that the key component price actually dropped during the same time. So in other words, basically, you did not really have some cost savings to consumers or users. I'm just wondering how this ASP stabilization will be sustainable, and what will be the trend for the ASP for the next 1 or 2 quarters.",191

So I think Lenovo -- so we will build ourselves a manufacturing facility in Chengdu. So we still manufacture most of our desktops by ourselves. So our competitors, most of them are using the OEMs or ODMs to manufacture. That's not themselves to build the facility in western part of China. So that's the first part. The second part is we can get more benefits than our competitor because we have high market share in western region of China.

What's pleasant about our focus there is based on our Protect & Attack strategy, we've really focused on managing this ASP trend. And if you look back over the past 4 or 5 quarters, I think we've done a very nice job of maintaining a strong ASP performance. How do we do that, and what's been our focus? Well, one we've been seeing a strong mix up in terms of our Think portion of the business, driven by the corporate refresh cycle that we see continuing around Windows 7. You know that there's been pent-up commercial demand that was driven by the economic downturn. And we see this corporate refresh now into its initial phase, but will continue for the next 24 to 30-plus months. We're seeing a worldwide growth rate in a relationship segment of over 29% versus the market of approximately 14 points. This means we're acquiring new customers and they're reacting to our strong product portfolio around the ThinkPad and things that our product does. At the same time, we're seeing good uptake in our options and services components around warranty, close-to-the-box service activity, as well as key options like batteries, docking stations, et cetera. We're also doing a good job of reacting to market demand changes or market price fluctuations in the transaction space. And we're balancing our portfolio across entry, mainstream and high-end product in the commercial and SMB space. As you know, we've been on that focus to build on that transaction base for many quarters now. And as we've increased our Idea volumes now outside of China to approaching 10 million units, that allows us to have a very good mix not only Think to Idea but in Idea mixing across our entry-level products in the S Series and the G Series up into our mainstream and premium products leveraging U product and Y product and this new Z product. This balance portfolio is helping to lift our ASP, at the same time we're a lift in our corporate buying, so a balanced performance. Of course, there's always downward pressure. But our focus is to outpace and outgrow the market by balancing this Protect & Attack strategy. We are very focused to outperform the market on our ASP trend in the coming quarters.",392

I'll take the first one around tablet and the commercial segment. We've had a traditionally strong portfolio around tablet, around the X200 Tablet series for several years now. We are, in the industry level, a leading commercial segment in traditional tablet space. Commercial buyers are interested in the tablet or slate format around the touch scenario, but that's at the very early stages. We're seeing a more traditional Windows level tablet, which we already deliver around the X200 and commercial. We're monitoring and listening to our customers' demands and interests around the tablet space. But we are only seeing some initial test models in that area. They want the manageability. They want the security, and they want to get consistent data and application activity across it. Of course, we'll see tablet in the touch format expand over the next several years. But this is very early in the cycle. We believe that it's key to enter into that tablet space, as I mentioned earlier, early next year in China, and then in the second quarter across the rest of the world. Traditional tablet space using the Windows environment used in our ThinkPad X200 series has been paying dividends for several quarters and will continue to move in that direction. For the second question, I'll pass it to Wai Ming, our CFO",225

I'm Wong Wai Ming, CFO of Lenovo. Thank you for joining us today. Today I'm joined by Mr. Liu Chuanzi, Chairman of Lenovo; and Mr. Yang Yuanquing, CEO of Lenovo. I will first take you through the Lenovo financial highlight for the fiscal first quarter, as well as the outlook for the year. Then, our CEO, Mr. Yang Yuanqing will give you an update on key business and strategic items that we have been focusing on this year. Our Chairman, Mr. Liu, will conclude with some remarks. After that, together with our COO, Mr. Rory Read, we'll take your questions.
Lenovo had another strong quarter in quarter 1. PC unit shipments were up around 48% year-to-year, making Lenovo one  of the fastest-growing major PC companies for the 3 straight quarters. PC sales were at $4.97 billion [ph] , up 44% year-to-year. This is also the first quarter we recorded a full quarter contribution of our mobile business after we reacquired the business. The mobile unit shipments were up 82% and sales were at $182 million, up 89% year-to-year, if we compare this to its own performance last year prior to the acquisition. This is a result of the good performance from both our conventional handset, as well as our local business. This resulted an increase in market share by 0.9 points to 4.9%, and remained the number one domestic brand in China. Such performance was much better than the projection that was made at the time of the acquisition about a year ago.
Group sales were at $5.1 billion, up about 50% year-to-year. Every selling price was down slightly year-to-year, largely due to the business shift to SMB and consumer products, especially in the emerging markets. Gross profit was at $523 million, up 39% year-to-year. Gross margin was at 10.2% in quarter 1 compared to 11% in quarter 1 last fiscal year, and down slightly from 10.4% last quarter. Our corporate strategy is to grow commercial products and relationship business to maintain our margins and at the same time, we are driving high volume growth through transaction business model rollouts to expand our SMB and consumer business, especially in emerging markets.
This will build scale and lower our cost which will help us to achieve sustainable profit in the future. The business mix shift result in decline in both ASP and gross margin in the short term. And increasing component cost as far as depreciation of key currencies such as the euro against the U.S. dollar in quarter also cost the lower gross margin. While this is a natural consequence of our high-growth strategy, we have already implemented short-term [indiscernible] as well as long-term strategy to help mitigate pressure on the gross margin. Yuanquing will elaborate more on this later. With these actions, we expect the gross margin to stabilize at this level in the short term and improve over a longer period.
Operating expenses increased 21% year-to-year, this figure has included our mobile operation expense that we did not have in last year's results, which included an investment of over $12 million in LePhone in quarter 1. As our increasing expense spending was substantially smaller than our sales growth, the operating expense through revenue ratio continued to trend down to 8.6%, which is the historic low-level for us. The scaling effect helped mitigate decline in the gross margin. Operating income was up more than 4x year-to-year, where the operating margin improved to 1.6%.
We have a net financial costs of $6 million. Pretax income was $75 million versus a $2 million loss year-to-year. Pretax income margin also improved to 1.5%. The pretax income also included the contribution of handset operation net from Lenovo Mobile, which has a stronger performance compared to the projection at the acquisition. The group taxation was at $20 million, and the effective tax rate was around 27%. We expect the effective tax rate to stay at around 30% before the operating margin shows a significant improvement. Accordingly, we reported a net profit of $55 million for the quarter. This is a substantial improvement against the $16 million loss last year. Basic profit per share also improved to USD $0.57 profit versus $0.18 loss last year. Now let's take a look at the balance sheet in the next chart.
Our balance sheet in quarter 1 remained strong. The noncurrent asset were around $2.7 billion in quarter one which is similar to last quarter. Current assets were around $7.6 billion, substantially higher than the level in the last quarter, largely due to an increase in receivable and inventory which were in line with the increase in our sales. Current liabilities were at $7.7 billion, against $6.4 billion last quarter. The increase was largely due an increase of our payable resulting from an increase in sales and our outsourcing to ODMs. As a result, we have the net current liabilities of $87 million in quarter 1. Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart.
Net cash reserves continue to improve to $2.2 billion against $1.4 billion last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue and cash conversion cycle performance. Our working capital management performance remained strong. Days of inventory increased 4 days year-to-year to 19 days. Days receivable also increased 6 days to 28 days year-to-year. The increase is largely due to our continued expansion into the emerging market, particularly consumer products through our transactional model, which tend to have a longer credit period and inventory level. We have also increased ocean shipment to save cost, which also resulted in high inventory level. Thirdly, we have included the mobile operation, which typically have a longer receivable period compared to PCs. The payable remains largely the same compared to last year. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 1 was negative 23 days against a negative 34 days last year or a negative 28 days last quarter. Next chart, please.
The chart summarizes the performance by geographies. We have excluded restructuring costs from the operating profit and margins so that you can better assess our results. China accounts for approximately 49% of group sales. The China PC market posted 31% year-to-year unit shipment growth during the quarter according to industry estimate, benefiting from the steady economic growth and increasing interest in notebooks. Our PC business continued to perform well in China, with unit shipments up 43% year-to-year. And we further expand our leadership position.
As I mentioned before, our mobile business also shows strong growth momentum in quarter 1. We further expanded market share by 0.9% to 4.9%, remains the number one domestic brand. Sales revenue in China were up 50% year-to-year to $2.5 billion, within which we have included $182 million sales from our mobile business during the quarter. PC sales were up $2.3 billion, up 39% year-to-year. Operating profit was up 31% year-to-year to $138 million, and operating margin was down year-to-year but flat quarter-to-quarter.
We have invested in the launch of our first smartphone during the quarter that resulted in flat operating margin from last quarter in quarter 1, but continue to invest to build a solid foundation for our smartphone business in China. In fact, the PC operating margin improved by 0.2 points quarter-to-quarter to 5.9%. Emerging markets, excluding China, accounted for approximately 16% of group sales. Lenovo continued to show strong unit shipment growth momentum at 69% year-to-year, with market share gain across the board that led to an increase of 1.4 percentage point year-to-year to 5.4%. Sales revenue in emerging markets were up around 80% year-to-year, and operating loss improved by $7 million year-to-year. Mature markets account for approximately 35% of group sales. Lenovo unit shipments in Mature Markets were up 49% year-to-year, driven by strong growth in Idea-branded products and the ongoing recovery of Think-branded products. We recorded growth and share gain in all markets in the region. And as a result, our market share increased 1.3 points year-to-year to 5.6%.
Sales revenue in mature markets were up 39% year-to-year, North America and ANZ recorded positive operating profits, Japan was close to breakeven, the Western Europe was affected by the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollars in quarter 1. We are pleased to report that the total mature market achieved breakeven in quarter 1. First time after the financial crisis at the end of 2008. Now let me give you the product performance in the next chart.
Both Think- and Idea-branded products showed strong growth momentum in quarter 1. Consumer and SMB products continued to show smaller growth as we continue to roll out the transaction business model markets outside China.
 Idea-branded products grew 74% year-to-year in unit shipments, up 74% in sales, and accounts for 35% of group sales. We have launched the first 3D multimedia notebook Y560d featuring High Def 3D technology, including a 3D screen, software and glasses. We also introduced the IdeaCentre 8700 all-in-one, a stylish multimedia consumer Desktop PC.
Think-branded products also showed good growth in unit shipments, up 29% year-to-year, and up 32% in sales. It accounts for 61% of our sales. The ongoing recovery in commercial business helped boost Think products even in mature markets. Our enriched product portfolio, including L Series for business, government and education customers, and the ThinkCentre M90z all-in-one, which is a full performance business Desktop in a 23-inch display, helped broaden our product portfolio to cater customers' specific needs. 
Notebook continued to demonstrate strong growth momentum throughout our winning portfolio. Unit shipment and sales were up 58% and 50% year-to-year, respectively. Our worldwide market share increased 2 points to 10.5%. Notebook accounts for 61% of the group sales.
Desktop also performed well in quarter 1. Unit shipments and sales in our Desktop were up 36% and 35% year-to-year, respectively. And our market share in worldwide desktop market increased by 1.7 points to 9.7%. Desktop accounted for 33% of group sales, our all-in-one product in the SMB targeted desktop continued to see good growth momentum.
Finally, Mobile products also showed strong unit shipment and sales growth. If compared to the performance prior to acquisition, were up 82% and 89% year-to-year, respectively. The launch of LePhone has received rapid and widespread customer acceptance, and the initial sales were encouraging. Next chart, please.
I want to give you an update on our recent share repurchase. Lenovo repurchased $34 million shares in quarter 1 and a total of $43 million prior to our blackout period in July. We view share repurchase as one way to enhance shareholder's return. This also demonstrate management's confidence on the company prospects. Lenovo has repurchased a total of 77 million shares for a consideration of approximately $43 million. The average price paid per share is around HKD $4.33.
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. The worldwide PC market has shown strong growth momentum in the last several quarters, especially in China and emerging markets. Despite challenges in debt crisis, uncertainty in the face of economic growth and high compression base established last year, we remain optimistic with the worldwide PC market outlook. China market will continue to show moderate growth in quarter 2 despite slowing consumption. We will leverage our well-established core strength to further expand our leadership in China. Typical summer sales promotion in quarter 2, however, may lead to high E/R ratio in China which is the normal seasonality pattern.
The corporate replacement demand, which has already shown some growth, will be gradually picking up in mature markets. Growth in the emerging markets will likely continue as we drive our share growth strategy. Although cost pressures from key components such as memory chips and panels appear to be easing recently, the ongoing shift of product mix towards low price bands and consumer PC, especially in the emerging markets, will likely continue to exert downward pressure on the average selling price and potentially gross margin. But we already have action in place to stabilize the gross margin at around the current level.
We believe the scaling impact from the high volume growth will also help improve the operating margin over time. While having an encouraging launch of LePhone in China in May, we will continue to invest in LePhone business in order to achieve our leading market position in the Mobile Internet area. We have a healthy balance sheet. We'll continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders' value and look for M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth. We are confident that our well-defined strategy and action plan in place, Lenovo will continue to improve its performance and profitability this year.
Now let me turn to Yuanqing.",2117

As Wai Ming has just told you, Lenovo continued its strong performance for the fifth straight quarter, building on our momentum from last year. We achieved solid results to begin the new fiscal year.
Next slide. We achieved the greater results across the world last quarter with all of our regions, outgrowing the market. This strong growth led to our historic breakthrough in the Lenovo's worldwide market share, reaching double digits at 10.2%, up nearly 2 points year-to-year. Last quarter, when I shared Lenovo's strategic goals for the new fiscal year, one of the goals was to reach double-digit shares within the year. With the effective execution of our strategy, we are pleased to achieve this goal in fiscal Q1. This is an important milestone for Lenovo. We achieved this record market share while remaining the fastest-growing top 5 PC company for the third consecutive quarter. We grow at 48% year-to-year, more than double the market growth rate of 21%. We become the number 2 for commercial notebook at the 17.1% market share, up near 3 points year-to-year. Our profitability also improved significantly with a PTI of USD $76 million. This is an improvement of USD $77 million year-to-year. While strong growth in all regions were the main driver in improving our profitability, the refinement of our lean cost structure also made key contributions. Our expense revenue 8.6% reached the lowest levels since the acquisition, a drop of 2 points year-to-year. In terms of volume, revenue, profitability and expense to revenue, we've achieved our financial targets that was set earlier this year. Next slide.
The main reason behind this performance was because we had the right strategy and strong execution. Last year, we designed our Protect & Attack strategy, protecting our leadership in China and our global commercial business, and attacking in the faster growing emerging markets and the global transactional business. The results from last year demonstrated that it was the right strategy. This year, we are continuing with this strategy. Our Think and the relationship business is our profit engine, and our Idea and the transactional business is our growth engine. Depending on the forecast of different markets, we will use these 2 engines to complement each other and to drive sustainable growth. Next slide.
Let's first take a look at our China business. In China, we further strengthened our leadership position last quarter, growing shipments by 43% year-to-year, well ahead of the market rate of 31%. This led to a market share increase of 2.4 points year-to-year. Meanwhile, our key competitor lost the shares over the past couple of quarters and we further widened the gap with them. At the same time, we further refined our end-to-end operational efficiency and optimized our product mix that will keep the current customers. Through these actions, China's profitability grew. Operating profits increased by USD $33 million year-to-year. Next slide.
In other emerging markets, the key word is growth. By fully leveraging our Idea products and the transactional model, we continued our rapid expansion, growing at almost 70% year-to-year, more than 2x market rate of 26%. We gained 1.4 points of market share year-to-year to 5.4%. We achieved a substantial year-to-year growth in all of the key emerging markets, including Russia, almost 4 points; India, 2 points; Latin America and South Asia, 1 point. Eastern Europe, slowed down a little bit but still gained 0.4 points.
At the same time, operational losses were kept at a reasonable level and were further improved by USD $7 million year-to-year. We have always believed that the key to making money in the market depends on whether you have relevance in that market. This relevance is market share and brand recognition. That is why within these emerging markets, our first priority is to quickly improve our market shares to double digit.
Next slide. In mature markets, this year, we will not only protect our relationship business, but also focus on growing the transaction business. Last quarter, we saw positive results from this strategy. In our relationship business, shipments were up 30% year-to-year, twice as fast as the market growth. Meanwhile, our transactional business, up almost 60% year-to-year, that was 4x as fast as the market. The Protect and Attack strategy within the Mature Markets delivered growth across all regions. Australia and the New Zealand gained 3.5 points, Western Europe gained 1.6 points. In Japan, where Lenovo has been the fastest-growing vendor for the past 4 quarters, we gained 2 points year-to-year. These results show the overall growth in the Mature Markets where our shipments increased by 49% year-to-year, 3x that of the market at 15%. Our market share increased by 1.3 points year-to-year reaching 5.6%. While delivering volume growth, mature markets and profitability was also improved, reaching breakeven for the first time since the global financial crisis. Segment operating profit improved by $37 million year-to-year. We haven't seen such high growth in Mature Market regions in a long time. This shows our new engines that drive our business are working. Think and the relationship driving profitability, while Idea and the transactional drive volume growth. Next slide.
Not only are we growing in our core PC business, our new business, Mobile Internet, also had a good start last quarter. Since its launch on May 17, LePhone achieved 12% market share in less than 2 months in China's high-end Internet phone market, despite the sales being slightly impacted by screen supply shortages. And the supply issue will be resolved in the near future, we believe LePhone's volume growth will increase even faster. The initial success of LePhone in the market creates a solid start for our Mobile Internet business. We will continue to invest in this area and grasp this growth opportunity. Next slide.
The success of launching LePhone was the result of several years of long-term planning and the investment in competitiveness. Looking forward, we will continue to build on our competitiveness and further focus on these few areas. The first is innovation. We believe innovation is the weapon to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. In the next few years, we will further increase our research and innovation investment in areas like Mobile Internet, digiphone and cloud computing. Second, we will continue to refine our business model and improve efficiencies across our value chain, especially in manufacturing, we will fully leverage China's push in developing its western region to optimize our manufacturing strategy and further increase our profitability. Third, we will increase our branding efforts outside of China and raise our brand recognition globally. We believe by continuously investing in our competitiveness, we will create a stronger foundation for Lenovo's long-term growth. Next slide.
Lastly, let us take a look at the market situation. It can be said that the global market outlook has both challenges and opportunities. In terms of challenges, although China is still growing faster than the rest of the world, its growth has been moderated by the slowdown in the stock and real estate markets. Meanwhile, mature markets have not fully recovered from the global economic crisis. This is especially obvious in the consumer sector where consumer confidence in Europe and the U.S. has recently weakened.
However, opportunities also exist. First, global commercial replacement demand is gradually recovering. Second, emerging markets still offer growth opportunities we can leverage. Furthermore, the Mobile Internet is growing and it will create new product categories in the business models. We already have a clear strategy in place and are prepared to grasp these opportunities. But no matter how the market evolves, Lenovo is confident that by executing our strategy and further increasing our competitiveness, we will continue to outgrow the market. Many of you may recall that before year 2009, Lenovo's market share never grew above 8%. Since last year by designing the right strategy and focusing on strong execution, our market share has been increasing rapidly and setting new record highs. Reaching 10.2% market share is an important milestone and a new starting point. Certainly, we will not be content with just this achievement. We will continue this good momentum and bring long-lasting returns for the shareholders.
Thank you, everyone. I will now turn the meeting over to Chairman Liu. Chairman Liu, please?
Next is the translation of Chairman Liu's remark.",1378
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-18-2010",2010-08-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3803.0,165372.0,10384705.0,Presenter Speech,Chuanzhi Liu,,Executives,2,"Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, in earnings announcement of the last quarter of fiscal year 2009 to 2010, I explained to investors and the media, on behalf of the board, that Lenovo's outstanding achievement in the past year did not happen by chance. I told you that Lenovo had moved far away from extreme danger and had embarked on a stable, fast growth track. Now we are reporting on the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 to 2011, Lenovo achieved an excellent opening quarter based on its original plan. Here, I want to emphasize 4 points.
First, in this quarter, Lenovo's worldwide market share increased to be 10.2%, which was due to strong performance globally, not only in the China market, but also markets in developed countries, as well as emerging regions. Lenovo has a very clear strategy to determine when and where to focus on gaining shares, and when and where to focus on maintaining profits, and it executed well. It demonstrates company's strong capability of developing the right strategy and executing it.
Secondly, the significant decrease of Lenovo's expense-to-revenue ratio ensure the stable increase of its profit margin. It shows the management's deep understanding of the operation of the PC industry, as well as their excellent execution capability. In addition, with the further improvement of the company's IT system, there will be more opportunity to lower expenses while improving efficiency and performance.
Thirdly, the future increase of profits for Lenovo comes from 2 areas. First is the growth of its market share and increase in revenue. The other one is the increase of profit margin. PC has become a commodity business, maintaining profit margin will be a challenge. The fundamentals for boosting profit margin are: Innovation and the raise of brand awareness. Gradually enhanced investment in research and development is a promise for technology and innovation. For this, the management has conducted thorough analysis. A series of transformations in the IT industry such as the emergence of Mobile Internet and cloud computing have provided new space for IT companies. Despite this, in the past, numerous IT companies died or failed due to their misguided investments in R&D. These past failure cases are good lessons for us. Lenovo will pay attention to 2 things while increasing investment in R&D.
First, among various options and directions, we will make sure an exploration is in the right direction and is within our reach so that we can ensure our efficiency of investment and that we can provide and produce a strong return on that investment. Secondly, while investing in R&D, we need to make sure our other business functions and operations are equally strong. The launch and marketing of LePhone is a typical example of both of these concepts working together. In the next few years, Lenovo will work on maintaining sustainable and stable fast growth rather than just focusing on generating extremely high profits in short-term. To achieve our long-term goals, it is critical that we make efficient timely investments in R&D and build our brand.
Fourthly and finally, as I have mentioned in each earnings announcement, the fundamental for Lenovo's continuous development is an outstanding leadership team which blends talents and practices from both the East and West. This is the biggest fruit the company harvested in the last year. Because of this outstanding management team, Lenovo was able to develop the right strategy and execute it. And the leadership team has created a strong culture insight. The new global culture, highlighted by the new principle, Do what we say, Own what we do, is being embraced by employees across the world. Despite uncertainties about the world's economy and various challenges and hardships lying ahead of us, I firmly believe that Lenovo's future will be brilliant. I invite all of you to keep on tracing and checking on our progress down the road. Thank you.",646

You are looking at a higher revenue probably from the emerging market, which is still is a loss making for you. So how do you think your margins will trend up on the second half of this year, given like the most profitable market is slowing down a bit, whereas loss-making market maybe will grow at a faster rate?",96

I would imagine China higher than our worldwide average. But we really are betting the GP margins challenged. So we have analyzed issue side. So actually we are betting short-term, midterm and the long term issue part. Short-term up to last quarter, we have had supply shortage, particularly in memory and LCD panels. Because we overachieved our target. If we were to sell more, so we have to buy some high-cost materials. So that impacted our GP margin. But because the market is slowing down, so we believe the supply will be relieved this quarter and the rest of the year. So that will help us manage the cost of material better than last quarter. Second, midterm. So when we execute our Protect and Attack strategy, the mix -- so you know our Protect and Attack strategy, so we want to protect our China business and the global commercial business. Why we want to attack the global transactional business and the emerging markets. So when we executed this strategy, the mix of the Transactional business and the Idea products, will become higher than before. But unfortunately, the current Idea products and the Transactional business GP margin is lower than our relationship and the Think -- legendary Think [indiscernible]. So that will have the impact to our GP margin. So we have asked our team how to address this issue. We have asked our team to at least grow our Think and the relationship business with the market, with the flat GP margin. But meanwhile, we want our team to better plan our attack action. So we should concentrate most of the resources in some selective countries to gain double-digit shares first. After they reached the double-digit share, we will pay more attention to the profitability -- to improve the profitability. Then we could remove the resources to other markets to attack the market share. So that's midterm. For long-term, as I just said in my opening speech, so we will have small attention to innovation, to this model and the 2 brands. So I think this is crucial to maintain or to improve our GP margin. As you know, most of our competitors consider the PC is a commodity in that, that don't do any innovation work. So that drives the industry, the GP margin. But we still want to do some innovational work to ensure we can maintain and improve our GP margins. So for sure, we will further improve our business model and promote our brand outside China.",440

I think Yuanquing, you've just mentioned there is a slight slowdown. So I'm wondering what could be the major that could help you to maintain the margins there, especially given that it seems that competition could further intensify after this cooperation between Acer and Thunder [ph]. So is the decline in component prices enough to mitigate this weakening demand and also increasing competition? This is the first question.",75

I think we want to, again, emphasize that this is a very important  point to make. The growth rate in China is still growing and the only point is it's moderating from the very hyper growth that we've seen in the past couple of quarters. There's no reason to expect that we won't be able to continue to protect and add share in an expanding market while it may not grow as fast as it had been a couple of quarters ago, we still will see significant positive momentum in the business activity. And you heard Yuanqing mention both our short-term, our midterm and our long-term focus on improving margin, many of those items will apply themselves in China, where we have a very strong brand position, that allows us to command a much stronger margin result. And also, I think your point related to commodity activity, some of our competitors are not having some of the same success. While they're very good competitors, this is putting downward pressure on commodities. This should help us in our activities to continue to increase share, step-by-step and improve our margins step-by-step. And I think the key, if you think about Yuanqing's comments, the strategic long-term margin activities around innovation, around the Mobile Internet and around our brand and marketing activities, are 100% represented in China. Our innovations around LePhone, our innovations around our new products and the Mobile Internet with the services and activities, we're already seeing progress in those areas. That creates more value and that allows us to gain better margins from our customers because they see that value.",277

So we have built a solid foundation in China. So our business model there is very strong. So you can see us over 10 years. Although our key competitors have changed frequent their style, but we always keep our leadership position. So why we can have this competition, because I think the most being promising is that we have this business model. So this is our end-to-end [indiscernible] business model. Not only we have the wide network of strong brand awareness, but also we developed this product. We have a development team in China. So they understand the China market better than our competitors. So we could have the better product for the market. And also, our supply chain is very close to the market. So it's very -- not only we could meet the customers' serviceability requirements, but also we could keep the flexibility. So that's the advantage to our competitors.

One of the things that we are seeing there's almost an overhyping of this emerging segment. It's a relatively small part of the market at this point. We've been focused on innovating and creating the right solutions as Yuanqing has mentioned, and our move to some of the Android technology, we thought, was a prudent one for the long-term success. There seems to be a little bit of fad fever right now and we do think it will be an important segment. But we really believe that it's crucial for us to deliver the LePhone infrastructure and the application base leveraging the Android technology that allow the customers to have that full experience. And you'll see that occur over the coming months. This is a key space, but it's definitely not causing -- and it's not large to cause a significant ripple in any of the PC demand. And we will have a complete set of products, from smartphones to smartbooks through netbooks  all the way through laptops and desktops. And Lenovo family of products will leverage those technologies across those products, as well as the cloud computing solutions that our customers are interested in. We think that full set of products that allows over the next 12 to 24 months with the back-end applications will be important. This is just the beginning of this space, and we feel we are very well-prepared from smartphone, smartbook, all the way up that allows us to compete effectively.",247

I think Yuanqing has driven the team with an intense focus of being efficient and productive. We're going to continue to have that focus. At the same time, we've been able to scale our business, adding almost 3 points of market share over that same time period. That scale has translated into better revenues, better cost per box and obviously, our expense-to-revenue ratio. I believe that will work to continue to drive efficiency and productivity over the coming quarters, as well as -- and we believe we can do that at the same time investing in additional brand activity and additional innovation. While I don't think that either our declines will be as large as they've been over the past several quarters, we will continue to drive efficiency. It's key to our business and it's important. But we will not sacrifice our ability to innovate and to build our brand in those key emerging markets and across the planet.",175

But generally, I can actually give you 2, I think answer your question in 2 ways. I think when we acquired or reacquired the Lenovo mobile, it has the traditional or conventional 2G and 3G handsets. I think that business has been growing very strong. I think it has actually increased in terms of year-to-year over 80-something percent, and generating good results. I think the result was much better then. I think, from a year-to-year basis, profitability was actually increased over, I think, definitely over 100%. LePhone is another business that was recently launched, as Yuanqing just said, I think we launched LePhone in May. We have the initial very good reception but due to the shortage of supply, I think, we're still growing with the market at a market share of 12%. We will continue to invest and one would not expect that, I think, in the initial period we will generate profit. I think from an investment point of view, we've been actually investing over $10 million, I think, including the brand as far as the R&D to follow up the, I think, the growth of the business so that we will position ourselves, I think, in order to get a much better market position.",218

First, our traditional feature phone business is working very well. So the growth is almost [indiscernible] part. We -- I think that number surpassed our prediction when we bought this business. And so not just revenue and the volume, but also our profitability. All these aspects are better than our expected. The second is our LePhone business, I think, is on track. So no matter, volume, revenue and profitability, so all these items are on track. So although we have very aggressive pricing strategy, we still have to defend the GP margin with the LePhone cost. But we think, if we want to get to the leadership position in this area, we must have a more aggressive marketing activity, so we will spend more marketing money to ensure we can get to the leader position. But because of the first quarter supply shortage, we haven't actually invested enough in this area. So when we get enough supply, we will have even more aggressive marketing action in China. So that's my comment on our LePhone and mobile business.",183

So we couldn't sell more. That's all we can sell. But as you said, so the feedback from market has been pretty positive. So we believe we can sell more this quarter and the future. So we expect to sell more than 800k amount, so that -- in 1 year we can sell 1 million. So that's our -- that's still our expectations. So actually, now we have already had a back up plan for the panel supply. So we believe we will resolve the panel shortages issue soon. So that's the answer to your question.",112

As Yuanquing said, I think LePhone, although we've extremely aggressive, but we actually have a reasonable gross margin without disclosing the exact, I can tell you, is we can achieved a double-digit margin on a gross margin basis. And trying to answer your question as to what is the break-even volume, I think at this point in time, while we are -- I think our objective is to once we have the supply back to normal, then we obviously ramp up and go to 1 million. And in this period, we are going to invest significantly the marketing activities as well as investing in technology. I think for more, for newer versions, for more models, so that we will be able to dominate the market. So in the first 12 months, I would say that we probably will spend probably a lot more resources in terms of marketing, as far as R&D, and therefore, I think probably, it's not right way to look at, I think the sort of breakeven volume. I think we obviously, have the objective to want to get to a much higher market position and then we'll have the services attached to it as outlined very briefly by Rory a while ago, so that we will have a complete product range as far as be able to take a leading position in the entire Mobile Internet area.",246

We've seen a significant increase in our ocean shipments with an intense focus on driving our logistics cost down. What we would expect to see is year-to-year improvement of the logistics cost. What we're trying to do is outpace the market. What we've seen is a significant increase across the board in ocean shipments whether it's to emerging or mature markets. Probably well over 2x to 3x more ocean shipment that even 2, 3, 4 quarters ago. But I think we're reaching a point where we'll see that expansion kind of moderate from here. I think we will continue to drive ocean shipment but the percentage, I think, will stay near where we are. We'll continue to add smaller gains but a very rapid expansion of ocean shipments, I think, we'll manage from here to be in more of a flat range. So we've seen probably a 2x to 3x improvement in terms of the volumes that we're shipping there and I would expect us to increase that, but not at the same rate over the coming quarters. Because we're doing substantial volumes across the board there. But this is only one of the levers we are using to improve our logistics cost and our supply chain cost, to get the products most efficiently to the market. And you're going to see us continue to work each of those items as Yuanqing mentioned, as part of our short-, mid- and long-term margin activities. Because this is key, not only for the ocean shipments, but across the board to improve that market. So again, 2x to 3x improvement in those volumes and we'll continue to grow that over the coming quarters.",283

It's kind of exciting, actually. Our overall growth rate was very strong at 48%. And what was particularly pleasing about the growth rates and our performance, as Yuanqing mentioned in his presentation, was the balance of the performance. We saw share gains in consumer, we saw share gains in SMB, we saw them in commercial. And we've started to see, over the past 3 quarters, improving business activity in commercial. The corporate refresh cycle, the Win 7 migration is definitely driving better business activity. And we're seeing it in our results. And we're seeing it in the fact that we're able to take share and we're growing. Our 48% growth rate for the quarter, I think, is quite substantial and one that represents good momentum. And for the standpoint of Mature in this quarter we're reporting, we've seen some of our best growth rates that we have had in the past 6 or 7 quarters. And that's driven by a combination of SMB, consumer and commercial and the commercial activity has been building strength for 3 quarters in a row. We expect that commercial activity to continue to grow. All our pipelines suggest that many customers that have been locked in, are locked in to the XP operating system, are planning to go to 7. In terms of linearity, there is definitely some moderation in the hyper growth rates that we saw in the March, April time frame. But we saw solid growth rates across every region and every segment and overall put in 48%. We'll expect that to continue to moderate from there in the coming quarters, but we expect the market to continue to grow. We expect it to continue to grow in all markets, and we continue to expect we'll be able to build share because we have the right strategy of Protect and Attack that Yuanqing laid out.

I am Wong Wai Ming, CFO of the group. Thank you for joining us. Today, I'm joined by Mr. Liu Chuanzhi, Chairman; and Mr. Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo. 
I will first take you through Lenovo's financial highlights for the fiscal third quarter, as well as outlook for the year. Then Yuanqing will give you an update on key business and strategic issues that we have been focusing on for the rest of the year. Our Chairman, Mr. Liu, will conclude with some remarks, after which, we will take your questions. 
Let me start by giving you an overview of our quarter 3 performance on the next chart. Lenovo had another strong quarter in quarter 3 with record-high market share, the fastest growth among all key competitors, substantially improved profit and historic low expense-to-revenue ratio. 
Lenovo PC unit shipments grew 42% year-on-year in quarter 3 against the market growth rate of 17%, and we grew fastest among top 5 players. As a result, our worldwide PC market share increased by 1.6 points for approximately 9.0%. This is our record-high market share and is the third consecutive quarter we outgrew the worldwide PC market since the economic crisis. 
This was achieved by our strong growth in China and Emerging Markets and transaction business that drove our consumer business to gain market share in all regions. We also gained market share in notebooks and desktops. We improved our profitability in Q3. This is our second straight profitable quarter, supported by our profitability improvement in all regions. For expense control, this is the third consecutive quarter we have improvement in our E/R ratio and achieved a historic low E/R ratio of 9.0% through good expense management and scaling with increased volume. Yuanquing will elaborate more on how our strategy and strong execution helped deliver these results and how they will continue to help us deliver strong performance in the future as well. 
Let me turn you to details of our performance in quarter 3 in the next chart. Lenovo recorded $4.8 billion in sales in quarter 3, up 33% year-to-year. Gross profit was $531 million, up 45% year-to-year. Gross profit margin improved from 10.6% in quarter 2 to 11.1% in quarter 3. This is largely due to higher mix of notebook and high-end products, and better pricing control helped improve the sequential margin improvements. However, key component costs remained high and will probably constrain margin improvements. Although, we will continue to drive for volume growth of better scaling impact, please note that Q4 is typically a low season with low gross margin. 
Meanwhile, our actions in expense reduction are on track. We have saved a total of $247 million in the past 3 quarters. We further reduced our operating expenses from $457 million to $431 million year-on-year in quarter 3. The strong sales volume increase in quarter 3 helped achieve better scaling expenses, resulting in our expense-to-revenue ratio to further improve to a historic low of 9.0% in quarter 3 against 9.5% in quarter 2. 
Notwithstanding that we have already achieved the majority of our target expense reduction in the last 3 quarters as planned, we will continue our efforts in expense control. We will also invest part of the savings to drive future growth opportunities in consumer business, R&D and in Emerging Markets. We expect the E/R ratio to remain low, although E/R ratio in quarter 4 is usually higher compared to quarter 3 due to the seasonality. We have a strong operating profit in quarter 3. This the second consecutive quarter we returned to profit with improved margins. 
Operating profit was $99 million. We recorded a nonoperating expense of $6 million, which relates to net financing costs. Pretax income was $93 million. We recorded some one-off items in Q3. There were provisions of non-reimbursable warranty costs for replacing components and parts and licensing fees that resulted an expense of $43 million. The group has recorded a net gain of $43 million from disposal of some of our investments during the quarter. As a result, our pretax income for quarter 3 is $94 million. Profit attributable to equity holders for quarter 3 was $80 million. EPS is USD $0.86 in this quarter. 
Next chart, please. Our balance sheet at the end of December remains strong. The noncurrent assets were approximately $2.5 billion. Current assets were around $6.9 billion against $4.1 billion as at March 31, 2009. The increase in trade and notes receivable was roughly in line with our sales increase. The current liabilities were at $6.8 billion against $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2009. The increase was largely due to increase in our accounts payable. And again, this is in line with our growth in business. As a result, we have net current assets of $17 million as of December 31 against $319 million net current liabilities recorded at the last fiscal year-end date. 
Let's go through to the cash and working capital in the next chart. Cash reserves continued to improve to $3 billion against $2.4 billion last quarter, while our bank borrowings were $597 million, similar to last quarter. Our net cash reserve remained very healthy at $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Compared to last quarter, days receivable were 24 days, which shows an improvement of 11 day year-on-year. This was achieved through reduced overdue accounts receivable balances and early payment incentives. Days inventory also showed the reduction of 2 days year-on-year to 15 days, which was driven by strong sales performance. Day payable was slightly down by 3 days year-on-year. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 3 was at negative 32 days, decreased or better by 10 days year-on-year. 
Next chart, please. China. China continued to deliver solid growth and gain share amidst keen competition. Robust growth of the China market was driven by consumer products, especially notebook. The China PC market posted 41% year-on-year growth during the quarter, benefiting from steady economic growth under the government stimulus package, improved consumer sentiment and increasing interest in consumer notebooks. We continue to expand our leadership in China by growing 54% in unit shipments and increase our market share by 2.8 points to approximately 33.5% based on the latest industry estimates. This is the largest quarterly increase in share in the last 9 years. We have the highest market share in our history. The impact of the government rural subsidy program, as we mentioned in previous quarters, remains more in quarter 3. But we believe the huge rural population will be a big potential market in the future. 
Sales were up 45% year-on-year and up 14% quarter-for-quarter. Operating profit was $135 million and operating margin improved from 4.8% in quarter 2 to 6% in quarter 3. The margin improvement was due to a higher mix of notebook and high-end products and better pricing control, as well as high attachment rates of services, software and peripherals. 
Emerging Markets, excluding China. Our expansion in Emerging Markets continue to show good momentum in quarter 3. Lenovo grew 52% year-over-year by unit shipments, again, 19% market growth. We gained share in almost across the region. As a result, our market share was up 1.2 points to 5.5%. Sales were 53% year-on-year and up 39% quarter-to-quarter. Profitability in all markets in the regions improved year-on-year, except Latin America, and operating loss was reduced from $20 million to $6 million in this quarter. Operating margin was improved accordingly. 
Mature Markets. Mature Markets are on track to turn around. Unit shipments grew modestly compared to Emerging Market at 16% year-on-year against the market growth of 10%. We gained share in all markets, except North America, as our consumer business was still relatively small in this market. Unit shipment in North America and Western Europe were up 17% and 7% year-on-year respectively.  Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand were profitable in quarter 3. North America was breakeven. Japan recorded a strong shipment unit growth at 46% year-on-year. Indeed, we have recorded the fastest growth for the 2 straight quarters in Japan and the #1 in consumer business growth in quarter 3. Japan was approaching break-even level in quarter 3 as well. Operating loss reduced from $15 million last quarter to $7 million this quarter. Indeed, if we look at the operating profit before headquarter and other expense allocation, the Mature Markets have already recorded a small profit after 6 quarters of losses. These are the results of the improved margin control and our expansion in the transactional business, which helped to increase our business resulting a better scaling impact. This U.S. dollar weakening against key currency also helped margins, especially in Europe and Canada. 
Next chart, please. On product performance, Lenovo posted share gain in both desktop and notebook computer markets in quarter 3. The launch of Windows 7 helped improve the PC market during the quarter. Notebook shipments in quarter 3 were up 68% year-on-year against 32% market growth, and we gained market share in notebook worldwide to 8.5%.  Revenue was up 46% year-on-year, which was largely due to our expanded consumer product lineup. Notebook continued to be the largest contributor to the company's total revenue, accounting for approximately 62%. Our Idea netbook has contributed to the good notebook volume growth that stabilizes approximately 50% of our net notebook business, similar to last quarter. During the quarter, we launched the industry's first multitouch capacitive tablet booklet S10-3t. Our Desktop shipments were up 18% year-on-year in the quarter against minus 1% market growth, boosted by the strong consumer products. We gained market share in Desktop worldwide to 9.9%. Revenue was up 17% year-on-year, accounting for 36% of our total revenue. 
Please turn to the next page for the outlook. While the worldwide PC market has shown signs of improvement, commercial spending still remains soft in quarter 3, though, it is expected that the corporate replacement cycle may come in the second half of this year. Our expansion in consumer and Emerging Markets delivered good momentum in quarter 3, and we will continue to invest in this area to drive growth. 
However, the ongoing shift of product mix towards consumer PCs and penetration into Emerging Markets may exert pressure on the ASP. But we think that the ASP may remain relatively stable in quarter 4 compared to quarter 3. However, the supplies issue in certain key components that impacted us in quarter 3 will continue to constrain margin improvement. And particularly, in quarter 4, which is typically low season and E/R ratio, therefore, were normally higher sequentially compared to quarter 3. 
In addition, we will continue to take expense out in order to achieve a more efficient operation. The volatility of major currency against U.S. dollar will also have impact on our margins, especially in the Mature Markets, though we have a prudent hedging policy in place. Despite these and sequential seasonality, we expect the year-on-year unit shipment growth in quarter 4 is similar to quarter 3. 
The progress in quarter 3 continues to demonstrate the strength of our strategic priorities, and we will continue the solid execution to drive consistent strong performance. Yuanqing will give you more update on these later.

Hello, everyone. Today, I will first give you some comment on our performance last quarter, and then I'll discuss our view and the thinking on the future. 
Next slide, please. Overall, we continued our strong momentum in the third quarter. For the first time since our acquisition of IBM PC business 5 years ago, Lenovo become the fastest-growing PC company at 42% year-to-year, vastly outpacing the market growth rate of 17%. This record growth enabled Lenovo to achieve its highest-ever global market share for the third straight quarter, reaching 9%. Our growth was driven by gains in almost all regions of the world, particularly in China and other Emerging Markets. And the continued rollout of our global transactional business is another driver. 
Last quarter, Lenovo continued to expand its leadership position in China, gaining 2.8 points to reach our all-time high share of 33.5%. Our expansion into Emerging Markets outside of China continued to yield strong results, growing at 52% year-to-year, greatly outpacing the market rate of 19%. With this strong growth, Lenovo gained 1.2 points of the market share year-to-year. We grew volume  radically year-to-year in key markets, such as India at 54%, Southeast Asia at 66%. Eastern Europe at 63%, and Russia at 374%. We also saw our growth in most regions of the Mature Market. Overall, we gained 0.2 points of the share year-to-year. But in particular, Japan gained 1.5 points, Australia/New Zealand gained 1.7 points and Western Europe gained 0.3 points. 
Meanwhile, the expansion of our transactional model is becoming an important driver in the company's market share growth. In this space, we gained 1.6 points of the market share worldwide year-to-year. This includes gaining 1.6 points in Emerging Markets outside of China and 0.5 point of share in Mature Markets. This strong performance proves that our attack portion of our strategy, which was clarified last year, is delivering good results. 
Next slide, please. We have sustained the momentum that returned Lenovo to profitability last quarter and grew our PTI to USD $94 million in the third quarter. We improved our profitability in every part of the world and our strong performance in China played a especially important role. Our China business contributed USD $135 million to our profitability, up 42% quarter-to-quarter. We achieved this by not only increasing sales volume but also focusing on improving average sales price and gross margins. In other Emerging Markets, our profitability improved USD $14 million quarter-to-quarter. In Mature Markets, our profitability are improved by USD $8 million quarter-to-quarter, bringing our Mature Markets growth close to breakeven. 
Next slide, please. The improvement in profitability was also a result of our effective expense management after achieving our lowest E/R ratio since the acquisition in fiscal Q2. Last quarter, we reduced the expenses by USD $26 million year-to-year, while we grew our revenues by 33%. Our efforts led to another historical low E/R ratio of 9%. Meanwhile, we continued to focus on managing costs. We lowered our cost-per-box by 4.5% quarter-to-quarter. 
Next slide. These strong results, once again, demonstrated that we have said are effective strategy with strong execution. Early last year, we set a new business strategy based on the market conditions at that time and the company's situation. We called this strategy Protect and Attack. Protect our core businesses in China and in global commercial segment and attack Emerging Markets and the global transactional segments. So this strategy is simple and clear and enables every team to focus on their key areas. 
Based on this strategy, we realigned our organizational structure. Mature and the Emerging Markets growth at the front end and the Think and the Idea product growth at the back end. This structure is more efficient and effective, allowing better integration and a greater focus on the customers' needs. Catering to our different customer needs, we launched different lines of innovative products in the commercial and the consumer segments. This enhanced our product lines, making them more complete and more competitive than ever before. Meanwhile, our culture of delivering our commitments is taking hold across our teams and they're delivering strong results. 
Next slide. Here, I would like to share more of thoughts on this industry, and the Lenovo's business philosophy. As this industry moves toward low price points, more and more manufacturers think that there's no room or need for innovation. These PC players create a commodity products in order to achieve higher efficiency. But at Lenovo, we have a different perspective. Now we believe that efficiency is important in the industry. Without it, you cannot survive. But innovation is equally important. Room for innovation is everywhere. We need to be a company that best balances between innovation and the efficiency. And usually, this is the most efficient innovation to lead the developments in the industry. 
Guided by this philosophy, we were able to fully demonstrate our innovation capability and achieve greater results at this January's Consumer Electronic Show. In only 3 days, we introduced more than 20 new products that enhance our strong portfolio. This has not only further expanded our product line but also opened new areas that can ensure Lenovo's sustainable growth. These products got a greater response, as Lenovo won 8 industry awards, and the most of any PC manufacturers. We also generated a positive media coverage in more than 3,500 articles worldwide. Our success at the CES demonstrates our innovation leadership. Even more, it further proves that Lenovo has a strategic vision to identify growth opportunities and the capability to grasp at these opportunities. 
Next slide. One of the growth opportunities that we see, in the Mobile Internet. As 3G networks become more mature, cloud computing technologies become more prevalent, content and the usage models of the Internet become more diverse. Traditional PCs such as desktop or notebook, no longer fully satisfy the people's needs to connect online at any time and any place. Consumers are eager to get smaller and better wireless devices that they integrate with the Internet content and the services and they easily connect to 3G or WiFi networks. Such a need is especially evident for an Emerging Market like China. Targeting this growth opportunity, we have defined Lenovo's Mobile Internet strategy. 
To dedicate our efforts in the development of more advanced and a complete line of Mobile Internet devices, these devices can integrate with and will be best assured for the most popular Internet applications. Therefore, they will provide the users with optimal Internet experience. Based on this strategy, we have been carefully preparing our technology and the product portfolio for the past few years. 
At CES, we introduced the first wave of our products in 3 categories for the Mobile Internet. Our first smartphone, LePhone, and the industry's first ARM-based smartbook, Skylight, and the IdeaPad U1, our traditional notebook and our tablet hybrid PC. These products become instant stars after they were announced. Many people can't wait to buy and start using them. We will first launch this new business in China because there, we have a strong brand and a channel network. With these advantages, we can more easily integrate it with the service providers and the carriers. 
In addition, with the shareholders' approval of our recent acquisition of Lenovo Mobile, it further strengthens our end-to-end operational expertise in phone and small form factor devices. We believe that the Lenovo's Mobile Internet products will have high potential. 
Next slide. We are seeing good momentum in our performance and making progress with our new business. While we will make our best efforts in maintaining this momentum, challenges clearly remain. First, fiscal Q4 is typically the slowest season of the year. Seasonality will continue to be a factor. Second, although the global economy has shown signs of improvement, the corporate replacement cycle is still expected to be delayed until the second half of this year. In addition, although we have strong plans and the processes in place to manage and minimize the supply issue, component costs are increasing, especially memory, and remain a challenge. And more importantly, I would like to emphasize that we will continue to invest heavily in Emerging Markets, in consumer business and in the Mobile Internet to achieve sustainable growth. We believe that long-term benefits of this investment strategy are clear. 
Next slide. In any case, I have complete confidence in Lenovo's future innovation. Good results depends on our strong strategy and our solid execution, one step at a time. To do this, we must continue to focus on executing our strategy priorities: maintain our China leadership and improve profitability; improve profitability in Mature Markets; continue to invest in and seize growth opportunities in Emerging Markets and the global transactional segments; execute our Mobile Internet strategy, firstly in China then worldwide; drive our lean cost structure; differentiate this through innovation and our leading product portfolio. 
Thank you, everyone. Now I will turn the meeting over to Chairman Liu.",1489

This is not only because our performance exceeded our expectations, but also that we had big success with our new products launched last month in CES in Las Vegas. Several of our products snatched major awards. These new products are going to be launched in China very soon, and then will be launched in other markets in the rest of the world. 
When we announced our earnings performance last quarter, some investors and journalists asked the management how it would address the issue of declining gross profit margin. Our CEO and COO said clearly that the company will not only do the apparent of lowering costs, but will also, more importantly, seek to raise profitability through innovation. And the new products we launched at CES, marked the beginning of our innovative efforts. 
The new Lenovo management is forward-looking and strong in strategic planning. Although Lenovo, like many business corporations, has been hit in the economic downturn last year and is still in its recovery, it has already started to deploy a development strategy that integrates innovation into a business model, technology and management. 
Mobile Internet is a growing demand worldwide. In China, the government is currently driving the convergence of the 3 networks, telecom, TV and the Internet by formulating new standards. This gives the computer industry, especially Lenovo, significant opportunities for development and growth. 
At the last earnings announcement, I encouraged you to look at what we have said and whether we are able to deliver on our words. This is a basic principle in relationship building between the Chairman and management team of the company and investors. And this time, my conclusions are, first, although Lenovo managed notable improvements, it still has rooms for improvement in management and operation. Secondly, some of our innovative initiatives may not hit the target the first time, hence, might need adjustments. In addition, we will enlarge our investments in R&D and product marketing, so we hope that investors won't set expectations in profits too high for us. Thirdly, I'm happy to say that Lenovo has the best of time, circumstance and people now, which means it will be able to keep growing in the short-term, the next 1 to 2 years, and its long-term prospects look bright. 
Sometime this year, we will invite investors and analysts to visit our operations in mainland China to allow them to see firsthand and in-depth about how we run our business. Thank you.",420

Because we have a very strong brand, we have very good relationship with those service provider, content provider. So I don't think it's very difficult for Lenovo to integrate to those kind of applications and the contents in China. And also, I believe we could have -- the good relationships will carry us. So we have wonderful designed devices that we could incorporate with carriers and service and content providers, so we could provide a better customer experience to our end users. So we are very confident that we could be a strong player in China in this area. In terms of the concrete investments, we couldn't give the exact number.",124

And I mean, in the presentation, it was alluded to in that you expect something in the second half. But I wonder if specifically you could take us through what you look forward to, to validate that expectation. Do people put in orders sort of around March, April, May for delivery in Q3, calendar Q3? Or what markets can we look for on the way to validate that expectation, please?",100

That's actually a very interesting area for us to look at. In the most recent quarter, we actually were able to take share in the commercials segment across the planet. We also saw better business activity. While I wouldn't say it's a full recovery yet in the commercial segment, we clearly saw better activity in the quarter. What's encouraging about the corporate refresh cycle is the interest in new products and new solutions from our customer sets. Those commercial customers have been bringing forward additional RFPs, request for quotations and request for pricing. They've also been bringing in certain products to do testing using Win 7. I think if we continue to see business activity improve over the coming quarters, which we expect they will, that, that corporate refresh cycle should begin in the second half of this calendar year. That's based on the early test activity. It's also based on the increase in RFP. And we've done a lot of focus on acquisition, acquiring new customers during this down period, so as that refresh begins to take hold, we have a stable of new customers to participate in that segment. I think those are the key areas. In terms of the segments, I don't think there's any doubt that we'll see it in the global customers, those large enterprises that run on a global basis. We'll also see activity across Asia and China and here in North America and Western Europe. To be quite frank, we see activity or interest increasing in all geographies. I would not call it a turn yet, but I definitely see increased activity.",272

And to what extent does it -- is it sort of 4.5-, 5-year cycle time? And if the former, if it is Win 7-inspired, would you expect a sort of double whammy effects in terms of volume as demand?",55
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4318.0,166020.0,10413678.0,Answer,Rory Read,,Executives,19,"I think you highlight both of the actual key drivers. You can take a look at what comes out of the computer bags at the airport, at the security station. Some of those laptops in the corporate area are getting quite old, 4 and 5 years. That's at the outset of most normal corporate refresh cycles. So I think that's a key driver. I also think that while Vista was not a significant uptake in the commercial segments, we see a lot better corporate interest in Win 7. So I think you're spot-on in your identifying really the 2 key drivers. I think it is actually the longevity of this particular cycle, the length of time since the last one and Win 7 as opposed to Vista. Vista never got the interest at the corporate level in terms of refresh and XP is now quite long in the tooth. It's time. And I think as the economic environment improves, we'll have all 3 factors in place for that to increase. I don't expect it to be gangbusters, initially. I think it will build over the course of a 24- to 30-month refresh cycle. And we'll begin to see some of that activity in the second half.",206

So actually, we think that we strengthened our product competitively. We sell more high-end products. We sell more SNPs [ph] so that our AUR, average unit revenue, went up. So that helped us to increase our GP margin. So this is our objective. So no matter how fierce the competition will be, we want to improve our GP margin, improve our profitability, not only in China, but also worldwide. So we will further improve our product competitiveness. Meanwhile, we think to improve the profitability, we need to further innovate, not just our existing business but also we should find new opportunity to enter into the new business like Mobile Internet business.

We saw very rapid growth across the transaction space, and we outgrew the market substantially on a volume basis. Our business model and our relationship with our business partners are working very well and our business partners are giving us the feedback that they believe in Lenovo, they believe in our product set and the value they create for the customer. So I think we're seeing a very strong interest in our transaction model, the competitiveness of our products, and that's driving our 42% growth versus the market of 17%. We saw that in all regions and we saw that particularly strong in the Emerging Markets and driven by the transaction business model.",135

And with 18 months ago, we really moved from single-digits, a handful of countries, we've been expanding rapidly over the past 4 to 5 quarters. In the most recent quarter, as Gary mentioned, we increased by an additional 10 countries. But also equally important, we're increasing our product portfolio in all of the existing countries.

I think let's look at the sort of Emerging Market and Mature Market. I think year-to-year, we increased $1.2 billion turnover, 82% come out from Emerging Markets. I think the rest come out from Mature Market. And if you look at -- if you really break down between Idea and Think, year-to-year, it was an increase of $1.2 billion, nearly 70% come out from Idea, about 30% comes out from Think. And I just said that transactional and relationship business, more than 90%, 9-0, coming from transactions, the rest coming from relationship. Now looking at quarter-to-quarter, I think we increased turnover by about $690 million or $685 million, above 36% coming from Emerging Markets. And if you look at Think versus Idea, Idea, I think, account for about 40%, and you can actually see more sort of transaction business also coming from Think as well. I mean, don't just take Think as a commercial relationship business. And if you look at the [indiscernible] of transaction versus relationship, 75% quarter-to-quarter come out from transaction and the balance from relationship. And then you can see that, I think, our success closely tied with the successful increase in the transactional business at the Emerging Markets.",225

We should and we could further improve our SMB segment business in China, particularly in those matured cities. So in those matured cities, we need to further improve our business model. We should use more caution. We should use more Web sales to help us to improve the business in these area. But meanwhile, we should -- so we have a lot of opportunity, small city and small towns because there are many, many SMB business in those cities. So now we separate the cities, mature cities and emerging cities in China to adopt the different strategies to attack the SMB and the consumer business. So we believe these kind of actions will help.

The all-in-one areas, one good example of innovation that helped drive growth for us, the Idea product group implemented the all-in-one, now Think has come out of it as well. Our products are quite innovative, they're quite stylish. We've seen a very rapid uptake in that part of the desktop market. And in several segments, we've taken significant share position in the all-in-one segment. So that's been very encouraging. And we'll look to continue to expand that all-in-one percentage of across the Desktop segment. In terms of Desktop, we continue to see Desktop activity. I think that a number of our competitors have neglected the Desktop space. We continue to innovate and create new products to meet customer demand. And while that market is not growing as rapidly as notebook, we've been able to gather and gain a share. We've seen that in most Emerging Markets, and we've seen that across most key segments.",162

We will continue to drive hard on the expense side and continue to make our business model more and more competitive.

So we dominate this segment. And also I think we are very strong in consumer area. Now maybe the weakest area is SMB. As we mentioned, we have plenty of [ph] impact to strengthen this area. We want to sell more products to SMB, through call centers, through Web sales, online sales, so in mature cities. Meanwhile, for the small towns, we will fully leverage our business partners to build more storefronts to cover more SMB business as well as the consumer business. So I believe with this kind of strategy, we could further strengthen our leadership position in China.",117

We think that was -- we know that's driven by mix and improving economic environment. We've also seen the expansion in the netbook space as now kind of stabilizing out, and we are reaching kind of a normal level there. I expect that there will be ASP pressure as we move forward. That's an industry phenomena. But I think it's clearly moderating, and I think you'll see a period of more consistent or stable ASP trending and won't be anything significant out of the historical norms.",114
