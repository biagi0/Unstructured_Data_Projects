For those of you celebrating Chinese New Year, I wish you a happy and a prosperous year of the monkey, a year I believe will be full of energy and harvest for Lenovo.
Last quarter, although Lenovo, just like everyone else in our industry, was impacted by global macroeconomic slowdown, currency fluctuations and the PC market decline and our revenue declined year-on-year, but the decisive actions we quickly took in the second quarter enabled us to beat expectations on profit. We delivered record-high pretax income of USD 397 million, up 14% year-on-year, excluding M&A accounting charges. Our net income was USD 300 million, up 19% year-on-year. This was driven by solid performance by all 3 of our growth pillars.
Definitely, the mostly exciting thing last quarter was that our mobile business reached the operational breakeven. This means we delivered on our commitment to turn this business around within 4 to 6 quarters after our acquisition of Motorola. And we improved the pretax income margin by 7.2 points over the last quarter. This success was not only through our restructuring action but also through our strategic shift to focus on emerging markets outside of China, which has continued to pay off significantly. In Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, the emerging markets and Eastern Europe, we significantly outgrew the market in key emerging market countries like India, Indonesia and Russia. We outgrew the market year-on-year by our estimated 170, 310 and 22 points, respectively. And our shares are around double digits in India and Indonesia, 14% in Russia and 20% in Brazil.
In PCs, we again reached the record worldwide shares of 21.6%, up 1.5 points year-on-year, while maintaining stable margins. We saw strong share growth in North America, Asia Pacific and particularly in China where we have reached a record market share of 40%. And our tablets business achieved operational profitability as well.
In enterprise, after we acquired System x, we have consistently improved the top line every quarter. Last quarter, our revenue grew even faster at 12% over the previous quarter and 8% year-on-year. Our revenue growth in China was even stronger at 30% year-on-year. Operational profit increased every quarter. Pretax income reached 1.5% last quarter.
All these results indicated we are now in full attack mode in this business. We are now seeing the benefits of our strategic actions and are on schedule to realize $1.35 billion in full year run rate savings. Our cost structure is now competitive across all businesses. And based on that, we will continue to decisively and steadily execute our strategy.
In PCs, we will continue to leverage the consolidation trend to expand our leadership advantage. As Windows 10 is getting accepted by more commercial customers, there will be a wave of replacement demand this year. Innovation in detachables and convertibles will also generate more excitement in the purchasing decisions among users. We will fully leverage our innovation capability and efficiency to achieve our goal of 30% market share in PCs.
In mobile, we will play different games in different markets. In emerging markets, we will leverage scale and efficiency to accelerate growth and gradually improve the profitability. In mature markets, we will break through with innovative products and the premium brands and get our fair share in more profitable markets. In China, we will expand in open market and retail with a stronger product portfolio. Our goal is to pursue long-term profitable growth worldwide in mobile business.
In enterprise, we will strengthen our competitiveness through strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as Nutanix, SAP and others to achieve profitable growth. Meanwhile, we will continue to drive our business model transformations. We will transform our organizations and processes to become more customer-centric and to better address device plus cloud strategy.
Finally, we will continue to bring more innovative products to the market: our new ThinkPad X1 family, Yoga 900S notebook, Moto X Force smartphone, Moto 360 smart watch, et cetera; and we'll gain greater customer feedback once they were launched. At the CES, we announced the Project Tango with Google to develop the first mobile device with the breakthrough augmented reality technology. That product will be launched in summer. And there will be more exciting products to be launched soon.
Now let me turn you to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",726
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2989.0,926148.0,39475485.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing.
I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q3 fiscal year 2016. Next chart, please.
First, I will give you some highlights for the quarter 3 performance. Group revenue declined by 8% year-on-year to $12.9 billion. If we exclude the currency impact, group revenue was down by 2% year-on-year amidst the challenging markets. Group PTI achieved a record high of $397 million, if we exclude the noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $77 million, representing an increase of 14% year-on-year. Reported PTI was $320 million, up 17% year-on-year. Group net income was $300 million, increased by 19% year-on-year.
The improvement in our profitability in Q3 was a good demonstration of the solid execution of our strategy to protect our leadership and profit in PC and attack the mobile and enterprise businesses.
Contemplating the market environment will remain challenging in the near future, we have taken prompt and decisive actions to align our businesses and plan to achieve an annualized savings of $1.35 billion, as announced in last quarter. These restructuring actions are nearly completed and the effects have started to pay off, and some of them were reflected in Q3. We have realized a cost saving as planned in Q3, and we remain on track to achieve our savings target in the second half of this year and on a full year run rate basis. The restructuring actions, when completed, will help us to enhance our competitiveness with a faster, stronger and more efficient organization, together with our industry-leading cost structure, to drive future revenue and profit growth even in the current market environment. I will elaborate in more detail on our financial performance in the following charts. Next chart, please.
As I mentioned, the market environment remained challenging in Q3, and currency fluctuations also affected our group's revenue. Excluding currency impact, our Q3 group revenue would have down by 2% year-on-year. Gross profit decreased by 10% year-on-year to around $1.9 billion. And our gross margin recorded a slight decline year-on-year to 14.6%. Gross margin improved quarter-on-quarter, as we continue to improve our product mix and cross-scaling benefits.
Operating expenses decreased by $266 million and were down 15% year-on-year. Expense-to-revenue ratio was 11.7%, also down significantly by 0.9 points year-on-year. The improved efficiency was the result of our restructuring actions that have already started to show effect, bringing us a more efficient organization and leading cost structure across all our business groups. Other nonoperating expenses were $59 million, which were mainly financing costs. It's including fixed expenses from the notes we issue and included interest expense for the Motorola deal-related promissory notes.
Group reported PTI was $320 million, up 17% year-on-year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 8.2%, slightly higher than that of last year due to improved profitability of the 2 acquired businesses. Profit attributable to equity holders was $300 million, up 19% year-on-year. Basic earnings per share were USD 0.0271.
Next chart, please. There were no material changes in our balance sheet items, and the drive of the movement in our balance sheet is mainly due to seasonality. The noncurrent assets were about $11.6 billion, and current assets were about $15.2 billion as of 31st December 2015. During the quarter, we have repaid some of the short-term loans, which resulted in lower bank loan balance. We had net current liabilities of around $2.5 billion, and noncurrent liabilities were around $6.2 billion.
Next chart, please. Cash flow from operations performance remained solid in Q3 at $393 million, against $738 million same quarter last year and $909 million in quarter 2. Q3 operating cash flow was lower, as some of our restructuring expenses we accrue in Q2 were paid in Q3 as the realignment plan continued to progress. And we have been moving the manufacturing of Moto products to our Wuhan factory. As I mentioned above, we repaid some of the short-term loans in Q3, which resulted in lower cash position and borrowings quarter-on-quarter. We have a net debt of $49 million in Q3.
We continue to improve our working capital by driving both new businesses to adopt growth working capital discipline. Our cash conversion cycle for Q3 was negative 2 days, similar to that of last year and improved slightly compared to last quarter. Thus, our Q3 net cash position was also better against Q2.
Next chart, please. Our business remained solid across the board in Q3.
For PC business group, even though the market continued to show a decline, we continued to grow our market share in the consolidating market. We remained the #1 player in the worldwide market for the 11th consecutive quarter. We continued to outperform the market. Nevertheless, our PC revenue inevitably was affected by the slower-than-expected market and currency impact, which resulted to a decline of 12% year-on-year to $8 billion. Excluding the currency impact, revenue declined 6% year-on-year, which is in line with our shipment performance. Despite a tougher-than-expected PC market, we're still able to hold our PC margin at 5% level in Q3, driven by a leading industry position and cost efficiency. We expect our industry-leading cost structure has improved our competitiveness and will position us to drive growth in the PC business over time without a material impact on our margin even if the tough PC market environment continues.
For Enterprise Business Group. As Yuanqing mentioned, our enterprise business has been trending strong, and we have been delivering growth trend of revenue and profit in every quarter since we closed the System x deal last year. In Q3, enterprise business recorded year-on-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter as revenue increased 8% year-on-year to $1.3 billion. Our strong growth in China continued, up 30% year-on-year, driven by our attack in the high-growth hyperscale market. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we recorded operational profit before the noncash M&A accounting charges. And the margin continued to improve. With an improved cost structure after our restructuring actions, we are in an attack mode in the faster-growing enterprise areas while promising partnership with industry leaders, including Nutanix, Red Hat and SAP.
Mobility business group. As Yuanqing mentioned, we achieved a key milestone for our Mobile Business Group in Q3 by operational breakeven both in mobile and the Motorola businesses, as we committed when we closed the transaction a year ago. With the business realignment action taken in Q2, our mobile business began to regain momentum in Q3. Revenue was up 21% quarter-on-quarter to $3.2 billion in Q3, driven by our strong smartphone growth in markets outside China, especially in key emerging markets. New Motorola products launched, including the very innovative shatterproof Moto X Force smartphone, also added strength to the -- our mobile business performance in Q3. For tablet, we continue to launch new innovative products, including the ThinkPad X1 tablet. Our Q3 tablet shipments increased 4% quarter-on-quarter. Our mobile business has reached the break-even milestone if excluding the noncash M&A accounting charges. Our pretax margin was improved by about 7.2 points quarter-on-quarter from negative 8.1% to a negative 0.9%. We remain committed to our mobile business to drive this profitability over the next 12 months.
Next chart, please. Our solid performance was also seen across geography. I want to highlight that, as our business continues to get more diversified, the geo P&L will reflect a combination of our PC, enterprise and mobility businesses. Its financial performance will be driven by the change in the mix and the seasonality of the different business in each of the geography, but China will remain a very strong #1 position in China PC market despite challenges while holding up the margin. Enterprise business revenue grew 30% year-on-year, driven by the capture of the hyperscale opportunities. For smartphone business, we now have a much healthier inventory position after our clearance efforts. Consolidation in smartphone has started, and we will leverage this by strengthening our open-channel partnership while maintaining the telco relationship. At the same time, we will focus on product mix improvement and leverage on our dual-brand strategy. With a new leadership team and refreshed strategy, we will remain focused on driving profitable growth of China's smartphones business over time. Revenue was down 14% year-on-year to $3.5 billion, resulting in our China PTI at $167 million. And operating margin was 4.7%, a decline of 1 percentage point year-on-year and improvement on 0.6 points quarter-on-quarter.
For Asia Pacific, our attacking strategy in PC worked effectively in Q3 in the region. We continued to grow PC shipments and achieved a strong premium growth, with continuous share gain in the region especially in key countries such as India. Our smartphone business also achieved strong growth, including India and Indonesia. For enterprise, we continued to record growth with improved profitability. Revenue grew 15% year-on-year, with PTI at $19 million and PTI margin at 1%. The year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter decline in margin was mainly due to significant market decline -- macro challenges and the currency impact.
For EMEA, the PC market in the region were affected by challenging macro environment and currency fluctuations and remained our #2 position in the market. Smartphone business achieved strong growth in this region, driven by substantial year-on-year growth of both Lenovo- and Motorola-branded phones. Revenue declined by 13% year-on-year. And profit before taxation was $57 million, and operating margin was 1.7%. The margin decline was mainly due to the tougher market environment and the foreign currency impact.
Americas. Our PC unit in North America remained strong, leading to a 16-point premium growth and share gain of the overall American region. For the mobile side, we significantly improved our smartphone business across the region in the quarter, especially in North America, driven by new products Moto launched. And we continued to stabilize our enterprise business in the region. American revenue was up 9% quarter-on-quarter and declined 7% year-on-year. We turned around our American business with $76 million pretax income and 1.9% PTI margin, thanks to the continuous profitability in Brazil and MBG cost structure improvement.
Next chart, please. As Yuanqing mentioned, we have largely completed our business realignment and restructuring actions. In Q3, we realized $346 million of savings. And we are on track to delivering our saving targets, which was $650 million in the second half of this fiscal year; and target full year run rate saving of $1.35 billion. Looking forward, even the markets we are in will remain challenging under current macroeconomic situation, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities across our businesses. And Lenovo is poised to capture those opportunity to drive future growth with our clear strategy and solid execution.
For PC, the traditional PC market will likely continue to be tough, impacted by the macro weakness in the short term. Nevertheless, our #1 market position and our further-enhanced cost structure will help us to accelerate share gains under the continuous industry consolidation trend. Even further, the evolution of the board of form factors such as detachable, convertible and 2-in-1 will continue to bring growing opportunities to the expanded PC market. We have recently launched a number of new innovative products, including IdeaPad Miix 700, Yoga 900S notebook, ThinkPad X1 Yoga, will well-position us to capture this opportunity.
For mobile, we now have a more efficient cost structure and a clear business strategy to drive sustainable growth. With a solid foundation built in Q3, we will continue to execute our growth strategy in emerging markets outside China and build our capability in both the mature markets and China. We are confident that we can continue to improve our mobility business by both increasing our top line while maintaining our profitability in the next 12 months.
For enterprise, with our strength in China and emerging markets, we will continue to attack in the solid growth, on one hand, in the traditional IT market with better technologies, great product portfolio and the right cost structure leveraging both System x and Lenovo's efficiency. On the other hand, we will also move into faster-growing opportunities through strategic partnership established with the leaders in the areas to drive growth.
We finished our quarter successfully, achieving a record profit while executing a significant restructuring. Although the market environment remains volatile and challenging in the short term, we remain confident that the solid quarter 3 result has provided the foundation for us to drive a balance between growth and profitability over time.

For the full year, yes, for the full year. So because Q1, calendar Q1, is always the lowest of the season, it's always the lowest sales and volume, so definitely. So we cannot guarantee this quarter we can make money. But I believe, if we can have enough volume like last quarter, Q3, our fiscal quarter, so we have good chance to make money. So actually, after our restructuring -- so let me give you the number. After we restructure, in Q3, fiscal Q3, our MBG E-to-R ratio reduced to just 14%. So second half last year, last fiscal year, was almost 20%. So Q1 was 25%. Q2 was 18.6%. So that's -- so if we can have the similar revenue or volume, so definitely we can further improve our efficiency. So that's what we can see.",140

I think what I'm guessing is right. I think the MBG, our mobility business, can have around 60% of the savings; about 10% coming out from our enterprise; and about 30% coming out from our PC. So I think, in addition to what Yuanqing said, that I think, PC, we saw one of the biggest decline in one of -- normally one of the highest season or highest quarter that we ever saw [ph] , which is about 10%, 11%. And therefore, unless the market is going to go even further down, otherwise, I think the actions that we took actually give us, I think, sufficient headroom or definitely the best expenses-to-revenue ratio from an efficiency point of view, I think, to be able to compete and then be able to win in the markets. And I would want to also, I think, highlight the point that I think -- even in a very difficult market with the market declining 11%, I think we'll still be holding our margin at around 5% level, which is obviously I think the best-in-class.",189

I think the revenue impact obviously is big. I think, from a constant currency point of view, we are probably, for this, say that constant currency from a conversion perspective, I think, is about 6% or 7%, make it a delta. So asking about the operations, we have all along a, I think, hedging policy, I think, to hedge, I think, the cost of our materials, I think, on a going-forward perspective. And therefore, I think, for the short-term fluctuation, obviously our margin is well protected. And then I think, longer term, I think, if the currency remain low, we obviously need to reprice our product so that we can able to, I think, maintain our overall margin. But inevitably, I think, when you actually raise price because, when the currency depreciates, the cost of material going up, I think there may be some impact on the demand, which as a result we can see that the decline in overall market. Just you -- just also to give you a sense of how the currency impacts on our profits: Because generally, I think, on the top 10 markets, I think that some of those, I think, obviously have double digits, like -- for example, like Latin America, like Argentina, I think, year-to-year, it's definitely drop by nearly, I think, about 15%. And Russia, I think, and emerging markets are now 30%. And even in the mature markets, you are really talking about a decreasing view about 12%. I think, just thinking about the top 10 markets, I think, just on the translation, assuming that we make the same local currency profits, it'll have about over $40 million PTI impact on our result. And I think that is that I think we actually have to work much harder in order to maintain the level of profitability. So I think that is really the achievement that we did. And I also would want to add the point that I think, in quarter 3, we actually undergo a major, I think, restructuring and realignment. That itself is actually a complicated exercise. And with that, we'll also be able to achieve, especially in the PC, 5%. And we'll have further power [ph] as a result. And we believe that, after the restructuring, we have the best cost structure to go forward and be able to win or continue to win in the market.",406

So first, from a China perspective, we're -- we've been very successful in the Chinese market. We grew it 30% on a year-over-year basis. And we had significant wins in the hyperscale space with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. But what I'm excited about, if we look at from some of Wai Ming and YY's charts, is we're growing quarter-over-quarter every quarter and dramatically increasing revenue. And we have a very aggressive cost structure as well, and so we're extremely well positioned to win. And we're #1 in the market share position in China as well. Now obviously, over a period of time, if you look at the IDC forecast, it's going to -- it's the fastest-growing market in the world and will continue to be from an infrastructure perspective going forward. On the Nutanix piece, which I am personally very heavily engaged with, we're really excited by the opportunities. We've just -- we announced the appliances in December. We actually officially launched them and, well, actually last week. And we're excited with a number of go-to-market opportunities we have working with Nutanix with -- on prospective customers, as well as we're doing tremendous amount of media as well as digital marketing-type of hits. This has been -- actually, it's Nutanix' best-ever webinar they've ever done. They announced it and it just came out last week. So we're very bullish on hyperconverged. And we're very bullish on our partnership with Nutanix.",242

Thanks for providing the market share numbers. So it's becoming obvious Lenovo is becoming a major player across a few countries with over 10% market share. And if I remember correctly, previous strategy was to ensure profitability once the market share get to a level. So could you share your margin performance perhaps by region, by market so we could get a better idea?",72

So in markets where we actually have, I think, doing great, I think this is really primarily coming out from rest of the world emerging markets. I think we've been growing at a significant premium, I think, in country like India with over 150% upfront premium and Indonesia, Russia. So I think we will continue to execute that. And those businesses are profitable -- not usually profitable, but that is the place where we are going to. Since Q3, we already reached on a cash flow basis. I think, if you were to take out the accounting charges, I think the entire MBG is actually recording a small profit. So on that basis, I think we will continue to grow our market share in those countries -- mostly in the rest of the emerging markets. And again on the other side, we will continue to build up our capabilities, primarily in terms of product as well as distribution channel, I think, in mature markets; as well as slightly building up our business again in China.",213

So Jenny, so I think -- so why we can break even last quarter up, so it's mainly -- it's not just because of our cost-cutting action. It's also because of our strategic shift from China to rest of emerging markets. So actually, we grow significantly in rest of emerging markets up, so including maybe softening [ph] Asia Pacific, emerging markets, Eastern Europe. So we really have reached a very different market share in India, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, et cetera. So actually, that give us a lot of momentum [ph] . So general speaking, so we have much better profit in those markets than in China, so -- yes, so in China, we still are lose money, I think. The emerging markets, we can make money. And also, we make money in North America. So don't worry. We -- that help us to break even. So actually, so over time, so we still are [indiscernible] there's a lot of business between emerging market and the mature markets and because, in those 2 markets, they are different again. So in emerging markets, if you want to make money, you must have 2 elements. The first thing, you must have enough scale, so that means you must get enough market share on the sale -- or enough volume. The second important element is you must be efficient. Even having now -- even with enough scale, if you are not efficient, so it's harder for you to make money. So that's why, for those premium brands, so it's not easy for them to win in emerging markets, emerging, but this is definitely a Lenovo service again. So in PC, so we have remained a lot smart, so how to make money, how to win in that space. But the mature markets, it's different again. There's -- firstly, it's a much larger profit than emerging markets, but if you want to share the -- that profit, you must have another 2 things. The first piece is you must have very innovative products. Then secondly, you must build a very strong premium brand. So with these 2 reasons, you can have an opportunity to share the profit. So definitely now, we have a bigger presence in North America. So this year, so we are preparing to break through in North America, another mature market as well, with both innovative products like our Tango project with Google. Definitely, we have more exciting products coming. Second thing is we are preparing to invest more on the branding, on the marketing, so to build on our premium brand in mature market as well. So that will be our current plans to win in the entire smartphone market definitely. It doesn't mean we will give up with our China market. China market actually is a mixed market, so we're not directly impacted. It's definitely emerging market. So we feel either we show that emerging market approach. But meanwhile, so on the premium product, it's big market as well, so definitely, we will not ignore that. So but I think with a stronger positioning outside of China, so that will be a headwind to win in China as well over time. So now we have -- so we just announced the stronger leadership team in China. So our MBG leader, Chen Xudong, will be the acting leader for our China smartphone business. Meanwhile, we have already launched the more compatible product, so -- but definitely, we now have that. We have even stronger product portfolio. So we are ready to turn around our China business as well, all right? So that's our own mobile or smartphone business strategy.",609

Can you add maybe more color about the cost savings about USD 346 million in the December quarter? Should we assume that the benefit from cost savings will directly fall through the bottom line? And how do we reconcile these cost savings of USD 346 million with the reported PTI of 6 -- USD 320 million?,64

Now as you can see, the market actually sort of declined by 10%. And if you really just, I think, taking the expenses unchanged, I think no one in that situation would be able to maintain profits. And therefore, I think the profits or the expenses they are taking out obviously contribute to one of the reasons why we were able to maintain, I think, our overall profitability, which is at 5%. Secondly, I think that taking out expenses also enable us to grow our business better than the market. We obviously report a decline, but if you really compare with the market, we are still looking at doing better around 6%, 7% premium to the market. So I think we are operating in a market which has obviously declined on a simple PC form factor, but if you want to take in other form factor, obviously, I think the decline is much smaller. And for us, to taking out expenses, that is one of the ways for us to maintain our overall profitability with a decline like this, but at the same time, we also have been, I think, spending money in our R&D, I think, to have a lean operating product expenditure, especially in the sort of, I think, 2-in-1 which obviously we've taken in a segment which is growing. And we definitely will take advantage of that going forward.",290

I think that's really number one. I think, EMEA, for the last few quarters, the market actually had relatively high channel inventory, which is a general market statement. And we obviously -- I think, bearing in mind how to do a healthy business, we actually take very aggressive actions layering channel inventory. I think, for us, I think we feel very comfortable about the level of channel inventory as of today, exactly bring now -- and it's actually come down quite a lot, quite a bit, I think, in Q3.

Yes, so as you know, so we took action to reduce the expense and the cost. So that definitely had to put us in a competitive situation in the industry. So as I just introduced, so now our E-to-R ratio is just around 14%, 15% high, so that's almost a 5% drop compared to the same period last year, so -- and also, so we are confident we were -- we resumed the growth. So that will ensure us so we have enough scale and we have enough room so to be profitable. So that's the reason why we think we can try to win in our mobile business, definitely. So where we -- so it's relying on our strategy as well, and justifying the expense. We dreamt to grow in rest of emerging markets, so where you can see the results last quarter. We grow faster in Middle East, Africa, in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, in Eastern Europe. So I think even in Latin America we will resume the growth as well. And we will become very definitely in those markets, so that means we will own more than 10% market share, so -- and also. So this is still the growth market in the smartphone area. So that's the first spot. And the second is we will try to break through in mature markets. Those -- that means that we want to share the profit pool in the mature market as well, so with more attractive product and with more strong brand. So that's what our strategy. And also, I think now our China business has already hit bottom, so from now, you will see the growth quarter-over-quarter. So that's the confidence we'll -- so why we can be profitable.",296

Thank you for joining me today. So I will cover our performance and then discuss our future strategy. 
Last quarter is quite a challenging economy and industry conditions. We protected our profit. While revenue declined, pretax income was up 86% year-on-year and the net income was up 80% 
Our PC business remains strong. We gained almost a point of share year-on-year and kept the PTI margin at more than 5%. When you combine PCs and tablets, we are now tied for #1 in worldwide market share. 
In our data center business, we improved operational profit margin by almost 2 points year-on-year and remained #1 in China, with almost 21% market share and 8% revenue growth year-over-year. 
In mobile, we outgrow the market in Asia Pacific and EMEA and maintained a strong position in Latin America. Our volume dropped to 85% in China due to shifting from carrier market to the open market. 
For the fiscal year, our revenue was almost USD 45 billion, down 3% year-on-year, but up 3% year-on-year if we are excluding currency impact. The decisive actions we took midyear significantly improved our profitability. 
Our PTI in the second half of the fiscal year improved 116% versus the first half and 22% year-on-year. Our PC business continues to be strong in the last fiscal year, achieving record market share of 21%. We outperformed the market by almost 6 points while maintaining strong PTI margin at 5%. 
In Enterprise, our DC -- data center business, our revenue was up 73% year-on-year, led by strong growth in China, and operational PTI keeps improving and totaled USD 53 million for the fiscal year. 
In mobile, our smartphone volume grew over 60% year-on-year outside of China, with strong positions in key markets like in Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEA. While these are bright spots, we recognized we have challenges beyond the macro economy or industry situation. 
Operationally, our China smartphone business declined significantly as we shifted focus to open market and high price band. Our smartphone product that transitioned in North America was not successful. 
In data center business, while we achieved great results in China and emerging markets, we need to align our sales model and aggressively grow our top line in U.S. and other mature markets. These are definitely the focus areas for me and for our leadership team. We will stay fully committed to our mobile and the data center businesses for the long term. 
We have taken a number of actions to address these challenges proactively. I believe what you are most concerned about is how we will get our mobile business back to growth. Frankly speaking, in the past 18 months, our progress and the results in model integration did not meet our own expectation. We are still in a learning stage, but we believe in our ability to learn and to apply the learnings to actions. Moto and Lenovo have solid products and technology foundation. We have built global markets and channel coverage. We have a strong talent pool and now we have stronger leaders to more decisively execute our strategy, thoroughly integrate our organization, quickly streamline product lines and strengthen product competitiveness. 
Recognizing how different China and Rest of World markets are, we now have Aymar and Xudong as co-presidents to dedicate our Rest of World and China, respectively. 
In Rest of World, while keeping high growth in emerging markets, we will focus on getting U.S. business back on track. In U.S., we will invest in our brand, broaden our channels and at the same time, launch more innovative products to gain market and improve profitability. 
In China, we will keep driving the strategic shift from carriers to open market and leverage ZUK model to rebuild our end-to-end competitiveness. With all these actions, I'm confident that we will get these things back to profitable growth. 
To better manage and grow these diversified businesses, we are changing our management system and adopting a multi-business operating system to give different authority to different businesses. Some businesses will be 100% owned by Lenovo, while some could receive external investment. Some will leverage the global platform more while some will be built more independently. Some will be focusing on profit and some will be focusing on growth. I believe we will better unleash the productivity and the creativity of each business by adopting this new operating system. 
The new structure and operating system will enable us to attack the opportunities in Device + Cloud. We used to be a device company and then become a Device Primary and Cloud Secondary company. As we are heading towards age of Internet of Things, everything around us can have computing, storage, networking, modules, buildings, while protecting our general-purposed device business, we will develop more specific purpose of the devices based on customer's needs in different scenarios, at home, at work or on-the-go. 
Lenovo has a unique advantage in integrating our traditional strength in end-user devices with our new capabilities in cloud and in infrastructure to meet customer needs for our balanced Device + Cloud model. This is where Lenovo will attack and grow. 
We will showcase our innovative products and technology that best illustrate this vision at Lenovo Tech World on June 9 in Silicon Valley, so please stay tuned. 
Last year was tough. And in the short term, we will likely continue to face the challenges, but we believe we have the vision, the strategy and the strong execution. And we remain confident that the actions that we are taking will bring us the growth that we are aiming for, starting from current quarter. 
Thank you. Now let me turn this to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",951

Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through the Lenovo financials and operational performance in our quarter 4 and the fiscal year 2016. 
Next chart, please. First, let us look at our fiscal year highlights. We reported group revenue of $44.9 billion, down 3% year-on-year, plus 3% if it is restated in constant currency. Facing currency depreciation, a slower recovery in the PC market and hypercompetitive smartphone industry, we have taken prompt actions to realign our businesses against these challenges as we announced in the middle of the year. The improvement in our profitability in the second half of this fiscal year has clearly demonstrated the result of our commitment to maintain a competitive expense structure. We have achieved more than our planned savings in the second half with around 3,600 headcount reduction, and we are on track to achieve our full year run rate savings target. However, the expense -- despite the expense reduction efforts, the depth -- the decline in the market resulted in a much weaker than expected E/R ratio. 
Next slide, please. For fiscal '16, revenue was down 3% year-on-year. However, gross profit reduced by 1% only due to the improvement in gross profit margin to 14.8%. The year-to-year improvement in gross profit margin is driven by a favorable shift of our revenue mix to data center and mobility business. Operating expenses increased by 20% year-on-year to $6.7 billion due to the inclusion of the full year of the Moto and the System x results. Excluding restructuring cost and onetime charges reported in our fiscal year quarter 2, total expenses were approximately $5.9 billion, increased by 6% year-on-year. 
Net nonoperating expenses increased by 36% year-on-year to $230 million. The increase mainly represent interest expenses in respect of the USD 1.5 billion and RMB 4 billion bonds that were issued as far as the included interest expense from the Google promissory notes. We recorded a net tax credit for the fiscal year, largely from the tax benefits associated with the 2 acquired businesses. 
Loss attributable to equity holders was $128 million. However, if we exclude the restructuring cost and onetime items and the noncash M&A-related accounting charges, our run rate pretax income was $976 million, down 14% compared to the year before. Please refer to the Appendix for the details. 
Turning into quarter 4. The market environment remained challenging. Revenue was $9.1 billion, down 19% year-on-year or down 16% if restated in constant currency. Gross profit down 15% year-on-year to 1.5 billion, largely due to the revenue decline, while gross margin increased by 0.9 -- 0.09 points year-on-year to 16.6%. Gross margin improvement is primarily driven by our reductions of [indiscernible] doing the low-end smartphones business in China. 
Operating profit increased 95% year-on-year to $248 million as a result of our business realignment and restructuring actions. Other nonoperating expenses were $55 million. Excluding the noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $77 million, pretax income was $270 million for the quarter, up 37% year-on-year. 
Reported pretax income was $193 million and reported profit attributable to equity holders was $180 million. Basic loss per share for the year was USD 0.0116 compared to earnings of USD 0.0777 last year. 
The board decided in this meeting today to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.205 per share. So together with the 0.06 we already paid as interim dividend, total dividend for the year is 0.265, remain the same compared to the year before. 
Next slide, please. The change in our balance sheet mainly reflects our business activities during the fiscal year. Noncurrent assets were $12 billion and current assets of $13 billion. The major change year-on-year was from the decrease in the trade and the OEM receivables as a result of slower business activities and efforts to reduce aged receivables. Net current liability is $2.8 billion. Similarly, the year-on-year change was mainly due to the decline in our business activities. The noncurrent liabilities was $6.1 billion. 
We have started actions to monetize certain of our noncore assets. Coupled with an increasing focus on further improving the management of our working capital, those actions will continue to improve our financial position. 
Next slide, please. Cash flow from operation at the end of fiscal year '16 was $292 million against 232 -- $238 million the year before. Decreasing bank deposits and cash was mainly due to the payment of the restructuring expenses in our second half and interest expenses for the bond and the promissory notes. We have a net debt of around $1.2 billion at the end of the fiscal year '16. We'll continue to drive improvement in our balance sheet by reducing the working capital requirements and rearranging part of our short-term borrowings into long-term facilities. We'll continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. 
In quarter 4, we improved from a positive 3 days last year to 0 day this year. Though for the full year, it dipped slightly from the negative 2 days last year to positive 1 day this year. 
Next slide, please. While our PC business growth will continue to grow our PC market share to record high of 21% further solidifying our #1 position in the expanded PC market, which include PC, slate tablet and detachable, Lenovo returned to our #1 position in the fiscal quarter 4. 
Among the regions, North America achieved a remarkable 19% year-on-year growth in unit in quarter 4 with record high market share. However, the contraction of the PC market and the weaker currency conditions continue to put pressure on our revenue. Full year revenue was $29.6 billion, down 11% year-on-year, or down 6% in constant currency. Pretax income was $1.5 billion, maintaining a solid margin at about 5%. 
For our Enterprise Business Group, revenue increased 73% year-on-year to $4.6 billion. We achieved operational profitability with margin improvement for 6 consecutive quarters since the close of the System x acquisition. 
Our business in China remains strong with 76% year-on-year revenue growth, driven by our success in the hyperscale business. On the other hand, we are still optimizing our sales model to accelerate top line growth in mature markets. For quarter 4, revenue declined due to longer pipeline conversion and some deals delaying into quarter 1. 
This year, we recorded an operational profit before the noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $53 million with a margin of 1.2%, improving from a loss of $29 million and a negative 1.1% margin last fiscal year. 
For the Mobility business, revenue increased 10% year-on-year to $9.8 billion. We recorded an operational loss before the noncash M&A charges of $469 million, due to softer market growth and hybrid competition, we saw mixed result in our smartphone business across geographies as Yuanqing has just discussed in detail. 
With regained leadership -- with realigned leadership team and strategy. We are committed to bring this business into profitable growth. 
Next slide, please. So looking at China. Revenue was $12.4 billion, down 16% year-on-year and profit down 29% year-on-year. Overall margin in China was down 0.8 percentage points year-on-year to 4.6%. The margin deterioration was mainly resulted from a strategic shift of our China smartphone business towards open market and rebuild our end-to-end competitiveness. 
PC business continue to perform well. PC market share improved to 36.5% with stable margin. Enterprise business continued to maintain a strong position in the market with solid revenue growth. 
Asia Pacific. Revenue up 9% year-on-year to $7.2 billion in Asia -- in the region. The growth was mainly supported by strong smartphone shipments, especially in the ASEAN countries and India. Operating margin declined by 3.4 points year-on-year to 1.2%, mainly due to the significant weakness in the PC market as well as currency situation in Japan as well -- Japan and in other emerging market countries. 
EMEA. Revenue down 8% year-on-year to $11.8 billion and operating margin declined by 2.1 points year-on-year to 1.1%. Similar to Asia Pacific, decline mainly is a reflection of the severe market softness and currency depreciation. Despite these challenges, our PC business continued to gain share and achieved record high market share. In smartphone, we recorded strong growth in the EMEA, driven by momentum of the emerging market regions from Eastern Europe as well as from the MEA region. 
Americas. The revenue was up 11% year-on-year to $13.6 billion, owing to the strong PC shipment during the year. We continue to deliver solid growth in the PC business in North America and achieving record high market share while our profitability in Brazil continued to improve. On the other hand, our smartphone business suffer from the slower than expected product transition, which contributed to the operating loss. Enterprise revenue declined year-to-year due to slower acquisition of new customers. More focus will be devoted to do up sales coverage and leverage on new partnership to drive growth opportunities. 
Looking ahead, even though the market we are in remain challenging under the current economic environment as far as the industry conditions, we are actively taking actions to improve each of our business units. In the short term, we see PC industry as being relatively soft but growth opportunities from new form factors in the second half of this fiscal year will definitely help the market perform better. With our competitive cost structure, we will continue to take advantage of consolidation and attack growth areas in the expanded PC market. We target to outperform the market while maintaining our margin performance. 
For our Mobility business, we have taken -- we have actions in place to get our Mobility business back to growth. In markets outside China, we will focus on affordable premium products and invest in select key countries. In China, we will leverage our ZUK brand to rebuild our end-to-end foundation and keep driving the strategic shift from the carriers to open market. 
For Enterprise business, we have in place a focused management team and continue to view our end-to-end capabilities, and this group will be renamed as the Data Center Group in the new fiscal year. We will attack the top line growth across all geos, and we will adopt a new partnership approach with the best-in-class partner like SAP, Nutanix, Red Hat and Juniper to open up new top line revenue opportunities. We are confident to grow faster than the market with improving margin. 
While the market remains challenging in the short term, we will continue to examine further actions needed to improve profitability. We have action in place to drive sustainable growth and profit improvement, although these actions will take time to see results. Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in area we believe are important to our future successes. We are confident that Lenovo can outperform the industry to drive profitable growth and hence, increase shareholders' return over time. Thank you.",1795

I remember in last results, Yuanqing, talk about the Mobility Business Group's financial target is now aiming for breakeven for the fiscal year. And I think, in December quarter, we had about $20 million kind of [indiscernible] that helped Lenovo to reach around breakeven level. So I'm wondering whether there is any adjustment in terms of how we should look at this business, mainly in terms of breakeven point and financial target. Are we sticking with a breakeven kind of a fiscal year target? And is the breakeven level going to be lower after any kind of adjustments?",102

So we lost $60 million in smartphone business with much lower volume. So while the volume was lower -- so I think 3 reasons. The first is definitely the lower season, so -- compared to the Q3. The second is, so our volume in China significantly dropped because we almost shut down all the operators business, so -- in the low end. So we are very determined that we will shift from the carrier market to the open market and online market. So that's the key reason for the volume drop. But definitely this is good for the AUR, average unit revenue, or price. So that's -- and also, it will improve the GP margin as well over time. The third thing is in North America and Latin America, because of the product transition issue price. Actually, we didn't perform very well last quarter. I think that's the key 3 reasons, definitely. So I think this business -- mobile business, so the integration of the Moto and the Lenovo product -- organization and the product are still in the beginning stage, so we are still learning something there. So I think -- so in this business, probably we still needed to invest for a couple of quarters to make this business as a profitable gross [ph] business. So Aymar, you want to add something on it?",240

There is a lot of work that we have to continue to do to better align our respective businesses, in particular, between our Lenovo branded phones and the Motorola branded phones. We have good assets that Yuanqing mentioned in terms of geographical footprint. And it's a matter of how fast we can reorganize our internal operations and then accelerate in the markets that we are strong in, like Brazil, as an example. So on that, I'll leave -- I have nothing to add to what Yuanqing said.",95

The question should be there, does it still take $20 million a quarter to reach that breakeven point? And previously, I think we've been continually being informed expending oversea sales is actually very helpful compared with domestic Chinese sales. So is that still the case? And how is the priority between China and the overseas business?",63

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3053.0,993502.0,41992594.0,Answer,Aymar De Lencquesaing,,Executives,9,"So, yes, the first thing, I mean, obviously, I can't really speak that much for China, because it's not in my scope. But even having said that, look, we have 3 geographies. We split the world in 5: 3 geographies were we're doing relatively well. It's Latin America, it's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. In all of those regions, we're not particularly dependent on any 1 country, and we have market shares ranging sometimes from 5% to as high as over 20%. So we sort of demonstrate that it can be done under either brand, by the way. So if anything, I would say that the organization needs to maybe focus on some of those regions a bit more than we have in the past, while paying attention to the other 2 markets, which are the Chinese market, where we have a massive shift from having been operator-focused to now being open-market focused, and we have to manage that transition. And in North America as well, we want to change the product mix, as well as diversify the customer base. And so we're in the midst of that transition. A lot of it being driven by product, and we need to streamline the portfolio very clearly between the 2 brands, and that will help us achieve better economies of scale and therefore, improve profitability. So I'd say that we have a lot of homework to do still, but the opportunity is clearly in front of us.",248

So given now the base has been very low, so definitely I think that we have opportunity to drive the growth. But driving the growth definitely we need some investment in branding in China, our expansion and definitely in the product. So actually -- fortunately, so we -- so last year, we established a new company called ZUK. So this is more customer engaged business model, so we want to fully leverage this business to grow our China business over time. So definitely that still can leverage our worldwide product, the portfolio to sell in China with the Motorola, with the Lenovo brand, but I think the U.K. team is the foundation. So we want to build a company with a different end-to-end business model. So we -- last month, we launched the new ZUK Z2 product. I think it has attracted a lot of attention in the market. So we think so leveraging this product and this business model, so we can grow our China business, but in short period, probably in the next fiscal year is still in the investment stage in China. So we -- but probably 1 year later we can drive the profitable growth there.",206

Two questions. First, going to the basic, back to the PC business 2/3 of your revenue, and what we observed so far is you had higher market share, but at the same time, lower sales due to shrinking PC market. I remember at some point, you mentioned about a market share gain target from 20% to 30%. Can we seen more aggressive steps to achieve that? So can you give some update how you're going to get that? And how fast can you get to that 30%? That's very important in order to drive growth. That's number one. And second is on the smartphone business. I think this is the start of a new fiscal year. Last year, 66 million smartphone shipment. Can you give us some guidance for this year, how much you are targeting for this year?",145
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3053.0,993502.0,41992598.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,13,"Yes. On PC, I think that we're always very, very careful to balance market share growth and PTI. If you see last year, we have been growing share in the range of 1.5%, still keeping 5% PTI. One thing that we see that the consolidation process is probably speeding up. So we see even a bigger number of players in the process to leave or already left. So I think, this year, for sure, we can be more aggressive than before in terms of gaining share. But still said with a good balance between growing share and PTI without compromising the profitability. I think that talking about 30% is still in the range of 2 to 3 years, the possibility to go up to 30%. No doubt. We're also working on 2-in-1s, for example, we just announced the X1 tablet a few months ago. We are going to announce new product in that category in the next couple of months. So we're also looking at some new segment in order to speed up the growth.",175

For the year ending in March, correct? Yes. So I think the guidance is that it's probably not going to be substantially different from what you had last year. You said 66 million the year before, and it's probably not going to be substantially different from that number. With a different mix, yes.",61

So I think Gianfranco is very confident, so we can keep at least the 5 to 10 points of premium to the market. So hopefully, the market would not decline more than 5% to 10%, so that we can still keep the positive growth so in a fiscal year. Smartphone. So definitely, so we will try to drive the growth. I think, we have good share in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific. So we are growing fast and we will keep the growth pace [ph]. In Latin America, we have good foundation, good position. So we will -- we should fully leverage that. So last year we had 20% market share in Brazil, but in rest of the Latin America, we still have the room to grow. I think in China, so our situation would not be worse than last quarter. So that's, of course, varies [ph] so now definitely smartphone market is becoming more saturated or mature. But I think, Lenovo could become stronger in this kind of market. So actually, you see our PC business, so we grow this business, we -- in the similar situation -- in a similar market environment, so we grow from a local company, Chinese local company to a global company from The Street, 4% market share to more than 200% market share just in past 7, 8 years. So very saturated and a mature market. But now it's still a very decent business for us. So 30 billion [ph] with a 5% PTI. So it's pretty good business, because we know how to balance the innovation and the efficiency. So I think we have the opportunity to replicate our success in the smartphone area as well. So I think in this environment it probably is more appropriate for that now, so that's my thinking. But definitely now we need to fix 2 biggest markets, China and the U.S. So that's the key. So I talked about China. So we will leverage our ZUK brand to address the open market and online market. So meanwhile, definitely we can leverage our global portfolio to sell Moto and other Lenovo phones in U.S. and other mature markets. So we wish we could breakthrough with innovation -- with innovative products. So we will launch our very innovative product next month in our Lenovo Tech World in Silicon Valley. So hopefully, you can pay attention to that.",407

So one question, I think, one major concern stock market currently is whether because of your loss-making smartphone business, whether you need to write off part of the good will in your Moto asset? So I think maybe it is the -- I'm not sure why we're making comment. So in what situation so this may trigger for accounting wise, this may happen to write off part of your good will? And another thing is -- I think linked is that if we can maintain the current scale like 66 million, do you think we can this year can roughly could make breakeven in this smartphone business as a standalone? Or this may -- we are still in investment phases need to fix something?",133

I think, we actually have a plan that really, I think, would help. You can see how to address the market. I think based on the plan that we're going to execute, I think we probably will not run the risk of -- I think, writing off goodwill. I think that's number one. Number two, I think that when you look at the smartphone business, I just really want to put the perspective how Lenovo look in the smartphone business. China, we are really, I think, shifting our strategy from operator to the open market. And therefore, I think, it's not just the volume that you're looking at. I think we're actually taking actions to build a more solid foundation so that when we're going forward, I think, will be a sustainable profitable growth. I think, likewise, as Aymar said, I think we are also, I think have a very clear strategy as advised or as really was advised by McKinsey what they actually do an event and look at it. We actually have very clear go-to-market strategy, which particular market we are investing in, and we will definitely will continue to grow the business, but obviously, I think, from an investment point of view, I think we are looking at this as the transition state where we will invest to build a more solid foundation. So I would say that based on even today, I think, you would not be surprised when McKinsey look in the numbers, they take into consideration how we perform today. I think even based on today's, I think, financial performance plus the actions as far as the strategic direction for us to enable to do build a healthier business, I think, there is at this point in time, the risk of writing off goodwill is not significant.",319

So I think in short term, so we still need to invest in our smartphone business to build the foundation, because I don't think our smartphone business foundation is as strong as our PC business. So we need to build the brand. We need to expand the channel networks. We need to invest in the product portfolio. So I think this shouldn't be the concept, because if you don't invest to build the foundation you will not have a future. So probably it's not that difficult if we only focus on the profitability. So probably we can do that. We can do that. So -- but probably we will not have the future. We will not have the future. So I think now we are still very committed to our smartphone business. And also, as I said before, I'm very confident so we can win in this industry over time, even though it has become a saturated, matured industry. So even -- so in this situation, we think Lenovo could become an even stronger player. But we need to invest in the foundation, building, branding, product, channels, particularly in China and the U.S., these 2, the most important markets.",200

So I think -- so in the past, we just focused on the general-purpose devices. So like PC and smartphone, they're general-purpose devices, but they're definitely not. So it's a device class cloud model -- business model, but for Lenovo is device primary and called the secondary. So I actually I placed the similar model. So but in the future, so probably more and more specific use -- a specific purpose device will emerge at home, at the office or on-the-go. So but for this kind of device, it cannot exist just by device itself, it must be more of device cloud balanced -- balanced business model so to give you different experience in payment on e-commerce. So we -- and also this -- the kind of devices will be with more intelligence. So I think now we are focusing on these directions. So definitely we cannot communicate too much on the product details.

But no, I think, first of all, I think, it's very, very different, because if we look at Huawei, they probably are coming with a 2-in-1. And 2-in-1 for sure is growing very, very fast. We need to see when they can deliver the product, because it looks like they are not really on time. I don't -- we don't see or we don't perceive at least any major threat from Huawei when we think about 2-in-1s. This market is going to be, probably this year, in the range of 25 million growing from 15 million, it's going very, very fast. But PC market is very different than mobile market. It's really very, very different in terms of IP for sure is important, but then you also need to understand in terms of specs and features and performance and if I look at the product, it's probably what they show at Mobile World Congress. If it is -- it's still the same, is probably start to be a little bit outdated, simply because the evolution during the last 3 to 6 months is already there. And but on the other side, as I said, it's also very difficult to run this kind of business with one product only. So either you run with the full range of product, or in my opinion, to stay in the PC business with one product, I really don't see how they can be successful and they can compete. They may have some space with telecom [ph], because this is the natural ecosystem, but I see very, very difficult for them to be successful outside this channel. On Xiaomi, I think, they are coming with -- based on what we know, with a couple of products, they are also late. They have some delay that -- but I think in this case, it's probably even more difficult for them. Because to come with a couple of traditional notebook when form factor are changing, because we really start to see traditional notebook in traditional clamshell moving to very thin and light or detachable 2-in-1 or compatible. But I see the traditional notebook will continue to go down. And the same things, I don't think you can come into the PC market with 1 or 2 products in order to be successful. Not only if I look at our scale, running 60 million PC, I think that in terms of economy of scale, before they can catch up with us, it takes some time. So frankly speaking, I'm not scared at all about the 5% PDI from Huawei or Xiaomi. And I still look at competition in a different way. We see have some other big solid competitors, but not these 2.",467

After that, we'll take your questions. Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing.",78
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2786.0,1036751.0,43600956.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, our industries remained challenging. The PC and the tablet markets declined, and the smartphone and the server were essentially flat year-on-year. The continuing currency fluctuations worldwide, especially the RMB depreciation, also impacted our results. Yet Lenovo still delivered a solid performance. Overall, although our revenue dropped 6% year-on-year or 4%, excluding currency impact, our PTI increased nearly 300% year-on-year to reach USD 206 million. If we exclude the noncash M&A accounting charges, our PTI will be USD 281 million, nearly twice as the same quarter last year.
Our PC and Smart Device business remains strong. We improved the profit margin by 0.5 points year-over-year. All geographies gained this year and improved profitability except for EMEA. Our tablet business outgrew the market by 14 points and returned to #3 worldwide. In fact, we are now the clear worldwide leader when you combine PC and the tablets. We will leverage the industry consolidation to further gain share and focus on faster-growing segments like detachable PC, gaming PC, Chromebook PC to grow revenue over time.
In Mobile, our turnaround strategy is delivering results. We are integrating the teams, not just optimizing cost structure but strengthening cohesiveness and the consistent culture of the team. We are enhancing our product portfolio. In mainstream, we are optimizing cost and expenses to ensure competitiveness. We successfully launched the new Moto G4 and the ZUK Z2 models and have received very positive feedback from the market. 
At the high end, we are focusing on innovation. We launched the Moto Z and the Moto Mods in the U.S. in late July, and we'll ramp it in other parts of the world soon. These are game-changing products, and we are getting strong reviews from customers and partners and the good preliminary sales results in U.S. We are also expanding our channels and investing aggressively in marketing and branding. With these actions, we saw quite positive signals. Our mobile business revenue was almost flat year-to-year, only declining 1% if we're excluding currency impact. Quarter-to-quarter, our shipment increased by 3%, but the revenue increased by 10%. This shows our mobile business is stabilizing, and our transition to high-end products is really working, leading to higher average selling price and almost a 3 point improvement in operating margin year-to-year. We keep a strong momentum in Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
In Data Center business, while we still face challenges in U.S. and other mature markets, we strengthened our #1 position in China and grew revenue 14% year-on-year there, driven by growth in hyperscale business. Another highlight is that our global accounts business grew data center revenue by 45% year-on-year. We will further strengthen sales capabilities worldwide, improve product cost competitiveness, particularly in hyperscale market, and increase attach rates of services and options. In addition, we will continue to build our capabilities in storage, networking and hyperconverged technology. We believe innovation has always been the core to drive our company's future and business growth.
At the Tech World in June, we unveiled the Phab 2 Pro, the first augmented reality mobile device. We wowed the audience with the bendable phone and a foldable tablet concept of prototype product. We launched the Moto Z, which I mentioned earlier, and its snap-on Mods, which make your phone an outdoor theater, a portable stereo, a professional camera, a battery powerhouse and perhaps even more. Just like we created a new category of convertible PCs with our Yoga a few years ago, we have now created another new category of SnapPhone. 
Lenovo does a lot more than just tinker and upgrade. We keep challenging the status quo and delivering the innovation that the industry has long been waiting for. At the IFA in Berlin in September, we will showcase more one-of-a-kind innovations, so please stay tuned.
In the long term, Lenovo is combining our traditional strength in devices with unlimited possibilities enabled by cloud. We are uniquely positioned to build a balanced Device + Cloud model, connecting devices to cloud to create a seamless experience of our users at home, at work or on the go. This is the direction that Lenovo is pursuing. Although the market and the environment may remain tough for the foreseeable future, we are seeing the results of our execution and are investing to achieve long-term growth. We remain confident in our strategy and our capability to achieve our vision and goals.
Now let me turn it to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",754
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2786.0,1036751.0,43600957.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2017. 
Next chart, please. First, let me take a look at our quarter 1 highlights. The markets continue to be challenging, but we have seen progress in our business transformation, driven by our solid execution. Our group revenue recorded growth of 10% quarter-on-quarter to $10.1 billion, and the year-to-year decline narrowed down 6% year-on-year as compared to 19% year-on-year in last Q4 or down 4% in constant currency. Our profitability also improved in quarter 1. Group PTI, excluding the noncash M&A-related accounting charges, was $281 million, up 97% year-on-year. Reported PTI was $206 million, up 297% year-on-year. Group net income was up 64% year-on-year to $173 million. 
Next chart, please. Gross profit decreased by 7% year-on-year to around $1.5 billion, and our gross margin was 15.3%, showing a slight decline year-on-year primarily due to change in our business mix. Operating expenses decreased by 17% year-on-year, and the expense-to-revenue ratio was down 1.7 points year-on-year to 12.8%. This was due to our continued efforts to improve cost efficiency, and part of the expenses was offset from gains derived from our asset monetization exercise. As I mentioned in last quarter, we have begun to look for opportunities to monetize our non-core operating assets in order to free up capital for investing in our business. We have executed a sales and leaseback of one of our property assets. The transaction resulted in recording over $120 million in capital gains, which is shown in other operating income in our financial statements. We will continue to look for such asset monetization opportunities to fund some of our investment to drive our business growth. 
We recorded net other nonoperating expenses of $39 million, which mainly included the interest expenses from the USD notes and the RMB notes we issued, and they included interest expense for the promissory notes. 
Tax for quarter 1 was $38 million, with tax on the gain in relation to the asset monetization offsetting part of the tax credit associated with the 2 acquired businesses. Net income was $173 million, an increase of 64% year-on-year. Basic earnings per share for the quarter was USD 0.0157 compared to earnings of USD 0.95 last year. 
Next chart, please. The change in our balance sheet mainly reflects our business activities during the quarter. Noncurrent assets were $12 billion, and current assets were $13.2 billion. The major change compared to March end quarter was the increase in freight and OEM receivables and payables due to seasonality. The reduction of provision results from restructuring cost payment made during the quarter. [audio gap] liabilities were $2.5 billion. The noncurrent liabilities were $6.2 billion.
Next chart, please. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $8 million against cash outflows of $310 million same quarter last year. In quarter 1, we also recorded a cash flow from investing activities of $34 million, again, a cash outflow of $147 million last year. Decrease in bank deposits and cash was mainly due to the payment of restructuring expenses in the second half of last fiscal year and interest expenses for the bond and promissory notes. We have a net debt of around $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We will continue to drive improvement in our balance sheet by reducing working capital requirements and rearranging part of the short-term borrowings into long-term facility as well as looking for asset monetization opportunities. We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In quarter 1, it improved from positive 5 days last year to 0 days this year. 
Next chart, please. This is the first report under the new organizational structure we announced in early 2016, and the like-for-like comparison is on a pro forma basis. The pro forma historical data for the last fiscal year can be found in the appendix of this presentation deck. 
In quarter 1, we continue to grow our worldwide PC market share and improve our share in every geography except EMEA. We recorded profit for our tablet business which has been growing at a double-digit premium to the markets. As PC is our core profit-generating businesses, we will continue to enhance its profitability by balancing overall improvement in profitability and revenue growth. In Q1, we managed to not only grow the PCSD PTI year-on-year but also improved the PTI margin by 0.5 points year-on-year to 5.3%.
Our strategic shift is showing signs of positive momentum. Our smartphone shipments and revenue saw positive traction quarter-on-quarter. Our Mobile revenue year-on-year declined, narrow to nearly flat for the quarter if excluding the currency impact. This compared to a year-on-year decline of 39% in the previous quarter. We recorded an operating loss before noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $163 million, against loss of $229 million same quarter last year. 
In China, we launched our ZUK 2 (sic -- ZUK Z2) series and have received positive market feedback. At the same time, we increased our investment in branding and marketing in Q2 to prepare for the launch of our new products, Moto Z as well as Moto Mods.
Our business in PRC remained strong, with 14% year-on-year revenue growth, and we acquired new large global accounts leading to the revenue going up 45% year-on-year. The North America and EMEA business remained relatively slow, as we are still investing in product portfolio and building our sales force. 
The Data Center Business Group thus recorded 1% revenue growth year-on-year for the quarter or up 4% if excluding currency impact. With our ongoing business transition of our Data Center business, along with the keen competition in the hyperscale business in China, we recorded an operation loss of $31 million for the fiscal quarter 1 before noncash M&A-related accounting charges.
Next chart, please. China. Total revenue for China was $2.9 billion, down 10% year-on-year, partly due to the translation impact from the soft RMB, while we upheld our PTI margin flat year-on-year at 4.8%. We continue to uphold our strong PC profitability in China by leveraging our leadership position despite the market challenges. The Mobile business has begun to shift our portfolio to mid- to high-priced bands and improving user experience, while the successful launch of the ZUK Z2 model received good initial market feedback. 
China Data Center revenue grew at 14% year-on-year, a premium to the market and supported by growth from hyperscale and contribution from the new partnership approach. 
For Asia Pacific, revenue was up 4% year-on-year to $1.7 billion in Asia Pacific. The Asia-Pacific business saw continued PC market share gains, up 0.4 points to reach 16.4%. The Mobile business outgrew the market in key countries, including India and Indonesia, while the Data Center Group continues to work on improving profitability. The growth was mainly supported by strong smartphone shipments, especially in ASEAN countries and India. Operating margin was on recovery track and improved 0.2 points quarter-on-quarter. 
EMEA. EMEA revenue was down 7% year-on-year to $2.5 billion, and we recorded an operating loss in the quarter. The decline mainly is a reflection of severe market softness and currency depreciation, which particularly affected our PC business. We took actions to improve channel inventory to address challenging conditions and return for future growth. 
Mobile saw traction over the previous quarter as a result of new products coming to the market. The Data Center business remained challenging with the year-on-year revenue and margin decline. 
For Americas. Americas revenue was down 7% year-on-year to $3 billion. PC market share was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 15%, driven by strong growth in North America and improvement in Latin America, especially Brazil. Mobile shipments declined in North America due to product transition but stabilized in Latin America. The Data Center business worked on building the right sales model, while strong competition put pressure on the business. Operating margin for Americas thus improved to 1.3% this quarter from a loss position last year.
Looking ahead, the markets we are in remain challenging, and we'll continue to take actions to improve performance of each of our businesses. In the short term, there are signs suggesting the PC market will stop declining significantly, and we see growth opportunity in detachable, gaming PC and Chromebooks. We will aggressively targeting certain growth product categories, for example, the 2 in 1s, the workstation and gamings, to drive growth. At the same time, we have taken actions to address the challenges in EMEA arising from the soft market and operational issues. 
On the smart device side, our Phab 2 Pro, as the world's first AR-capable smart device, will soon be coming and has already attracted lots of attention, while our competitive cost structure will continue to take advantage of market consolidation and attract growth areas in the expanded PC market. We expect to continue to outperform the market while maintaining our margin performance. 
For the Mobile Business Group. Our transformations have already started showing some progress in Q1, and we'll continue executing our plan to get Mobile business back to growth with the improved profitability. We have launched Moto Z in Q2, which has received initial positive market feedback, and we'll continue to invest in branding and distribution to build up the sales momentum. 
For Data Center business, we have reorganized our structure to sharply focus on the markets and continue to enhance the end-to-end capabilities and ownership for everything from innovation to operation and technical support while expanding the solution portfolio with our innovation and integrating partner technologies to compete in a larger percentage of the total market opportunity. 
In August last year, we execute a series of business realignment actions with an objective to take out $1.35 billion operating cost to enable the group to focus resources, sharpen its business model and efficiently capitalize on the most attractive market opportunities in Mobile, PC and Data Center. Execution of these actions have been on track, and we have overachieved the $1.35 billion target over the last 4 quarters. We have taken actions to drive sustainable growth and profit improvement, although these actions will take time to see result. Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in areas we believe are important to our future success. We remain confident that Lenovo can outperform the industry to drive positive growth and increase shareholder's return over time. Thank you.

And I think my understanding seems to be that ZUK has at least predominately been an online approach. Can you talk about the strategy there?",69
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2786.0,1036751.0,43600961.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,6,"Thank you. So I think ZUK is just focusing on China. So let me talk about our worldwide smartphone strategy first and come back to the ZUK and then China. So our worldwide smartphone strategy is clear. So we will talk about a few things to improve. The first is that we will thoroughly integrate the Motorola and the Lenovo team in our organization so that not only we can -- we have the better cost structure plus we can be more efficient and cost competitive, but also, we can form the cohesive and the -- cohesive team and the consistent culture. So that's the first point. 
The second point is so we will enhance our product portfolio. So we will separate the mainstream and the premium products. In mainstream, we are optimizing our cost and expenses to ensure the competitiveness. As you just said we are successful in the launch of the new Moto G4 and the ZUK Z2 models last quarter. And we received a very positive feedback from the market definitely. And Moto G4 is for worldwide and ZUK Z2 is for China and some selected Asian countries, India, [indiscernible]. And in the high end, so we are focusing on innovation. So we launched the Moto Z and the Moto Mods in the U.S. late July. And we are ramping it up in other parts of the world very soon. So I believe that this is a game-changing product. And that we are the first company to launch this kind of model, so that we can significantly enhance the feature of the smartphone. So we have gotten very positive reviews and feedback from customers and from partners. The preliminary sales results is also very, very good, very positive. So this is about the product. The third thing we are focusing on is expanding our channels and investing aggressively in marketing and the branding so -- in key countries, so including China, U.S., Germany [indiscernible] so that we can strengthen the brand image, brand awareness, we can have more channel coverage. Like in China, so we are strengthening our relationship with Sony and JD.com. In U.S., so in the past, which we rely on the [indiscernible] part. Now we have expanded into Best Buy. Soon, we will expand into the Costco and Wal-Mart. So that's about the channel expansion. So in China, so you just say you are right. So our -- so we launched ZUK to focus on the mainstream price there, right. So we have seen very positive feedback from the market. So actually, our average selling price last quarter in China significantly improved. Actually, we dropped many low-end products and shifted focus to the mainstream and the premium. But very soon, we will launch our Moto G and Moto Mods in China, probably in September. So that will help us to strengthen our high-end and premium price there. So in China, we have -- regarding our product portfolio, we have very clear strategy -- we will use the Moto to cover the higher-end and premium price. In the U.K., we will manage -- actually, we have another sub brand, our product brand called the Lemo to cover the entry-level, entry product. So actually, all the products will cover all the channel. So you are right. Actually, the online channels now are in China is not the dominant in China. So actually, I would say that back to the normal, so actually, online channel, online accounts for 30% of the overall market. So probably, open market accounts for -- retail channels that accounts for more than 50% market than less than 30% is the carrier market. So all Lenovo product, so no matter it's Moto, in the UK it's the Lemo, will cover all 3 channels. So that's our strategy.",634

The gap has been narrowing because if you look at the premium, it is down to 2% to 3%, so below the 5%. As we said, it's mainly coming from EMEA and the sense that if you look at all the other geos, we are gaining share with a good premium. We're very good in U.S., strong in China, and also good in all the other geo like Latin America and Asia Pacific. In EMEA, we are facing one side from tough market condition or I'd say, very strong price war on one side there. We also face some operational issue on the other side. We are fixing it. I think that already this quarter, we will come back to a much better premium to market. The market is slightly stabilizing. I would say it's still, when we look at the market overall, I think it's still negative in terms of growth -- is a negative growth, is slowing down. So we are working in order to fix the operational issue we have seen in EMEA. But we are quite confident with all the other regions. Another good thing is that when we look at our Brazil results that it was, I would say, a little bit despicable last year. We are almost running at breakeven now, which is -- and we also start to see, in Brazil, with Olympics and some other things, the market slowly coming back. I would say for Q2, we are much more confident that we can come back to good premium to market. And we can also come back to enlarge the gap with the competition. Even though when you look at the rush to consolidation, I think it's clearly that all the major -- all our major competitors, meaning HP or Dell, they are also trying to see how they're going to leverage consolidation. And we continue to see all the other players on the other side getting in trouble or losing share. Another important thing is that when you look at our result, we are always very, very careful on balancing profitability and share and growth. And when you look PC, we have been improving margin by 0.5%. So we are running with a 5.3%. That is, I think, by far, the best in the market. I don't think there is anyone else that's able to do the same. And we will continue to balance growth and profitability.",408

So basically, we performed strongly in all geographies except for EMEA. So we -- in our other 4 geographies. So North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and China, we are getting very decent shares and also we improved profitability. We improved the PTI ratio. So particularly, North America was -- is very impressive. So it's very impressive. So actually, in PC, we grew by 13%. In tablet, we grew by almost 78% -- 70%. So our profitability in North America improved by 1.1 points. So now it's the second best geography in Lenovo. So that's pretty encouraging.",98

The item was actually recorded in other operating income expenses item. I think in the P&L items. If you go through it, I think, it was there.

So because our sales coverage is not enough, and our sales capability is limited, so we do see some challenging in U.S., actually a lot closer to our data center business declined by 7% in U.S. So because the sales to scale is different the sale data center and with the sale of PC, so actually, PC, we sell to the procurement department. So for the data center business, we sell to CIO, so we definitely needed to strengthen sales capability. But the good news is -- so our global account team is doing very well. So not only we are selling PC but also they are selling data center business very well. Last quarter, we grow our data center business with a global account by 45%. So that means that we have the knowledge. We have the scale in that part of the customers. We just needed to replicate our success to North America and to EMEA to the next level of the enterprise customers. So we need to strengthen the scale, the scale in North America and EMEA. So that's the current situation.",186

Yes, I think Q1 versus Q1, we obviously improved, yes. Well, I think we are -- we obviously is, I think, the transition from the -- I think, executing the strategy does not actually happen, I think, in 1 quarter because this is obviously a -- we still need to clear, I think, some of the channels, some of the inventory. You definitely see that we are selling more high-end phone or high-priced phone. For example, in China, I think we are moving out from the low-price product, I think, in the higher price product. But on the other hand, you actually see, as a result of that, I think our volume actually sort of coming down as well. So I think, the -- I think when we sort of slowly executing the strategy, I think you will actually see that, I think, happening. But on the other hand, if you really look at the, I think, year-to-year, we actually continue to further improve the benefit by our, I think, cost-reduction program. I think that we announced about, I think, 12 months ago. So you actually see expense result, I think, come down, I think, resulting exactly in improvement year-to-year. So that is really a combination of transiting, I think, from the previous low-priced product, I think, to a high-priced product.",224

I think the real driver of the financial result is the rest of the world. I think our revenue actually sort of coming down.

Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, market conditions remained challenging. Both the PC and the tablet markets declined year-on-year, while smartphones saw only modest growth. Yet, in spite of this, Lenovo delivered a solid performance. Overall, while our revenue dropped 8% year-on-year, we grew 12% quarter-to-quarter. Our reported PTI was $168 million. If you exclude one-time actions, our PTI increased 7% year-on-year.
Our PC and Smart Devices Business had another strong quarter. Our PTI margin increased by more than half a point year-on-year. In North America, we outgrew the market by more than 15 points year-on-year, with a strong PTI margin of 6.6%. Our focus on faster growing segments delivered good results. In gaming and detachables, we grew 36% and 52% year-on-year, respectively. In addition, we focused on millennial PC users. And the always online, always connected feature was well-received in China, growing over 200% year-on-year. We see big potential to expand to other parts of the world.
All of this were driven by great products. Even more, we keep innovating. The Yoga Book which has launched the -- is a one-of-a-kind product that's awarded in the industry. And the award-winning Yoga 910 and the Yoga Tablet 3 Plus show we continue to bring innovation to the convertible and the tablet segments.
Overall, we strengthened our #1 position worldwide with PC and tablet combined. We will maintain leadership and the strong profitability through leveraging industry consolidation, launching innovative products and focusing on faster growing segments and vertical markets.
In Mobile, over the last 18 months, we have taken many actions. We formulated a clear strategy, integrated our brands, built a united team and a consistent culture, and significantly drove cost down with 2 [ph] restructure. We have saved almost $1 billion run rate expense, which allow us to invest more in innovation, in products, marketing and branding to drive the growth. These actions had brought steadily improved results.
Our Mobile business operating margin improved by 4 points quarter-to-quarter, with ASP up 18% year-on-year. Our smartphone volume grew 25% quarter-to-quarter, driven by strong Moto volume growth of almost 40% quarter-to-quarter. And then we began this year quarter-to-quarter by 0.6 points. In average year, we outgrew the market and improved the share quarter-to-quarter. We are on track to turn around this business in the middle of next year.
Our better performance was also driven by our very successful Moto Z and Moto Mods launch. The first stable sales results came in quite encouraging, particularly in North America and Latin America. We ramped up to almost 60,000 units per week globally. As a new category, its momentum is comparable to iPhone during the first 3 months of launch. In the United States, almost 30,000 units a week. Even in Mexico alone, we are selling almost 10,000 units a week and quickly surpassed Apple to become the #1 in AT&T's premier segment. We expect to sell 3 million units in the first 12 months, which would represent a very strong launch for this new category of modular smartphone.
In Data Center business, the bright spots are China and the global accounts. Their revenue grew 7% and 16% year-on-year, respectively. But we clearly understand this business is still in the middle of the integration and the transformation as our revenue and margin both dropped the last quarter. This is mainly due to our insufficient direct sales and channel capability in some regions. Besides, our product offering was still transitioning from server-centric to hyperconverged and software-defined solutions that also impacted our short-term results. But I want to say we remain -- believe Data Center business is a very attractive business, and we are still fully committed to it. We are taking actions to fix its business model and to build our core competence, strengthening direct sales and the channel capability on the front end and then improving competitiveness of our products and the solution offerings.
The leadership change, which I will discuss shortly, will also help getting this business back to profitable growth. As our business has become more diversified, we have clearly realized that our past experience, capabilities and talents are not enough to support the growth of multiple businesses. We need to keep attracting the industry's top minds to ensure our success in new businesses. So I'm glad to announce that Dr. Rui from Asia Lab of Microsoft has joined as Chief Technology Officer; Kirk Skaugen, an industry veteran, former SVP of Intel, will join Lenovo as the President of the Data Center Group; Laura Quatela, former President of Eastman Kodak, has joined as the Chief Legal Officer. All 3 are deeply respected experts in their fields and are proven leaders with a passion for technology and innovation. 
To continue strengthening execution, Gerry Smith, with his knowledge and experience in operations, will run our global supply chain for all our businesses. Xudong Chen will lead our global services following Xiaoyan Wang's retirement. And Gina Qiao, with her deep expertise in strategy, in people and in marketing, will lead the Mobile business of China. Go Lan [ph], a highly experienced HR leader, will step in to assume HR leadership role. For more details, please refer to our press release.
In summary, market conditions may remain tough in the short term, but we were seeing the results of strong execution. We are confident in our vision, in our strategy and in our leadership team. And we are investing to achieve long-term, profitable growth. 
Now let me turn you to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",924
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2523.0,1073449.0,44971085.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q2.
Next chart, please. First, let us have a look at our Q2 highlights. Our group revenue continued to stabilize and record growth of 12% quarter-on-quarter to $11.2 billion. However, revenue declined 8% year-on-year due to the continued challenging market environment and currency impact. And if excluding currency impact, the revenue declined 6% year-on-year. During the quarter, we executed a resource action to improve operating efficiency and expect a potential run rate expense savings of $337 million against a redundancy cost of $136 million incurred in Q2. 
Meanwhile, we also recognize a capital gain of $218 million from the disposal of property and other assets. Group PTI was $168 million against a pretax loss of $842 million from last year. If we exclude the net benefit of $82 million resulting from netting off the redundancy costs and capital gain, as mentioned earlier, operating PTI would be $86 million, up 7% year-on-year. Group net income was $157 million against a net loss of $714 million from last year.
Next chart, please. Gross profit increased by 2% year-on-year to around $1.6 billion. And our gross margin was 14.3%, up 1.3 percentage points year-on-year, primarily due to better product mix from our smartphone business. Operating expenses decreased by 41% year-on-year, and expenses-to-revenue ratio was down 7 percentage points year-on-year to 12.4%. This was due to our continued efforts to improve cost efficiency, and part of the expenses were offset from net gains derived from our asset disposal, as I mentioned earlier.
On a like-for-like comparison, our run rate operating expenses decreased by 6% year-on-year. We recorded net other nonoperating expenses of $47 million, which mainly included the interest expenses from our U.S. dollar notes and RMB notes we issued and the included interest expenses for the promissory note.
Tax charge for quarter 2 was $16 million. This include tax on the disposable gain in relation to the sale of property, offsetting part of the tax credits associated with the 2 acquired businesses. Net income was $157 million against a net loss of $714 million from last year. Basic earnings per share for the quarter were USD 1.42 compared to losses of USD 6.43 last year. The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.06, representing the same level of interim dividend paid last year. 
Next chart, please. The change in our balance sheet mainly reflects our business activities during the quarter. Noncurrent assets were $12 billion, and our current assets were $15 billion. The major change compared to June end quarter was the increase in trade and OEM receivable and payables, both of which is primarily due to seasonality. Net current liabilities were $2.7 billion. The noncurrent liabilities were $6 billion. 
Next chart, please. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was around $1.6 billion, which improved significantly both year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, thanks to better cash conversion cycle from receivable collections efforts, inventory management and improved payment terms. Increasing bank deposits and cash quarter-to-quarter was mainly due to strong cash flow from operation. We have a net debt of around $77 million at the end of the quarter. We will continue to drive improvement in our balance sheet. We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In Q2, it improved from negative 1 day last year to negative 5 days this year.
Next chart, please. PCSD. In Q2, we continue to grow our worldwide PC market share and record strong margins in PRC and North America. With our strong tablet shipment growth in China, we continue to stay as the leader in the PC+Tablet market. PCSD remained as a solid profit pool to the group, and we further improved our PTI margin by 0.6 percentage points year-on-year to 5.2%.
Mobile Business Group. Strategic shift in our Mobile business continues to show signs of positive momentum in quarter 2. Our smartphone shipments and revenue continued to show strong traction quarter-on-quarter with 4 percentage point profitability improvement, driven by successful launch of Moto Z and Moto Mods, strong shipment from Moto G and strategic shift to drive higher-priced end products across the board. We recorded an operating loss before noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $114 million against a loss of $163 million loss in Q1 and $175 million the same quarter last year. We have recently taken resource action to further align our organization structure and streamline product portfolio. This will help further to sharpen our competitiveness in the global smartphone market.  
Data Center business group. Our Data Center business in China and Latin America both had strong revenue growth year-on-year in Q2. We see encouraging achievements in our global account customers, which recorded another quarter of strong growth. We have started our hyperscale business in North America, and we won new customers from next-generation IT segment. Although we continue to invest to build our direct sales and channel capability to expand our sales coverage, our businesses in North America and EMEA remain relatively slow. As a result, the basis on the business group recorded 8% revenue decline year-on-year, and operational loss before noncash M&A-related accounting charges worsened to $108 million in Q2 compared to a loss of $31 million in Q1. As Yuanqing mentioned earlier, we will continue our investment in this business to drive growth and take further actions to improve efficiency. We expect our DCG business will start showing improvement in the coming quarters.
Next chart, please. China. Total revenue from China was $3.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year, mainly impacted by our business transition in smartphone, while our PTI margin grew 0.8 percentage points year-on-year to 4.9%. We continue to uphold our strong PC profitability in China by leveraging our leadership position despite the market remains slow. The Mobile business continue to focus on our channel expansion and portfolio shift to mid- to high-price band, demonstrated by the year-on-year ASP improvement.  China Data Center revenue grew 7% year-on-year, supported by growth from hyperscale and contribution from the new partnership approach. 
Asia Pacific. Revenue was down 4% year-on-year to $1.9 billion in Asia Pacific, mainly due to slow PC market in the region and the Indian mega education deal last year. The Mobile business continued its strong momentum in India, while the Data Center Group continue to work on improving profitability. The operating margin drop both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter was mainly due to a weaker PC business in the region.
EMEA. EMEA revenue was down 14% year-on-year to $2.7 billion, and we recorded an operating loss in the quarter. The decline is mainly from the challenges of our DCG business as well as additional spending to clear our PC inventory during the quarter. 
Americas. Americas revenue was down 7% year-on-year to $3.4 billion. PC market share was up 1.6 points year-on-year to 15.4%, driven by strong growth in North America. Mobile shipments continue to show positive traction quarter-on-quarter. The Data Center business started its hyperscale business and have made progress in global account customers during the quarter. With a stronger PC business and improvement in the smartphone business, PTI margin for Americas region improved from negative last year and turned to positive 0.6% this quarter.
Looking ahead, we will continue our focus on executing the actions to improve performance from each businesses. For PC, there are signs suggesting that the PC market continue to narrow its decline. We remain confident to maintain our leadership and strong profitability in our core PC business, leveraging the market consolidation and the success in fast-growing product segments. On the other hand, we will continue our efforts to build Mobile and Data Center business into new profit engine. Through the series of actions Yuanqing mentioned, we stay confident for driving mobility, continuous revenue improvement and turning around the business in the next fiscal year.
For DCG, we believe data center is an attractive business, and we're fully committed to this business. We will continue to expand our sales coverage through building stronger direct sales and channel capability, provide competitive product and service offering, and build partnership with industry leaders. Those actions will need some further investment in the second half to ensure our Data Center business back to profitable growth over time.
Although the general market environment will remain challenging in the near term, with new and strong leadership team we announced today, plus our actions in place, we believe we can continue to drive sustainable growth and profit improvement, although this action will take time to see results. We will continue to invest in area we believe are important to our future success. We remain confident that Lenovo can outperform the industry to drive profitable growth and increase shareholders' return over time.

I think Wai Ming just commented the business still needs some investment in the near term. So should we expect the loss to expand in the coming 1 or 2 quarters? And when you said improvement, is there some more coming from the scale improvement or coming from the cost reduction? And do you have a plan on when to turn around the business?",71

So definitely, we think we certainly need to do more investment on the Data Center business. So in 2 aspects, the first is in the frontline [ph]. We need to significantly strengthen our sales colleagues so that we can directly sell to the leaders, the larger enterprise customers. As you know, when we acquired a part of it is a business from IBM, actually, we only got the second-tier sales. So again, it's the first tier of sales solution which manages our customer relationship. So the second-tier, they're called branded sales, so let's say a different product or service to the same customers. So we -- so definitely, we realize that we only have the second-tier sales, it's not enough. So we try to leverage our PC sales force to sell -- service our business better significantly. Definitely, there is a limited effect. So actually, where we sell PC, we sell through the procurement department. We sell the service, we need to sell to the CIOs. So we need to build the basic capability, so that means that we need to further invest in the sales area. But fortunately -- so we -- I think it's not too difficult to get that kind of talent now. So we are definitely doing our best to speed up the investment in that space. So another area is definitely in the back half [ph]. So we are in the product of -- so definitely, the market is transitioning from the traditional IT to the new IT. So we need to significantly strengthen our product offering, so we need to transition from the traditional server to the converged, or the hyperconverged products, software-defined storage, software-defined networks. So we must further invest in this area. So I definitely believe so we need to invest more in these 2 areas. Thank you.",309

Obviously, you've seen last year, you have done a [indiscernible] of restructurings already. Can you update us how many employees did you still have at Motorola? Particularly, how many are in this half that you still have? If the number has been reduced, would you be concerned about the product development in the future?",61

I think we still have more than 400 R&D engineers based in Chicago. So they are focusing -- in the future they will be focusing on the premier product. So we definitely are shifting our resources to China, focusing on the mainstream and the low-ended product, like the Moto G, Moto E or other new products. So that's where -- that's our plan. So we -- I think we will grow. So we have completely integrated the organization, integrated the products in the portfolio. So we have the plan. We integrated the brand as well. So now we sell 2 brands, Moto and Lenovo. So over time, we will have only 1 brand. So Moto will be -- so Lenovo is a company brand. So Moto will be our smartphone brand. So that means every issue of the Lenovo smartphone, you will see a Moto -- a Lenovo Moto. So based on this branding strategy, so we will have united product in the portfolio. So that will be very clear. So we definitely need to further invest on the branding, on the [indiscernible], but now I think that we are help us to save the money.",197

I have 2 questions. The first question is regarding to Mobile Business Group, MBG. So it's been a while since we started the restructuring. Could you give us an idea regarding to -- and the ASP increase is actually quite encouraging. So should we expect the ASP continue to increase? That will offset the pressure on the volumes and in the -- right, even volume will be much lower than what we expected before?",79
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2523.0,1073449.0,44971094.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,11,"Yes, definitely, you can expect the ASP to further increase. So actually, we almost dropped all the low-ended product in China with the carriers. So that's the key reason to drive the ASP up. So -- but we will continue to do that. And also, definitely, as this is driven by new products, by our innovative products, Moto Z and Moto Smart and the Moto Mods, so the first stable sales result is really encouraging. So by now, we have shipped more than 1 million units of the Moto Z. So by September -- the Mods attach rate is around 6% to 8%, it's around 6% to 8%. So if you view this as a new category, so you benchmark it with the iPhone's first year -- or first 3 months, so definitely, we are on a similar track, trajectory. So our activation rate ramped up to -- activation volume ramped up to 60,000 units per week recently. So they're already in the U.S. So even in a market like Mexico, so we -- our activation volume reached 10,000 k [ph] per week. So that's pretty encouraging. So actually, in AT&T, so AT&T is the most important partner of iPhone. So in Mexico, we surpassed them to become the #1 partner of AT&T. So that's a pretty encouraging result. So if you look at our last quarter results, so in almost every geography, we grew share. So that proves that not only this business is stabilized, but also we resume the growth -- we are resuming the growth. So definitely, I believe that we can pursue the profitable growth over time. So starting from the rest of the world, definitely in China, we still need to take some time to take that ground and to pursue the profitable growth. Thank you.",301

First, on the PC side, the last couple of quarters, the gap between Lenovo's PC growth and industry growth have narrowed. I think we historically were at about 5% to 10% premium to the industry growth. Any thoughts on what is happening there? Is it because of mix shift, geographically, is it because of mix shift between segments? And when do we expect to get back to that 5% to 10% kind of premium in terms of -- to the market growth? That's my first question. Second question, just wanted to dwell on the points Jenny raised as well on mobile. Could you give us -- after the recent restructuring actions, could you give us some indication on, whether on a revenue scale or a volume scale; maybe revenue scale is easier given ASP is going up, where the mobile business, MBG business will become breakeven? And any kind of time frame on that?",158
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2523.0,1073449.0,44971097.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,14,"Okay. So regarding of the PC, yes, so definitely, we -- given this is a mature business, so we prioritize the profit returns. So we need to ensure having enough profit to fund our growth in the other 2 businesses. So that's our strategy. So definitely, if you want to maintain 5 to 10 points of premium to the market, probably you have to sacrifice some profitability. So that is not what we wanted this time. So some of our competitors are pretty aggressive because they are private companies now. So probably, the cash flow is more important than the profit. So we don't have -- we don't want to have that kind of unreasonable competition. So that's -- so definitely, in the last quarter, so we had some operational issues as well. So I think, yes, we are fixing that. So probably -- so hopefully, this quarter, we could fix the issue to keep the premium to the market. But generally speaking, I'm confident on our competitiveness in the PC space. I think we are very efficient. We have a very efficient business model in that area. So even in this market -- declining market in this sales competition, market -- so we restructured [ph] for  more than 5% PTI, that's very impressive. So that's -- another reason, another reason is in India, in Asia Pacific. So last year, we had a big deal. So we call it the airport [ph] deal, so actually India education deal. So the deal accounts for a big portion of last year's performance. So probably that's where a little bit of impact on the volume basically. On a year-on-year growth, so that's about the PC. So regarding of the MBG, I talked about that already. So we are actually very encouraged by the progress we have made. So I think now our product portfolio are very competitive and also very innovative. So not only we had drive the ASP up, but also we had drive the gross margin up. So we intend to turn around this business in the middle of the next fiscal year. So after that, we will pursue the profitable growth. So actually, we -- last quarter, so we surpassed Xiaomi and LG and then to become the #6 player in the world. So definitely, it's on track. So if you -- some of you still remember how we become the #1 in PC. So I hope we could replicate that success in the smartphone area, products in smartphone [ph]. So hopefully, every quarter, we could grow this year because supply side will come back there one by one. So we have to -- that's my expectation. So thank you.",450

We're seeing some year-on-year growth. Could you just talk a little bit about the dynamics that you're seeing in your corporate PC business? And the second question is -- I think Wai Ming had talked about a slowdown in the Asia Pac PC business. Looking at some of the data that we have, it seems like declines there kind of dropped off in the third quarter. Could you also talk about dynamics going on in your Asia Pac PC business?",101

So I think definitely, first, the commercial PC or corporate PC business is the most stable as the consumer business. So commercial customers, still need to replace their PC. Even though the repair cycle becomes longer, but probably this is a handicap, at least 4 to 5 years before they need to replace. So we will -- and also, Lenovo is more competitive in the commercial space with our legendary ThinkPad brand, Think brand. So actually, we maintain a very good margin in that business, particularly in the global accounts, so multinational companies. So I think we have -- we are very happy there, so we go faster in that. We even grow in that space. So that's about the commercial. Actually, so even if the entire consumer market has declined, but we try to find the new category to grow. So actually, as I talked at my opening, so some specific category, so 2-in-1 detachable PC, tablet PC, millennial PC, Chromebook, so we all grow faster and grow our premium to the market, like a 2-in-1 at least 2% year-on-year; then in PC, so that's 6% year-on-year; Chromebook, so 70% year-on-year; millennial PC, 200% year-on-year. So I think that will guide our direction. So we will drive this specific category to grow. So probably, in the future, those kind of general-purpose consumer PC will move the market. But there is a specifically used PC that will grow this year.",241

But I think that -- I think if you really look at the top line, I think the base, I think, probably was, I think, high last year because we actually get the Indian education deal, which actually come in quarter 2. And therefore, we actually have, I think, quite a high base. Now if you actually sort of take that out for comparison purposes because this year, Q2 this year, there's no, I think, government deal. I think we actually have been increasing market share as well. So the 18% maybe on the numbers year-to-year growth, a little bit slower, but the underlying impact is actually quite respectable.",137
