410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2884.0,1136442.0,47107026.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Happy Chinese New Year. I wish the Year of the Rooster will bring prosperity to all of us.
Last quarter, despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and the fact that we are still in the process of building our foundation and the core competence in the 2 new businesses, Lenovo delivered a solid performance. Our revenue reached USD 12.2 billion, and our reported pretax income was USD 101 million.
Our PC and Smart Devices business continued its strong performance. Despite the decline in PC and the tablet markets year-on-year and the industry shortage of key component supplies, we achieved revenue growth year-on-year for the first time after 7 quarters of decline.
Pretax income was a solid 5% and an improvement year-on-year. Our PC volume grew 2% year-on-year, outgrowing the market by 3.5 points and reached a record share. We were especially strong in North America, Latin America and EMEA, outgrowing the market by 14 points, 16 points and 8 points year-on-year, respectively. We achieved the hyper growth year-on-year in the high-growth segments, namely, over 70% in gaming PCs, almost 100% in detachables, almost 260% in millenial PCs and almost the 80% in Chromebooks.
Our tablet volume grew 10% year-on-year, outperforming the market by 29 points. PC and the tablet combined, we remained #1 in the world. PC is our stronghold. We can make products of any new category successful as long as we can leverage our established business model and the road to market in PC.
We will continue to differentiate with innovation and leverage industry consolidation to gain share and keep a strong profitability. In mobile, we continue to see improved results as our turnaround strategy takes hold. Our worldwide volume continue to recover, growing 7% quarter-to-quarter. We also grew almost 16% quarter-to-quarter outside China to surpass LG to become #4.
And our Moto business outgrow the industry. In particular, we saw strong quarter-to-quarter growth in EMEA and Latin America. While our performance declined in Asia Pacific quarter-to-quarter due to supply shortage, in India, we remained strong and grow our market share to almost 10% despite the demonetization, which impacted the consumption. We did all this while continuing to improve overall Mobile business operating margin by 0.5 points quarter-to-quarter.
We also continued to see strong performance by Moto Z and the Moto Mods products and remain on track to reach our goal of selling 3 million units in the first 12 months. The Mobile business is definitely getting better, but we still have much work to do. In China, we are still in transition, focusing on more competitive product portfolio and channel expansion. We are building broader carrier relationships globally, especially in key markets such as North America. We believe we will start seeing worldwide revenue growth year-on-year since next quarter. We remain confident that our Mobile business will deliver breakeven and start profitable growth in the second half of the next fiscal year.
Our Data Center business is still in transition. When we acquired this business from IBM, we missed some capabilities, particularly the direct sales capability, and we had to depend too much on channel sales. This resulted in fluctuation in both revenue and profit. We're recognized the industry leader now leading this business, we now have a plan to build direct sales capabilities. We have seen that where we have direct sales capabilities, we delivered good results such as 7% year-on-year revenue growth by our global account team.
We are also fixing the hyperscale business model in order to deliver not only top line growth but also bottom line improvement in China. Although the transformation will take time, we are already seeing signs of stabilization in North America, EMEA and Latin America.
We recently delivered our first ThinkAgile converged system to our client. And in high performance computing, Lenovo has the second most system installations in the High Performance Computing Top 500 list.
Innovation continues to be a strength that drives growth across all our businesses. At the Consumer Electronics Show last month, we own 62 awards for innovative PCs, tablets and mobile devices. Our Smart Assistant powered by the cloud, which understands your voice commands and provides services accordingly, has attracted a lot of public attention. Our Legion brand gaming PCs also received rave reviews. We are also doing many innovation roadshows in 100 major cities all over China. I look forward to sharing more exciting announcements at the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
And just last week, Lenovo announced a revolutionary manufacturing process that will dramatically reduce environmental waste and carbon emissions. Lenovo's industry-leading innovation will be our competitive advantage that continues to drive growth across all our businesses.
In summary, market conditions may remain tough with possibly higher component costs going forward, but we are confident in our vision, in our 3-wave strategy and in our execution capability. I know that transition will take some time, but I'm confident that we will achieve breakeven and profitable growth in our Mobile business and in our Data Center business.
Now let me turn it to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",848
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2884.0,1136442.0,47107027.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in quarter 3.
Next chart, please. First, let us have a look at our Q3 highlights. Our growth revenue for the quarter was $12.2 billion. It declined 6% year-on-year due to the continued challenging market environment, including the supply constraints in key components while our Mobile business is recovering and we're still transforming our Data Center business. Revenue would have declined 4% year-on-year if excluding currency impacts.
Gross profit decreased by 15% year-on-year to around $1.6 billion, and our gross margin also declined by 1.5 percentage points to 13.1% due to the impact from the component cost hike across our various products and the impact from foreign currency fluctuations even though we took actions to mitigate the impact.
Expenses to revenue ratio was up 0.3 percentage points year-on-year to 12%, largely attributed to the increased branding and marketing expenses incurred in the launches of our new smartphone products and expansion into more markets. Our reported group PTI was $101 million. The reported PTI show a decline year-on-year as we are transitioning our Mobile and Data Center businesses, as Yuanqing mentioned, together with the increasing component cost.
Net other nonoperating expenses totaled $37 million, which mainly included the interest expenses from the USD notes and RMB notes we issued and the included interest expenses for the promissory notes.
We recorded a net tax credit of $6 million for the quarter, which was mainly due to the tax credits associated with the 2 acquired businesses offsetting the cost charge in our PCSD business.
Net income was $98 million against $300 million from last year. Basic earnings per share for the quarter were USD 0.009 compared to USD 0.0271 last year.
Next chart, please. The changes in our balance sheet mainly reflect our normal business activities during the quarter as well as some long-term liabilities becoming payable within 12 months. Noncurrent assets were $12 billion, and current assets were $15 billion.
Net current liabilities were $4.4 billion against $2.7 billion as of September 30 last year. The noncurrent liabilities were $4.3 billion against $6.1 billion as of September end last year. The Google promissory note will become due in October this year. As a result of which, it has moved into current liabilities. We have been planning the refinancing of this liability and do not anticipate any difficulty in executing those plans.
Next chart, please. In Q3, we continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle, which improved from negative 2 days last year to negative 13 days this year as we have successfully negotiated better credit terms with our major suppliers since late quarter 2. In Q3, our cash flow from operation was around $345 million. Increase in bank deposit and cash quarter-to-quarter was mainly due to cash flow from operations and the remaining part of cash payment received in relation to the monetization of our real estates executed in Q2.
We recorded net cash reserve of around $155 million at the end of the quarter, and we continue to drive improvement in our balance sheet.
Next chart, please. PC and Smart Devices business group. In Q3, PCSD business continue to deliver solid growth with strong margin. We maintained a worldwide #1 position in traditional PC market with record high market share.
In PC+Tablet market, we remain a strong #1 and expanded our market share year-on-year. We have strong shipment growth across tablets and high-growth PC segments, including gaming, Chromebook and detachable products. Thus, our PCSD business recorded positive revenue growth year-on-year with a solid PTI margin of 5%, up 0.02 percentage points (sic) [ 0.2 percentage points ] year-on-year.
Mobile business growth. Despite facing challenges from component shortages, MBG turnaround plan is on track in Q3 though momentum was solid in rest of the world markets with strong quarter-on-quarter shipment growth in Latin America and EMEA. Our MBG revenue increased 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by ROW businesses while we are still transforming our business in China.
We could have achieved a higher shipment growth without the component supply constraint, and the increased component cost has also impacted our gross margin. As a result, we recorded an operational loss before noncash M&A-related accounting charges of $112 million for the quarter.
We recorded a flattish loss quarter-on-quarter despite revenue growth as we continue to invest in branding and marketing to support our new smartphone product launches and expansion into more market to drive future growth.
Data Center business group. We are still in the process to transform our Data Center business. An industry veteran joined as our new leader and change actions are in place to enhance our foundation and capabilities. While this action required time to be effective, we begin to see some early signs of stabilization especially in the North America businesses. Nevertheless, in Q3, amidst keen competition and our focus on the balance between growth and profit in China, the group, Data Center business group, recorded a 20% revenue decline year-on-year while the operational loss before noncash M&A-related accounting charges was $94 million in Q3, a slight improvement from a loss of $108 million in Q2.
Next chart, please. For China, the revenue from China was $3.5 billion, down 2% year-on-year. The decline was reduced compared to previous period. It's due to our strong PC performance that reached record high share in this quarter but offset by our smartphone and data center businesses.
Our PTI margin grew 0.5 percentage points year-on-year to 5.2%, largely due to our continued operational improvement in PC.
Asia Pacific. Revenue was down 14% year-on-year to $1.7 billion in Asia Pacific mainly due to demonetization in India and component shortages, which impacted our PC and smartphone businesses for the quarter while we are still revamping the business model for the Data Center group. Despite the challenges, the group maintained a solid #2 position in the PC market and grew our market share in India smartphone market quarter-on-quarter. The decline in sales resulted in a lower operating margin.
For EMEA. EMEA revenue was $3.4 billion, down 3% year-on-year but improved 23% quarter-on-quarter as our PC business in the region resumed growth and reached record high share. We have started to expand our smartphone businesses in Western Europe. We recorded solid growth quarter-on-quarter but recorded a decline year-on-year due to different product launch cycles. And we are still undergoing transformation in our DCG business. Together with our investment in marketing and branding to drive our smartphone business, we recorded an operating loss in the quarter.
Americas. Americas revenue was $3.6 billion, down 8% year-on-year but improved 7% quarter-on-quarter. Our PC business in America remained robust. PC shipments increased by 12% year-on-year, outperforming the market by 14.3 million, driven by the strong growth in North America.
Our American smartphone shipments again show quarter-on-quarter growth while we are building broader carrier relationship in North America. Our Moto brand products continue to show solid growth during the quarter. The new Moto G products saw strong momentum in Latin America while we also have successes with our Moto Z and Moto Mods product in North America.
We continue our investment in the Data Center business to strengthen our sales capability, and we started seeing signs of stabilization in regions, especially in North America. Our PTI margin for Americas improved by 0.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 1.1%.
Looking ahead, we will continue our focus on executing our actions to improve performance in each business. For PC, we remain confident that we will maintain leadership and drive growth with strong profitability in our core PC business by leveraging market consolidation, launching innovative products and focusing on fast-growing segments and vertical markets.
We continue our efforts to build Mobile and Data Center business into new profit engines. We have a solid smartphone business in Latin America, and we'll continue to build a competitive operating model and organizational structure to capture efficiency in other geographies.
For DCG, we are continuing our actions to enhance our capabilities and refine our business model, not only in the traditional technologies, but also for the new IT solutions. These transformation strategies may require time to be effective, but we remain confident to bring DCG business with solid business foundation to drive breakeven and profitable growth over time.
Looking forward, market conditions may remain challenging due to the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment while constraint in supplies of key components will likely increase cost and continue to bring challenges to the group business environment, especially as Q4 is typically low season for us. In spite of these market challenges, we will continue to execute our strategy diligently to drive sustainable, profitable growth over time. In addition, we'll continue to look for opportunity to monetize our noncore assets to enable us to further invest for the future growth of the group.

I think this relates to probably DRAM. It seems like these constraints and price hikes might sustain for maybe the first half of this year. So just curious what Lenovo's seeing out there in terms of supply and pricing and maybe a little bit more about how you're managing this across your businesses, both PC, smartphones and tablets.",73

What we have seen at least mainly last quarter for sure, some shortage on memory, DRAM SSD and also some other components, I would say mainly LCD, a little bit batteries and other things and of course, the costs going up, but I think we have been able to manage during last quarter in terms of supply relatively okay, mainly leveraging our strength in terms of being #1. Moving forward, I think we will continue to see some shortage on memory even though probably still this quarter and maybe next quarter, but it's getting better. Price is likely going up still but almost stabilizing while we don't see any major issue on the other components except maybe battery due to the accident of a few weeks ago. But overall, I think yes, memory is still in shortage, and we continue to be in shortage. Price is, as I said, slightly going up, I think -- but stabilizing. We are, I think, in a good shape in terms of supply. I think we should be able to get what we need on PC and also on the other -- for the other businesses, but I would assume that the industry will continue to suffer for at least 1 or 2 quarters.",211

Regarding the Mobile business, so definitely the supply situation is worse than our PC. So we are facing component shortage, particularly in the camera imaging so these kind of things. So actually, last quarter, if we could get enough supply, we could ship 2 million more to the market. So probably -- so for the current quarter and probably the first half of the year, we are still facing the supply shortage challenge, but we wish we could operate better -- to try our best to deliver as many as possible.

A couple of things. One, on the PC environment, it looks like we are in an environment where PC declines are fairly moderate now compared to the beginning of last year when it was pretty bad. Any outlook in terms of how we see this continuing into the rest of the year? Are we expecting the PC declines to be fairly moderate or even pretty flattish in terms of the market going through the rest of the year? The second question I had is on mobile. For the breakeven target in Mobile Business group going into second half of the next fiscal year, are we comfortable that at the current revenue scale itself, around 2 billion per quarter, we will be able to break even? Or would we need revenue growth from these levels also to attain the breakeven point?",141

If I look at this year, in my opinion or in our opinion, it would still be in decline, probably in the low single-digits decline, but I don't think it's going to be flat year-on-year for different reasons. If you look, emerging markets are still on a negative side. And if you take China, China is getting a little bit better, but Latin America is still in, in some cases, even double-digit decline and even some emerging markets in EMEA are on the same side. We see good stabilization in U.S. and Europe and partially Japan, but overall, I think it will be probably something in the range of minus 4%, minus 5%. What we need to understand that's being a little bit different in the last quarter is detachable growth because detachable, it's used to grow at very high growth, even 40%, 50%, 60% year-on-year. If you look last quarter, for the first time, detachable was negative growth. We are still growing very, very fast there, but I think mainly not because the market is growing but because we are gaining market share against other people. So if detachable doesn't come back to growth, if we combine detachable and PC, I think we will still see negative growth also this year, not as bad as last year or the year before, but I still -- we still believe that it's going to be negative. On the other side, we continue to see consolidation moving forward. And I think we need to -- we continue to gain share while the other people, I think they will continue to struggle. So there are still good opportunities in terms of growth from our side, not because the market is growing, simply because other people are slowing down.",315

So regarding the MBG, our Mobile business breakeven turnaround plan. So we are very confident that we can deliver that. So definitely, so this is a plan not just drive that turnaround but also drive the growth over time. So I -- so definitely, we are not satisfied with just $2 billion per quarter revenue. So actually, as I said -- I just said, so in the last quarter, if we have enough supply, we could ship 2 million more to the market. Probably with that 2 million, we could be breakeven in this business. So actually, -- so today, our operational expense is around $400 million per quarter. So I think -- so not only we can grow our top line but also we can improve our gross margin, gross profit. So last quarter so actually, we were hit not just by the supply shortage, not just in the shipment but also in the cost, in the material cost. So I think if we could improve the gross margin to around 20%, so we definitely can be easy to make money. But I don't think that that's mission impossible. So that's why I'm confident. So actually -- and so that's the story for the rest of the world. In China, probably it's a little bit different. So -- but for the next fiscal year, I don't think our China business will lose more than 100 million. So we definitely will mitigate the risk in China market.",252

Could you comment on your future branding strategy here? That's my first question. And the second question is regarding to the PC consolidation comment. The thing is we've been seeing PC consolidation for quite a while. And now it seems like the leading players, there are not many surviving players. So what's your -- let's say, 5 years from now, what do you think the market will become? Is it going to be like 3-player market? Is it something that you are envisioning for the future?

Okay. I would not say that it's going to be a picture with only 3 players. It's probably going to be a picture with maybe 4 to 5 players because we should not forget that there are also some other players not running Windows. But having said that, if you think about the picture with 4 to 5 players, there are still a lot of room in terms of consolidation. There are still some local players here and there in different parts of the world. There are still some other players that continue to lose share during the last couple of years, but I would say in a couple of years from now, in my opinion, we will see only 4 to 5 player left, and this is why we still believe that shooting for 30% market share is challenging -- is very challenging but is not a dream, yes.",153

So we understand that the trend is everything going to the cloud, and how we make the money from DCG in the future, is it data center service business? Can you share your strategy on the turnaround on the DCG and also the new business in the data center?",52
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2884.0,1136442.0,47107045.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,20,"Okay. Thank you, Arthur. So definitely, DCG business is a new business for Lenovo. We are -- so to some extent, we are still in the learning stage. So -- but fortunately, recently, we hired a very experienced leader to lead this business. So -- but definitely here, I can give you some very simple and preliminary thought on this business. So actually, this DCG, data center enterprise business is shifting from a mature market to emerging market. So actually, today, the growth is not in U.S. The growth is in China. So actually, U.S. and China probably account for more than 50% or 60% of the total market. So -- but China is growing faster than U.S. and the mature markets. The second is this market is shifting from the traditional enterprise customers to Internet companies, so-called IP DC markets. So data center market. So the third one, the third shift, the third trend is from a technology point of view, it's shifting from traditional IT to the new IT. The traditional IT is separate servers, storage and network, but the new IT will be hyperconverged technology. So computing, storage and networking will be combined together, so everything is software defined. So that's -- are 3 clear new trend. So definitely, Lenovo is trying our best to address all these 3 trends. So unfortunately, -- so we have to address this trend simultaneously with the integration of our business. But fortunately, we don't have an annexing. So compared to other competitors, so we are in a better position, particularly creating the third trend that I just talked, from a traditional IT to new IT, and also I think we definitely have the advantage in China market than our traditional competitors like HP and Dell. But definitely, we also understand that we have a lot of things to do, particularly in China. So it's shifting to the hyperscale market, to the IP DC or Internet companies very fast, faster than the rest of the world. But so far, we haven't built a solid business model for this trend, for this shift, for these new categories -- new category of the customers. So we need to refine our business model to ensure not only we can grow in that market, but also we can make money, we can be profitable in that market. So as long as we can grow that market in China and make money in that market, I think it will be easy for us to grow and to be profitable in rest of the world, particularly in U.S. IP DC market. So that's what we should address. Definitely, so for the hyperconverged, so actually, we are leading in that space. So we have built a very good relationship, a partnership with a company like Nutanix, et cetera, et cetera. So -- but definitely, to fix our DC, Data Center business, so addressing this shift is not enough. So we -- as I said, so simultaneously, we must fix the integration issue. So actually -- so when we acquired the business from IBM, we missed some capability, particularly the direct sales capability. So because of that miss, we have to rely on more our PC sales force. So we have to rely on more indirect sales model although we are doing well in that space, but it is not enough because in the industry, 80% of the enterprise business are through the direct, only 20% are through the indirect. But in Lenovo, we are in reverse situation. We are in reverse situation. So we must fix this issue simultaneously. So -- but fortunately, we have seen the first signal, particularly in the North America and EMEA market. So actually, last -- after we started to increase the direct sales force, so last quarter, for the first time, we see the quarter-to-quarter revenue growth. So that's a definite positive signal. So that's what I want to address on our Data Center business.",663

So how would that pan out in the next quarter, next 2 quarters? Are you going to control the losses there by scaling back on your expenses or you will continue to invest in order to get more sell-through in EMEA?",83

I think it's a combination of -- because when you look at EMEA results, it's a combination of the 3 businesses together. So it's DCG plus MBG plus PCSD. For sure, there are some costs or some additional expenses coming from marketing, and I think they are going to control better for next -- for this quarter. On the other side, as we said, we also need to turnaround the DCG in terms of loss in order to be able to give a better result in EMEA.",92

Second question is about your Mobile business in China. Can you give us more colors on your strategy, on your ambition in your home turf? Because when we look at China Mobile business in the last -- 2 years ago, Xiaomi was very successful with their online channel. And then this 1 year and 1.5 years, we see Vivo and Oppo going very strong with their off-line channels. So in this situation, this market, where do we stand in terms of Lenovo in this market?

So thank you. Regarding our Mobile business in China, so definitely, so it's still in the transformation period. So actually, why we -- our revenue declined significantly, and profitability is bad because we are cleaning up the image part. So the HD product. So we are trying to -- building the new channel, new business model. So I would say by the end of this fiscal year, so we would clean up all the HD image part. So that -- so we have the chance to start up from scratch. So with the new leader, Gina Qiao, she is very ambitious. She's willing to help the company to build solid foundation in this business. So -- but definitely, we need to start from -- rebuild the leadership team, rebuild the organization, rebuild the business model. We also need to sharpen our product competitiveness. We need to have a very solid branding strategy. So -- but everybody here knows China market is the most competitive market in the world. Actually, almost all multinational brands cannot succeed in that market because some local players, definitely, they are very aggressive. So product definition is different from other markets. So customers pay more attention to the price performance essentially said. So we must have a different strategy, a different product offering to address this market. So that's what we have learned from this market. But this market still represents more -- almost 30% of the total market. If you want to win worldwide, you must win in this market as well. So this is not a market we can give up. So we will never give up this market, but I wish you could know. So we start from scratch to rebuild the foundation, to rebuild the core competence in this business. So -- but it needs to take some time to see the results. Thank you.",314

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will discuss our last quarter and the last fiscal year financial results, strategy and the progresses in execution today. Last quarter, despite the challenging industry condition, Lenovo -- our revenue resumed growth year-on-year after 5 quarters of decline, reaching USD 9.6 billion. Our net income was USD 107 million. In PC and Tablets combined, while we faced the component shortage and the price increase, both our revenue and the volume year-on-year grew for 2 consecutive quarters. Our average selling price improved, and we still delivered a 4.3% pretax income.
In mobile, outside of China, we achieved more than 17% volume growth and outperformed the market by almost 13 points. Particularly in Brazil and India, our volume grew 56% and 34% year-on-year, respectively. We also achieved a breakthrough in Western Europe countries like U.K., France and Germany. In China, we are reorganizing and rebuilding a stronger team.
In data center, we saw profitability improvement quarter-to-quarter in every geo, except for China and Latin America. In China, we are proactively balancing growth and profitability of hyperscale business.
For the fiscal year, our group revenue was more than USD 43 billion. We returned to profitability with net income of USD 535 million, more than USD 660 million higher year-on-year. In PC and tablet combined, we were #1 in share, in worldwide share, and outperformed the market by more than 7 points while maintaining industry-leading profitability of 5%. Last month, Laptop Magazine named Lenovo the Best Laptop Brand for the year, unseating Apple, who carried the position for the past 5 years.
In mobile, our transformation continued to deliver results outside of China. Our performance saw quarter-to-quarter improvements every quarter. And the last quarter, our revenue resumed growth year-on-year. Our premium smartphone, Moto Z, is on track to reach 3 million units sold within 12 months from its launch. Our average selling price improved more than 15% year-on-year. Last year, we united the teams, formed a consistent culture and integrated the brand and the product portfolio. As such, we are on track to breakeven in second half of this fiscal year.
In data center, we are still in the stage of investment and the foundation building. With Kirk, our industry expert in leadership, we restructured our organization into end-to-end segments around the 5 market opportunities and hired many experienced industry leaders. We continue to build core competence in software-defined data center and the hyperscale businesses as well as investing in partnerships and sales capability. Lenovo is now reorganized as the most -- is recognized as the most reliable server provider by ITIC and the fastest-growing supercomputing company.
Beyond the operational results, last year, we focused on building foundational capabilities for long-term competitiveness. We have made solid progress in executing our 3-wave strategy. Our PC business as the first wave, we continue to lead the industry in scale, profitability and innovation. For the second wave, we are determined to invest further in mobile and the data center to build them into our new growth engine, no hesitate -- no hesitation, no reservation. Meanwhile, we look beyond this to capture new opportunities brought by cloud, big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality and the natural language user interaction. So we have quickly mapped out the third wave of our strategy, which is Device + Cloud and the Infrastructure + Cloud. With this strategy, you will see that we are not only giving cloud and artificial intelligence wings to our existing devices but also developing and then launching new devices, new infrastructure, driven by artificial intelligence and the cloud.
Lenovo's Smart Assistant and Smart TV will invigorate your home. Our augmented reality technology will be applied to more vertical industries, and our software-defined infrastructure are the backbones for cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service.
In summary, we have worked hard to finish the difficult part of the foundation building, and we will be well positioned to harvest the fruit of our transformation. I'm confident that we have the right strategy, right people, right organization structure to drive strong execution and achieve our long-term goals.
Now let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",699
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, May 25, 2017",2017-05-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2325.0,1216926.0,49765945.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. So I will take you through the Lenovo financial and operational performance in our quarter 4 and the fiscal year 2017. Next chart, please.
For fiscal year '17, revenue was $43 billion, down 4% or 3% year-on-year, excluding currency impact. Gross profit declined 8% year-on-year, and margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 14.2%, impacted largely by component supply constraints with cost increases across the various products as well as the transition of our data center business.
Operating expenses were down 19% to $5.4 billion, helped by our previous resource action and disposal gain from the noncore assets. We, in fact, recorded disposal gain of our real estate interest of $218 million in Q4. This offset the higher marketing expenses for smartphone launches during the year to support our new Moto brand products launches and expansion into more new countries.
The group's reported profit before taxation was $490 million. Net other operating expenses totaled $182 million, which mainly consisted of the interest expense from our USD notes and RMB notes that we issued before as well as the MTN issue in quarter 4 as well as the included interest in -- expense for the promissory notes.
We recorded a net tax credit for the fiscal year largely due to the tax benefit associated with the 2 acquired businesses.
Profit attributable to equity holders was $535 million against $128 million loss recorded in the previous year.
Turning to Q4. Our group revenue was $9.6 billion, up 5% year-on-year, helped by our strong revenue growth in mobile and PC businesses. Gross profit decreased by 10% year-on-year to $1.4 billion, and gross margin declined by 2.3 percentage points to 14.3%. While we are still transforming our mobile and data center businesses, our margins were thoroughly impacted by the component cost hikes across our various products, even though we took actions to mitigate the impact. As a result, our PTI was $15 million. We recorded a net tax credit during the quarter. Profit attributable to equity holders was $107 million.
Basic earnings per share for the year was USD 0.0486 compared to a loss of USD 0.0116 last year. The board decided in its meeting today to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.205 per share. Next chart, please.
The change in our balance sheet mainly reflect our business activities during the fiscal year. Noncurrent assets were $12.3 billion, and current assets were $14.9 billion. Major changes year-on-year were related to the issue of our MTN as well as perpetual securities in quarter 4 and gain from the noncore assets disposals for the year. We have paid off half of the $1.5 billion of the promissory notes due to Google in quarter 4, and we have also repaid the rest of the promissory note earlier this month. Net current liabilities at $3.5 billion. Similarly, the year-on-year change was mainly due to the decline in business activities. The noncurrent liabilities was $4.8 billion. Next chart, please.
Cash flow from operation at the end of fiscal year was $2.1 billion against $292 million in the previous year. The increase in bank deposit and cash mainly due to the cash from the bond and perpetual securities issued in quarter 4, netting off the partial repayment of the promissory note due to Google made in the quarter. Net debt at the end of fiscal year '17 improved to $86 million from $1.2 billion in the previous year. We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In Q4, it improved from 0 days last year to negative 22 days this year. For the full year, it also improved from positive 1 day last year to negative 10 days this year. Next chart, please.
The industry was -- the industry-wide increase in key component costs impacted various businesses last year, especially in the second half of the year, although we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts. We continued to grow our PC market share to a record high of 21.4%, further solidifying our #1 position for the full year. Our PC shipments resumed growth in the second half of the year for 2 consecutive quarters in the PC+Tablet market. In the PC+Tablet market, Lenovo also remained #1 with strong growth across high-growth segment. We grew 34% in gaming and 69% in detachable. Among the regions, we hit record high market share in China, America and EMEA. Contraction of PC market and weaker currency conditions, though, stabilized somewhat in Q4, continue to put pressure on our revenue. Full year revenue was $30.1 billion, down 2% year-on-year and almost flat in constant currency. Revenue in quarter 4 was up 5% year-on-year, thanks to a better commercial refresh demand despite slower performance in North America due to component cost increases and inventory clearance. From a full year perspective, pretax income, $1.5 billion; margin up 0.3 percentage point year-on-year, thanks to the improved efficiency.
For the mobile business group. The group's strategic shift in our mobile business has started showing signs of strengthening, leading to a strong performance in markets outside of China. We recorded strong shipment growth in Latin America and signs of breaking through in Western Europe while keeping our solid position in emerging countries like India. Our innovative new products like Moto Z, Moto Mods and the new generation of Moto G continue to receive encouraging customer response and increased education rate. In China, we continued to execute our transformation strategy in rebuilding the brand and realigning our channel strategy. As a result, we recorded a decline in both revenue and shipments. Owing to the increase in branding and marketing expenses to support new product launches and increased key component costs, we recorded an operating loss of $566 million last year.
For our data center business. DCG under the new leadership of Kirk Skaugen, who joined the company in last November, is executing our transformation strategy and building the critical modification for the business growth. We have already seen results in multiple geography with enhanced focus in programs. We recorded double-digit growth in global account business and continue our solid performance in HPC. Indeed, Lenovo is currently ranked as the worldwide #2 HPC company on the top 500 list. We will continue to build a worldwide portfolio of solutions and provide end-to-end global sales and marketing teams with more sophisticated channel programs. We will also focus on increasing attach rates in networking, storage and services to enhance our profits.  Nevertheless, revenue was down 11% year-on-year to $4.1 billion, and increases in the key component costs also impacted profitability, resulting in an operating loss of $343 million. Next chart, please.
For China. Total revenue from China was $11.8 billion, down 5% year-on-year, and profit down 4% year-on-year. Our overall margin in China remains stable at about 4.6% for the year. PC business continued to perform well during the year. PC market share improved to a record high market share at 37.1%, with stable margin for the year in quarter 4. However, as we are executing our transformation strategy in both mobile and our DCG business, which continued to have short-term impact on our profit performance in China and has resulted in lower margin in quarter 4. We announced our new leaders in PCSD and DCG to drive business growth more efficient over time.
For Asia Pacific, revenue down 2% year-on-year to $7 billion in Asia -- in the region. The decline was mainly driven by a soft PC and DCG business, although our smartphone business was solid with ASP and revenue growth. Increasing component costs has a negative impact on the region that resulted in a loss.
For EMEA, revenue down 5% year-on-year to $11.2 billion, and we recorded an operating loss of $337 million. Similar to Asia Pacific, decline mainly driven from a soft PC and data center business. Our smartphone business has successful breakthrough in Western Europe, while we have made adjustment in our channel inventory, mainly through our product transition and soft market environment in the Middle East. Increases in key component costs also negatively impacted the region that resulted in loss.
For the American regions, revenue down 4% year-on-year to $13 billion. PC business remained solid with stable margin, although facing significant challenges in the second half of the year from our competitors. But our profitability in Brazil continued to improve. Strong smartphone performance in Latin America, driven by Moto G and Moto Z, helped turned the region from loss into profit last year, offsetting the impact of the data center business. The region recorded a profit of $157 million, reversing the $121 million loss in previous year.
Looking forward, we expect the industry-wide supply constraint and cost increases in key components will continue to bring challenges to the group's short-term business performance. The group will continue to execute its strategy diligently to drive sustainable, profitable growth over time. PCSD. We'll continue to strengthen our performance of our PC business by leveraging industry consolidation while driving growth by launching more innovative products and focusing on fast-growing segments with vertical markets.
For our mobile business, we'll continue building the brand and expanding our scale across geographies. We will leverage our streamlined innovative product portfolio and broaden global carrier relationships and channels coverage.
In China, we'll continue to execute our business transformation plan. Through our previous resource action, our mobile business has now established a new competitive operating model and organization structure to capture efficiency, which is set to help the profitability improvement of the business over time.
For DCG, continue to implement our transformation strategy and build a critical business structure to drive future business growth. This transformation strategy may require time to be effective, but we remain confident of returning DCG business to profitable growth over time.
Despite the market conditions that will remain challenging in the short term, we exited the year with stronger organization, allowing for sharper customer focus and more compelling product portfolio across all our businesses. In addition, we'll continue to seek opportunities to strengthen our financial position as well as to look for inorganic growth opportunities. Together with our competitive cost structure and solid execution, we remain confident in our vision and strategy to drive the long-term profitable growth.

How would you comment on the trend that when people are replacing their PC, they might probably switch to Mac or probably switch to a Microsoft Surface. So how would that impact on the OEM in terms of the future prospect for PC replacement?",143

I'll answer the first question; then Wai Ming,  second; Gianfranco, third. So obviously, you have a question for Kirk for the data center, the next one, no. So regarding of the smartphone target, so last quarter, we resumed year-on-year growth for the first time in probably 5, 6 quarters. So actually, we grew 6% year-on-year on volume, close to 28% in revenue. So that means our AUR, average selling price, was increased significantly. So we are very satisfied with this progress. I wish -- so in the next -- in the current fiscal year, so we can keep this path.",101

So tax credit, well, I think probably everybody knows how this tax credit works, is really we, I think, bought the 2 businesses. They actually have, I think, quite a bit of accumulated losses that we carried forward and any profit we make, we obviously, I think, from a taxation perspective, need to offset those losses before we start paying tax, and hence, we have the tax credit. I think going forward, we probably would still have some tax credit but not really to that extent. I think it's not easy to estimate because, obviously, the taxation environment around the world is changing, and in particular, I think we have a new President in the U.S., I think, proposing a lower tax rate. So the tax credit benefit probably will come down. So I would expect that there will be still some tax credit but not to the quantum that we saw in this year or in particular, quarter 4.",162

It's my turn. On PC, first of all, let me make one consideration -- sorry. When you look at PC market, just only PC, and you look at the last couple of quarters, we have seen the decline slowing down, right? It's down to a very small single digit. And we expect that this is going to be more or less the picture for this year and probably also for the following year. So very stable. Even when you combine the PC and Tablet, so not really personal computer but personal computing, let's say PC device and the IDC is going to change even the reporting numbers from PC to PC+Tablet plus detachable plus -- all the rest. You see also the market is relatively stable. It's not going to decline for the next 2 or 3 years. So I think decline on PC is probably almost over. Another good thing when I look at replacement, frankly speaking, we don't see Apple growing. Apple is not growing share. So we are not particularly worried then, people replacing PC, they need to switch to Mac, because it's not happening, and we don't see why it should happen. And even on detachable, detachable is a very interesting category. It's growing. We are growing -- we grew last quarter almost 70%. So we have a good product line. We continue to introduce product. But we don't see -- on the other side, if I look at the Surface result, they have been -- during the last quarter, they have been declining. And I think they have been declining simply because the category is growing. The number of price points is getting wider. They are covering only a very small limited price point. So I think rather than seeing really competition from Surface, I think we see this category going -- becoming bigger and is a good growth opportunity for us. So we don't see any -- really, any issue from both today.",330

And I have 2 questions, and the first question is I sense that probably the annual report you gave, you already do a lot of effort on it. But if you look at the next year, actually, we are facing high component price environment. So how we improve or maintain our gross margin even with this high component price? This is my first question. And then my second question is related to your new -- not new, actually, the strategy on the Device + Cloud and infrastructure. So maybe can you share or Kirk share more about this maybe cloud or data center strategy to us? I think this is also something long-time investors are really focused on.",128

Memories, DRAM is becoming already quite stable. Of course, you have an impact at the beginning because you always need a couple of quarter to adjust the price. You cannot adjust price overnight. But I think we will continue to see a certain impact probably for 1 or 2 quarters, and then I think we should be back to normal, same thing, because you can adjust price. On the other side, I think it's -- from one side, it's an issue, from another side, it's an opportunity because with our scale, I think we are not suffering in terms of shortage at all. We can deliver whatever we need to deliver in terms of product. While some small competitors, they may really suffer in terms of availability.",176

The first is Device + Cloud. The second one is the Infrastructure + Cloud. So I will talk a little bit about the first part. Kirk, you can talk the infrastructure. So actually, so what's the Device + Cloud strategy? And so, actually, we think -- so you know Lenovo was a PC company, but the PC at that time, is personal computer. So we think in the future, PC will be the personal computing devices. It means it's not just a PC. It should include tablet and detachable, et cetera. It also include the smart speaker, so we just launched Smart TV and even VR/AR devices, so that kind of smart devices. So that's the broad PC reach. Meanwhile, we will give the cloud and the AI, artificial intelligence, wing to all these kinds of devices. So for example, PC today is not always connected. So we will leverage our Lenovo Connect. So virtual operator, so virtual SIM card business to drive the PC to be always connected. So our PC users will be our monthly or daily active users. So -- and also, we give the Lenovo Companion as a service to each of our PC users to help them to optimize their PC to kill the virus and then to call our call center so very easily. So that's how we give the cloud wing to the devices over time, definitely, so we can recommend the other applications and the contents to our PC, tablet, smart speaker users. So that's how we give the cloud wing to the device -- to our devices' users, definitely. So over time, we can add the artificial intelligence to each of the devices so that personal computing will further evolve into the personalized devices -- personal cloud, we are further evolving to the personalized cloud. So that's our strategy on the Device + Cloud. So we have made a lot of progress. So some product will be launched in this fiscal year, and some more are still in the development.",353

Around the infrastructure, I think we see a world of, obviously, public cloud or hyperscale designs but also a growing requirement for enterprises that were traditionally using traditional infrastructure that are moving to software-defined. I would say, if you talk to the largest CIOs in the world, the biggest global accounts in the world, this is our fastest-growing market, so we were up 16% year-on-year. The reason is people don't see us as Lenovo with legacy. We don't have a big legacy router business or a big legacy storage business. We're off promoting the transition to hyperconverged and composable infrastructure. So we have been very fast-growing in the global 500 accounts, our fastest-growing region. In hyperscale, we are not competing with our customers. Some of our largest competitors, especially here in China, have chosen to go into the cloud and compete directly with the customers. Our strategy is to build the infrastructure for our customers. So we have a new Vice President of Hyperscale that we -- was one of the founders of Wiwynn, knows how to run this business very efficiently. And we're changing our business model. Unlike this past fiscal year, we're going to be building our own motherboards, putting those motherboards into our own factories and engaging in deep engineering, not just with the China hyperscale accounts like Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, but we're also predicting rapid expansion into some of the largest hyperscalers on the West Coast of the United States as well, as well as helping the Chinese hyperscalers as they grow globally into Europe and North America. So I think we should -- we expect with this new business model better profitability in the current fiscal year than we saw last year.",288

Thank you for joining us today. During our last earnings release in May, I talked about our 3-wave strategy. We will maintain the leading profitability and the market position of the first wave, PC business, in order to fuel the growth of the second wave, Mobile and the Data Center businesses. At the same time, we will invest in the third wave of Device + Cloud and the Infrastructure + Cloud to capture next-generation opportunities brought by new technologies, like artificial intelligence, for long-term success.
Last quarter, while the PC, smartphone and the server markets all showed very slow growth, our overall performance was stable. We sustained our revenue year-on-year at USD 10 billion. Although we are at a net loss, our operational pretax income improved USD 110 million quarter-to-quarter. To me, this result is still far from ideal. However, if you ask whether I'm satisfied with the execution of our management team, my answer will be a firm yes. Not only satisfied, I'm now even more confident in the direction of our strategy and our execution. I believe you would also agree if you look into the details of our report. We have made solid progress in every front. In fact, I believe Lenovo has entered a new phase of growth, and we should see sustained improvement in the following quarters or even years.
In PC business, in order to preserve profitability, we dropped some low-margin deals, such as Chromebook deal, which helped improve our average selling price by 7% year-on-year. Our total revenue year-on-year was stable. Despite the increase in component cost, we maintained industry-leading profit margin of 4.2%. This defensive battle of PC business has not been easy, but we were able to provide the resources and the time for the new businesses to build a solid foundation. 
Our Mobile business keeps improving. In the past year, we've continued to build the competitiveness in our global branding, product portfolio, channel and organization. Strong growth continues in Latin America with 15 points premium to the market. We also made progress in the channels of mature markets. Western Europe achieved a breakthrough growth of 137% year-on-year. In the U.S., we have launched the new flagship products with all 4 major carriers, and we will no doubt see stronger results very soon. As a result, our revenue outgrew the market year-on-year according to IDC data. Our margins improved 2.2 points year-on-year. Going forward, we will refine our business model in emerging markets, especially key markets in Asia Pacific. We are definitely on track to deliver our commitment to breakeven in the second half of this fiscal year. 
In our Data Center business, our execution is also gaining traction. Starting from second half of last year, we restructured our Data Center business to give independent and to add accountability. We acquired many new talents, including dedicated sales force and experienced leaders. In June, we had a successful launch of our most comprehensive Data Center product lines in our history. In fact, we are already shipping new products with the next-generation Intel platform in large volume. Lenovo is recognized as an industry leader in customer satisfaction, reliability and the performance by TBR, ITIC and the various industry benchmarks. Know that we have better handle of the business operation. For the first time since the acquisition of System X, server revenue year-on-year grew in the 2 largest data center markets, North America and EMEA, by more than 12% each and outgrew the IDC market forecast by almost 17 and 19 points, respectively. In the future, we will continue to refine our hyperscale business model and invest in network and storage attached as well as new areas, such as software-defined and 5G. We are confident that this business will continue to improve and start contributing profit in 2 years. 
In the third wave, we also made good progress. Last month, at our annual flagship event, Lenovo Tech World in Shanghai, we shared our vision in artificial intelligence and showcased progress in Device + Cloud, Infrastructure + Cloud. Innovative products were demonstrated, including SmartCast, the next generation of smart assistant; SmartVest, the health monitoring smart wear; daystAR, the AR glasses to assist the industry of maintenance; and smart services, the AI-powered customer service chatbot as well as industry vertical solutions for manufacturing, health care and municipal operation. The feedback has been exceedingly positive. 
Beyond executing our 3-wave strategy, we also made progress in our customer-centric transformation. We created a set of quantitative metrics to measure our progress and to take guided actions. Last quarter, the number of registered Lenovo ID users reached 225 million, up 50% year-on-year, out of which a number of monthly active users reached 90 million. The revenue from repurchase by the registered user increased 12% quarter-to-quarter, and our total non-device revenue reached $400 million and is still growing. All of this solid progress in execution leads me to believe that although our performance is not yet ideal, we are approaching the turning point. As the 2 new engines gain speed, sustainable results will soon follow. We also believe the fiscal year 2017 will be a year of growth for Lenovo. 
Now let me turn it to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",874
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2017",2017-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3111.0,1284760.0,51921536.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2018. 
Next chart, please. For quarter 1 financial year '18, revenue was $10 billion, approximately flat year-on-year even though markets remain challenging. Gross profit declined 11% year-on-year, impacted largely by component supply constraint with cost increases across various products. This issue has a relatively bigger impact on us due to our larger exposure in commercial segment in our PC and Data Center businesses as customer usually have long-term fixed price contracts. Operating expenses increased 6% to $1.4 billion, mainly due to the inclusion of gain on property disposal of $129 million booked in the same period last year that resulted in lower expenses. Excluding the gain, expenses remained largely flat year-on-year. As Yuanqing mentioned, our focus on strategy execution resulted in an operational improvement quarter-on-quarter in Q1 financial year '18. Profit before noncash M&A accounting charges was $5 million, an improvement of $110 million from quarter 4 last year. The improvement was mainly due to the improvement of our DCG and MBG businesses during the quarter. DCG resumed its revenue momentum, especially in North America and EMEA, while improving its margin performance quarter-to-quarter. Our Mobile business continues as year-on-year revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter with profitability improvement, both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter. Meanwhile, our PCSD business continues stable revenue performance and maintain industry-leading profitability despite the market decline.
Next chart, please. Cash flow from operations for the quarter 1 financial '18 was an outflow of $577 million against an inflow of $8 million in the previous years. The changes are mainly due to a reduction of profitability year-on-year as well as an increase in holding components inventory in quarter 1. The change of net cash position was largely due to the increase of working capital for our action to increase the component inventory level during the quarter. The decrease in bank deposit and cash was mainly due to the repayment of the Google promissory note during the quarter. Our net debt at the end of the quarter 1 fiscal year '18 was $1.3 billion against $1.2 billion in the previous year. We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In Q1, it was negative 15 days, an improvement of 15 days year-on-year.
Next chart, please. The industry-wide increase in key component costs impacted various businesses in quarter 1, although we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts. During the quarter, the market remained challenging due to negative year-on-year growth, especially -- an approximately 10% drop in China and the industry-wide component cost hype. The group continued to focus on protecting revenue and profit. In the PC + tablet market, Lenovo remained as a top player with share gains in Asia Pacific and EMEA regions. Revenue in quarter 1 remained flat year-on-year and increased 5% quarter-to-quarter at $7 billion. We continue to focus on protecting revenue and profit performance by driving better product mix, which resulted in an improvement in average selling price. Pretax income was $291 million, and profitability maintained at industry-leading level of PTI margin at 4.2%.
Next chart, please. The group continues its strong sales momentum in markets outside of China in quarter 1. We recorded strong business growth in Latin America and in Western Europe. Our innovative products, like Moto Z and Moto Mods, achieved its target of 3 million units in first 12 months since launch. We launched a second-generation Moto Z² during the quarter, while the mainstream product portfolio continued to deliver strong shipments contribution. With a strong momentum from Latin America and Western Europe, our revenue grew year-on-year for the second consecutive quarter at $1.7 billion. PTI margin also improved more than 2 percentage points, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, thanks to a better product mix from the market outside China and the losses narrowed in China. PTI margin improved even though we made more marketing investment in the quarter.
Next chart, please. Our transformation action continued to work well in Data Center business in quarter 1 and showed signs of stabilization, especially in North America and EMEA. We continue to record double-digit growth in our global account businesses and are the fastest-growing, high-performance computer provider globally. We gained traction in the HPC at ISC 2017 in Germany and are currently worldwide #2 and China #1 on the top 500 customers. We recently installed the largest supercomputer in the world, our next-generation Intel platform, at Barcelona Supercomputer Center. The group also launched the largest product portfolio in its history with comprehensive offerings to address a wider range of market opportunities. The new ThinkSystem have the most world record benchmark in the industry, which is a testament to the excellence in our product performance and quality. Revenue from Data Center Group improved 14% quarter-on-quarter to $971 million. We begin to see positive impacts from our transformation actions, especially in the America and EMEA, which, for the first time, showed positive year-to-year growth in revenue since the acquisition. China business remained challenging, and together with the increase in key component cost, we recorded an operating loss of $114 million in the quarter, although we have an improvement in profit margin. 
Looking ahead, we expect the industry-wide supply constraint and cost increases in key components to continue to bring challenges to the group short-term business performance. The group will continue to execute its strategy diligently to drive sustainable profitable growth over time. For PCSD, we will focus on protecting its profitability and attack targeted markets and segments to drive long-term growth. The group will continue to improve its supply chain and manufacturing efficiency, together with its customer-centric segment structure to launch more innovative products and to address opportunities in the fast-growing segments and vertical markets. For the Mobile business, we'll continue building the brand and expanding our business in all geographies. We will leverage our new innovative product portfolio; continue our strong business momentum in Latin America, carrier expansion in mature market and balance between growth and profit in emerging markets, including China. For Data Center business, our new ThinkSystem has earned 43 new world record benchmarks, demonstrating our attention to quality and innovation. We have also demonstrated our rapid time-to-market capability as we already started shipping ThinkSystem servers with the next-generation Intel Xeon scalable processor. We'll continue to implement our transformation strategy, sharpen the focused end-to-end organization and invest in enhancing sales and channel coverage to drive future business growth. These transformation strategies will require time to be effective, but we remain confident of driving the DCG business through profitable growth over time. 
For our third wave strategy, we have recently teamed up with Disney to launch our new augmented reality handset for the new Star Wars experience. We'll continue to invest in technology. Indeed, we have already attracted some industry top talents, including Dr. Hans Uszkoreit and Dr. Xu Feiyu to join Lenovo to help develop our artificial intelligence capability. Despite challenging market conditions in the short term, the group now has reached a turning point with stronger and better customer-focused organization and a more compelling product portfolio across all our businesses, enabling us to address more market opportunities. Together with our competitive cost structure and solid execution, we are confident to continue our quarterly profit improvements. Meanwhile, we'll also continue to look for inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market position. We remain confident in our vision and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth.

I understand your question. Because I think in quarter 4, there is a property gain of $218 million, and there is also a restructuring, Arthur, of $27 million -- $24 million that actually was the operational loss that really get down to a pretax income. So if you start at quarter 4 last year, so if you take out the property gain, add back the restructuring charge, add back the noncash accounting charges, that actually has an operating loss of $105 million versus $5 million this quarter, and that's a result -- that's what we said, that [ we actually ] from quarter-to-quarter, I think the company has improved $110 million operationally.",118

Do we need revenue growth in -- on a year-on-year basis or volume growth in second half to get to that mobile turnaround? Or is it mainly coming from gross margin improvement and OpEx cuts? The second one is, are we -- in the Data Center business, given that most of the growth seems to be coming from hyperscale and enterprise seems to be declining based on what Intel has been saying, can you talk a little bit about what is the hyperscale strategy for Lenovo? And what is the mix of hyperscale right now? And where do you expect that to go, let's say, once this transformation is completed?",129

So we definite -- for MBG, we definitely expect that we will increase our revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So actually, I think sort of current quarter, so definitely second half as well, because first, now we have very fine Latin America. So last quarter, we see more than 50% year-on-year growth in Latin America, so in both top line and the bottom line. And also, we -- in the past, we've had only one partner in U.S., which was Verizon. So -- but this year, so we have rented our Moto product in all 4 carriers in U.S. So we believe we will see a significant year-on-year revenue growth in North America since current quarter because we just started the late expansion -- we just started selling all 4 carriers in the U.S. So we -- since a couple of quarters ago, so we have successfully expanded into Western Europe. So actually, last quarter, you can see the triple digit growth in Western Europe. So we believe this trend will continue. So that's why I believe our top line will keep growing. The even better thing is in all these 3 areas, Latin America, North America and Western Europe, they are more profitable geographies. So we have a better chance to not just grow this year, grow the volume, but also to improve the profitability. So actually, our challenge is about the -- is not in these geographies. So it's in India, Asia Pacific. So definitely, we can grow our share there, but I don't think it is easy to maximize. So actually, in those geographies, our decision is we [ match ] the balance, the growth and the profitability. So if we cannot improve the profitability, so we will mitigate the loss. So we will not drive the growth there. So that's our strategy, how to ensure we can break even in the second half. So -- but actually, in full year, we can make money. So actually, it's relying on the revenue or volume growth as well. But it's in the 3 geographies. Regarding of the Data Center business, as you can see from our report, so we will make good progress in North America and EMEA. These 2 markets actually represent more than 60% of the task -- of the total data center market. So that's a very encouraging improvement. So we grow our revenue 12% year-on-year in each of these 2 geographies. And also, we improved margin as well in these 2 geographies quarter-to-quarter. Definitely, the -- now the biggest -- the issue is hyperscale. We can -- particularly hyperscale business in China. We definitely can do more business with the [ IDC ] players, but I don't think with our kind of business model, we can make money. Actually, we lost a lot of money in that business. So actually, last quarter, we tried to mitigate it as a loss. So we gave up a lot of deals in the hyperscale area in the past. But now we are fixing this issue. We try to build a more competitive hyperscale business. We should do more in-house development and in-house manufacturing in that space. We must build the customer relation capability so -- to support our customer better. So that's what we are doing. So over time -- so definitely, I believe we can build the competitive business model in the hyperscale to compete with those Chinese players. So that's my comment on the Data Center business. But the -- generally speaking, so now we can handle this Data Center business better than 2 years ago. We have accumulated more experience. So I think they see [ us still ] a good direction, good strategy we should pursue. So -- but we still need some time to build this foundation. So we give this business 2 years to be profitable. So actually, so if you compare DCG with MBG -- so MBG issue emerged in the year before last year. So we use the almost -- the 2 years with the 6 quarters to fix the issue. So now I'm very confident that we can turn around this business in the second half of the year. So for the DCG business, the issue emerged last year. So definitely, management has deep-dived into the business after we found the issue. And now, while North America and EMEA see the positive momentum up, I think mainly because of 2 reasons: the first thing is that we have built the new organization, the dedicated end-to-end organization to take charge of the DCG business, rather than we share the resources with the PC. And also, we have hired many sales support in key countries or geographies. So that's the first reason. The second reason is our product is still strong. So we have the better technology. So we -- for example, we are the first company to launch the next generation of Intel [ chipset ] product. So that -- and also, our product reputation has already been strong. So our reliability, quality are always #1 in the industry based on some surveys so -- I talked to that through the opening part. So that definitely gave us a lot of confidence. We built a strong foundation here and [indiscernible] much of a turnaround as it's been, but we will drive the growth. Thank you.",904

Can you talk a little bit about the results that you're seeing in North America and EMEA? I think you're seeing very strong quarter-on-quarter growth. You've been adding a lot of account managers. Can you maybe just share with us the types of customers you're winning, the types of accounts? Are these Fortune 500? Is this a product of channel expansion, direct sales force? Just a little bit more color around the types of accounts and wins you're seeing in North America and EMEA. That's my first question. The second, if I may, is just about the new Purley platform.

I think, generally, I think we definitely been doing, I think -- well, I think, in the past -- well, for the last 1 or 2 quarters, we've actually been doing very well in our global accounts given the slow growth. I think the other is really the -- I think the -- I will say the large customers as far as SMB, I think, which is obviously the area that, I think with increasing workforce, we are going to increase the coverage. So I would say, generally, I think the dedicated workforce, I think that we do have over time, begin to see the result. As you know, I think enterprise business, you don't necessarily deploy the sales force and then see the result immediately because you obviously need to sell the solution. So I would say global accounts, we have been doing well even in the last few quarters. I think [ which we actually call out ] . I think that we begin to see the result. I think it's general, I would say, enterprise customers. There is no specific, I think, industry or category that we particularly excel, but generally, I think it's really the result of deployment of the resources. And in terms of product?

I think, Thompson, maybe one of the -- I think we obviously believe that we've been doing well ahead of our competitors. I think as far as we know, I think we actually have nearly 48 products, which obviously is the, I think, highest volume. I think that's also been confirmed by, I think, the supplier that we obviously have the largest portfolio. So we begin to ship, and then hopefully, that we will see the result. I think when you ship, you obviously have a testing and then I think the real business will come and hopefully, I think, we track in the Q3. That's the reason why we believe that I think with all the transformation work that we have been doing, I think, over the last 6 months, I think during [indiscernible] accounts, listening to customers, getting the products. Now, the new platform actually now become available and this is where we are going to, I think, demonstrate our capabilities serving our customers, and hopefully that will reflect in the numbers and continue to grow in both the mature market North America as well as, I think, in EMEA.",193

So B2B business is -- should be much easier business than B2C business. So definitely, if you want to make this business profitable, you might accumulate the customer base. So I believe we need at least 2 years to accumulate our customer base. But definitely, we have inherited from IBM to get some customer base. But definitely, we have lost some -- we need to further acquire some more customers. Then after that, given we have the stronger product in the portfolio. Actually, we have the most trusted, the most reliable brand in this industry. And also, we have a good cost structure. So I strongly believe we can make better margin in this business if you compare with our PC business. So that's the logic. So definitely -- so I talked about the 2 years. So Lenovo management has always been conservative. So definitely, we expect we can see the improvement every quarter, so quarter by quarter. So I believe in North America and EMEA, so you can track the progress every quarter already. And also, I believe Asia -- so actually, Asia Pacific has been our most profitable geography in the past couple of quarters. So that means whole rest of world are okay now. So we can have very different gross margin or even the gross margin can be improved. And meanwhile, we can see the top left of revenue growth in all these geographies. We now -- the main issue is that we need to fix the China hyperscale. So we need to improve this business. If we want to improve the business, we need to sharpen our business model. So actually, I don't think that our past business model has supported this business because our -- the cost is very high -- is way too high. So we need to build the most in-house development and the manufacturing capability. We must build the better customization capability in that space. You need to take some time, but we are definitely taking action to fix that. So that's about our Data Center business.",365

I think we obviously -- as Yuanqing said, that we've been -- I think the cost of breakeven really comprises of Q1, obviously, will continue to grow our business. As demonstrated in the current quarter, we begin to see, I think, 2 of the 3 largest markets, North America, Europe, we already see year-to-year growth. I think we are getting better momentum. I think the other is really improvement in the gross margin, because we will focus more on apart from just selling servers, we are selling more storage and more networking as far as services. As a result, we actually will continue to see -- hopefully, that gives you an improvement in gross margin as a result of the top line and that road to breakeven. So we are putting up the sales capability by having a more sort of dedicated sales force, begin to see result in Europe and North America, and then we are taking actions to address the hyperscale issue. We are taking more focus in selling more attach, storage attach network in attach services, that has improving in gross profit, and then holding the -- I think the [indiscernible] probably to have further decrease because of the top line increase, and hence, this is the road to breakeven.",223

So as I already said, to build our new business, our new growth engine to integrate the acquisition. So it's not easy. You need to take some time. So actually, we found the issue for our Mobile business earlier. So actually, 2 years ago. So we found the problem. Then we took the action to build the stronger organization, to build the stronger leadership team and to build the stronger product portfolio, brand, et cetera, et cetera.

Welcome to Lenovo's Quarter 2 Result Webcast. This is [ Yu Hu ], VP in Finance at Lenovo. 
Before we start, let me introduce our management team with us today. We have our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yang Yuanqing; our Corporate President and COO, Mr. Gianfranco Lanci; and our CFO, Mr. Wai Ming Wong. We will first start with our management presentation. After that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing.",81
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2461.0,1333567.0,53537560.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Thank you, for joining us today. This past quarter we continued to transform our business by executing our 3-level strategy. Our revenue grew almost the 5% year-on-year to reach nearly USD 12 billion. Our pretax income was USD 35 million, improved more than USD 100 million quarter-to-quarter. Benefiting from tax credits, our net income stayed USD 153 million, flat year-on-year.
For the first wave, our PC business, while we maintained industry-leading profitability, our revenue outgrow the bucket, especially in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa. In China, under new leadership, the momentum has returned to growth. In fact, all geographies were profitable this past quarter.
We also maintained growth in high-growth segments, such as detachable, workstation and the Millennium PC. Even in the shrinking tablet market, our volume has grown almost the 9% year-on-year, and we have reached our record-high market share. This proves how our innovation and efficiency are effective in the scale business.
In the future, we will continue to leverage market consolidation to retain leadership in profitability and market position. The joint venture with Fujitsu we announced today we will further grow our business in Japan, the third-largest of PC market and globally as we leverage its scale efficiencies. Meanwhile, we were also investing high-growth segments under new emerging areas to drive future growth.
For the second wave, we are building data center in the mobile businesses into new growth engines. In Data Center business, we have been building a solid foundation and our transformation is well on track. We not only maintained the leading position in high-performance computing and the traditional data center infrastructure but also strengthen the technology and the products in software-defined hyperscale, storage and the networking.
Our investment in the sales force since last year has taken effect in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Well, revenue year-on-year continued to grow for the second consecutive quarter, and the profitability also improved. In China, after restructure and strengthening our leadership team and the product competitiveness, we saw quarter improvement in revenue, a sign of turning around.
We are confident that this business is on track to return to profitable growth. We will continue to invest in this business to realize this high-growth potential.
In Mobile business, the turnaround is well in process as well. In most markets, last quarter, we saw strong premier to market growth year-on-year, especially Latin America and the mature market outgrow the market by around 66 points, respectively.
Emerging markets, despite the fierce competition by Chinese players, we continued healthy growth in Asia Pacific, especially in India. In the high end of smartphone segment, we will continue to build the competitiveness to enable break-through and fully execute our strategy for profitable growth.
In the future, we will continue to execute our peer strategy for our Mobile business, strengthening our leading position and the profitability in Latin America, aggressively drive break-through in mature markets, including North America and Western Europe. And in the short term, maintain healthy growth with controlled investment in emerging markets.
In the third wave, we also met a good progress as we continued to invest in Device+Cloud, in technologies like artificial intelligence, smart office, smart home and AR/VR to capture future growth.
Our first AR wearable product, the Star Wars AR headset has been on the shelf for the coming holiday season. 
In the past several quarters, I know that our performance was not as good as expected, and it may have raised some concerns, but I want to share with you that the Lenovo is a company that pursue deep thinking, hard work and persistence. Once we decide on the direction, we would never give up. We will keep refining our approach and executing persistently until we find the right place to accomplish our goal.
I want to share a story as an example. Brazil is known to be a very tough market with a double-digit interest rate, a complex tax system and an extremely volatile exchange rate. Not many multinational companies can succeed in Brazil. But as one of the top 10 economies in the world, it is a market that we were determined to win. Over many years, we tried approaches running from acquisition to sellout, from outsourcing to in-house manufacture, from expatriate to local leadership, from unified to customized product portfolio. We ran into many obstacles along the way, but we never give up, and we kept refining our business model. 
In the last 3 years, performance started to gradually improve. Today, our PC market share reached almost 20%. We outgrew the market by more than 80 points last quarter and have become profitable again after 7 years of continuous losses.
Our smartphone business outgrow the market by 26 points year-on-year. Our market share reached almost 23%, strengthening our position as a rising #2 player. Since the third quarter of last fiscal year, it has become not only profitable but also the profit engine for our Mobile business. In the future, we will continue our persistent execution to bring the same breakthroughs to India, Japan, U.S., Russia and the [ mo ] markets. In the past 2 years, our data center and the Mobile businesses were also learning and refining execution.
But now, I'm confident to say that we are on the right path and that the performance will follow. The proposed purchase of Lenovo shares by our top management also demonstrates our commitment and the confidence for the future for our company. So here, I will repeat what I said last quarter: Lenovo has ended a new phase of growth, and we should see sustained improvement in the following quarters or even years.
Now let me turn you to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",960
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2461.0,1333567.0,53537561.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. Now I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q2 fiscal year 2018.
Next chart please. Firstly, let me share with you financial highlights for the Q2 performance. For Q2 FY '18, we delivered solid group revenue growth and continue our profit improvement quarter-to-quarter. Revenue was USD 11.8 billion, increasing 5% year-on-year and 17% quarter-to-quarter as our PC's SD business continued to drive premium revenue growth to the market. The transformation in our Data Center business remained on track and stabilized revenue quarter-to-quarter, and our Mobile business also showed strong revenue growth momentum.
Gross profit increased by 0.3% year-on-year and 18% for the quarter, while gross margin increased quarter-to-quarter to 13.7%. The improvement in Data Center business gross margin as a result of better product mix helped to offset the impact of component-cost increase.
Operating expenses increased by 10% to USD 1.5 billion, largely due to the increase in advertising and promotion expenses for new smartphone launches in Q2 and the inclusion of the gain in property disposal of USD 206 million booked in the same period of the previous year that resulted in lower expenses.
Pretax income was $35 million in Q2, an improvement of $104 million quarter-to-quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by profit improvement from our PCSD business, while the losses in both our DCG and MPG businesses continued to narrow.
In Q2, PCSD management improved profit margin quarter-to-quarter despite the component cost hype. The transformation actions in DCG started to take effect in Q2. We further improved our product mix with the launch of our most comprehensive product portfolio, resulting in a solid profit improvement, especially from mature markets. Our Mobile business continued a strong profit performance in Latin America, while China profitability stabilized.
In Q2, we recorded a net tax credit of USD 180 million due to losses incurred in our mobility and data center businesses. As such, profit after tax for Q2 is $153 million comparing with loss after tax of $34 million reported in Q1. 
The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.06, representing the same level of interim dividend paid last year.
Next chart please. Cash flow from operations improved quarter-to-quarter to $364 million in Q2, again, an outflow of $577 million in Q1. The change was mainly driven by the improvement in operational performance as well as better-working capital position against the previous quarter. However, compared to the stronger operating cash position a year ago, the change was partially due to the lower profitability year-on-year and increasing component inventory holding in this quarter as we continue the buy ahead activities to mitigate the impact of component cost hike.
Our net debt at the end of Q2 fiscal year '18 was  $1.4 billion against $77 million in the previous year. The year-on-year change was mainly due to the fact that we paid down the $1.5 billion promissory notes to Google earlier this year that resulted in a lower cash flow compared to a year ago. We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In Q2, it was negative 14 days, an improvement of 9 days year-to-year.
Next chart, please. For PC and Smart Device Business Group, global PC market showed further signs of stabilization during the quarter despite the continued industry-wide component cost hike in Q2. The group PCSD team demonstrated its solid execution and achieved record-high market share in EMEA and continued to gain share in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
PC business in China also regained its momentum for this reason: channel-enhancement actions. We continue to see strong growth in fast-growing segments, including workstations, detachable and Millennial PC. As a result, we recorded a premium-to-market revenue growth in almost all geographies. Revenue in Q2 thus increased by 7% year-on-year and 20% quarter-to-quarter to $8.4 billion, helped by an ASP increase that was up 6% year-on-year due to more innovative products and a better product mix. 
The business was profitable across all the geographies. Pretax income was $367 million, up 26% quarter-to-quarter, faster than our revenue growth during the quarter, which is up 20% quarter-to-quarter. PTI margin improved by 0.2 percentage point quarter-to-quarter to 4.4%.
Next chart, please. Our transformation in the Data Center business are well on track. For the first time since the acquisition of System X, we continue to see revenue increase year-on-year in North America and EMEA for the second consecutive quarters, where they contributed to the profitability and improvement both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter in our business outside of China. Our transformation actions in China including strengthening our sales capability also started to gain effect in Q2 with quarter-to-quarter revenue improvement.
Our product segments performance. We continue to record double-digit growth in our global account business and remain the fastest-growing high-performance computer provider globally. 
Margin in our hyperscale business has also improved due to better product mix and new customer wins. We now have the most comprehensive product portfolio in history, and we'll also secure 43 world-record benchmark on our new ThinkSystem, the most awarded [ 886 ] vendor in the industry.
Revenue from Data Center business continue to see quarter-on-quarter improvement for the second consecutive quarter to $976 million. Although, we still reported an operating loss of $100 million in the quarter with our previous efforts, including the end-to-end organization structure and the fast time-to-market product launches. Our operational PTI margin further improved by 1.4 percentage points quarter-to-quarter.
We continue our strong sales momentum market. Sales are up in China in Q2. We recorded strong shipments growth and gained significant market share in Latin America, North America and Western Europe, driven mainly by our mainstream product of Moto E and G.
Our new Moto Z 2, who has started to expand his footprint into more telecom areas in mature markets in Q2. We also achieved healthy growth in emerging markets, including India, where we increased market share in Q2.
In China, we are focused in building multiple channels and prepare for new product launches, such as for Moto Z 2. Revenue grew year-on-year for the third consecutive quarter to $2.1 billion. Operational PTI margin also improved 1.1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter, thanks to the margin improvement in Asia Pacific. However, we recorded  $132 million operational PTI loss largely due to increased investments in marketing and promotion for new product launches during the quarter.
Looking ahead. We can see our transformation is taking effect, and we believe our overall performance will continue to improve quarter-on-quarter, although, the supply constraint and cost hikes in certain key components may continue to bring challenges to the group's short-term business performance, especially in our second half for MBG and PCG. We'll continue to execute our strategy diligently to drive sustainable profitable growth over time.
For PCSD, we have just announced a formation of joint venture with Fujitsu, which further strengthens our leading position as the industry consolidation trend continues and will help to improve our position in the premium segment as Japan is the third-largest PC market with the highest average selling price. This joint venture will be mutually beneficial through synergies in scaling complementary product lines and R&D capabilities.  We'll aim to maintain our industry-leading profitability and drive growth in fast-growing market segments. We'll continue to improve our user experience by leveraging our customer-centric segment structure, innovative products and general reform to drive future growth.
For Data Center business, our transformation is on track. We're aiming to continue improve both revenue and profit quarter-to-quarter. We've turned more proactive in pursuing opportunities in the hyperscale business with our unique business model. We continue to demonstrate our rapid time-to-market capability of the new Purley product rollout and are ahead of our competitors. Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen our leadership in high-performance computing, software defined infrastructure and drive faster growth in the hyperconverged product segment.
For Mobile business, we will continue our investment to grow the branded and expand our business in all geographies. We will protect our leading position and profitability in Latin America, attacking the mature markets such as North America and Western Europe and pursue healthy growth in key emerging markets.
Looking forward, we see challenges such as cost increase and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers in major market. However, we'll continue to drive better margin performance and achieve profitable position over time.
In conclusion, market competition remain fierce in the short term. However, the group now has a more customer-focus organization and more compelling product portfolio across all our businesses, enabling us to address more market opportunities. Coupled with our competitive cost structure and solid execution capability, we are confident that our quarter-to-quarter profit improvement will continue. The reason share subscription proposal by Legion holdings and the company's senior management team, subject to approval by independent shareholders, also demonstrate our confidence in the future prospect of the company. We remain confident in our vision and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth.

I think that you are right, market is still slightly declining in [ CA. ] But when you look at PC market, it's growing in revenue. But we've been able to outgrow the market by more than 5 points, right. And in this coming, I would say, from all the geo, EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, we have seen a good comeback in China. We are still fixing some few things in U.S. I would say it, but mainly due to the -- with the [ fight ] in U.S. to step back from low end acquisition business that it's big in terms of [ CA ]. But not really good in terms of profitability. So growth is coming mainly from mid-end and high end from premium, and this is the main reason of the revenue growth. So much better mix and much better [ AUI. ] Looking at this quarter, I think we see a similar trend. On top of your working in order to also come back in U.S. to a better growth and to a more solid growth in terms of mix and premium. We still see some component shortage issue, but we should be able to manage through the quarter as well as some component that still is slightly going up. We think that we probably change starting from next calendar year. But I think we have seen a good momentum in all the geo. We continue to see good momentum also this quarter in all this year, I would say, including U.S.",258

So adding to Gianfranco's answer. So I think Lenovo is definitely strong in our PC business of this kind of volume business. So actually, we are -- we grow faster in a hyper-growth area, such as workstation, detachable on the Millennium PC, gaming PC, even in the shrinking tablet market. So the market dropped almost 10% year-on-year. But our volume also grew 9% year-on-year. So that proves our business model are really effective in this kind of a scale business.",81

While I think the loss is understandable because of spending on the sales and marketing. But it seems that revenue growth is a little bit short of expectation.

So now -- Latin America definitely has become our stronghold. So that will be our first priority to protect or to strengthen our leadership position in Latin America regarding of the market share as well as the profitability there. So we should pursue the profitable growth in that geography. Then, our second priority will be attacking mature markets, definitely. So we should be focusing on North America and Western Europe because, in those markets, so actually our competition is not that fierce. So the -- and also, partly too, it's larger than in emerging markets. So -- the emerging markets -- so we -- we have a lot of competitors from China. So definitely, the margin, the profitability is not as good as in mature markets. So our emerging-market strategy is we want to pursue the healthy growth with a controlled investment in those market. So that, in the short term, we will pay less attention to the volume growth to the market share in emerging markets. So definitely, improving the profitability or to turn around the business is today our first priority. So we believe -- so quarter-over-quarter, so we will see the improvement. So that's about our MBG business.",215

I think if you really look at rest of the world, we're actually outgrow the market in terms of market share. I think we are growing, I think, quarter-to-quarter by 20% and year-to-year by 6-something percent while the market is actually about 4% or 5%. So we actually outgrow. The reason you may have me just read the number because we obviously have a strategy of contain our investment in China. So if you take out China, in fact, we actually outgrow the market.",114

Actually, we grew more than 60% year-on-year in Latin America. We grew more than 60% in North America and Western Europe as well. So that's  pretty dramatic achievement. But definitely, it's mainly driven by mainstream and entry level of product. We still needed to [ shuffle ] to strengthen our premier price and product. So definitely, if we can have the stronger premier price and product, that will help us to further improve the profitability.",96

It is actually a question for Kirk because I think, during the presentation, the management mentioned there was some improvement in the product mix for the hyperscale. And actually, Lenovo has really improved their position outside of China. So can you elaborate about what was the change in the product mix? And I thought at one point hyperscale's profitability was a bit low, and that was not really the direction that we wanted to pursue. So it sounds like you found a better approach. And it seems that the potential is actually not really that -- in terms of this progress-wise, it's still one area that we want to invest. So it will be good if you could help to elaborate on that?",124

So I think our transformation is on track, and I want to be clear that hyperscale and public cloud is a core element of our growth strategy. As Wai said, scale is critical to the Lenovo business model. Part of the transformation we're doing in hyperscale is the transition across the CPU generation from Broadwell to the new Intel Xeon scalable processor. And as Wai said, we're leading that mix we believe relative to our competition. So it was very difficult to change market share when someone had been buying the old product from a competitor of ours for several years. But now that the Purley or Intel Xeon scalable is ramping, we're seeing good share gains across all our segments, including hyperscale. But the business model is also changing. In the previous generation, we basically just took a ODM product. Now we're doing deep engineering collaboration with some of the largest public cloud providers in the world and also putting those products into our own motherboard factories and our own system factories. None of those occurred in the previous generations. So as we moved to the new generation, we believe overall for the DCG business, we should be at almost 50% share mix by the end of calendar quarter to the new processor. And that's where we're seeing the share shift and the profitability improvement, so both the CPU transition and the business model change.",237

So could you elaborate more about component cost? How's that impact on the gross margin of the PC segment?,27

[indiscernible] I think component cost, of course, is slightly impacting the margin because if you look at our margin compared to the last year, it's slightly down. And I would say we have been able to transfer the cost increase to consumer a little bit. It's a little bit more difficult to larger-enterprise customer where we have long-term contract. But you can make a very simple exercise. If you consider that component cost has been going up around $30 during the last 9 months, right, they've been doing more or less during last year or so. But we have not been able to transfer maybe $4 or $5 to that. The main factor is, I think, we have been able to manage the impact very, very well. So it's relativity slow. And moving forward, I think it's becoming even better because also on long-term contract with Enterprise we're probably in a position to increase price.",158

My last question is about Data Center. So just a follow-up on Arthur's point. There's changes in strategy, so you would do more in-house capacity and provide engineering services with data center locally. So how would you be competitive against those competitors, especially Chinese players and also some opponents' ODMs?",54

So this is Kirk again. I think we are benefiting from the scale of having a phone, tablet and PC business when we do our procurement relationship. So we sell 3 to 4 devices per second. Even though, we sell about 100 servers per hour. So we get the benefit, unlike some of our competitors, of having the scale on the PC, tablet and phone side for procurement. But also, I think we have the ability to compete very aggressively even against ODM. So we're not afraid of [ competing ] with ODM for the business because we have global scale in 160 countries. As some of the China hyperscalers grow outside of China they want a company that can grow with them outside of China, and Lenovo is obviously a very global company with 160 countries where we have presence. So we're seeing benefit of growing with the hyperscalers outside China. And with the deep engineering expertise, we also, when we acquired IBM, we got rack-level integration capabilities. So this isn't about selling a pizza box. It's about the complex integration that we're bringing not just to hyperscale but also to supercomputing. Because we're able to cable up the entire machine and sell it a level -- a level 11 kind of integration level. And this is something I think we have a unique differentiation on as well.",230

So we have strong in-house manufacturing capability as well. So definitely, we can easily expand it into the several storage areas.",28
