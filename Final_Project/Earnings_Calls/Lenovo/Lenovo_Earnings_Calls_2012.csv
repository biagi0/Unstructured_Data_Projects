Welcome to Lenovo's Q3 Results Webcast. This is Gary Ng, VP in Investor Relations at Lenovo. Before we start, let me introduce our management team with us today. We have our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yang Yuanqing; our CFO, Mr. Wong Wai Ming. We'll first start with a management presentation. After that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn it over to you Yuanqing.",68
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3095.0,219125.0,12798611.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. We had another record-setting quarter, so let's jump right into it. 
Our strong momentum just got even stronger. Now Lenovo has been the fastest-growing major PC company for 9 quarters. This quarter, we grew 37% year-on-year as the overall market kept flat. The tremendous growth led to our record market share of 14%, record shipments of 13 million units, record revenue of USD $8.4 billion and a record PTI of USD $192 million. We outgrew the market in almost every region, every customer segment and every product segment. For the first time, we are #1 worldwide in commercial PCs and in consumer desktop, and we are closing the gap with the #1 to just 2 points from last year, almost 9 points. 
Meanwhile, even as we continue to invest in innovation and the branding, our E/R ratio dropped almost a point quarter-to-quarter. I especially want to highlight here, we achieved these fantastic results despite our major worldwide hard drive shortage. Our record performance shows Lenovo can turn a crisis into a competitive advantage, further demonstrating our world-class execution capability. 
Now let's look at our strategic areas more closely.  In China, the world's largest PC market, we reached our record market share of over 35% for the first time the highest ever in China market history, and that is larger than the next 4 competitors combined. We significantly outgrew the market while increasing our segment profit by 57% year-on-year. While dominating the PC space, we are already looking ahead, Mobile Internet, server and the service business are our future strategic priorities in China. Actually, we have already made a good progress in these areas. In just a couple of minutes, I will talk more in details about our Mobile Internet business in China.
Now let's look at the rest of the Emerging Markets. We increased our market share by more than a point year-on-year. We grew 23%, much faster than the market rate, and have further strengthened our #1 position in overall global emerging markets. Now we are 6 points ahead of the next competitor. More impressively, we gained share in almost every region. Particularly in India where we gained more than 3 points year-on-year; and in Russia, we increased our market share by 1 point year-on-year. 
We also had another fantastic quarter in Mature Markets. We delivered our record segment profit of USD $109 million, as well as record shipments and the revenue. While both integration with NEC and the Medion are going smoothly, our organic growth was 14 points more than the market. This led to a record higher market share, close to double digits. In Mature Markets, we will continue to leverage our strength in commercial sales and to attacking the consumer space.
Now, our exciting quarter goes beyond the traditional PCs. We also made greater progress in the Mobile Internet space last quarter. In China, we now have our strong Mobile Internet business that keeps getting stronger very fast. Last quarter, we saw hyper-growth in our smartphone business, growing more than 4x quarter-to-quarter. Lenovo sold more than 6.5 million phones in China last quarter and almost half of them are smartphones. Now, our smartphone market share in China has jumped to 10% for the first time in December.
In tablets, we also see strong momentum. Lenovo is now dominating the Android-based segment with over 50% shares in China. Overall, we are strong #2 tablet player with 16.5% of market share. With more innovative products and a clear strategy, we expect our Mobile Internet businesses to keep winning in China and over the next fiscal year, we expect expanding into more overseas markets. 
Like I said before, the foundation of our strong growth is our innovative products. Last month at the Consumer Electronics Show, we unveiled our newest products across many categories. The response was clear. We won 23 awards. That is more than the next 5 competitors combined. Lenovo was absolutely the star of the show. These awards demonstrate not only our innovation capabilities, but also our strategy. Even as we have come very close to the leading position in PCs, we are already thinking ahead and are preparing the next steps beyond the tradition PCs to the Mobile Internet space. We believe Mobile Internet will become our new growth engine to team up with our core PC business. Clearly, our “Protect and Attack” strategy is working very well. Our world-class innovation capability, efficient business model, investments in branding, diverse leadership team and a unified global culture are also major success factors. 
Looking ahead, I want to assure you that Lenovo is deeply committed to the PC industry and optimistic about the future of the PCs. We believe we will continue to outpace the market and are on course to become the leader in our industry. Thank you, everybody. I'll now turn to Wai Ming, our CFO.",812
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3095.0,219125.0,12798612.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for the fiscal quarter 3. 
Next chart, please. Yuanqing just shared with you about our record quarter 3. Group sales in quarter 3 were also at our historic high at $8.4 billion, up about 44% year-to-year. We have consolidated a full quarter of revenue from the NEC joint venture and Medion in the quarter 3 sales revenue. PC sales were up about 34% year-to-year to $7.3 billion. Revenue from the Mobile Internet business was $565 million, up 159% year-to-year. 
The flood in Thailand has resulted in HDD supply shortage, a substantial cost increase in Q3 for the PC industry. We managed to secure the supply to largely meet our customer demand in Q3 and took immediate actions, such as demand conditioning and stringent costs controls to mitigate the HDD cost increase. Our solid execution has successfully turned the industry's HDD shortage crisis into our competitive advantage. 
Our strong shipment growth also help provide better scaling benefits. As a result, our gross margin in Q3 was up to 11.4% from 11.2% last year despite the HDD cost impact, but was down from 12.2% last quarter driven by HDD cost increases, product and regional mix. Gross profit was at $954 million, up about 47% year-to-year. Operating expenses were $761 million, up 45% from last year. The expenses-to-revenue ratio was 9.1%, up 0.1% from last year, but was lower quarter-to-quarter driven by the revenue scaling despite continued investments. 
We continue to invest in product innovation, branding and MIDH business to drive future growth and margin improvement over time. 
Operating profit in Q3 was $193 million, up 55% year-to-year. Pretax income was $192 million, up 59% year-to-year. This is a record high for Lenovo. 
Taxation expense was $38 million, up from $21 million last year and $20 million last quarter. The year-to-year increase was due to our increased operating profit as well as the inclusion of full quarter performance of NEC and Medion, which has relatively higher tax rate compared to the group. The quarter-to-quarter increase was largely due to a lower tax charge in Q2 as a result of a write-back of provisions made in earlier quarters. Nevertheless, the effective tax rate for quarter 3 was around 19.8%, which is still in line with our target of around 20% level for the full year.  The effective tax rate in Q4 will be higher, as Q4 is our typical low season during the year. Basic EPS improved to USD $0.015 from USD $0.0103 last year. 
Next charts, please. Our balance sheet at the end of December remains strong. Noncurrent assets were about $4 billion. The increase from that of 31st March 2011 was due to consolidation of NEC joint venture and Medion into our balance sheet this quarter. Changes in current assets and current liabilities were due largely to increased activities during the quarter, with our current liabilities of around $11.4 billion at the end of December. The noncurrent liabilities were around $1.6 billion.
Next chart, please. Our cash flow and cash conversion cycle continue to be a very healthy in quarter 3. The net cash reserve continued to improve to $3.9 billion against $3.2 billion last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue. We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Inventory days in Q3 was 1 day higher than last year while days receivable increased by 4 days to 34 days, largely due to consolidation of the NEC and Medion this quarter, and our growth in emerging markets outside China. Days payable decreased by 9 days to 6-8 days largely due to shorter payment terms to shore up our HDD supply. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in Q3 was negative 17 days against a negative 31 days last year. 
Next chart, please. We have even more balanced business is in terms of geography after we consolidated the NEC joint venture and Medion. China, we continued to perform well in China and further expanded our market share. PC sales increased 22% year-to-year to about $3 billion. Strong growth in emerging cities in desktop PCs helped drive strong shipments in China. We reached our record high market share ever achieved in China. Indeed, the PC operating margin improved year-to-year to 5.9% due to better scaling and stringent expense control. 
The Mobile Internet business in China is making progress, but we are still making investment in product development, marketing and promotion to drive future growth. Our sales revenue and segmental operating profit in China were at record-high levels in quarter 3, benefited from our continued strong PC performance. 
Emerging market, excluding China. Our expansion in Emerging Markets continue to show good momentum in quarter 3. Sales were up around 13% year-to-year to approximately $1.3 billion, and we recorded operating loss of about $30 million. We continue to invest to expand scale to reach an optimal operating scale in key markets, resulting in margin decline in the short term. But we are pleased to see the increasing number of countries that recorded progress in quarter 3. 
Mature Markets. We continue to record strong growth in Mature Markets, helped by our strong commercial business and increasing momentum in the consumer business. Sales were up over 81% year-to-year to slightly above $3.6 billion. We have included a full quarter performance of our NEC joint venture and Medion in quarter 3. Both have performed better than their respective markets and they were earnings accretive to the group. Excluding the acquisition impact, the organic growth in Mature Markets is around 32% year-to-year. Our U.S. continued to record strong shipment growth at about 40% year-to-year. Operating profits improved to record high level at $109 million, and operating margin also improved to 3% for the quarter. 
Next chart, please. From the product perspective, in quarter 3, we became the largest worldwide commercial PC company for the first time. Both notebook and desktop business continued to outperform their respective markets and achieved record-high market shares. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 41% and 30% year-to-year, respectively. Both our consumer and commercial notebook business show strong growth. Our worldwide notebook market share increased to around 13%, and sustained our position at the largest worldwide commercial notebook player. Unit shipments in sales in our desktop business were up 31% and 39% year-to-year, respectively. 
Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased to around 15%. Our all-in-one product, as well as our sales in China, continue to see good growth momentum. We also became the world's largest consumer desktop company for the first time. 
Finally, sales of Mobile Internet products were up about 159% year-to-year bolstered by strong performance across all our Mobile Internet products, namely smartphone, feature phones and tablet, as Yuanqing said earlier. Our smartphones A60 and P70 received very good market response, while our tablets continue to show good momentum and we are the #2 China tablet vendor. We will continue to adopt a full product portfolio strategy, that is to launch new products targeting a different prices in specific niches to drive future growth. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite uncertainties in the global macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in continuing our trend of outperforming the worldwide PC markets. We believe the balanced nature of our growth that is China, Emerging Markets and Mature Markets will enable Lenovo could continue to outperform the global PC market. Nevertheless, the HDD shortage will continue to affect the global PC supply in quarter 4, and the gap between demand and supply will last through Q4. Even the HDD supply is expected to gradually improve in late quarter 4. As a result, HDD cost will continue to stay high in the short term. We have demonstrated our success in turning this industry shortage into our competitive advantage through effective and flexible tactics to mitigate the shortage impact. We will continue to prioritize our customers, but also to monitor closely the cost efficiency. We will stay focused on the cost initiatives and growth opportunities. We will continue to make opportunistic investments, i.e., to use additional profits above our internal targets to fund the investment in core competence building, product innovation, branding, emerging markets and especially the new MIDH group to drive our future growth. These investment, however, will cause the E/R ratio to increase in quarter 4, which is a typical low season when the ratio will be highest sequentially compared to quarter 3. 
We have a healthy balance sheet. We will continue to be prudent in our cash management and to create shareholder's value and look for M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth. Thank you.",1450

I want to step back to ask a longer-term question. First I want to ask that in 3 years' time, I was wondering what's your goal?

So first -- so we will continue to focus on the traditional PC. So we want to win in this market until we become the leader. So I believe the traditional PC will continue to be our core business. Not only are we will win the commercial PC area, but also we will win the consumer segment. So not only we will win in China, but also we want to win Emerging Markets as well as in Mature Markets. Meanwhile, we will try to attack the new opportunity in Mobile Internet and the Digital Home area as well as -- probably in China, we will try the server and the cost of the box  -- service, cost of the box service. So in short term, I don't think that we are a kind of a bigger exposure of our entire business, Probably Mobile Internet, smartphone and the tablet, we are reaching 10 -- trying to leverage in 3 years. We don't have the exact numbers, that's our expectations.",180

I will actually say that we will continue to see improvement in operating margin, I think year in year out. I think that primarily come from, I think, firstly I think improving our gross margin line, as you would if you would follow -- if you had followed us for period of time, I think over the last couple of quarters. I think we actually continue to invest heavily in building up our brand, making the investments and coming up with innovative products, which you obviously have seen I think from the result that we achieved. At the same time with the increase in our business scale -- business volume that obviously the -- you can begin to see the scaling impact as a result. You can see that. In fact, those 2 areas that are already reflected in our P&L over the last couple of quarters, meaning that we see margin holding or improving on the growth side as well as our E/R coming down. So I would say that it is our target or it is our plan to improve the operating margin over time, but it may not be appropriate for me to give you a definitive number what is the PTI margin in 3 years' time.",237

My second question is on a mature market. Even when excluding the acquisitions, you still grew your Mature Markets business by 32% year-over-year? That's a very impressive growth rate. Would you be able to elaborate on somewhat your sort of a secret weapon or secret strategy that puts you where you are today, where you grow the market over the last year, particularly in the Mature Market where the competition is pretty intense?",74

So I think we will implement -- we have well implemented our strategy. First of all, we are focused on the commercial segment to strengthen our leadership position, so to make more money from that area, so that we can fund our attack in the consumer area, in the SMB area. So we have implemented the risk strategy very well. So that will why not only are we -- we have reached the #1 in the commercial area, but also we are growing faster in the demand in the SMB area. So but definitely, so why are we can -- so to be successful in Emerging Markets? Another reason that we really have very, very competitive -- very strong product portfolio. So our ThinkPad has become very popular, a high quality, innovative products in the commercial area. So that helped us to win the #1 position to make more money.",158

I know you said it would be tight in fourth quarter and pricing would remain high, but I'm trying to figure out how much of this is sort of locked in on a longer-term basis. And if you could give us some idea on the impact on your third quarter gross margin if we haven't had the HDD shortage, because clearly I'm sure there was some impact there. And then I have a follow up.",97
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3095.0,219125.0,12798624.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,14,"Yes, so we believe this quarter, so the calendar first quarter, the HDD supply were being pulled gradually in later of this quarter. But we expect the gap between the demand and the supply to last us through this quarter, as all the PC makers try to fill up their demand. So we believe the HDD cost that we will continue to stay high are in this quarter up, but we try our best to offset the gap with the other components. So that's this quarter HDD situation. So regarding of the last quarter's achieving margins, so it's definitely impacted by the HDD cost rise. So if you compare our last quarter GP margin with the Q2, so we dropped a little bit, we dropped, I believe, I think majority -- the key reason is HDD. And so Wai Ming, you'll add something here.",144
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3095.0,219125.0,12798625.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,15,"Yes, I think if you really compare the gross margin of our -- well, quarter 2 versus 3, I think is around 0.8%. But I actually wouldn't contribute all of those of the increasing costs of the hard drive, because our margin obviously also varies because of the changes of the mix of our business versus consumer and commercial. But I think for the benefit of you to do any sort of modeling, I think I would say that increasing cost of HDD is around between $5 to $10 a box. And obviously, some of those, we'd be able to pass on to customers. Some of those we may not be, because there are also finished goods inventory that we hold inventory and on some of the hard disks. So it is nearly impossible to actually say how much of that change is the result of the hard drive. But the -- generally, the industry you see that the cost increased between $5 to $10 as a result of the flood, unfortunate flood in Thailand. And we continue to see that in quarter 4, and probably we will ease out, I think, towards the end of the quarter. But having said that, I mean obviously, HDD is only one component within the entire box. There are obviously some benefits or cost benefit coming out from other commodities. And that's the reason why I think it's impossible to quantify exactly what's the dollar amount as far as the margin I think that has an impact on our P&L for the -- for quarter 3.",263

That was very helpful. And my second question is on ultrabook. We actually went to your booth and your trailer at CES and saw all of your lineup. I'm curious as to how you think about ultrabook when Intel is saying 40% of the market is going to shift to ultrabooks in a couple of years. How does Lenovo think about the opportunity and think about sort of trading off a higher ASP and trying to get customers to effectively pay up for a notebook relative to prior price points? So just any color you can give us on your thoughts on ultrabook will be very appreciated.",109

Actually, ultrabook has learned a lot from the phones and the tablets. So we believe consumer customers, they need not just a smaller compact but also always on feature. So long battery life, et cetera is actually essential. So the ultrabook will meet customers' this kind of requirement. So definitely, so this will become the check for the traditional or clamshell notebooks. So sooner or later -- so the ultrabook will account for the majority of the traditional PC, traditional PC market, definitely the customers want to see the price competitive, so if you then compare with the traditional PC. So we think Lenovo, we are positioned ourselves in this area. So we will become the leading company in the technology, in the product. So we believe -- so this is our sentiment. Probably in next 18 months ultrabook, where we have accounted for around the 38%, 48% of the total notebook market.",170

So probably a couple of hundred thousand units, so we will be satisfied with that test. But definitely, we will have a higher expectation on our next generation. So that's the answer to the first question. Regarding of the smartphone, so last quarter so as you have seen, so we really had a breakthrough results. So we shipped 6.5 million phones. Total of that, almost half are smartphones. So for the coming year, so definitely we want to keep that kind of momentum. So at least the 1 million per month, so that will be our expectation. Yes, so we want to gain more market share in this area.",147

In our MIDH business today, by and large a lot of those is actually in China while our global -- our PC business is global. So without giving you the exact number, I will actually say that the gross margin probably is about -- I think it will be very, very difficult because again, the MIDH business comprises of our smartphone as well as the tablets, and while tablet, we are at the beginning stage.

I think we have $0.5 billion today and then we have -- I think, again, if you really compare that to our PC business, I think our PC business really around $8 billion or $7.8 billion. So actually would need to see that business to grow, as Yuanqing said, at least double before we actually see a reasonable margin coming in. Again, I think the MIDH business as Yuanqing just now said where I think we'll have more product to come out. So it will be very difficult to actually -- I think the phone business, we obviously can. As Yuanqing said that we'd definitely have a lot more visibility on that, but there are more -- more new products coming in especially in different stage of the launch that actually may not be able to give you a definitive sort of margin as far as the -- as far as just how much revenue or how much scale in order to get that turn into a decent margin.",176

I think, again, if you really look at the Emerging Markets, I think we obviously would not be able to give breakdown of all the regions in the Emerging Markets. I think we probably would have 1 or 2 regions in the moment that is not profitable, because we're not really reaching the scale that we want. And I think you are -- I think partly the reason is obviously, the cost is high, but partly because there are, I think we take some efforts in cleaning some of the channel inventory in some of certain regions and that caused the losses. All I can tell you is I think of the top 3 markets in the rest of Emerging Markets portfolio in Lenovo, I think we are -- I think those 3, top 3 markets are doing very well in terms of increasing market share as far as profitable.",156

Thank you for joining us. Lenovo closed the record-setting fiscal year with a strong fourth quarter. Now we have been the fastest growing major PC company for the 10th straight quarter. So I'm very excited to share our accomplishment and future strategy with you, so let's jump right into it. 
For the year, Lenovo not only set an all-time high revenue of nearly USD $30 billion and an all-time highest market share at almost 13%, but also reached a impressive net income of USD $473 million, up over 70% year-on-year. We've not only strengthened our #1 position in Global Emerging Markets, but also reached the all-time high market share in Mature Markets. 
We also achieved a balanced growth in all customer segments. We reached the record high market shares in both the worldwide Commercial and Consumer Markets. In Q4, we reached the top position market share in Mature Markets and the worldwide Consumer Market for the first time. So these are truly fantastic results. 
Now let's look at each area of our strategy more closely. In China, we once again outgrew the market and set another record high market share for the year at over 32%. That is about the same as the next 4 competitors combined. Our strong presence in emerging cities will continue to drive our future strong growth. More impressively, while gaining market share, we also increased the profitability by 27% year-on-year, and we will stay hungry on the drive for both more market share and profit in the coming year.  
In the rest of the Emerging Markets, we continued our hyper growth, growing 28 points premium to the market rate for the year. And now, in worldwide Emerging Markets, we are more than 4 points ahead of the next competitor. What's even better, we gained share in every region in Q4. Like in India, we gained almost 6 points year-on-year and have become the #1 in that market for the first time. And in Russia, we reached the top of the shares and have become #3 there. So those are fantastic results from Emerging Markets.
Now let's move to the Mature Markets. We not only set our all-time high segment operating profit of over USD $315 million, more than double the year before, but also set a record for revenue, shipments as well as market share. Organically, we grew at a 33-point premium to the market. And when we come to our successful integrations with NEC PC and Medion, we actually outgrew the market by 58 points. More importantly, we saw both big profit improvements and big market share gains in the world's most competitive markets like U.S., Japan and Western Europe, so more profit, more market share and more future growth. That is the speed across our PC business. 
But our good news does not stop there. We also made strong progress in the Mobile Internet space. Our Mobile Internet business delivered a strong improvement throughout the year. For the fiscal year, in China, our smartphone shipment grew by 11x and more than 6x faster than the overall market and again, almost 5 points over the market share year-on-year. Last quarter, our smartphone share reached a record high of -- a record high market share of near 10%. 
We also had a strong growth in our tablet sales. We are solid #2 in China tablet market with nearly -- with 17% of the market share and the clear leader. So we are the clear leader in China and the best in tablet with almost a 50% market share. According to the latest IDC data, our worldwide tablet market share has leaped from #8 last year to #4 last quarter. With more innovative products and an enhanced brand image, I expect that our growth in Mobile Internet and the Digital Home to be even stronger next year.
This leads to our next topic, our strategy for the next year. Our protect and attack strategy has guided our company to record results over the last 3 years, and it will continue to be the core of our PC business strategy. This year, our emphasis is attacking the consumer and the SMB space even more aggressively outside of China. To win in this space, we will build our premium consumer SMB brand that is similar to ThinkPad in the price space with compelling world-class, top-quality products, more stylish, lighter, thinner, longer battery life, always on and the instant on. While we are taking consumer SMB aggressively, we will continue to protect our core commercial business.  At the same time, we will maximize our advantages to extend our server, workstation business. 
While executing protect and attack in the PC area, we have a clear strategy to expand into the new PC+ era. Obviously, multiple devices are emerging, smartphone, tablet, smart TV. We are entering a new era, the PC+ era. To win in the PC+ era, we will pursue our 2-step strategy. First, we will win in China first, where we have a more mature business foundation. Outside of China, we will first build our brand channel and the ecosystem to prepare for driving success in PC+. So what is that direction? Our Mobile Internet and the Digital Home business have seen initial success in China, but we are definitely not satisfied. For the coming year, our goal is to triple last year's smartphone volume and to be a top 3 player in China in tablet market. So we want to reach more than 20% market share in China and establish Lenovo as a pioneer in smart TV area. Actually, earlier this month, we officially launched our first smart TV. It will change the whole concept of family entertainment, and this also means even more growth opportunity for Lenovo. 
To drive growth in both PC and PC+, we will build up our core strengths. First, our strategy is clearly understood and executed by our employees as well as our business partners and the suppliers globally.  Second, innovation is in our DNA. For both PC and the PC+ products, we will focus on better design, better user experience and a better ecosystem. Even more importantly, we will develop our own distinguished -- distinct characteristics and a winning differentiation and eventually, leading new categories like smart TV, convertible PCs and the family entertainment devices. That is our business model, which is a unique, vertically integrated business model through strategic partners with key suppliers and channel partners. We will jointly define and develop the products that will satisfy customers' requirements.  Lastly, we have built a unified ownership culture that is embraced by our employees globally. 
So we will maximize our core strength going forward. Looking ahead, we will push to continue growing faster than the market and to further improve our profitability. To support our growth, we have realigned our organization into 4 geos: China, North America, EMEA and the Asia Pacific and Latin America. So we will also report our business results for each new geo from next quarter and forward. 
Overall, we are optimistic about the PC market as well as our ability to continue growing quickly in the PC+ market. We are confident that next year will be even better. Thank you. Now let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Thank you.",1217
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 23, 2012",2012-05-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3040.0,318124.0,15451582.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Hi, good afternoon. Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through the Lenovo financial and operation performance for the quarter as far as for the full year 2012. 
Next chart please. So Yuanqing has just shared with you our fiscal year 2012 performance, which is a year of records for Lenovo. I think Q4 is another record quarter for us. We continue to outperform the worldwide PC market across the board, by geographies, by products and by customer segments. Our PC shipment growth in quarter 4 was up 44% against a worldwide PC market growth of around 5% year-to-year. We have a record quarter 4 market share at 13.1%. We have consolidated a full quarter of performance from the NEC and the Medion, but if you exclude them, our Lenovo brand growth is up 30% year-to-year. 
Group sales grew 54% year-to-year to approximately $7.5 billion. PC sales were up 44% year-to-year at $6.8 billion. Revenue from our MIDH business was at $423 million, up 126% year-to-year, and sales of other goods and services were at around $300 million. Gross profit was about $806 million, up 34% year-to-year. Gross margin declined slightly to 10.8%. The year-to-year decline is due to the hard disk impact, though we managed to mitigate the impact as well as an increase in the mix of the NEC and the Medion consumer products as far as our Mobile Internet products. The quarter-to-quarter decline is largely due to a typical low season in China, although we expect the gross margin to improve in quarter 1 as the scaling benefits will improve given the higher volume of our business and again, especially in China in quarter 1. 
Operating expenses, including our investment in R&D, branding and others, increased to $704 million, but the E/R ratio was down 1.5 percentage points to 9.4% year-to-year under our very strict stringent cost control. 
Pretax income in quarter 4 was $102 million, up 69% year-to-year. PTI margin was up 0.2 percentage point year-to-year. We expect the pretax margin to continue to expand due to the scaling benefits from the continuous strong shipments growth in the next several quarters. 
The effective rate for quarter 4 is 34%. The higher tax rate is due to a lower tax -- a lower pretax margin in quarter 4 because of the seasonality and the inclusion of the NEC and the Medion businesses. Profit attributable to equity holders for quarter 4 is $67 million, up 59% year-to-year.  
For the full year, we finished the year with very strong sales revenue growth. Revenue is up 37% to $29.6 billion; gross profit, up 46% to $3.4 billion. Gross margin expanded to 11% from 10.9% a year before. The E/R ratio was at 9.7%, up 0.5 point year-to-year even with our continuing investment to drive future growth. We have a record high pretax income at $582 million, up 63% compared to last year. Profit attributable to equity holders for the full year is $473 million, up 73% year-to-year. Basic earnings per share is USD $0.65 in quarter 4 and USD $4.67 for the full year.  The board decided in its meeting this morning to declare a final dividend of HKD $0.10 per share. 
Next chart please. Our balance sheet as of 31st March this year remains strong. Non-current assets were about $4 billion. The increase from that of 31st March 2011 was due to the consolidation of the NEC as well as the Medion balance sheet into ours and the other factor that attributable changes our overall operational performance. We had a net current asset of around $11 million as of 31st March 2012. The net current liabilities were around $1.6 billion. 
Next chart please. Our cash flow and cash conversion cycle continued to be very healthy in quarter 4. The net cash reserve continued to improve to $4.1 billion against $2.7 billion last year largely due to an increase in sales, revenue and operating profit. 
We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Inventory days in quarter 4 were flat, while days receivable increased by 3 days to 35 days, largely due to the consolidation of the NEC and the Medion business and our growth in the Emerging Markets. Days payable decreased to 70 days largely due to shorter payment terms to secure the hard disk supply. As a result, our cash conversion cycle in quarter 4 was a negative 17 days against a negative 33 days the year before. 
Next chart please.  The group has a record high quarter 4 in shipments and market share, grew almost 10x the market, driving market share to 13.1%. We have an even more balanced business in quarter 4 in terms of geography after we consolidated the NEC and the Medion business. 
In China. We continued to perform well in China and further expanded our market share. Sales increased 25% year-to-year to about $2.5 billion. Strong growth in emerging cities have drive strong shipments in China. Our market share further expanded to 30%. PC operating margin dipped slightly as we continue to invest in branding activities, and we expect that the margin will improve quarter-to-quarter in quarter 1. The MIDH business in China is making progress, and we are still making investment in product development, marketing and promotion to drive future sales. 
Emerging Markets excluding China. Our expansion in Emerging Markets continued to show good momentum in quarter 4. Our shipment grew about 7x the market growth, and we see share gain in all regions. We are particularly pleased with our milestone achievement. We came #1 in India and #3 in Russia. Sales were up around 43% year-to-year to approximately $1.2 billion, and our operating loss was flat at $19 million. 
For Mature Markets. We continue to record strong growth in Mature Markets. Indeed, this is the first time we hit the 10% market share in this region, which is a record high for us. Sales were up around 85% year-to-year to slightly above $3.4 billion. We have included a full quarter performance of NEC as well as Medion in quarter 4. Both have performed better than their respective markets, and their earnings are accretive to the group. Excluding the acquisition impact, the Lenovo brand shipment grew in Mature Markets around 28% year-to-year. Operating profit improved to $74 million, and operating margin also improved slightly to 2.2% for the quarter. 
Next chart please.  Looking at the performance by product. From a product perspective, our drive in the consumer business, especially in market outside China, began to show results. We have a record high worldwide consumer PC at 10.2% in quarter 4. Our commercial business continue to do well and outperformed the market in quarter 4. We had a record high market share in notebook at 13.5%. Notebook unit shipment and sales were up 44% and 41% year-to-year, respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 43% and 45% year-to-year, respectively. Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased to around 12.7%. 
Our MIDH business also saw strong performance. Smartphone shipments grew 21x faster than the market year-to-year, and our market share grew 8.2 percentage year-to-year to 9.5%. Tablet business continued to show good momentum, and we are the #2 China tablet vendor with about half of the Android-based tablet market and the #4 in the world. To ensure strong growth momentum continue, we have already launched a series of new products in smartphone as well as tablets to drive future growth. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on market outlook. Our continued efforts in operational efficiency improvements and significant investment made over the years in R&D, and establishing a global brand will enable us to continue our trend in outperforming the worldwide PC market. The successful execution of our protect and attack strategy has resulted in having a very balanced business for us in Emerging Markets versus Mature Market as well as in consumer versus the commercial segments. Such solid foundation reinforce our confidence that we can continue our trend to overperform the market with improved profitability despite the current uncertainties in the global economic environment. 
And in particular, we have products in ultrabook and in new chipset which will help us to drive demand this year that will also benefit us. We launched our first consumer ultrabook, the IdeaPad U300 last year and launched our first commercial ultrabook, ThinkPad X1 hybrid at the CES in January this year. Both products are among our prize-winning products that we launched in CES this year. We believe we have an excellent offerings. The market response has been very positive, and we have got more exciting ultrabooks on the way.  While we are one of the first, and with our current offering, we have shown that we are also one of the best. 
Our drive in PC+ that Yuanqing has just shared with you will further provide additional growth to us over time. We have a very strong MIDH product portfolio lineup for this year. And our goal is to triple last year's smartphone volume, and we'll continue to win in the China Android tablet market. We will stay focused on our cost initiative and growth opportunities, and we'll continue to make the investment in our core competency building, which is product innovation, branding in Emerging Market and especially, the MIDH group, which will ensure us to have strong growth momentum to continue. Nevertheless, we expect our margin, both gross and at operating level, will improve in quarter 1, benefiting from the improved scaling of our sequential growth momentum. We have a very healthy balance sheet, and we'll continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders' value. We'll continue to look for M&A opportunity that will enable us to accelerate our growth in high-growth markets as well as in profitability segments. 
With that, thank you very much. And now, we can have any questions.",1653

So we do see some weakness in U.S. and Western Europe in the price business. But this partially is impacted by the macro economy, like the European debt, but partially because of the enterprise are waiting for Windows and the better product in the second half of the year. So -- and also, the first quarter, we still had some hard drive shortages. But we still see very strong demand in the Emerging Markets including China, particularly in China. So although those big cities up, the penetration rate have been very high, but in emerging cities, many emerging cities, Seoul and emerging cities, the demand is still very strong. So we still can see a 10% year-on-year growth in those markets. So the other Emerging Markets similar to China, up like Russia. We are seeing the strong demand from Russian market. Our channel inventory is very healthy -- second question. So our channel inventory is very healthy. We monitor that daily -- weekly and daily basis. So we haven't seen the significant increase in this area, but I just don't know what's our competitors' situation. So we really see the competition here is becoming fierce, tough, but I think we will insist on ourselves growing past, so keep the inventory healthy. Thank you.",215

I think for China, I think the growth for 2012 is 9%, of which the emerging cities, which is very similar to our definition is 12% and mature city is 5%. And going forward, I think emerging cities growing 17%, 18%, I think in the next few years. So China, you actually see a different picture. The overall growth, I think, is 9% -- well, according to the IDC forecast is 9% -- sorry, 9% for 2012, 14% in 2013 and 15% in 2014. And the Emerging Markets -- the emerging cities in China is obviously much higher than this number.",122

Right now, your strategy is very focused on smartphone and tablet for the Chinese market, but your PC-centric business is a global business. We're seeing a very big move between PC and these mobile devices. First question, do you plan to roll out your tablet and smartphone business to be global so that as consumers and enterprises switch from PC-centric to ARM-centric that you're going to be able to get that business?

So firstly, I don't agree. I disagree. So PC market will be shrinking, so it's still a very decent market. So we are optimistic on that market. But definitely, PC need to evolve, so we need to redefine the PC, particularly notebook and the desktop. So you will see Lenovo will launch more and more -- evolve the notebook and desktop to meet the customers' requirements. So for notebook, and not just seeing the lighter, longer battery life as well as always on, instant on, so this kind of feature but also, you could use both keyboard and touch, so in the future. So I believe Lenovo, we lead the revolution so in that area, so in the desktop area. So you will see the similar situation. So Lenovo, we lead the revolution. So that will drive the decent growth in the traditional PC area, but definitely. So tablet and smartphone so will be 2 more important market as well. So we think that's Lenovo's future. So we have paid a lot of attention to growing these 2 business. But as I said at my speech, so we will focus on China first. So outside China, we don't think that now we are ready to be more aggressive, because we're not ready in the branding, in the channel, retail channel and the telco channel. We're not ready in the ecosystem. So we want to build our consumer PC business first, leveraging that so we prepare the brand, prepare the channel, prepare the ecosystem definitely. So even in China, so our tablet and the smartphone is -- are not just focusing on the low end and not just -- so actually, we are -- we have much -- reached a much broader product portfolio than our key competitors. So they only have one models. They have only one model, but we have multiple model to cover from premiere to the low end. So in the -- so certainly, outside of China so we will have the similar strategy. So by the way, so actually, we have already started our tablet business outside China. So certainly, smartphone now is just focusing on China. Thank you.",364

So I think the Wuhan project is actually -- we firmly believe that this -- the eventual success of our MIDH business, which is primarily consumer, is you have to have a very efficient end-to-end process, from product development all the way to assembling the product. And hence, rather than relying ODM and then you stick your brand there then sell, I think you to have your distinguished features that is relevant to the market as well as the capability of developing that, have the product design closely sort of geared to us or closely associated to work with the assembly process. And that's the overall view of us in why we actually been investing in improving our product design capability, I think, a while ago in Hefei together with Compal and now with Wuhan. I think that is really the overall strategy.",144

We -- I think what I can say this, we definitely are very confident that in the current quarter -- you're talking about quarter 1 which is the current quarter -- we will see improvement of both our gross margin as far as our net operating margin. And in fact, I think this is the overall strategy of the group that over a period of time, we will improve our overall net operating margin. And the way that we do it is obviously depending on the product mix, and again, it -- you probably would know that. I think the commercial business -- the mix between the commercial business and the consumers business have a different margin and a different expense or different business model. We're serving different need throughout. And therefore, I think the -- that we -- I think the primary focus for us to improve the net operating margin. But insofar as quarter 1 is concerned, compared with quarter 4, which historically is our lowest quarter within the financial year, we are very confident that we will outperform. Well, we will improve the gross margin as well as the net margin. Why are we confident? I think we obviously have a very balanced business. I think Yuanqing just now showed that there may be some weakness in certain parts of the world, but we have a very balanced business. I think we have been investing in research and technology, and we actually have the series of products that roll out. And again, from an operational efficiency point of view, you can actually see the trend that we will continue to improve our operational efficiency. I think a combination of those factors are going to be one factor that we rely upon to drive our improvement efficiency.",320

The first is hard drive cost. So because of the shortage, so that drove the hard drive cost up. The second were -- the second is so we had higher consumer business mix, so as you know, so outside of China. So our consumer business is still in the stage of developing the business. So the margin so with those retailers, key retailers like Best Buy are still very low, so that dragged our GP margin low. The third is because we absorbed 2 companies, NEC and the Medion. So their margin is lower than Lenovo's traditional average. So -- but over the time, so as Wai Ming just said, so we are confident. So we can keep improving our GP margin, because the first is we have invested a lot on the branding, on the marketing as well as on the R&D. So we believe that can help us to drive the GP margin up. The second one is so our consumer business as well as our Mobile Internet business up, so we reached a certain scale. So with that scale so I believe can help us to improve the margin up. So the similar situation we are having in the Emerging Markets. So as you know, so we still lose money in Emerging Market but with improved market share, so particularly for those countries which have reached double-digit market share. So we believe that they will shift their focus to the profitability. So that's our confidence, that over time, we will improve our GP margin.",270

So that drove our market share up, our smartphone market share in China, to close 10%. This is a historic high for Lenovo. So now, we are the #4 smartphone player in China. So we're the #4 tablet player in the worldwide as well. So we -- so compare with the #8 one year ago, so it's a big improvement. So regarding of your question about when we can make money in Emerging Market as well as MIDH, so this is our belief. So if you want to make money, you must have enough scale. So for Emerging Market, so we -- our belief is when we reach the double-digit markets, 10% markets, so we -- there's time for us to make money. Now we have 7.76% overall up. But for the individual market, so like India, Russia, we have already reached the double-digit shares. So you can see the result. So we can make money from those market. India, we have become the #1 in the total market, so we make money. In Russia, so we have rough 10% market share, so we can make money, so this quarter. So we believe those big Emerging Markets can contribute more to Lenovo's performance. So MIDH is a similar situation. So if we cannot have enough scale, so it's hard to make money. So we believe in smartphone area, so we are close to the breakeven point.",237

If you really looked at the REM, I think to answer your question I think indirectly, you can actually see that we actually hold more or less flat, our operating, some loss. But on the other hand, we actually have been increasing nearly 40% year-to-year revenue. So you can actually see that I think the -- what it means by scaling, because obviously, I think and not all the markets that we've been -- I think we are selling our product at a gross -- negative gross margin. So I think we obviously -- in markets where we are very small, we begin to invest and expand. I think pricing is obviously one tool for us to grow market share. But again, as I said, if you really look at the year-to-year increase and the operating loss, basically, it stayed flat year-to-year, but business really literally grew by 50%. And I just add one more sort of financial, I think, so that in case you are interested in putting in your model. Our smartphone is actually at a gross profit. I think, obviously, at the moment, we are still investing, but the business is -- the pricing of the product is actually has a -- is a positive gross margin.",229

I hope you all enjoyed the exciting Olympics over the past 2 weeks. For Lenovo, our last quarter was also exciting. We are on our way to winning the gold medal. Our momentum continues to get stronger and more balanced. This quarter, our PC sales volume grew 24% year-on-year. Even as the overall market dropped, our global market share reached another historical high, 15%. Just the year ago, we were behind the #1 by almost 6 points, but now we have narrowed the gap to just 0.7 points. We achieved the rapid growth in all customer and product segments, no matter whether in commercial or consumer, desktop or notebook, all had a record high market share. Especially, I want to mention the initial success of our PC+ strategy. Our smartphone sales in China reached almost $5 million this quarter. Total phone sales volume reached almost $7 million to surpass our China PC volume for the first time.
In June, our smartphone market share in China reached 13%. Now we have surpassed Nokia and Huawei to become the #2 smartphone and all-phone player for the first time in China. Our 4 GEOs all had a stellar performance. Our PC sales volume gained market share in all 13 regions. Even as the market dropped, our China PC business maintained a growth of almost 10% year-on-year, and our market share continued to reach new heights in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We grew at more than 50 points premier to the market. We gained share year-on-year in key markets such as Russia, which jumped to 4 points to reach 11%, and India, which increased by 6.5 points to achieve our historical high of 17%. In North America, we reached our all-time of 8% market share in the United States and rejoined the top 4, just behind the 3 strong domestic brands. Just a year ago, we had only 12 countries and regions with double-digit market share. 
This quarter, we had almost tripled that number to 35 countries and regions. While we continued our rapid growth, we also improved the profitability. Our pretax income increased 50% year-on-year to reach USD 185 million. Our net income increased by 30% year-on-year to reach USD 141 million. Gross margin improved by more than 1 point quarter-to-quarter.
You may still remember that during the global financial crisis in year 2008, we faced a similar situation. Back then, the China PC market grew slower than the global market. Enterprise business shrank significantly. At that time, Lenovo performed poorly. Revenue dropped significantly and the losses mounted. But now our performance is totally different. We not only maintained a strong growth but also significantly improved the profitability. Similar market environment but with very different results. So how did we do that? I still like to summarize it into the 4 points that I have always been saying: the right strategy, the efficient business model, innovative products and a diversified team and culture.
Today, I especially want to talk about having the right strategy and a strong execution. Before 2009, we had only 2 core businesses: China and the global commercial business. In emerging markets and the consumer business, our foundation was very weak. Although there was huge room for these areas, we had not established any business scale or capability. So during the financial crisis, this caused us to be at a big disadvantage versus our competitors. We had the lowest growth rate and the largest loss. Over the last 3 years, we locked in on our clear ""protect and attack"" strategy. On one hand, we protect our core businesses, allowing us to maintain the overall profitability of the company and have enough resources to invest in expansion in high-growth areas. On the other hand, we attack the growth businesses, gaining scale rapidly in emerging markets, in global consumer business and in mobile Internet and digital home area. In this way, we incubate new core businesses and profit pools. Over the last 3 years, we executed this strategy very well to build a scale rapidly in this 3 new areas and drive hyper growth.
Compared to year 2008, last fiscal year, we doubled our PC revenue in emerging markets outside of China from USD 2.4 billion to almost USD 5 billion. Our consumer PC business in mature markets grew more than 4x since our mobile Internet and digital home business was established in 2011. In just 1 year, we doubled our revenue to over $1 billion last fiscal year. Last quarter, revenue from the mobile internet business surged to almost USD 600 million, which accounted for 16% of our China overall revenue and 7% of our global revenue. We are still growing rapidly even today. Last quarter, in emerging markets outside of China, our PC volume grew by 39% year-on-year. That is a 36-point premier to the market. Our global consumer business volume increased 43% year-on-year, outgrowing the market by 42 points. Our smartphone business in China grew 44x year-on-year.
Three years ago, these 3 new businesses combined for 32% of our overall revenue, but now they account for 45% of our overall business. Together, they have become balanced pillars to support our overall performance, allowing us to maintain strong growth even as China and the global commercial slow down. 
For 13 straight quarters, we have grown faster than the market. In comparison to our major competitors, we have grown the fastest for 11 straight quarters.
Even with a weak macroeconomic environment and the PC market seeing negative growth, this new areas still shine, especially smartphones in the emerging markets. According to IDC's forecast, from year 2012 to 2014, China's smartphone market will have a compounded growth rate of 20%. For emerging markets outside of China, the compounded growth rate for PCs reaches close to 10%. So we are confident that through deep implementation of our strategy, we will seize this growth opportunities and continue to grow faster than the market. 
To maintain growth in this challenging environment is difficult. To do that while also improving profitability is even harder, but at Lenovo, we did it. This was also because of our strong execution of the strategy. China and global commercial are our 2 core businesses. Even today, they are still the mainstays of our profit. Over the last 3 years, when the overall market grew nicely, we actually made our protect battle more aggressively. While protecting profitability, we also gained market share. Now in these challenging environment, we will prioritize maintaining healthy profitability.
Last quarter, even with a slower growth in China, we were able to maintain our healthy segment operating margin of 6.5%. At the same time, our global commercial business also delivered very solid profitability. So fully leveraging our commercial area advantages in brand, channels and customer base, we proactively expanded into high-margin enterprise businesses. Most recently, on August 1, we formed our strategic partnership with EMC. This will further enhance our advantages in server and storage areas. At the same time, our new businesses all progressed in line with our strategy. When they reach scale and they reach certain market share, like a double-digit market share, they will or are able to enter a phase of profitable growth. Last quarter, our emerging market outside of China almost broke even, and our consumer business outside of China showed a very good GP margin improvement. The endgame of all those new businesses should be the same to make our new businesses as profitable as our core business today. 
Although the environment we are in is full of challenges, we are confident that through leveraging our core strength and continuing to execute our ""protect and attack"" strategy, we can achieve sustainable growth and healthy returns to our shareholders. We will continue to maximize our strength in research and innovation in the second half of the year. We will launch web after web of exciting products. We will continue to build our brand. We are now the official PC sponsor of the National Football League. This will significantly lift our brand image in North America. In addition, we will continue to leverage our efficient business model and diversified team and culture, which are also competitive advantages of us. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the future of PC+ on our course to become the leader in this industry. We will deliver investors a solid long-term return. 
Thank you, everybody. Right now, I'll turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1414

I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 1. Next chart, please. We continue our profitable growth momentum, and our PC shipment growth in quarter 1 was up 24%. More importantly, we have a balanced growth across the board, with particular strong growth in consumer and emerging markets. PC sales were up 25% year-to-year to $7.1 billion. Our strong performance in mobile Internet business helped contribute more to the group's strong sales growth. Revenue from the mobile Internet business was up 1.7x year-to-year to $587 million. Sales of other goods and services were $282 million. Group sales grew 35% year-to-year to approximately $8 billion. Gross profit was about $959 million, up 30% year-on-year. Gross profit margin declined slightly to 12% year-on-year largely due to an increase in the mix of consumer products, including our mobile Internet products. However, our gross margin improved quarter-to-quarter largely due to better scaling and component price benefits. Operating expenses increased to $777 million and E/R ratio was down to 9.7% year-on-year from 10.4% a year but up quarter-on-quarter from 9.4%. The year-on-year improvement is due to better scaling benefits, while the quarter-on-quarter decline is due to investment in promotion, branding and R&D. 
Operating profit in quarter 1 was $182 million, up 48% year-on-year. Pretax income was $185 million, up 50% year-on-year. The effective tax rate for quarter 1 was 22%. While our quarter 1 tax rate is in line with our average run rate, which is around 20% to 25%, this is higher than that in quarter 1 last year. The low tax rate last year was due to a reversal of certain provision made in previous years. Profit attributable to equity holders is $141 million, up 30% year-on-year. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet in the next chart. Our balance sheet in quarter 1 remained strong. Noncurrent assets were at about $4 billion, similar to the level at 31st March 2012. Changes in current assets and current liabilities were due largely to increased activities during the quarter. We had net current assets of around $306 million at the end of June. The noncurrent liabilities were at around $1.8 billion. 
Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. Our cash flow and cash conversion cycle continued to be healthy in quarter 1. Our net cash reserve remained strong at $3.7 billion, slightly above $3.6 billion of the same period last year. The quarter-on-quarter drop is mainly due to changes in the cash conversion cycle. Inclusion of the NEC joint venture and Medion in the balance sheet drove the main changes in cash conversion cycle from year-on-year perspective. Inventory days in quarter 1 were 19 days against 16 days last year as we continue to expand into more emerging markets and consumer business outside China. Days receivable increased by 5 days to 34 days largely due to expansion into more emerging markets and consumer business outside China. They remain roughly flat quarter-to-quarter, increased by a day. Days payable was 66 days in quarter 1. The decrease year-on-year was, again, due to the inclusion of NEC joint venture and Medion, our expansion in the emerging markets as well as the changes in payment terms with some suppliers. The decrease quarter-on-quarter was largely due to seasonality that quarter 4 is usually a low season. The change was in line with our normal trend. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 1 was a negative 13 days, again, negative 27 days last year and negative 17 days last quarter. 
Next chart, please. The group has a record high shipments and market share in quarter 1. We have an even more balanced business by geography and products. Since quarter 1 this year, we have changed our organizational structure. We will accordingly report our geographic performance under the new 4 geographic classification. We have enclosed in the appendix the historic performance for your reference. 
China. We continue to perform well in China and further expanded our market share in PC and mobile Internet business. Our PC sales increased around 13% year-on-year to about $2.97 billion, driven by our strong growth in emerging cities. Operating profit increased to $192 million, while margin remained stable at 6.5% year-on-year and up from last quarter. Our mobile Internet business in China continue to show strong growth and begin to play a part for our continual high growth in China. Sales increased to $549 million, which accounts for 16% of our China sales revenue in quarter 1. This strong growth helped contribute to the group's strong 24% sales growth year-on-year to $3.5 billion in China despite the slow PC market growth. We will continue to invest in the PC+ area to drive future growth. 
APLA. Sales were up 72% year-on-year to $1.7 billion in APLA, and quarter 1 was profitable against an operating loss of $4 million recorded in the same quarter last year. We expect the new hub in Brazil will help accelerate our expansion in the country over time and therefore, contribute to the improvement of the region's profitability over time. 
EMEA. Sales grew 62% year-on-year to $1.6 billion, and we recorded profit in all regions. We are particularly pleased to see the EET region to show the first-time profit in quarter 1. We begin to see the positive impact of our investment in the region both operating profit and margin improvement year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. 
North America. Sales grew around 7% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. Operating profit declined to $46 million this year from $52 million last year. That improved from $33 million last quarter. The year-on-year decline was due to our continued investment in consumer business, product mix change and competition, and the quarter-on-quarter improvement was due to better scaling benefit. 
Next chart. We have a more balanced product portfolio, helped by expansion in the mobile Internet business and other PC-related business. We had a record high market share in notebook at 15.4%. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 27% and 23% year-to-year, respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 21% and 26% year-to-year, respectively. Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased to around 14.4%. Our MIDH business also saw strong performance of 173% in sales, led by the smartphone business. We will continue to invest in innovation and broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitiveness and service to our customers. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite uncertainties in the global economic conditions impacting the PC market growth in the short term, we will remain focused to outperform the worldwide PC market in a profitable way. We have continuously achieved that over the last few years and remain confident to continue such trend. We execute our ""protect and attack"" strategy well. Our core PC business is performing well, and our strategic investment in mobile Internet have started contributing to the group growth in sales and improved profitability. New products in ultrabook and the new Windows 8 operating system will help drive demand later this year that will also benefit us. 
We will stay focused on balancing the cost initiatives and growth opportunities. We'll continue to invest in core competence building, product innovation and promotion, especially to ensure successful launch of new products related to Win 8 and ultrabooks and also new MIDH products. We have a healthy balance sheet, and we'll continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders value. In addition, we will continue to look for M&A opportunities in areas that can help us to accelerate our growth. Finally, we remain on track to drive growth to transform ourself to a leading PC+ company.

So in short term, there is some uncertainty in China overall macro economy because of the tighter real estate bubble control and a weak export because of the worldwide weak macro economy. But from London point of view, I'm still optimistic on China economy because we still have 50% population living in the rural area. So the move from rural to the city will continue. And also, our PC penetration rate is still much lower than the mature markets, like New York and the U.S. From Lenovo competitiveness and strategy point of view, I'm even more optimistic. So if you look at last quarter's Lenovo's performance in China, although the PC market, there was negative growth, but our PC revenue was still growing by 13% year-on-year. That's because we are very strong in the low-tier cities and the rural areas. So there, our market share is even higher. So in those areas, we still can see double digit of growth. We still can see double digit of growth. If you look at our overall revenue growth in China, so actually, we grew by 24%. So that was driven by our mobile Internet strategy. So our smartphone grew by 44x over last year, the same period of last year. So that's because we have the strategy to attack the mobile Internet and the digital home area. So in summary, so even though the macro economy and the PC industry in China are not that optimistic, but we are still confident on Lenovo's performance in the next quarter and this fiscal year.",261

And therefore, inventory actually is a reflection, I think, of, I think, the quarter going forward rather than sort of -- I think you should really not be comparing, I think, their sort of balance sheet number. For us, we actually look at the way that we control the inventory or manage the inventory as we're looking at weeks of sales, I think, generally, and this is actually in a very healthy position.

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4006.0,348080.0,16839138.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,14,"Well, this is Wai Ming. I think that maybe I'll answer the sort of numbers first. I think that probably, it will have not many material, I think, increase in the revenue and therefore, profitability in the current fiscal year. I think what our cooperation or strategic -- establishing a strategic relationship with EMC, I think, comprises of 3 parts. I think the first one is I think we actually have a cooperation, I think, in building our servers, in particular the sort of product design capability, where that we actually form a joint lab to develop products, part of which we actually sell it into EMC, in their products, as well as we'd be able to sell it to a third party. This is obviously a worldwide markets. I think actually, currently, we have a -- I think we have a server business in China, but we do not have a significant server business outside China, and that actually gives us a lot of credibility of bringing in products to customers. That's number one. Number two is we have a joint venture with them in the NAS, the storage business, which primarily, I think, give us, I think, an exposure, I think, in the storage area. This joint venture probably will not be closed in 2 or 3 months because we obviously need to get some regulator clearance. And the third element of that, we actually will be able to sell on a joint brand basis, I think, the high-end storage of EMC products, I think, initially in China. And if successful, we'll probably be able to expand in other countries. So this actually give Lenovo a full range, obviously, outside our strong PC presence, I think, to be able to get into the storage as far as into, I think, the server business. So as I said, I think from a number perspective, it probably will have no material implication in our current fiscal year, I think, partly because I think that in the server side, although we begin the cooperation in developing products, I think, as soon as we can, but products will not come out the day after. So in the current fiscal year, that probably will not be significant. And the storage joint venture, as I said, it will take probably 2 or 3 months to play the regulatory -- to play the regulation. And that probably -- if it happens, it probably will happen a couple of months in this fiscal year, and as a result of that, it will not be significant. But the important thing is, I think, is really a very strong strategic alliance for us to link up with a significant storage or IT group around the world to give us the credibility as well as the ability to develop into a server market, which -- obviously, we'll have much better margin, and we'll have a very strong client base in the PC, especially in the commercial area. That actually give us a very, very solid foundation, I think, to expand into that area.",514

And on the server side, we'll probably begin in this, I would say, maybe in the second half of the next fiscal year because, as I said, I think the joint lab will actually have a -- the engineers coming from EMC working together with our engineers in China to develop a very strong portfolio so that we can actually sell into EMC for their products, as well as be able to sell into the third parties.",124

First of all, on the smartphone side, can you give us some roadmap in terms of how you think the business is going to evolve? The market share gain seems to be pretty strong. When do we expect the losses, which is running at about 20 million per quarter, to start to narrow? Is that something that we could expect in the medium term, or you're not going to focus on that in the near term? Second is also, if we look at the different geographies on the PC side, is it only Latin America which is now a drag on the profitability? Or asking it a differently way, is it only Latin America which is losing money right now, or are there any other geographies which are losing money after Eastern Europe and Turkey turned profitable?",142
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,4006.0,348080.0,16839144.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,20,"Yes, so regarding the smartphone, so I think we are building the core competence in this area in China. So now we provide a much richer portfolio than our core competitors, multinational competitors. And also, we have a much broad channel network and the relationship with telecom companies. Also, our development speed is very fast. We emphasize on the time to market and the time to volume so that we can launch the advanced devices than our competitors. So that's why we have been so successful in this area. So another reason is we -- not only we use the in-house development but also in-house manufacturing, so that gives us the cost advantage, the price advantage, so we can compete with any of our competitors. And also we are building the 3C storefronts across China, so that would help us to expand this business. Definitely, in short term, we are not focusing on the profitability. But with the current scale -- with the current scale, so we definitely believe we have a good opportunity to make money even in the smartphone area. So in the past, we sell more units to the telco companies, but now our open market mix is growing. So in those markets, our GP margin is much better than the sales with the telco companies. So we are very confident in a couple of quarters, so we can turn around this business to start making money.  So this is about the smartphone. Regarding the PC outside of China, so we -- so actually, so in all -- rest of the emerging market, excluding China, so we made money last quarter. So in most the regions, we made money. So probably only 1 or 2 regions. Definitely, Brazil is where we're not that -- so we are still losing money. So that's the situation in emerging markets. In mature markets, North America, Western Europe and Japan or even Australia and New Zealand, we are making very decent money, particularly in North America. Because we sell more commercial PCs in that market, so we can have a very decent GP margin and net profit in the commercial segment. So that's -- I don't know whether that answered your question.",371

I think Yuanqing mentioned about the change of mix. We continue -- while this is -- I'm talking about the smartphone business in China. I think as Yuanqing said, I think the 2 big points I want to give is the margin that we sell through the open channels versus the margin that we sell through operators, the difference can be nearly 3x to 4x. That's really number one. And number two is I think the change in mix, we continue to see that -- I think the mix -- I think selling through open channel increased. I think it's very roughly -- rough numbers.  I think the mix that we see that, I think, steadily improving probably by 5%, 10%, I think, over the quarter. And the more important thing, I think you mentioned about the sort of operating loss that you saw. So I would say that because we actually have a strategy of investment for growth, I think, provided -- I think that the overall group actually maintained and improved the profitability. And the investment that we actually put in, I think, in terms of really helping us to improve our mix in the open market is you can actually measure it by way of storefronts. We actually increased nearly about 25%, now reaching over 10,000 storefronts in China. And we will continue to invest with that, and that actually, I think from an accounting perspective, you may actually feel a mismatch because we actually keep investing heavily on storefront, and the benefit will come in with a higher mix in the open market. That's actually, as I said, 3 times the gross margin. And therefore, I think, as Yuanqing said, while we've been actually growing very fast, I think the two-pronged, the hybrid approach, on one hand, we actually leverage on the capability of the telecom operators to distribute our product in volume. At the same time, we actually increase the number through open channel at a much higher margin. And with the result of that, we obviously are very confident that we will be able to achieve, I think, a breakeven and will become, as Yuanqing already said that, the smartphone or the MIDH business today begin to show as a growth driver, I think, of the overall growth of Lenovo business.",404

So the open market will dominate the smartphone and the product market. So in the past 1 or 2 years, operators have been very aggressive to purchase smartphone by themselves and then sell by themselves. But that have a significant negative impact on the profitability. So probably, in the future, they will not be that aggressive. So that means the open market will become bigger and bigger. So in the open market, it's definitely Lenovo's stronghold. So we have much stronger brand awareness and reputation in the open market, in the public. We have much wider channel networks. And also, we are building the new 3C storefront now across China. And also, our product strategy is different from our key competitors. They only use one model to cover all their segments. So we don't think that this strategy is right for China, particularly for the low-tier cities and the rural areas. So we are providing much rich product portfolio. So this year, we will launch more than 40 models over the year. So we believe this is the right strategy for China.",190

Two questions. First question is about China again. So I think earlier, Yuanqing mentioned that the slowdown is more like temporary, but I just want to bring your attention that actually, for the September quarter, it's going to be an even tougher comparison because last year, you did even better. And this year, in terms of this Windows 8 transition, we all know it won't really happen until late October. So I'm just trying to see if you could share with us if the China market -- this slowdown is going to lengthen, what could you change your strategy to handle a situation that could extend this kind of weakness? That's my first question. And the second question is about Surface. I think some of your competitors showed -- worry some about potential threat. But obviously, you seem to be more confident. And yesterday, there's some news about maybe the product could be priced at only $199. Could you take this opportunity to share with us your view about a potential impact that this product could bring to the market and how you're going to face the competition?",193

But even in short term, I don't think that this quarter would be worse than last quarter. So this is about the market, so we are even more confident on Lenovo's competitiveness and our strategy. So not only we will leverage our mobile Internet strategy to grow our smartphone and our mobile Internet business, even in the PC area, we think that we still can outgrow the market. So definitely, so we also -- we'll protect our profitability in this core business area. So regarding of the Surface, so to be frank, we are not that worried about that. We are not that worried about that. Firstly, so Microsoft is still our strategy partner. We are very optimistic on the new Windows 8 launch, so we will fully leverage that to launch our new product, to take the market opportunity, although we don't like Microsoft to provide the hardware. But even the established hardware business, so we think that will -- for us, that's just to add one more competitor. It's just one of our many competitors. We are still confident in our sales. So we are providing the much better hardware than our competitors, including Microsoft. So they are strong in the software, but I don't believe they can provide the best hardware in the world. So Lenovo can.",239

Maybe again, to sort of add a little bit of numbers to substantiate what Yuanqing said, I think in hardware, in the sort of, I think, what arguably people think that China is going to slow down, I think, Lenovo, I think, disregard about the market environment. You can actually sort of take it, I think, that we, over the last few years, when China did have high growth as well as low growth and, in fact, the China's slow growth is not only in quarter 1 but also in part of our quarter 4 last year, I think look at the numbers. I think China was slow. The China growth, probably negative in quarter 1, and we are growing 13%. In fact, we actually have -- because of our capabilities in China in terms of product, as well as distribution capability, that actually give us even more strength to compete more effectively. I think that our competitors, as a result of that, not only we'll be able to increase our business, I think on a year-to-year basis, it's 13% versus the market of negative 2.8%. So that itself is not a problem for us, and obviously, I think that that is because of our strong execution and the right strategy on holding our stronghold and, I think, the world's largest PC market. The one other point that, again, I think one should not forget is I think Lenovo today is actually moving from a PC to PC+ in that we actually have another strong segment coming to implement growth. Again, look at the smartphone business. I think the China smartphone business is growing over 100% year-to-year. And we actually see, I think, the initial success that we had over the investment for the last one -- for the last few quarters. And that will obviously, together, as a whole -- I think we've been growing over 20-something percent year-to-year. And you can actually see that, I think, the slowdown in the PC market in itself does not necessarily have any significant impact on us. And on top of that, from a Lenovo group perspective, you see that even the entire worldwide PC market is slowing down, you can actually see our overall increase in volume, in revenue, as well as improving profitability. So I mean, although that one obviously would like to have a market with a high growth rate, but it doesn't necessarily have any impact on our overall capability to demonstrate that we will continue to improve our profitability as well as increase our business.",433

So China, global commercial enterprise business, then the rest of the emerging market, mature transactional consumer, then MIDH. So among these are 5 businesses, so our China business is very healthy. So last quarter, actually, we believe the 6 -- so in China PC business, we delivered a 6.5% operating margin. In the global enterprise business, although it's not as high as our China business, but it's still very descent, very, very decent profitability. For our other 3 business, they are developing business. So before, we have very low margin -- very low market share. We have very low market share in rest of the emerging market in global transaction, particularly in the consumer segment. And MIDH is the same story. So during the developing period, definitely, you cannot count on the profitability. But now our rest of emerging markets, as we said before, has already been spread even last quarter, broadly even last quarter. In the global consumer segment, so last quarter, we significantly pulled our GP margin, improved our GP margin. Over time, so we are very confident we will turn around this business again. MIDH, we have already discussed our plan to improve the operating margin. Given we have more opportunity to sell in the open market, we are very confident that we will improve our operating margin in that area as well. So our endgame for this developing business, for this new business, definitely is similar to our core business. So we expect we will deliver very similar operation margin over time. But even in short term, so we have seen the improvement in those area. So we believe we will give our shareholders a better return quarter-on-quarter, year-over-year. So that's my expectation. That's my assessment. So Wai Ming?",309

Obviously, we know that, I think, the PC industry, I think, you have certain benchmarks, especially when you're in the core position. We definitely, as Yuanqing said that, I think, relooking at just on the PC alone, I think that we obviously have geography which is obviously much higher than, I think, the PC benchmark. But at the same time, we are growing very fast in the -- in areas where we do not necessarily being #1, but a lot of those already in more than 10%. And as we actually have been explaining to you as well as to the market that when we reach the 10%, we'll have the scale and we obviously will then focus on profitable growth. I think on the PC, we obviously have planned our action plan to actually move ourself, I think, towards the benchmark, 4% or 5% operating margin. But at same time, we actually would not do it overnight. Actually, we improved, as Yuanqing said, quarter-to-quarter. I think taking into consideration the amount of investment we need to invest into another high-growth area, moving Lenovo to a PC+, I think namely the MIDH, the smartphone business, at the same time, you'll also see that our effort really building out another high-margin business supplementing to our stronghold in PC commercial, which is the servers, will probably become, in 1 or 2 years' time, become more significant. So you can actually -- you would expect that we will continue, on one hand, in growing, I think, our business, at the same time, improving profitability. We definitely will not reduce our profitability for growth. I think that is for sure. We will continue to grow the company as well as improve our profitability over time. Take a balanced view as to, I think, our ""protect and attack."" You'll probably hear it a number of times that we will protect our profit pool as well as enhance our profit in those areas. At the same time, we are definitely being very, very diligent in investing into the high-growth areas so that I think the company will be in a very healthy, sustainable growth position.",372

So that's not fair. Even for current leading company, when they developed the new market like China market a couple of years ago, I don't think they could make money. So this is the developing period. But definitely, we should thank our shareholders, our investors that you are tolerant for us to -- in the short term, we don't make too much money so that we can have the results to be more aggressive to attack the new business, to attack the new market. But definitely, from a long-term point of view, we must return our shareholders. So from now on, so actually, we are very confident that quarter-over quarter, we can give shareholders the better results.",132

I think starting -- I think a couple of years ago, when the situation is exactly like that today, when China growth actually lower than the rest of the world, when consumer has a much higher growth than commercial, I think Lenovo recorded the first time in its history of our losses. We obviously regrouped ourself, get the right strategy, execution, and from then onwards, quarter to -- while year-to-year -- I mean, obviously, we have quarterly skew, but year-to-year, we have been doing for the last 3 years that we will continue to grow our business. Definitely, in specific area like PC, we'll continue to outgrow the market. At the same time, we'll actually improve our profitability. We never -- I think definitely, for the last 3 years, we haven't sort of sacrificed profitably for growth. And definitely, we will continue to do that.",165

This quarter, despite our challenging environments, Lenovo continued its strong momentum and achieved many key milestones, demonstrating that our strategy is working very effectively. Last quarter, our PC sales volume grew by 10% year-on-year, 18 points ahead of the overall market. Our global market share reached another historical high, 15.6%. IDC has named [ph] #2 and according to Gartner, we have already jumped to #1 in global desktop and notebook sales. Now we have grown faster than the market for 14 straight quarters, and have been the fastest growing major PC company for 12 straight quarters. We again outgrew the market in all customer and product segments. Four years ago, we were #7 in the worldwide consumer space, with less than 4% share, and that was mainly the contribution from China. Then you basically could not find any Lenovo consumer products outside of China. 
After we made our attack strategy clear, within only 4 years, our consumer business has grown significantly. Now it doesn't matter if you are in emerging markets or mature markets, you can see our products everywhere. Last quarter, with 13% of the global consumer market share, Lenovo has become #1 in this segment for the first time. Even better, our stellar performance is balanced across all 4 geos, which each outgrew the market significantly. 
In EMEA, we outgrew the market by 34 points, particularly in the consumer segment. We are now in the top 3, and reached double digit market share for the first time. And for the first time, we were #1 in Russia, in Asia Pacific and the Latin America geo. We grew 15 points faster than the market. We also had a strong quarter in India, gaining 4.2 points share year-on-year. And in Japan, where we strengthened our position as #1 and have a record market share. North America outgrew the market by over 28 points. In the U.S., we also reached the record market share of 8.3%, and have a very stable business with strong profits even in a weak macro economy. 
In China, the macro economy has clearly slowed down, and the PC market declined. And in this challenging environment, our combined businesses still grow by 28% year-on-year. We grew almost 9 points faster than the markets in PCs. Total phone sales reached more than 8.5 million. Our smartphone growth was even more encouraging. We sold 7 million units this quarter, that's 18x greater than last year. 
Our smartphone share is now over 14% in China, just 1 point from the market leader. Let me remind everyone that we started this business only 2.5 years ago. I'm confident that we will continue our hyper growth with multiple new products that are even more innovative and stylish. We also began expanding our PC Plus strategy outside of China, aiding smartphone sales in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, with more to come. 
Now let me be clear. We not only grow rapidly, but our profitability also has reached record heights. Our pretax income ratio reached 2.4%, that's a 3x points better than last year. That have led to a record pretax income of USD 204 million, and our net income increased by more than 10% year-on-year to reach USD 162 million. We are gaining share and are improving profitability at the same time. This is our long-term formula for success. 
Our success is not an accident, rather, it is a result of our formula for success, which includes our clear strategy, innovative products, efficient business model and the diverse team and a global culture. Of this, having the right strategy is the foundation. We implemented our ""protect and attack"" strategy 3 years ago when the China PC market grew slower than the global market and the price of business shrank and Lenovo performed poorly. Now under similar market conditions, the difference in our results is like night and day. 
As I discussed before, our strategy is clearly working, and we are now a much more balanced company. In emerging markets outside of China, we have 27 countries and regions reaching double digit this year. In mature markets, our transactional business has more than doubled from 3 years ago. And our mobile Internet and the digital Home business continues to deliver hyper growth. Last quarter, revenue from our mobile Internet business grew to more than USD 700 million. This growth now accounts for about 18% of our China revenue, and 80% of our global revenue. In the first quarter this fiscal year, our business from emerging markets outside of China, mature transactional and the mobile Internet digital home reached 45% of our company's overall revenue. Last quarter, this ratio increased by another point; further demonstrates our balanced business, but our goal is much more than just the growing share and revenue. Our strategy has always been to achieve a critical share first and then drive profitable growth. Now emerging markets outside of China and the mature transactional have entered the profitable growth stage. I believe that in just a couple of quarters, our smartphone business in China will also reach another stage. 
To continue improving our profitability consistently, we must further build our cost strength, our innovation, business model, diverse team and the global culture. To further enhance our business model and allow our supply chain to be faster and more flexible, we are building a global local company step-by-step. This means that while we operate globally, we will also fully leverage local advantages and the local talents in every key market. We have already implemented this plan worldwide. We want to build our home base in key markets not only just the sales and the marketing team, but also use local innovation to develop products for local demand. At the same time, we will build our manufacturing bases in key markets to respond quickly to local market demand. 
Over the last few years, through M&A and self-expansion [ph], we have strengthened our foundation in key mature markets like the U.S., Japan and Germany, as well as in key emerging markets like Brazil and India and, of course, China. Last quarter, we acquired CCE in Brazil. This is another solid step forward towards our goal. Operating globally while emphasizing local development, this, also will strengthen our diverse team and the global culture. 
Our innovation leadership will continue to be our key competitive advantage, especially now with the launch of Windows 8, there will be more demand for PCs. Our family of convertible PCs combines the best experience for both laptop and tablet. We believe the emotional purchase trend for tablet is fading and that our convertibles will meet the customers' needs for more computing power in tablet devices. Already, our largest retail partners have told us that Yoga and Twist are their top Windows 8 devices in presales. And we will have even more exciting products to unveil at the CES next year. 
In addition to cloud devices, we are also -- we are focused on the back-end opportunity in servers, storage and services. Our joint venture with EMC and our acquisition of Stoneware, both enhance and expand our offerings to customers worldwide. In fact, we created an Enterprise Product Group to focus on making us a serious competitor in this space. So strong execution of our strategy and the continuous enhancement of our cost trends, we are confident that we will continue to improve our profitability. 
In 3 years, we want our global pretax income ratio to increase by at least 1 point to reach 3% to 4%. Looking ahead, although the macro economy show some softness, we see many growth opportunities, especially from Windows 8, from emerging markets and from China, where growth from smaller developing cities is still very strong. Lenovo is on course to become the worldwide PC leader, and while becoming #1, will be a major milestone, it is not the end of our journey. Now, our focus is to become a leader in PC+ as well. We formally believe that we will continue to deliver solid long-term return to our investors and shareholders. And I also believe that Lenovo's proudest days are still to come. 
Thank you, everybody. I now turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Please.",1372
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2012",2012-11-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3361.0,381411.0,18223851.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in quarter 2. Next chart, please. We continue to grow in both sales and pretax income, with margin expansion even when the global PC market declined in quarter 2. We have delivered such performance track record for 12 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Our balanced performance, driven by our successful execution of ""protect and attack"" strategy is a significant strength that we believe will help us drive sustainable growth even in challenging market conditions. 
Our PC shipments in quarter 2 were up 10%, and PC sales were up 5% year-on-year to $7.7 billion. Our strong performance in mobile Internet business, especially smartphone, helped contribute more to the group's strong revenue growth. Revenue from the mobile Internet business were up 1.5x year-on-year to $780 million. Sales of other goods and services were $263 million. Group sales grew 11% year-on-year to approximately, $8.7 billion. Gross profit was about $1.1 billion, up 11% year-on-year. Gross profit margin remained relatively stable at 12.1% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Operating expenses increased 8% year-on-year to $844 million to support our growth. E/R ratio was down to 9.7% from 10% last year, due to better scaling benefits and flat quarter-to-quarter even after our investment in R&D and promotion to support Windows 8 related new product launches. 
Operating profit was $206 million, up 24% year-on-year. Pretax income was $204 million, up 24% year-on-year. This is a record high level for the group. PTI margin continued to improve year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter due to scaling benefits and strengthened expense control. Effective tax rate for quarter 2 was 20%, while our quarter 2 tax rate is in line with our average run rate, around 20% to 25%. This is higher than that in quarter 2 last year. The low tax rate last year was due to a reversal of certain provisions made in previous years. Profit attributable to equity holders is $162 million, up 13% year-on-year. 
Basic EPS improved to USD 0.0158 from USD 0.0141 last year. The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.045 per share, representing an increase of around 19% compared to last year. Next chart, please. 
Our balance sheet in quarter 2 remains strong. Our current assets were about $4.2 billion, similar to the level at 30th of June 2012. Changes in current assets and current liabilities were largely due to increased activities during the quarter. We have net current assets of around $481 million at the end of September. The noncurrent liabilities were at around $2.2 billion. 
Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. Our cash flow and cash conversion cycle continued to be healthy in quarter 2. Bank deposits and cash level was lower compared to last year due to capital expenditures, share repurchase and changes in our cash conversion cycle. Bank borrowing was high in quarter 2 compared to last year and last quarter, as we draw down an outstanding facility before it lapsed at the end of the quarter. Our net cash reserve dipped slightly but remained strong at $3.6 billion. 
We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Inventory days and receivable days remained relatively stable in quarter 2 compared to last year and last quarter. Payable days were 61 days in quarter 2, a decline compared to last year and last quarter was again due to our expansion in the consumer business, including MIDH and Medion and increasing mix of in-house manufacturing. The change was in line with our normal trend. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 2 would have negative 9 days. Again, negative 20 days last year, and negative 13 days last quarter. The change was a reflection of our strategic business expansion into emerging markets and consumer business, including MIDH. Together with our hybrid strategy of increasing mix of in-house manufacturing to enhance end-to-end efficiency and product time to market. Nevertheless, the group's cash position remains at a very strong level to drive future growth. Next chart, please. 
The Group has record high shipments and market shares in quarter 2, even as the China PC market slowed down, and we see across the board strong performance and year-on-year profit improvement in each of the 4 geographies. Since quarter 1 this year, we have changed our organizational structure and we will accordingly report our geographic performance under the new 4 geographic classifications. 
China, we continue to perform well in China and further expanded our market share in both PC and mobile Internet business. Despite the negative growth in China PC markets, we recorded a 20% growth in revenue year-on-year to about $3.9 billion in China. Our PC sales increased around 8% year-on-year to about $3.1 billion, driven by our strong growth in the emerging cities undergoing urbanization. We continue to be a clear leader in the market, and our market share is even bigger than the total of the next 4 players. 
China PC operating profit increased to $185 million, while margin further improved slightly to 5.9% year-on-year. The slight dip in margin quarter-on-quarter was due to seasonality, as we normally have more promotion during the summer sales period in quarter 2. Our mobile Internet business in China continued to show strong growth and provided increasing support for our continuing high growth in China in quarter 2. Sales increased by 1.7x to $676 million, would accounts of 18% of the China total sales revenue in quarter 2. MIDH profitability also saw continuous improvement in Q2. We will continue to invest in the PC+ area to drive future growth. 
APLA. Sales were up 6% quarter-on-quarter, but down 2% year-on-year to about $1.8 billion in APLA. Operating margin doubled to 0.8% compared to last year, as we focus on a balance between growth and profitability. We expect the new manufacturing hub and the acquisition of CCE in Brazil will help accelerate our expansion in the country, and therefore, contribute to the further improvement of the region's profitability over time. 
EMEA. We had a very encouraging quarter in EMEA. Sales grew 12% year-on-year to about $1.8 billion. Strong growth in the emerging markets in the region like Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Russia, as well as consumer business, contributed to the strong growth in the region. In Q2, we achieved #1 positions in 2 of the largest 3 countries in the region. Operating margin also continued to improve, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter to 2%. Our attack in consumer business in the region continued to gain traction that resulted in share gain. Our consumer business in EMEA gained profitable in quarter 2, benefited from better scaling. We still continue to attack in the consumer business, and expect to provide additional support to margin improvement over time. 
North America. We continued to record good performance despite market decline in the region. Sales grew at 7% year-on-year to about $1.2 billion. Operating profit increased to $45 million this year from $39 million last year, but a decline from $46 million last quarter. The year-on-year operating margin improvement was due to better scaling benefits, while the increased mix of SMB and consumer business led to quarter-on-quarter margin decline. Next chart, please. 
We also have a more balanced product portfolio helped by the expansion in consumer PC and mobile Internet business. We have a record high market share in notebook at about 16%. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 11% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 9% and 5% year-on-year, respectively. Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased to around 15%. Our MIDH business also showed strong performance, up 1.5x year-on-year in sales, led by the smartphone business. We feel the strong growth of the group. We will continue to invest in innovation, and broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitiveness and service to our customers. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite uncertainties in the global economic condition, impacting the PC market growth in the short term, we remain confident that we can outperform the worldwide PC market and continue to improve our operating margin. We have a strong record of consistent year-on-year growth in both revenue and operating profit for more than 2 years. And we remain confident to continue this performance trend. We have executed our ""protect and attack"" strategy well. Our expansion in emerging market and consumer business outside China have already reached a tipping level that the scaling benefits will continue to enhance our group margin as planned. 
While our core PC business is performing well, our mobile Internet business, especially smartphone operations in China, has also started contributing to the group growth in sales with improving profitability. This balanced performance, driven by the successful execution of our ""protect and attack"" strategy, is a significant strength that will help us drive sustainable growth even in challenging market conditions. We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in core competence building, product innovation to drive sustainable future growth. 
Progress of our recent corporate transactions like our partnership with EMC, the acquisition of CCE and Stoneware, have been on track. We have a healthy balance sheet, and we will continue to look for M&A opportunities in areas that can help to accelerate our growth. We continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders' value. Thank you very much, and we will take your questions now.",1595

But -- so probably, that's a market strength, but this is not Lenovo's strength. So our average in sales price in the total phone area increased last quarter, because we sold more smartphones than feature phones last quarter. So actually last quarter, we sold, total, 8.5 million phones, among that, 7 million was smartphones. So actually, even in the smartphone area, now, we are not just focusing in the low-end, we also launched the mid -- the mainstream, so smartphone. So with around the RMB 2,000 price range. So definitely in the future, we will launch even more mainstream or high-end products to gain market share in those price range [ph]. So basically, in China, definitely, for our smartphone business, we now -- we have the strategy to expand into the other emerging markets. So we have launched our smartphone in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines last quarter, so more will come. So that's our strategy.",158

I think, especially the entry-level, I think, been growing much faster than a high-end and therefore, hence, comes the comments on the smartphone, ASP coming down very, very quickly. I just want to add -- I mean, give a little bit more color to Yuanqing's comment, I think our smartphone business has actually done through operators, as well as open market. I think in both channels, our ASP actually went up. So I think that is -- I think the comment is because the change in the market was so fast, that I think probably, 1 year ago, probably dominated by the premium end. So -- but now the market growth and lot is happening on the entry product and hence, I think your comment.",158

So I think our smartphone business margin was important quarter-to-quarter, because we sold more units in the open market, so last quarter. So actually last quarter, our open market versus telco market mix was almost the 1/3 to 2/3, so that does significantly help us improve the margin. And also, as I told -- told to you before, now we are not just reporting on the low end of smartphones, we also have the mainstream products to cover RMB 2,000 range, price range. So that helped us to improve our GP margin as well. We are confident, so we will further improve our GP margin and the profitability in the smartphone area. So probably, into 3 quarters, so you can see we start to make money in the China, in China smartphone area.",134

If you really at China and China PC, I think the difference is I think is really the smartphone. We actually see the smartphone improving not significantly, but obviously, we expensed significantly in the top line. I think Q1 -- well, Q-to-Q and year-to-year. I think that is really the -- and I can't give you more color, I think in terms of gross margin, although we do not actually disclose separately, I think it was the gross margin of the individual product.

Are you guys seeing any sign of any improvement heading into fourth quarter, and should we expect the return to growth in 2013? And secondly, on the tablet comments that Yuanqing made about pretty much opportunistic [ph] decisions fading and the emotional [ph] decisions fading away, what is your strategy on tablets, given that at least in the emerging market side, tablet has not really taken off in a very big manner?",80

But we are confident that we will continue to outperform the market, so particularly leveraging our Windows 8 best product, so we've also launched, Yoga, Twist et cetera. So we believe that's the innovation for traditional PC. So we are very confident that we will continue to outgrow the market. The second question is -- so definitely, where you put China market, this is just a short-term problem, so from long-term point of view, so we are more optimistic because in China, now PC penetration rate is still much lower than in mature markets, 30% [ph], so compared with more than 90% in mature markets. China is developing many small significant accounts to shift the population from the rural area to the cities, so that will be our opportunity. So after the target conference -- target meeting -- so I believe -- so the market will start to recover -- will start to recover, so that's my view. What's the other question?",184

So tablet is definitely our new market. So you can't address eReader the market, the media consumption market. But my view is either will not replace PC, the traditional PC, particularly, after the PC evolves in the sale, with the new product like our Yoga, so you can have both tablet experience and the traditional PC's power and the features and the function. So that will be even better product. So if you -- so I just read the report on the iPad. So actually now, our market accepts the 7-inch better than 10-inch. So that's a very strong signal. So the pad would not return to the traditional -- would not replace to the traditional PC. Obviously, tablet in the future would compete with larger screen smartphones rather than the PC. People will still need the keyboard -- the PC with a keyboard with hard performance, more powerful, full functional PCs. But definitely, if the PC can have the touchscreen, it will be even better. So this is our view. So with that assumption, so not only Lenovo would develop the better tablet product to address the market demand, we also will further innovate on the traditional PC to ensure we will be the leader in that area. But our ultimate target is to become the PC parts leaders in the world.",226

I think obviously with some convergence of, I think, the PC+ company. Although Yuanqing comments that PC probably remain soft, I think you had PC, our PC+, or our revenue in China actually growing 20% year-to-year. I think that is exactly a very, very significant increase over relatively large market. And secondly, even commenting on the softness of the PC market, maybe going forward, I think you look at our operating margin is actually improved from a PC perspective, I think marginally, I think, year-to-year. So I just really want to, I think bring to that, I think bring some financials so that you can understand, I think the development of the economy has an impact on Lenovo. Reasonably, a lot of economists base on SDMI [ph] Index in China renminbi sort of bottomed out or probably on its way up. I think that we, obviously, are operating in the market. I think if the market does turn -- probably does recover, I believe very strongly that Lenovo will obviously be the company that will benefit most.",191

It was very limited. We just launched the product in those 4 markets. So -- but I believe -- so to expand the smartphone to other markets, first, establishing the emerging markets, is definitely our strategy. We will fully leverage our go-to product, our good, sophisticated channel and the brand to develop this business. So starting from the emerging markets. So we are confident that, that will work.",85

So definitely with the launch of Windows 8, touch will become a very popular feature, so from the traditional PC. So we notify that this change earlier, so we have tried our best to build the relationship with those suppliers. So we cannot guarantee, so we will get 100%, so what we want to get. But we are definitely trying our best to get enough supply here. The second point is, we believe the convertible PC is even better for the -- is even better for the clamshell PC with a touch feature.

So Brazil is, so we still lost money last quarter. So even we have an appeal to the in-house manufacturing there, so we haven't been very sophisticated, that solely the -- been the model and the foundation there. So we still had some trouble or we're still struggling there. But as you know, last quarter, we announced that the CCE deal, so that's the important step for Lenovo to improve our operation in that market. So actually, this will be Lenovo's long-term strategy. We want to build Lenovo as a global local company. So we believe, if we want to win an important market, we must leverage the local talents, the locals to build more end-to-end integrated functions in the local area. So we should have the local products, we should have the local manufacturers, we should have local supply chain and service to support a big market. So with the acquisition of the CCE, so we believe we have good opportunity to improve in this area. So CCE is definitely a good consumer-oriented company. So not only it can help us to improve our PC business, but also other PC products, including smartphone and the TV. They have already sold those products for many years, so that's what we are addressing our Brazilian product.",216

I think, color on what Yuanqing said. APLA actually comprises of, I think, countries in both mature as well as emerging. As you can see that we are #1 in Japan. I think that is obviously mature. And in India, we're also #1. You may well recall that Yuanqing has been talking about one, we're actually over 10%, and we can focus on profitable growth, and that's exactly is the execution of our strategy, trying to grow the volume up to a market share so that when we further grow, we have the scaling benefit, and that will actually have a more significant impact on our bottom line, and that is exactly reflected in the results in APLA. So as Yuanqing said, I think that we have one big market we need to address within that area which is Brazil, and we believe that, I think, CCE will be a very good platform, together with other strategic investment decisions like building a factory there will help us to address that, I think, the growth as well as the profitability of the market. I think we have been very successful with integrating NEC in Japan, which everybody thinks that Japan has always in a difficult country for foreign investors to do business, to integrate and yet, we're extremely successful in that, and we've been also successfully integrating in Medion, and we are very confident that we will carry that capability and experience, and we're able to integrate CCE so that we can address that market in the near future.",268

So I'll give you another information. So among our top 7 PC countries, so now in 5 countries, so we have been #1. And also, we can make money in those are 5 largest markets, China, Japan, Russia, India and the Germany. Actually, so although we are #4 in U.S. but we still make very solid, very stable money from that market. So the Brazil is the only market that we haven't built a solid foundation. So -- but with the CCE deal, with other effort like -- so we are building a new factory in São Paulo part by ourselves, so this is not part of the CCE. So with these kind of actions, so we believe we will significantly improve our presence in Brazil.",127

That was very helpful, and best of luck on integrating CCE. If I may ask one quick follow-up question pertaining to the -- I guess, the emerging enterprise business. I know you guys have been quite busy there as well, the new business unit hiring some external talent, I guess specifically on the EMC side, have you guys begun to start selling storage systems in China through, on behalf of EMC, and I guess where are we with CE, with Iomega IT there, are we starting to develop more IT and technology on enterprise storage side, in house?",100

I think that the EMC deal as well as the Stoneware, which is another, I think software company, to do our cloud capability, those are still subject to the regulatory approval. Although, we will expect that we'll be able to close this quarter. Likewise, CCE, again is also subject to, I think, the regulatory approval. I think that we obviously, would want to build more solid foundation to build adjacent business, I think to our core enterprises customer. I think you're absolutely right that we will continue, we'll work with EMC and also do up again through I think the cooperation we obviously, would develop more IP, and that will be, I think, the foundation for our future growth to service our customers in the mature market. Again, it goes without saying, because we have not closed the deal, we are not, I think, selling the -- we're not integrating or consolidating the Iomega business, I think as of now, but we would expect that we will do it within this quarter.",211

You have mentioned that margin improvement was partially due to the shift from carriers to open channel. I'm wondering if the product mix from low-end handsets to mid-end handsets, approximately [ph] RMB 2,000 had any incremental impact on your margins on that business, and whether the breakeven point for these mid-end handsets are lower than the low-end handsets, and maybe quantify a little bit?

But even in the low-end area, so we are making effort to improve the GP margin part so that we are very -- like I always said. So I'm very confident that we can further improve our profitability in MIDH, with our kind of scale, kind of volume and the market position. So there's no reason we cannot make money in very short period. So actually, so for the past couple of quarters, although we still lost money, but actually we invested more on the marketing on the channel building, these kinds of things. So with the enough volume so I believe in a couple of quarters, so we can start to do -- to make money. So actually, as I said, in the opening remarks, now we have 3 attack business, so emerging markets, mature markets and transactional business and MIDH have been -- So among these 3 businesses, 2 of them have already started to make money, which are emerging markets as a whole and the mature transactional business. So it was -- we can turn around this -- MIDH have been, so that would significantly help our profitability, help our GP margin improvement. So that's why I'm very confident, so over the next 3 years, so this is my target. This is my target to improve our E/R ratio by at least 1 point to reach 3% to 4%. So that's our goal.",260

I think the overall gross margin have been improvement, have been coming out from a change in the mix, meaning that we sell more in the open market rather than the telco market.

So it's really the individual channel, we actually see improvement in margin, as well as we see that, I think the change in mix also help us, I think to move more to the open market, giving us, I think the benefit of overall margin improvement.",110
