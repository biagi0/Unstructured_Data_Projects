410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954876.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Once again, despite of the challenges of the pandemic and the supply shortage, Lenovo has delivered another record-breaking quarter. Our clear focus on profitability and innovation, supported by strong execution, has driven historical results across our businesses. 
We are also pleased that last week, Lenovo has been added to the Hang Seng Index, providing market recognition of our continued strong results. We accelerated the digital and intelligent transformations in the new normal, continue to generate significant opportunities. Investments in digital transformation are expected to increase over 16% annually over the next 3 years. Lenovo's new IT technology architecture of client, edge, cloud, network, intelligence prepares us well to capture these opportunities. 
Last quarter, Lenovo delivered another quarter of record profit and revenue. Our net income reached an all-time record of USD 640 million, up 62% year-on-year. This is the sixth consecutive quarters of over [ 60% ] year-on-year net income growth. Net margin also increased by almost 1 point year-on-year, well on track to doubling within 3 years. With 17% year-on-year growth, our quarterly revenue achieved $20 billion for the first time, thanks to double-digit growth in all key businesses and balanced growth across all geographies. Going forward, we will continue to double our R&D investments, along the new IT architecture, enhance our digital foundation to support the business growth, compete as one Lenovo with pocket of cloud offerings, global footprint and the organizational efficiency and we continue to deliver our ESG commitments. 
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with the Solution and Service Group. The $1 trillion global IT services market through 2025 presents big opportunities for growth. Almost the half of global workers are currently working remotely, driving demand for premier support and the customized fulfillment. As the service penetration in PC and data center is only 2%, providing substantial room for growth and enterprise spending is expected to grow faster in cloud and digital services. 
Last quarter, Lenovo SSG continued to deliver high growth with a higher profitability. This operating margin exceeded 22%, a nearly 3-point increase year-on-year. Revenue continued strong growth of over 25% year-on-year; Support Services, 21%; Managed Service, 50%, driven by our TruScale as a service offerings; Project Services & Solutions, 23% with a breakthrough in smart retail. Looking forward, SSG will capture the remote work trend and leverage our global service footprint to provide accessibility and the flexibility to our customers. SSG will also investing in 2 scale offerings, hybrid cloud solution and other software and services with our own IP and expand the sustainability offerings. 
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, ISG, continues to benefit from the ICT infrastructure upgrade, a $250 billion market globally through 2025. By 2025, the edge infrastructure market alone is expected to grow quickly to USD 41 billion. Last quarter marked an important milestone. Our ISG become profitable for the first time since the IBM x86 acquisition in 2014. Meanwhile, our revenue grew at a double-digit [ premium ] to market for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our Cloud Service Provider and Enterprise/SMB revenue grew by 38% and 7%, respectively, year-on-year. 
Over the years, ISG has invested in building full stack of data center portfolio as well as the in-house design and manufacturing capabilities. We can now cover customers of all scales from Tier 1 CSP to Tier 2 enterprise and SMB. In the long term, this customer coverage will give us unique advantages to balance the scale and profitability as well as customers' demand for security, reliability and agility, flexibility. We will meet all kinds of customer requirements from on-prem, Infrastructure as a Service, all the way to private-public hybrid cloud. 
For the Intelligent Device Group, IDG, smart device markets continued to benefit from the new normal of hybrid working model. The PC market is forecasted to remain strong and stable, shifting to commercial and the premier segments. In smartphone, the market reshuffling will bring more growth opportunity to Lenovo. At the same time, the penetration of 5G and the development of Edge-Cloud-Network-Intelligence will provide more growth potential for the emerging smart devices like embedded computing, IoT, AR/VR, driven by Metaverse as well as Smart Home and Smart Collaboration solutions. 
Last quarter, IDG delivered another record quarter in profit and revenue. Its revenue grew 16% year-on-year and the profit grew even faster, up 21%. In PCs, premier segment delivered a high growth. In non-PCs, smartphone business has seen healthy profit for 7 consecutive quarters. Last quarter, its revenue grew strongly at 46% year-on-year and was the fastest-growing major vendor. 
Meanwhile, we saw some emerging smart devices like smart collaboration solutions. Revenue nearly doubled year-on-year. Going forward, in PCs, we will continue investing in innovation, premier segments and core components. In mobile, we will strengthen our smartphone portfolio and investing, expanding new markets in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
We will also continue to invest in IoT, Metaverse-driven AR/VR, Smart Home and Smart Collaboration Solutions to capture the emerging opportunities. In summary, our market coverage is expanding. Potential is growing. Our capabilities are developing, and our performance is stronger than ever. We are on track to doubling both R&D investment and the net margin by the end of fiscal year 2023/2024. So we are confident in delivering strong, sustainable, profitable growth while also meeting our ESG commitments.
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",905
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954877.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q3 fiscal year 2022. We delivered more than $20 billion in revenue this quarter with multiple financial records. Our net profit grew 62% year-on-year to an all-time high of $640 million, with 17% revenue growth year-on-year. We are excited to see balanced growth across different markets. Our group net margin advanced 89 basis points year-on-year to near record level. 
All 3 of our business groups contributed to profit expansion. ISG, in particular, turned profitable for the first time since its acquisition in 2014. IDG and SSG continued their strong double-digit growth trajectory with profit expansion. We are on pace to achieve our medium-term target of doubling our net margin. The basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0550, representing 66% growth year-on-year. 
In line with the digital transformation and new IT opportunities, we leverage our Client-Edge-Cloud-Network-Intelligence architecture to create devices, services and infrastructure to enhance our digital foundation to support business growth. As part of our commitment to double our R&D investment, during the quarter, our R&D expenses grew 38% year-on-year. This includes investing in talent acquisition and development. Our R&D headcount was up 40%. 
We also invested in broadening services and intellectual property, driving innovation with a focus on ESG and designing for premium segment and edge computing. Every aspect of our R&D investments, ranging from devices, services, infrastructure to AI and operation efficiency to help contribute to the 56 basis point increase in both our record operating margin as well as our long-term competitiveness. 
For fiscal Q3, our operating cash flow remained strong at $606 million. This is in spite of the higher working capital requirements due to our buy-ahead action of strategic component in response to supply challenges. Q3 sales were also unusually back-end loaded because of late arrival of components and longer logistic lead time, linked to higher balances in both account receivable and payables. Our receivable credit conditions remain healthy, although Q4 will also see similar sales skew towards the end of the quarter. 
Nearly 80% of account receivables are within 30 days, and the overdue ratio is at record low. We expect to mitigate the impact from the above factors gradually and continue to accelerate our cash flow. The group financial position continued to be strong. In Q3, finance costs were down by 17% year-on-year, and we finished the quarter with net cash position. This was achieved by reducing our net debt and perpetual securities by USD 3.2 billion over the past 10 quarters. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to stay in a net cash position. 
SSG reported another stellar quarter with strong revenue and profit growth. Structural catalyst, including opportunities arising on the new IT track, hybrid work model, commercial recovery and increasing ESG awareness are powerful drivers to our service expansion. Its revenue increased by 25% year-on-year to USD 1.5 billion. Booking and deferred revenue grew at strong double digits, indicating a larger recurring revenue base. SSG boosted operating profit by 44% year-on-year to $332 million and operating margin revised 2.9 points to 22.2%. 
By segment, Support Services revenue rose 21% year-on-year, posting the highest profitability in the group. Working alongside with other business groups, SSG is broadening service penetration in PC. We made significant progress in premier and customer fulfillment services, while customer interest continue to grow for sustainability services such as asset recovery. We are actively developing 6 more sustainability service solutions. Managed Services posted a strong 50% revenue growth with improved profitability on the back of the increasing popularity of as-a-service model branded under TruScale. We won a number of deals while also expanding its geographic presence and customer base. 
Project Services & Solutions also reported solid revenue growth of 23% year-on-year. Despite the pandemic creating challenges in project delivery, the total contract value more than tripled with important deals signed for smart retail, amid increasing adoption of our in-house IP solutions. 
ISG staged a successful turnaround, leveraging its enriched architecture and technology solution as well as successful project wins and industry partnerships. As a result, its operating profit increased $28 million year-on-year. ISG outgrew the market with new projects and acquisition of new Next Wave customers looking to build their cloud platform. In response to increased emphasis on a streamlined, fully integrated supply chain, our unique ODM plus business model provide a holistic solution encompassing a vertically integrated operation. 
In SMB, revenue reached a 5-year high led by high-margin storage, service and software sales. The group maintained #2 in global entry storage market as well as continue as the largest provider of supercomputers globally. IDG achieved another record quarter for revenue and operating profit up 16% and 21% year-on-year, respectively. The shift towards commercial and premium segments continue to accelerate. Commercial demand benefited from digital transformation and transition to a hybrid work model on a global scale, growing at the third highest rate since 1998. This commercial strength, together with the strong growth in premium segments, bode well for increasing our average selling price and profitability. Our PC business does show a 19% increase in ASP and improved margins, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of year-on-year profit margin expansion for IDG. 
Non-PC products contributed to 19% of IDG's revenue in the quarter. Smartphone revenue grew 46% year-on-year, and its operating profit stayed at a record level of $89 million. Our portfolio expansion strategy to increase product differentiation was well executed. IDG smartphone shipments increased 53% year-on-year according to IDC, substantially ahead of the market with share gains across key markets. 
In North America, we posted triple-digit growth in revenue, while strengthening our #2 position in our stronghold markets in Latin America. Speaking of our ESG initiative in December 2021, Lenovo was rated at the leadership level for the first time in both the CDB water and climate surveys, respectively receiving an A and A- in these widely recognized surveys. 
We broaden our sustainability services and TruScale portfolio, added ESG-related features such as CO2 offset options to our products and increase our adoption of green materials. On the group level, we are exploiting the path to lessen our emissions by 2050, completing the road test of time-based target initiative methodology and becoming a founding member of the China Net Zero-Network. On governance, Lenovo has received recognition from Corporate Knight's, Bloomberg and The Hong Kong Institute of CPA. Other impactful sustainable initiatives include Lenovo 360 ESG Circle and the EcoVadis Rating, too. 
Strategic opportunities in digital and service-led transformation continue to accelerate. We are investing to build Lenovo service-led transformation, taking advantage of infrastructure demand proliferation, drive sales in high value-added products and ultimately achieve the growth medium-term financial target of doubling our net margin. 
Looking forward, SSG is building a broader service portfolio to take full advantage of remote working environment. New business model of asset service is growing fast and the resulting rapid penetration into PC and infrastructure sectors will support its future hyper growth. SSG will play a key role in driving recurring revenue and increasing Lenovo's profitability. 
For ISG, the infrastructure upgrade opportunity remains strong, and Lenovo is one of the fastest-growing infrastructure providers globally. We are committed to building full stack offerings and to servicing both CSP and ESMB segments. We'll continue to develop offerings to meet regional demand and capture growth opportunities, including as-a-Service portfolio to address the proliferation in data and AI computation at edge. In CSP, we are migrating to our ODM+ model for improved profitability and greater supply chain and procurement agility. In ESMB, we will continue to expand our product portfolio from service into storage, storage-defined infrastructure, software and services to pursue higher profitability. In doing so, we will create new business opportunities and expand our customer base. IDG will continue to lead and grow a premium to the market. The global PC sector should remain strong and stable, thanks to the hybrid work model and digital transformation, driving demand in commercial and premium segments. PC business will further invest in the premium segment to drive profitability through innovations in the area of ESG features and green materials. 
The smartphone business will focus on portfolio enhancement and differentiation to take advantage of accelerated 5G adoption and the changing competitive landscape. The group will address the expanding Internet of Things opportunities to grow its non-PC business. The Hang Seng Index Company announced last week that effective from 7 of March 2022, Lenovo Group will be included as a constituent stock of the Hang Seng Index, which is reflective of our stellar operational performance in recent years. 
Our strong financial position provides the solid foundation on which Lenovo can proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead. Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable profitability growth for our shareholders. Thank you. And now we can take your questions.",1473

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954880.0,Question,H. Chen,,Analysts,5,"Congratulations on your strong results. First question is about the guidance. Can you give us the guidance by different segments with new fiscal year? And the second question is, actually I was surprised to see Lenovo share price fell in the session today after reporting such good numbers. I think this actually happened a few times in recent quarters. Could you help us understand what drives the disconnection here?",69
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954881.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,6,"Thank you, Grace. So definitely, we delivered a very good result last quarter. So all our businesses grow at a double-digit level. And also, the -- our operators increased by more than [ 50% ] for consecutive quarters. So that's the last quarter. Definitely, we are very confident, so this growth can continue. So not only ISG will drive the hyper growth, SSG will drive high growth with higher profitability. Even for IDG, we are confident that we can continue to drive the growth. So although the PC market and order growth at [indiscernible] about the year, it will keep the current shipment level also that means [ 3 million ] units every year. 
And also, we see the second shift -- the shifting from low end to the premier segment, the shifting from consumer to the commercial. So all these trends will help improve the average selling price. So that means that even though the unit shipment will be flat or even growth, but the revenue part will keep growing up, we are confident on that. 
Meanwhile, our IDG is not just relying on PC. It will more rely on non-PC business growth. For example, mobile, so we see a strong 48% -- 46% year-on-year growth last quarter. So we definitely think this trend will continue, because we were expanding into the new market in Europe and Asia Pacific. We will double down on some markets so to drive the growth. And also with 5G development and with the new IT, the Client-Edge-Cloud-Network-Intelligence architecture development, we think there are more emergent devices in part. So for example, the embedded computing, IoT, for example, the AR/VR, driven by Metaverse, Smart Home and Smart Collaboration solutions. 
So those are definitely a faster-growing areas. So we will take that opportunity for the whole. So we are confident, so from all the company point of view. So we will continue to drive the growth. So in short term, we will still be able to drive the double-digit growth. So I don't know whether I answer your question. In share price, so probably Wai Ming, you're better to answer the question, right?",358
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954882.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,7,"Okay. So well, thanks for your question. I think great. I believe that it probably is the market may not fully understand immediately, I think, our very strong result because of the very volatile environment. I think, Grace, if you recall, I think Lenovo is probably the first company, maybe even a few quarters will begin after the COVID-19 that we actually have the insight of the continuing growth of the IT business. And the market, obviously, was a little bit suspicious. And as you noted, we actually been consistently deliver, I think, what we actually call out a few quarters that's really number one. 
The second one that I would probably want to, I think, draw your attention is our share price, unfortunately, did not immediately reflect the very strong growth, but with the experience invested, I think, such as yourself, after 1 or 2 days when you actually have an opportunity to study, I think the underlying strength of our business. If I recall, most of the analysts' report, in fact, actually have a recommendation of buy as well as uplifting our target price. And very slowly, the share price actually return, I think, to another high level. 
I think thirdly, I would say that clearly, there was some sort of short-term trading. As you recall, last Friday, Lenovo was -- I think it was announced that Lenovo was actually included in the Hang Seng Index. On Monday and Tuesday, there are tremendous amount of buy and the share price actually went up by nearly 5% for the last 2 days. So maybe there are some short-term, I think, trading mentality, especially in view of, I think, the latest unfortunate, I think Ukraine, Russia event that trigger, I think some short-term investors taking profit. 
So I would expect that, I think with the analysts having more time and more experience and more expert understanding of the business. I'm sort of patiently waiting for your research report and your recommendation and I actually am very confident about -- that I think the institutional industry, in particular, I think they will study very carefully of your analysis, and we will see the return of the share price to another high level.",371

Thank you for the question. So I think you're asking whether our view in the market, the PC market will be stable, kind of flat in the next fiscal. The answer is this is our view and also supported by most of the analysts and also our industry partners. We all see the market to be stable but with a higher AUR due to improved mix, premium, more commercial and also the -- compared with the previous year, there is certainly a slowdown of Chrome. So the total volume perhaps the same, but the value increasing significantly, as demonstrated by our AUR recently.",105

So sorry, so 2 questions for me. One is, can you talk a little bit about your channel inventory situation in the PC market? I think earlier this year, you guys had seen channel inventory creeping up a little bit to around [ 4 to 5 ] weeks, which is still below your healthy level. But just wanted to see how that has changed over the past couple of weeks. 
And in terms of the server business, I just wanted to ask a 2-part question. One is, in terms of your third quarter numbers, it seems like revenue were down a little bit on a sequential basis, whereas I think a lot of other companies within the server supply chain reported pretty strong calendar year fourth quarter numbers. So I just wanted to see -- ask what was the reason for that? It seems like cloud revenues were down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And can you guys provide outlook and commentary about your ISG business in the next coming quarters?",172

So look, the inventory profile is materially -- still materially below the pre-COVID situation and particularly in the commercial segment for the so-called transactional part of the commercial segment is significantly below the pre-COVID levels, and you also need to think that we are now in a market with a bigger total available market. Additionally, just maybe to give you a little bit more color on our business model. Not all of our business holds an inventory by design. So we have several segment relationship, government, global account that in most of the cases have no inventory at all. So this is a kind of an end-to-end direct kind of concept. 
The consumer inventory on the other side is growing a little bit, still below pre-COVID, but I would say that it's normalizing to a reasonable level because during the peak of pandemic, it was just too low, to the point that we lost or the industry lost opportunities to sell. So I would not consider this worrying situation. On the contrary, I would conclude saying that we are not concerned about our inventory levels. Hopefully, I answered your question.",191
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954891.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,16,"Yes. So probably Luca, I can ask you to expand this situation. So our inventory or channel inventory levels are probably higher than last year, but it's lower than before pandemic. And also the reasonable channel inventory is net -- that will help to drive [indiscernible] because in the last year and the past period. So if we have 10 model offerings, probably we only have 5 in -- another 5 is in shortage. So for those customers, they want to buy another 5, so they cannot buy. So that's the issue. So that's why we think the reasonable channel inventory will help the sales. So that's our current channel inventory situation. So our parts inventory probably is higher than before the pandemic. So the other reason you could understand, so that's because of the shortage. We have to buy ahead for some components, so that drives the parts inventory higher.  Okay. So Kirk, would you like to talk about the IT now?",163
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2022",2022-02-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3737.0,2503497.0,94954892.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,17,"Sure. So I think we're very excited about the growth in server and storage. But since your question was regarding server, I think some of the calendar fourth quarter Analyst Day is now just coming in preliminary, and we're expecting the formal revenue share numbers to be out in -- across the next several weeks. I think we're confident, given our increasing average unit pricing based on an improved mix that we'll see a premium to market when that happens. We're in a unique position because we are participating both in cloud and in enterprise SMB. 
In cloud, we had a significant premium to market, double-digit premium to market. And we have not only acquired some new billion-dollar class customers in the Tier 1 space, but we've grown our next wave account base more than 100% year-on-year in a supply-constrained environment. So as that supply continues to free up, we're confident that, that growth will just accelerate further, and we have the design wins in place to make that happen. In Enterprise SMB, this was our highest revenue in 5 years for a Q3. And we're seeing strength in records across all of our profit engine. So record Microsoft software, our VMware software, our Nutanix software in edge, in communication service providers, all of those hit new records. And I think our product innovation speaks for itself. We were just awarded this quarter the AI Product of the Year by HPCwire, CRN Storage Product of the Year, and now we have new ThinkEdge product that is the most GPU-rich edge server. 
So all of that shows servers are strong. And in storage, I think we're confident that in the price bands 1 through 4 will grow from previously not even being on the radar to being the #1 entry storage provider in price bands 1 through 4, which make up about 60% of the units in the storage market. So I think, hopefully, that gives you some optimism for the future. And the supply point is that I think things will get better from there. We did have an exceptionally strong Q2, which was a 30% year-to-year growth. So in this cloud business, when you've got very, very large customers that can be a little cyclical, but I would just -- there's no -- from my perspective, there's no concern I have. We see exceptionally strong growth for the future and continued profitability.",403

If we can have better supply, so definitely, even last quarter, we could deliver even stronger performance. But we definitely are optimistic on the current quarter and the future on the ISG business. And also, as I said at the beginning, so Lenovo is a very unique company in the ISG area. So we can cover all kinds of customers, all the way from Tier 1, our service provider to Tier 2, the enterprise SMB. So this coverage will give us a unique advantage to balance scale and profitability, and also, we can meet our customers' requirement. We can finish our customers' requirement on securities, reliability and flexibility, agility. So we have laid out the strategy. It is solid, so we are confident that we will continue to drive the growth in other business.",148

My first question is on the Service business, which has gained a lot of good traction. Could you consider any M&A point to accelerate the service business development? If yes, what's the consideration when doing M&A for service? My second question is on mobile. You mentioned that you're going to enter Europe and Asia again. I remember a couple of years ago, Lenovo changed their mobile strategy to become more focused in term profits. So I wonder what's the competition level in Europe and Asia versus not a couple of years ago. What's the difference in the strategy this time? And is there any impact on the new strategy on profitability side?",117

Regarding services, first of all, I think we are very happy to see the strong growth in Solutions and Services Group, SSG. I think this is the third consecutive quarter where we see our revenue growth is faster than the group and also maintaining at a high level of profitability. I think this, once again, giving us confidence that our service-led transformation strategy is actually executing well, right? Just like YY said at the opening, I think we definitely see our customer is asking for more help because of new IT is powerful, at the same time also very complex, right? 
So a lot of customers is actually looking for help. Like Lenovo, where we have the full portfolio of hardware, from pocket to the cloud software and now services and solutions, right, to help to unleash the full power of technology, and also to help them to bring in the desire services outcome. This is a big trend for the overall services market. In terms of growth, I think we are looking at all strategy, including both organic and inorganic way to grow SSG, and we are very confident in our strategy. And also I think Wai Ming can cover -- I think we are in terms of our balance sheet, where we are much healthier ever than before to support any kind of tactic in terms of growing SSG.

I think our scale has improved globally. So our plan has always been protecting Latin America, North America, where we are growing fast in premium to market and rebuilding our capabilities in different regions like Europe and Asia. Our approach is going to be very focused. We are not going broadly in those markets, but starting to get relevant in key markets we have selected carefully. Our time to market in product development has gone down 30% to 40% since 3 to 4 years ago. What allowed us to play much better in those markets in our software platforms. And I think also, we'll leverage a lot the Lenovo capabilities in markets like B2B and commercial. 
So I mean we're going to keep growing in North America and Latin America. We see growth coming from selected markets in Europe and Asia that will represent a strong percentage and our approach is going to be very careful. So we are seeing very early positive indications that we can sustain profitable growth, both interactive markets in Europe and no different in Asia.",188

So regarding our mobile business, so I think we have successfully realized our first stage objective to make this business healthy profitable. So actually, we have been in this position for 6 or 7 consecutive quarters. So now we changed the strategy to the profitable growth. So definitely, we will make sure there's been -- we have continued to be profitable, so simple at the current level. 
So if we can make more money from this business, definitely we will reinvest the money into expansion of the market. So -- but we will not expand the market everywhere. We will only choose the selective countries or markets to double down on that, that we can quickly get by September this year. So that will be our strategy for the future. So we are pretty confident. Last year, we shipped [ 65 million ] units of the smartphone. So this year, we will keep the hyper growth as we delivered in the past 2 quarters.",165

Definitely, we see AI and AI everywhere as a growth opportunity for us. As I mentioned, and I think also Wai Ming mentioned, we maintained our position as #1 in the global top 500 supercomputers and have actually, over the last year now, installed the largest supercomputers we've ever done in more countries than any person in the world or any OEM in the world. So about 1 in 3 of the world's supercomputers. And many, if not all of those are putting an AI elements into their compute engines. 
But the other large growth area is at the edge. And we've created now an end-to-end portfolio with the new [indiscernible] called ThinkEdge. And as I mentioned, we were just awarded by HPCwire, who gives out the awards, as having one of the best AI products or the Best AI Product. And we now have a new portfolio with the SE450 product that's the world's most GPU-rich servers. So we can actually put 4 GPUs in an edge server. As a result, we just won one of the largest global retailers in fast food chains in the world using our edge servers with the GPUs there to help automate and make their drive-thrus more resilient. So definitely, we're seeing AI as a significant growth engine. As YY said earlier, over a $40 billion market coming up, and we now have a brand-new ThinkEdge product line. And internally, we just announced a new ThinkEdge division to do everything from the edge device to the edge gateway to the edge servers. And this was a record quarter, by the way, for our Edge business. So we've put together several record quarters in a row now and are continuing to grow that portfolio.

So our -- like we reignite our business in India 2, 3 years ago. We are seeing good progress, solid. We're assuming -- we are seeing consumer ratings very positive, strong flash sales. So we will continue to grow in India. We are coming from a small base, but growing -- very in a sustainable way. We believe this is going to hold, and probably our expectation is to gain share to grow 3, 4 points of share in the next few months, years. 
So we see the progress, very healthy and sustainable and profitable in India with a special focus on online. In China, we reunite our business a year ago. We cleared the channel. We launched our Razr family very successfully and now the Edge family is still very small. We are going to be very careful. It's a big market. And -- but we are seeing a small progress in a very slow way. So India, little faster and going in a good direction, both brand and channel. Our stocking channels are very low in those markets, and our sell-out keeps surpassing our selling the last few months. So [ cash ] approach, we see steady growth, and I think we continue to sustain that over the next months.",213

So let me add something here. So actually, in the mobile world or industry, probably there are 3 different games. The first is the U.S. and the mature markets. So it's driven by the premium product, our premier brand. So -- but meanwhile, our consumers, our customers want to pay premium price so you can see there are different players in those kind of markets, so Apple, Samsung, Motorola and possibly, LG. So that's the first game. 
The second game is like Latin America market. So this is mainly driven by the mainstream product, not premium but fair price. So that's another market. So actually, China, India, probably are the third market, that's the price performance [indiscernible] market. So people want to have the latest technology. But meanwhile, they want to be more aggressive on the price. So those are 3 different games or battles. So definitely, we -- with Lenovo's strategy, we want to win the first 2 first. But meanwhile, we started to prepare the capability in the third game or in the third market. So that will be Lenovo's strategy. Okay. Next question.",189

So thanks for the question. So I think talking about 2022, a little bit, as I said before, the view is that the market will stabilize with better AUR. Now I think we can make -- I want to make 2 reflections. One is that when we say the market will stabilize, we also need to recognize that from the pre-COVID to the post-COVID PC market, this market will be adding $100 billion of revenue, which obviously is a very significant number and opens a lot of profit opportunities given the larger size. This is one. The other thing -- the other reason why we are confident is that the digital transformation, work from home, all these things, are naturally driving more demand for the PC technology. 
And I just want to say the remote collaboration, which is probably the killer application, this is the one which runs the best on PC. So I think there are many, many reasons to feel confident about a stable market with increasing average in unit price and consequently, a little bit of improving on the revenue versus already [ 900 ], which will be the 2021. 
Obviously, just to add some more color, this [ '22 ] market, we believe, will be stronger in commercial, which is very positive not only because our exposure in commercial is traditionally higher. Approximately 65% of our last quarter revenue was in commercial, but also because this mix is more favorable in terms of penetration rates, of service penetration rate, which obviously comes with good margins. And additionally, you have the accessory attached, which also come with a good margin. And if you think about the work from home, many users, once have now 2 PC from a world perspective, and want to have a rich portfolio of accessory and even services to use their product and to work with their product at home. So I think there are many good reasons to have a good view on the market plus our traditional ability to drive a premium to market. So even with the flat market, we'll continue to grow and better than the market. Thank you.",362

Last year, the world faced multiple challenges including supply shortages, pandemic disruption, geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation yet we successfully overcome these challenges and delivered a record year with historical revenue and profitability improvements. All our main businesses are profitable, and our new growth engines are positioned for even stronger success. 
The digital and intelligence transformation trend continues to accelerate. IDC reports that more than 50% of enterprises now have digitalization as a part of their corporate strategy. The hybrid work model is here to stay creating strong demand not only for smart devices and the data center infrastructure, but also scenario-driven solutions such as smart collaboration, smart home and the smart office. 
Guided by our clear strategy, we captured these opportunities to deliver all-time record fiscal year profit and revenue for the group. For the first time, net income reached USD 2 billion, up 72% year-on-year. Revenue also improved by USD 10 billion for the second year in a row, reaching USD 71 billion, crossing the USD 70 billion milestone. Our main businesses are now profitable for the first time since the Motorola mobile and the IBM x86 acquisitions with particularly strong growth momentum in our Mobile, Infrastructure and Software & Services businesses. 
At the same time, we continued to strengthen our competitiveness to drive sustainable profitable growth. We made strong progress towards doubling R&D investments within 3 years from fiscal year 2021-2022 up 43% year-on-year last year. And we continued to realize our ESG goals and commitments.  
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Software & Services Group. The trillion-dollar IT services market continues to expand with the hybrid work model. The demand for digital workplace services is expected to reach USD 93 billion by 2025. Also, our studies show more than 90% of CIOs are willing to consider adopting as-a-Service offerings. 
In the last year, SSG captured these opportunities and delivered high growth and high profitability. Revenue reached an all-time record of 30% year-on-year. Operating margin was 22%. We saw strong double-digit growth across all segments. Especially Managed Service grew more than 60% with a strong growth from our TruScale as-a-Service business. 
Now revenue from Managed Service and Project & Solution Services accounts for almost half of our SSG business. SSG continued to invest in software tools, platforms and repeatable vertical solutions with our own IP. 
We are driving deeper in our vertical solution capabilities in key industries focusing on manufacturing, retail, health care, education and smart city. We continued to expand our TruScale as-a-Service to the broader digital workplace solutions and developed our hybrid cloud solutions. In the meantime, we are further exploring metaverse solutions based on our current foundation. 
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG, continues to benefit from  ICT infrastructure upgrade. The data center market is expected to reach USD 183 billion by 2025, and the Edge infrastructure market alone is expected to exceed USD 41 billion. The hybrid cloud market will exceed USD 120 billion with data creation expected to nearly double by 2025 from 2022. The opportunities for data processing and storage will continue to expand rapidly. 
Last year, ISG reached an important milestone, becoming profitable over the full year with revenue up more than 13% year-on-year to a new record. All the high-value businesses, such as storage, software, services and the high-performance computers set revenue records. 
We continued to grow at a premium to the market by enhancing our full stack of capabilities that cover both CSP, Cloud Service Provider, Enterprise and SMB segment. We continued to invest in, in-house design and manufacturing capabilities while also expanding into faster-growing areas, including edge and cloud services. We further differentiated with green technology such as our Neptune Liquid Cooling system. 
For our Intelligent Device Group, or IDG, smart devices continue to benefit from the hybrid work model while consumer PC demand may slow in the short term. Commercial demand remains strong. Smart collaboration market is expected to surpass USD 80 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, the challenges we have faced in the recent past only disappeared right away. 
By overcoming challenges while capturing opportunities, IDG delivered a fantastic fiscal year with revenue exceeding USD 60 billion for the first time, up 18% year-on-year. Operating profit improved by almost USD 1 billion. We maintained the #1 position in PCs as the premier segments delivered high double-digit growth. 
Our Mobile business revenue outgrew the market by 30 points with double operating profit to more than USD 360 million, a record since the Motorola acquisition. 
We are expanding beyond the PCs. And now over 18% of IDG revenue comes from other smart devices, embedded computing, IoT and the scenario-based solutions. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on innovation, particularly in premier segments, to extend our leading position in PC while maintaining industry-leading profitability. We further expanded to beyond PC devices, IoTs and the scenario-based solutions to provide new growth engines as we move from computers to computing. 
Let me also cover our fourth quarter performance. Despite the disruption to supply under production due to COVID-19 outbreak in China, we still managed to close the year with strong results. Our net income achieved more than 50% year-on-year improvement for the seventh consecutive quarter. Our revenue grew nearly 7%. 
All 3 business growth contributed to our profitable growth. SSG revenue grew 28% and improved the operating margin by over 1 point. ISG sustained profitability for the second quarter. And IDG improved the operating margin for the 18th consecutive quarter. 
Lastly, there's one particular message I want to share with you. Years of our persistent investment and efforts in Infrastructure and Mobile businesses have paid off. They have not only turned profitable, but also become our new growth engines, along with SSG. We will capture these windows of opportunity and drive the entire company to new heights. At the same time, we will continue to decisively invest in innovation, service-led transformation and ESG for continued success. 
While the world continues to face uncertainty, we will stay flexible and resilient. We will execute our clear strategy, compete with a unique advantage of global-local model and balance between innovation and efficiency. We are confident to overcome challenges while capturing opportunities to deliver sustainable profitable growth in the future. Thank you. 
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1065

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in fiscal year 2022 and Q4. 
For the 2022 fiscal year, our group delivered another historic year with new milestone in profit and revenue. The group revenue exceeded $70 billion for the first time in company history and grew 18%, adding $10 billion for the second consecutive year. Profit attributable to equity holders increased 72% to $2 billion. And basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.1745. This represents an 83% year-on-year growth, a strong accomplishment in a year impacted by severe supply chain and logistical disruptions. Group net income margin improved 89 basis points year-on-year, on track to achieving our target of doubling net margin in 3 years. 
Our growth trajectory remains strong and well supported by structural trends, such as digital transformation, increasing complexity in cloud infrastructure and customer preference for value-added solutions. 
Our balanced growth profile underscore the group business strength. It is worth noting our growth beyond PC, including our successful turnaround of Infrastructure business and strong expansion in smartphone and services. We achieved consistent growth across all 3 business groups and geographical markets except Asia Pacific due to a slowdown in education sales relative to the high base last year. 
ISG turned profitable for the first time since our acquisition of IBM x86 business. Both SSG and IDG contributed to another successful year with double-digit revenue increase and profit expansion. 
Today, the Board declared a final dividend of HKD 0.30 per share. Taking into consideration of the interim dividend of HKD 0.08 per share, the total dividend will be HKD 0.38 per share for fiscal year 2022. 
Now let me shift gears to talk about our R&D investments. We made a commitment to double our R&D investment in 3 years. And in fiscal year '22, the group R&D spending grew 43% year-on-year. Digital transformation has never been more important to our growth as we invest in new IT architecture spanning across client-edge-cloud-network-intelligence. Our investments will push the development of high value-added products and key components including edge, storage and cloud in response to significant growth in data creation and data consumption. We will also drive innovation to propel our smartphone portfolio scenario-based solution, ESG initiative and expand our services scope. Every aspect of our R&D investment has helped contribute to the 71 basis point increase in our record operating margin and long-term competitiveness. 
In fiscal year '22, our operating cash flow further increased to $4.1 billion, improving over 4 consecutive years to a record level. Free cash flow reached $2.8 billion. These results were achieved through strong profit expansion and prudent working capital management while balancing between generating cash and maintaining competitiveness in response to the industry-wide challenges in supply and logistics. 
Our strength in cash flow management was maintained throughout the fourth fiscal quarter. Operating cash flow more than doubled to nearly $1.5 billion, while free cash flow [ tripled ] to $1.1 billion. 
To optimize our capital structure, the group further reduced net debt by $1.5 billion and finance costs by 18% during the year, including in the repurchase of perpetual securities. We cut net debt by a total of $3.5 billion in the last 4 years and achieved net cash for consecutive quarters. It's worth noting that not only did a major rating agency grant Lenovo a credit rating upgrade during the year, Lenovo was also added to the Hang Seng Index as a consistent stock. 
SSG closed its first year of business with operating profit up by 40% year-on-year as operating margin widened to 22%. Revenue increased by 30% to $5.4 billion, growing much faster than the industry average. Our recurring revenue base continued to build as our deferred revenue grew by 30% year-on-year. 
SSG's solid performance was supported by the strength in its 3 business segments, among which Support Services revenue rose 23% year-on-year. We continued to improve our service penetration with an enhanced portfolio, including services in areas of hybrid work and sustainability, which are vital to our customers. 
Revenue of our second service pillar, Managed Services, grew 63% with Lenovo TruScale's launch, which cover a wide range of as-a-Service offerings. 
The third pillar, Project & Solution Services, which provide industrial vertical solutions continued to build repeatable solutions and make breakthroughs in smart city and smart retail for contract wins. 
In Q4, SSG continued its robust growth trajectory from the previous 3 quarters, reporting nearly $1.4 billion revenue with 28% year-on-year growth and an 8% contribution to the group revenue. SSG operating margin improved 1.1 points year-on-year to a record 22.5%. 
Let's turn to ISG. The business group delivered a record year. Its revenue reached all-time high of $7.1 billion, up 13% year-on-year despite supply constraints of semiconductor parts. The business also turned profitable for the first time since the IBM x86 acquisition. ISG operating profit increased by $137 million year-on-year. 
In Q4, the COVID lockdown down in Shenzhen added further pressure on our supply chain affecting ISG revenue growth. Despite the unprecedented supply impact, ISG was again profitable in this fiscal quarter and reported a year-on-year profit expansion of $36 million, highlighting its strength in weathering through challenges to drive profitability. 
ISG expanded its client base through a broadened portfolio of product offerings that particularly appeal to next-wave customers in the CSP business that are in need of strong supply support to expand their own cloud services. 
CSP revenue grew 20% in the year, thanks to design wins in next-gen products. ESMB revenue was up 7% year-on-year as the business expanded high-growth, high-margin solutions across service, storage, SDI Software & Services and capture emerging opportunities in AI-powered edge and hybrid cloud. 
IDG delivered another record year in performance. Its revenue and operating profit grew 18% and 27% year-on-year, respectively, to all-time highs. IDG added $9.3 billion in revenue in fiscal year '22, a strong achievement considering the scale of this business. These results were achieved despite multiple challenges, including supply constraints, weakness in education segment and the ongoing pandemic. 
IDG group continued to be the leader in the global PC sector by both market share and profits. The business is investing in innovations and cultivating a strong commercial demand from the hybrid work model. Premium products continued to enjoy high double-digit sales growth as premium commercial sales grew 30% to 60% year-on-year, while sales among premium consumers were up 30% to 37%. We also extended our innovation in the ESG area including increased use of recycled materials and sustainable packaging. 
IDG also makes significant progress beyond PC, including other smart devices, embedded computing and scenario-based solutions. This delivered a combined revenue growth of 26% and accounted for 18% of IDG revenue in fiscal year '22. The success of IDG's adjacent products is becoming an increasing important profit contributor as smartphone sales increased 39% year-on-year with doubled operating profit. 
Sales of smart collaboration solutions also grew nearly triple digits year-on-year on the back of strong customer demand, although off a low base. 
In Q4, IDG achieved a solid 14% profit expansion. Its operating margin grew to 7.7% with profitability increase year-on-year over 18 consecutive quarters. 
Q4 was a quarter of strong performance with a 58% hyper growth in net profit. The global supply shortage of semiconductor persisted while COVID lockdowns impacted the operations of our Shenzhen factory. Despite these challenges, our revenue grew by 7% and all business groups reported strong profit improvements. 
SSG continued to post double-digit growth in both revenue and profitability, a clear evidence of its ability to increase service penetration and capitalize on its massive installed hardware base. 
ISG was profitable for 2 consecutive quarters with an operating profit improvement of $36 million year-on-year. 
IDG maintained high profitability, thanks to its focused strategy in driving growth in segments where demand is strong including premium and commercial segments as well as opportunities beyond PC. IDG's smartphone business continued its record breaking performance in focused markets and reached a double-digit market share for the first time in North America since the acquisition of Motorola. 
On the ESG front, Lenovo achieved a CDP score of A for supplier engagement rating in climate change. We are also listed on the Supplier Engagement rating leaderboard, an honor we have maintained since 2018. Lenovo was included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. As a global technology leader, gender equality is a top priority of our social impact efforts. We set several ambitious goals to enhance gender diversity, including increasing the female representation of our executive population by 7 percentage points over 5 years to 27% by fiscal year ending March 2026. 
On governance, Lenovo received its highest-ever rating and the best overall industry score for the IT industry in the 2021 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index, achieving a AA+ rating for the first time. It is also the first time we received the 2022 Asia Pacific top-rated ESG performer rating by Sustainalytics. We are making every effort to improve our supply chain practice by completing the initial ESG risk screening of over 500 suppliers with the EcoVadis rating tool. 
Looking ahead, the group will continue to operate with a larger purpose in mind as it anticipates the technology and innovation needs of a smarter future. While the external environment remains challenging, the strategic opportunities in digital and service-led transformations should accelerate, filling commercial demand for Lenovo end-to-end user-friendly product and service solutions. Our clear strategy and execution, coupled with committed R&D investment and solid global-local franchise, are key to achieving our medium-term goal of doubling net margin. 
SSG is a new and well-established growth engine for the group with its driving scale and strong profitability. Structural opportunities will emerge from digitalization and post-pandemic changes in the workplace. The shift will increase the demand for premier TruScale-as-a-Service, sustainability and vertical solutions. SSG will continue to broaden its service offering in this area while strengthening channel tools and cooperation with business partners. 
With our goal to sustain double-digit growth trajectory, we will actively seek business opportunities to broaden and deepen the geographical and vertical coverage of our services, especially by Managed and Project & Solution Services. With strengthened customer relationship, SSG will further enhance its financial contribution to the group. 
The outlook remains strong in ISG as the COVID-led supply shortfall has resulted in unfulfilled customer orders as customers accelerate infrastructure upgrades. ISG has built industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expanded from server to full stack offerings, including storage, SDI, software and services. 
For the ESMB segment, ISG will expand its portfolio for higher profitability. The group will also capitalize on growth opportunities in AI-powered edge, hybrid cloud, high-performance computing and solution for the telco communication sectors. 
For the CSP segment, the group has a unique ODM+ business model to address growing customer demand. The business will continue to diversify its customer base and expand its share of existing accounts through design wins. 
IDG will lead the global race and device innovation by enhancing features for hybrid working, gaming, entertainment, green materials and ESG designs. 
Meanwhile, the total available market of global PC sector should remain at a level higher than the prepandemic period, thanks to the strong commercial demand from the hybrid work model. The smartphone business will focus on portfolio expansion and differentiation to take advantage of the accelerated 5G adoption and changing competitive landscape. 
IDG will accelerate investment to score wins in new growth engines, a move which has become more important for growth. This includes fast-growing accessories and scenario-based solution. 
Our strong financial position provides a solid foundation on which Lenovo can proactively pursue long-term growth opportunities ahead. In the short term, we face headwinds from slowing down economic growth and ongoing pandemic. The entire industry has been impacted by unpredictable developments, which will create impact on supply and demand. Nevertheless, we will continue to leverage our operational excellence and pursue innovations to grow faster than the industry and expand our new business opportunities. 
Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability for our shareholders. Thank you.",2007

Thank you, Desmond, for your question. Definitely, the lockdown in China has certain impact on the demand and the supply chain. On the demand side, so we do see some short-term impact, particularly on the commercial PC. But in the consumer PC, the impact is less because when people at the home so they need the PC to work or to study. But for the normal, we have very balanced portfolio across the geographies. So we think the rest of world will offset the China loss. So that's about the demand. 
Regarding of the supply, indeed, it brings a certain -- uncertainty, but we have tried to mitigate during lockdown really are not new. It's something our industry and others around the world have navigated for the past 2 years. If you recall back to the early days of the global pandemic, it was cities and factories in China that were hardest hit first. We learned from those experience, which has helped us mitigate and minimize the impact for the similar situation. 
Lenovo's supply chain has always been a core strength of our company as demonstrated by our business results. Our unique global manufacturing footprint across the certified market, it's very helpful. Our hybrid manufacturing model of in-house and the ODM are -- is helpful. Definitely our operational excellence, our flexible and resilient will continue to help us overcome these challenges. 
Also, the good news is that we are seeing some cities, including China, losing restrictions. While we will still see some short-term impact in the market, we remain confident about the long-term opportunities even in China. Thank you.",270

Thank you, YY. Desmond, it's Wai Ming from -- CFO. We obviously are doing during deleveraging over the last couple of quarters very successfully. And you can see that I think the leverage we have, I think, compared with cash, we actually end up with net cash position for the last 2 quarters. 
I think in so far as the cash is concerned, I think we'll continue to deploy the cash to drive the profitable growth of the company. I think that also will include, I think, at time when this is appropriate, I think we will do, I think, the appropriate share buyback if there are some, I think, if we actually see the share price, which obviously is a significant leeway from the value. 
There are -- if you recall, we actually have a medium-term target of driving our net margin to double. I think in the first year, I think we already achieved 0.9 point. And we obviously will continue to use the cash to drive the growth, I think, both organic as well as inorganic as well as more important, I think, is to invest in R&D for innovation so that we will continue to maintain a sustainable growth. Thank you.",206

There has been some recent concerns. This should be a follow-up question. That's on server order cut rumor in market and have Lenovo seen  the order cuts from the Cloud Service Providers. And could you share your view for the server market this year? Those are 2 questions from Grace.",93

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3606.0,2579645.0,97459056.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,15,"Yes. Thank you, Yuanqing. Hopefully, you can all hear me okay. So thanks, Grace, for this great question. I think it helps to clarify our view on this matter. So we are certainly confident in the long-term outlook of our device business is largely positive. Digital life for consumer and digital transformation, hybrid work for commercial will be key drivers for the total available market increase. And as a data point, we also think there is a potential of between 300 million and 400 million aging devices more than 4 years in the commercial space, which are due for replacement. Meanwhile, the A1 with more premium devices, which are being demanded by the customer to improve their digital life experience is also helping for the revenue path. 
Now in consumer, despite some weakness in the low end, particularly Chrome but maybe not only Chrome at this moment. But we believe that the premium and the gaming segment will continue to do reasonably well. 
And for both consumer and commercial, we are also increasing the penetration rate of our services so that it can contribute to better profitability and better customer experience and [ spectrum ]. 
Now in short term, we certainly recognize some of the macro headwind, IC shortages, the manufacturing shutdown in China in the short term, certain demand slowdown and then the geopolitical tension. So all these factors are weighting on the demand in the short term, but that is more on consumer. 
When I look at the commercial demand, as of now, we still see strong demand and with good visibility for the full year. Our order portfolio is growing and we also expect to end the quarter with a significant backlog in commercial. 
So end of the day, we remain positive in the long term, particularly given our focus on innovation, our best-in-class portfolio and then our historical strong execution, we are confident we will continue to grow at premium to market. We are also focusing on adjacencies, accessories, visuals, security, software, several areas with high growth potential and also good or higher-than-average margin. 
So -- and then to conclude here, let me add that already we have expanded beyond [indiscernible] that over 80% of IDG revenue. And particularly, we are very proud of our mobile phone performance as you have seen from the data with 30 points of premium to market and triple-digit growth of the profit since acquisition. So we are very confident about that. And we are also working to expand the revenue on the smart collaboration area, where we recorded triple-digit growth. 
So I think despite maybe some short-term weaknesses of the PC, we are confident we will navigate it very well better than our competitors. Thank you, Grace.",457

I will answer the question on server. As you heard from YY and Wai Ming, the last fiscal year, we hit records in nearly every piece of our business. We do not see a slowdown in our cancellations from our Cloud Service Providers. We believe our ODM+ model with integrated board and system manufacturing is a superior model. 
And we believe that the revenue growth is -- and backlog is at an all-time high. Our orders and new orders are at an all-time high. And we're expanding from supporting 8 of the top 10 global clouds to also now covering -- having sales coverage on 500 of the next wave hyperscalers that we believe will become the next multibillion-dollar companies in the world. 
As you heard YY, Lenovo is unique in that we have Edge to Cloud. So our new ThinkEdge offering is offering ability for retailers and manufacturing and health care and others to deliver an Edge to Cloud infrastructure. So this is also helping pull through demand, our Edge products as well as the cloud. 
Relative to demand, we agree with the industry analysts, there'll be high single-digit growth as a compound annual growth rate and we are confident Lenovo will execute a premium to market for that. And then beyond that, our profitability should improve as I've said in previous calls. We're expanding beyond Intel into AMD and ARM. We're expanding into storage in addition to server. So all of these kind of infrastructure pieces are helping our profitability as well. Thank you.",264

Thank you, Luca. And our next question is coming from Howard Kao from Morgan Stanley. Given the current nickel price drop, a lot of companies are slowing down in their hiring, particularly tech companies. When you talk to your clients in the U.S., do you get a sense that they are still thinking about reducing their CapEx budget? And for your Chinese clients, there is an additional factor, which is the lockdown from COVID. And any colors on how they are thinking regarding to their CapEx budget now versus a few months ago?",96

As I talked to in the past year, so while we continue to focus on efficiency, we also invest more on innovation and R&D. We actually added more head count in the technology side, in R&D side. So we added 5,000 people to focus on the innovation, our new IT structure, client-edge-cloud-network-and-intelligence. 
I think from a long-term point of view, it will pay back to our sustainable growth and the profitability improvements. But definitely so we will adjust our set based on the market situation and our sales performance. So we do see the market situation is challenging so in both China and the rest of world. So we will make the detailed plan based on that. Thank you.",120

Can you hear me? Yes. So I think it's a combination of market expansion and better mix. So if you look at our volumes, we grew around 5%, our revenues grew 27% and our profitability tripled in fiscal Q4. 
When you look by market, we see growth coming from all markets. So Latin America grew by almost 10%, North America by 56%, Europe by 20% and Asia markets by triple digits. 
We are also seeing a much better mix. You see the revenue growing faster than the units. We expect both to continue to grow. Our AURs were higher. Our mix of 5G, higher. In terms of mix, our Moto Edge, the third premium franchise, grew by 600% from a smaller base. Our -- Moto G mid-tier by 50 and our Moto E by 30. So we are seeing growth in the more premium side of the market. And we are also now leveraging the One Lenovo footprint to grow in new segments like commercial. 
So -- and we expect that to continue in Q1 and to the year. We expect to continue to grow in all geographies, premium to market and in all segments of the market.",200

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3606.0,2579645.0,97459065.0,Answer,Kin Hang Wong,,Executives,24,"Yes, Yuanqing. So thank you, Mr. Conor O'Mara, I think this is a good question. So we have seen our customers becoming more increasingly dependent on new IT technology to support their digital transformation and improve their business performance, right? And in our experience, I think the IT services demand are pretty resilient regardless of economic cycle, right? And even I would debate, in a challenging economic cycle, I think the demand for IT services is even higher because this is about how to leverage technology to build a competitive edge, to be more customer-centric. That's why I think our view is still optimistic about the IT services growth. 
Now if you look at our last fiscal year performances for SSG, I think it was a great year. I think Wai Ming and YY shared early on. The SSG revenue on a year-to-year basis, we were able to grow at 30% year-to-year and maintaining a relatively high margin, right? Both the revenue growth and the profitability is above the Lenovo group average, right? 
So with that, I think for the new year, we continue to see good demand in the market. Our customer project is still planning for spending more in terms of IT services, right? So hopefully, we can be able to maintain 20% and above growth of revenue and maintain a relatively high profitability. With that, I think we'll continue to support the Lenovo overall service-led transformation strategy. Thank you.",242

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2022",2022-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3606.0,2579645.0,97459067.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,26,"Sure. So I think from a profitability perspective, as you can see this quarter, the focus on high-margin products even in a supply-constrained environment enabled us to significantly improve profitability and retain profit for the full year and the second quarter in a row. This is really driven by our 3S strategy around attaching storage, storage in floor areas, traditional storage, cloud storage, software-defined storage and hyper-converged storage and in HPC. We're still #1 in supercomputing. So the second is in services, as Ken talked about. And the third is in attaching more and more software, both developed internally at Lenovo as well as our core partners, whether that's VMware, Microsoft, Nutanix, Red Hat and others. 
So the 3S strategy, I think, means that we'll continue year-on-year profitability growth and quarter-on-quarter growth for the future. Relative to revenue, I think we are confident we can have a strong premium to market with a market that is growing, as I said, close to 10% in the foreseeable future. 
And then lastly, we have the ability to balance revenue growth and profit because as we've shown for multiple quarters, our business is unique in that it's almost perfectly split between public cloud and enterprise on-prem. So in a hybrid multi-cloud world, that means we benefit both on the on-prem side as well as the public cloud growth. And I think that's quite unique amongst our competitors. So we don't have an exact percent of the business. You should expect us to grow revenue quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year and do the same with profit and at a premium to market. Thank you.",267

That backlog pushed into Q1, our fiscal Q1, but again, we're seeing record backlog. And we think the scale of Lenovo's growth, now with another $10 billion year-on-year kind of growth, that kind of One Lenovo approach to the market taking advantage of our scale in phone and PC and tablet is helping the data center business. And we think we'll recover faster than the industry on the supply constraints. 
So it did affect us, but we now have record backlog of firm orders and we believe we will recover faster than the market on the scale of Lenovo and our industry-leading supply chain.",154

So general speaking, the Shanghai lockdown impacted more on our PC business on the supply chain. So less on smartphone and ISG business. Our smartphone and ISG demand -- business demand are still very strong. But definitely, they are still constrained by the supply -- component supply of ICs. But we are confident that we will grow in this 2 business. 
SSG actually, as I said, so now, only half of this business is related to the hardware. So another half is Managed Service and Project & Solution Service. So I think it's less impacted by this lockdown.",99

And due to limited time, we are now ready to take the last question. And our last question is from Albert Hung of JPMorgan. How do you keep the ISG profit-making in fiscal quarter 4? The revenue declined by $500 million sequentially, but PTI only declined by $10 million. How do you explain the substantial trends going forward into second half? Should we expect a huge rebound in terms of profits and revenue rebound? That's a question from our last question from JPMorgan.",86

So I think if you look at some of the constraints in the industry, whether, for example, power supplies or things like this, we definitely were able to prioritize our highest-margin products and solutions. So I think that's the main reason. And we are very careful on prioritizing higher-margin solutions in the market. 
So I think that's the core element in addition to adding and attaching more things around the actual hardware. Every quarter now, we're getting, as you saw, records in Software & Services. So we still have an opportunity to increase our attach rate of this type of thing even further. 
And lastly, we did pass through costs to the end user, as many companies have, around some of the premiums that we've seen and those changes that are costs takes sometimes take 1 to 2 quarters to flow through the system because we have deals that may last multiple quarters on a contract. So those contracts are new, we're passing through some of those costs and improving our profit. That should continue as we look forward in the market. 
As I said earlier, in terms of rebounds in profits and revenue rebound, I think we expect our expense-revenue ratio to continue to improve as revenue increases. And again, we'll see better profits quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in addition to premium to market revenue growth. And we have high confidence in that based on the backlog we're seeing out of several quarters. Thank you.",246

So you might be surprised by this achievement, but I'm not. So you should remember, when we bought the IBM PC from IBM, that business lost $200 million, $300 million a year. So -- but now fintech make more than $1 billion profit for us a year. So when we bought the Motorola in 2014, so it lost $1 billion at Google, so in 1 year -- in 2013. But last year, we made $360 million. So we keep replicating this kind of a successful turnaround story. 
So that's Lenovo's stronghold. So we know how to be more efficient, how to make money from this kind of hardware business. So we have this kind of culture and methodology. So I'm pretty sure so for our ISG business, it will quickly becoming our -- not just the growth entity, but also the cash cow. Thank you.",156

Last quarter, despite the increasing challenges such as the ongoing pandemic, pricing inflation, currency volatility, geopolitical tension and the supply shortages, we successfully grow our business and improve the profitability for the ninth consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, our years of persistent investment and efforts paid off as our revenue mix from non-PC businesses reached the highest level of over 37% in our history. 
Two factors were crucial for our strong results last quarter: First, the strategic foresight and the strong execution; second, our operational resilience through our unique global local operating model. 
Today, the digitalization trend continues to accelerate.  The hybrid work model is here to stay, creating strong and sustainable demand for smart devices, IoT, smart infrastructure and the intelligent applications and services. Thanks to our strong execution of digital and intelligent transformation strategy with years of investments in diversified growth engines, our net income grew almost 11% year-on-year and 35% is non-Hong Kong FRS basis, still on track to meet our commitment of doubling profitability in the midterm. 
Revenue grew to USD 17 billion and was up 5% year in constant currency. We saw strong performance in our new growth engines, solutions and services, infrastructure, and mobile businesses also double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. We also made strong progress toward doubling R&D investment commitment by growing R&D spending by 10% and head count by 29% year-on-year. Meanwhile, we further strengthened our One Lenovo platform and realized our ESG goals. 
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Solutions and Services Group. The trillion-dollar IT services market continues to see strong growth. By 2026, 75% of workers will adopt a hybrid working model. Driver demand for premium and customer fulfillment services. Digital workplace expansion has increased demand for other services, for devices, infrastructure and workplace management. Vertical solutions, including smart cities, smart manufacturing, smart education and smart retail, is expected to grow double-digit CAGR through 2025. 
Last quarter, SSG again delivered high growth and high profitability. Revenue grew 23% year-on-year. Operating margin was further improved to almost 23% as well. With double-digit growth in revenue across all segments, revenue from now hardware-tied management service and the project and solution services now accounts for almost half of SSG business. At the same time, SSG continued to invest in software tools, platforms and repeatable vertical solutions. That includes continued expansion of TruScale as a service portfolio to the broader digital workplace. 
We also launched hybrid/multi-cloud solutions and continued to develop our sustainability offerings. With a new strategic partnership with PCCW, we will expand our footprint in Asia Pacific. 
Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG, continues to benefit from strong infrastructure market growth. The server market is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2025. The Edge infrastructure market will exceed USD 41 billion. And the storage will reach USD 36 billion by 2025. Last quarter, ISG revenue exceeded USD 2 billion for the first half, up almost 14% year-on-year, the third consecutive quarter with positive operating profit. 
Cloud Service Provider segment as well as the server and storage revenue all reached the all-time records and outgrow the market. Edge computing revenue almost doubled year-on-year. In high-performance computing, we maintained our leadership in the Top 5 country list by adding more units with our Neptune Liquid Cooling technology. 
We will continue to invest in our comprehensive portfolio and in innovation, particularly in edge and services. We will continue to balance the scale and profitability as we remain focused on being one of the fastest-growing end-to-end infrastructure providers. 
For our Intelligent Devices Group, or IDG, the PC market currently is experiencing a short-term challenge. But as the people recognize the necessity of PC as a key productivity tool, the PC TAM is expected to be much higher than pre-pandemic levels in the long term. Meanwhile, the scenario-based solutions market grow faster. Smart collaboration is one of them and expected to surpass USD 80 billion by 2025. 
Driven by our operational excellence, IDG, overcome challenges while capturing opportunities. We maintained the industry-leading profitability with operating profit of over USD 1 billion. We outgrew the market to strengthen our #1 position in PCs driven by strong growth in Premier segments such as gaming and workstations. At the same time, our smartphone revenue increased by more than 20%. The more impressive part is that such growth not just come from our traditional strength of the market of Latin America and North America, but also expansion markets of Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Our expansion beyond the PCs continues and now nearly 22% of IDG revenue comes from non-PC smart devices, embedded computing, IoT and the scenario-based solutions such as smart home and smart collaboration. We continue to focus on innovation from smarter devices to smarter collaboration and then to smarter spaces. In smart devices, we focus on innovative form factor, extreme performance, adaptive intelligence, security, et cetera. For the digital workspace, we are working on seamless connection and the integration, allowing for the best possible mix of physical and virtual collaboration. 
In summary, although external challenges may persist in the short term, we continue to see long-term opportunities. We see clear trend from smart devices to smart spaces, from computer to computing, from traditional IT to digitalization across all industries and the new IT architecture, and from serving customers to protecting the planet. We will definitely innovate and capture these opportunities. You will see our vision and the progress in these directions at the Tech World, our annual flagship event in October. 
With a solid performance, Lenovo has proven that we have the right strategy, strong execution, the agility and the resilience to transcend the cycle. We are confident in our ability to overcome challenges, continue to transform, diversify our businesses and deliver sustainable growth and profitability improvements. Thank you. 
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",990
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2022",2022-08-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3866.0,2625166.0,98973860.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q1 in the 2023 fiscal year. We faced a variety of macroeconomic challenges in the quarter, including the ongoing COVID-led disruption, foreign exchange rate volatility, geopolitical uncertainties and surging global inflation. Despite this, our reported revenue remained steady year-on-year with a 5% growth in constant currency. Thanks to growth of IT spending arising from digital transformation and our operational excellence in cost control and supply chain management. 
While China saw demand impacted by the lockdown, all other geographical markets had positive growth. Even though our PC business continued to grow at a premium to market, the group's non-PC revenue has shown significant growth and now contributed over 1/3 of our group revenue. 
Our group net income reached a record high for the first fiscal quarter at USD 516 million. Net margin reached 3% up 29 basis points from last year, a record for quarter 1 and the ninth consecutive quarter with year-on-year profit expansion, and we are on track to achieve our medium-term target of doubling our net margin. Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.439. 
To facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Lenovo's current operating performance and comparisons to other peers, we have also reported our adjusted profit repair outside of the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards as an additional financial measure. Excluding fair value gain or losses from the group's strategic investments, amortization charges of intangible assets, resulting from mergers and acquisitions and M&A-related costs, our non-HKFRS operating profit and net income jumped 21% and 35%, respectively. You may refer to the appendix of our presentation for more information on the supplemental non-HKFRS measures. 
In Q1, we maintained a net cash position of USD 394 million after a USD 1.1 billion reduction in net debt in the past year. However, the supply disruption caused by the Shanghai lockdown resulted in sales concentrated towards the last month of the quarter, which have driven a higher quarter end balances in accounts receivable and also impacted inventory. Two-third of our account receivables are less than 30 days. We expect the disruption to be temporary and free cash flow to improve. 
Contemplating further uncertainty in the capital markets, the group successfully completed in July its USD 1.25 billion dual-trance bond offering, which include our inaugural green bond offering. In addition, a USD 2 billion refinancing syndicated loan facility was completed in the same month with improvement in margin compared to our existing facility. The two financing transactions together extended the group's total average debt maturity by 2 years to nearly 5 years. 
SSG is a key beneficiary of the growth in new IT, marking another outstanding quarter for the group. Revenue rose 23% to $1.5 billion, and operating profit reached $329 million with a year-on-year growth of 25%. SSG further improved its operating margin by 36 basis points from the previous year to 22.6%. Deferred revenue, an indicator for recurring business grew 20% year-on-year. The operating margin expansion was a strong driver for the group's continued growth. 
SSG achieved this by enriching its service offerings across all three of its segments for better profitability and scalability. Revenue of the Managed Services segment increased 70% year-on-year. Inflation and delivery uncertainties stemming out from macro conditions are triggering a shift in CIO's preference from ownership to services, driving the popularity of as-a-service. The TruScale as-a-service solution extended from server and storage to high-performance computing. 
Revenue from Support Services and Products & Solutions Services segments rose double digit year-on-year thanks to the enhanced portfolio, utilizing our intellectual property to address the growing IT workload. ISG continued to report strong quarterly performance. Revenue grew 14% year-on-year to above $2 billion for the first time in its history, making the group one of the fastest-growing infrastructure solution providers globally, leveraging its expanding solution portfolio, broaden customer coverage and a unique fully integrated ODM+ business model. ISG successfully improved its operating profit by $22 million year-on-year to $11 million, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with year-on-year profitability improvement. 
Cloud service provider revenue reached an all-time high, supporting by a growing customer base, product portfolio and design wins. We increased capacity in our plants in Mexico and Hungary to capture future growth opportunities. Despite supply challenges, the ESMB segment sales also continue to grow with a focus on improving profitability and an expanded footprint in server, storage, edge computing, services and multi-cloud solutions. 
ISG product sales broke Q1 records in server, storage and AI and edge. IDG revenue declined 3% year-on-year, primarily from the weak consumer PC demand and the COVID-led supply constraint. However, non-PC sales grew 12% year-on-year, thanks to several pockets of growth, accounting for 22% of the business group revenue. Its profitability remained robust at 7.5%, thanks to the enriched product mix. 
In the PC business, the structural shift to the Commercial and Premium segments is supported by the digital transformation cycle and IDG investment in innovation to leverage the hybrid work model and lifestyle change. Commercial sales in China were impacted by the COVID lockdown and the one for the rest of the world continue to grow. Premium segment sales also grew 8% year-on-year, including a 28% growth on workstations and a 14% growth in gaming. 
In the non-PC business, Smartphone revenue grew over 20% year-on-year, supported by a robust growth trajectory across all geographical regions and an accelerated product transition towards 5G. Scenario-based solutions are a new driver for IDG and our smart collaboration solutions maintain hypergrowth rates of key wins in the global markets. 
Now let's talk about Research and Development. It is the main driver for innovative growth pillars to meet customer demand despite various challenges. Although our total expense remained flat year-on-year, as a result of disciplined control, R&D investments still increased 10% year-to-year to drive various growth engines and business transformation to support the group's services, commercial sales, premium mix and ESG initiatives. These strategic priorities sustain the group operating margin at a record high level for Q1 at 4.6% and it will enable us to better navigate through the macroeconomic challenges and demand uncertainties. 
Now let's look at the result of our ESG efforts. Lenovo expanded its use of closed-loop post-consumer recycled content of 103 to 248 products in 2022 fiscal year. Our KPI required 100% of our PC products to contain PCR content materials and 90% of electricity used in our global operations to be renewable by the 2026 fiscal year. 
Last month, the issuance of the group's first green bond and the establishment of its first ever green finance framework like an important milestone in our ESG journey. These initiatives support our vision to achieve net zero by 2050 reaffirming our commitment to a more sustainable future. To further accelerate global ESG progress, in November 2021, the company kicked off the first phase of the Lenovo 360 Circle Partnership, we will promote corporate citizenship and facilitate the group transition to adopting a more sustainable value chain within its business model. While the external business environment continues to be volatile, the strategic opportunities in digital and service-led transformations are substantial and conducive to the growth of our high value-added products and services. 
The group will maintain its agility and resilience in tackling external uncertainties and challenges while implementing a growth strategy. Like every business today, we are actively and prudently managing our cost structure across all elements to ensure Lenovo's long-term growth and sustainability. 
Looking forward, SSG will drive scalable growth with high profitability. Digitalization and post-pandemic changes in the workplace will increase demand for premium, TruScale as-a-service, sustainability and vertical solutions. SSG will continue to broaden service offerings with the goal to sustain its double-digit growth and trajectory while actively seeking business opportunity to broaden and deepen the geographical and vertical coverage of our services, especially for managed services and project and solution services. 
We aim to grow both organically and inorganically through various means including our strategic partnership with PCCW. ISG has built industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expanded from server to full stack offerings that include storage, SDI, software and services. ISG will expand its ESMB portfolio for higher profitability and capitalize on growth opportunities in AI PowerEdge, hybrid cloud, high-performance computing and solutions for the telco communication sectors. 
For the CSP segment, the group has a unique ODM+ business model to address growing customer demand, increasing our customer base and procuring new accounts through design wins. IDG will lead the global race in device innovation by enhancing features that support hybrid working, gaming, entertainment, green materials and ESG design. 
Within the PC business, we will solidify our #1 position with leading profitability. The smartphone business will focus on portfolio expansion and differentiation to take advantage of the accelerated 5G adoption and changing competitive landscape. IDG will accelerate investment to score wins in new growth engines, including fast-growing accessories and scenario-based solutions. Our strong financial position provides a solid foundation for us to proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead. Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability for our shareholders.

Hi, everyone. Good morning, afternoon and evening. So thanks for the question, Howard, and maybe allow me to give you some context before giving a number. So I think the situation can be viewed from two perspectives, reflecting different time horizons. So we feel good about the long term of the PC industry as the digital transformation, hybrid work and also the digital life for consumers in our opinion unstoppable trend. And that we see is right at the center of that. And we also see additional opportunity which include a huge 400 million-plus old PC that has to be replaced and refreshed. And then also many new innovation will drive PC replacement in the midterm. 
We also feel good about the quality of this demand, which has shifted towards higher-end devices, premium devices, better features, higher attach of accessories, new services designed for the new hybrid. But meanwhile, we certainly recognize short-term headwinds, obviously driven by unfavorable macro inflation, exchange rate and consumer confidence. So at this moment, we see consumer weakness not in gaming, where we continue to grow like we did in Q1, 14%, SMB, a little bit of softness, while enterprise and public sector are still showing robust demand. And we have good order and pipeline visibility for the rest of the year. 
And then this includes also premium services, high margin accessory attached. And just as a data point, we grew 28% in workstation in last quarter, achieving almost $1 billion revenue and also our accessories business and visual business is growing at double-digit revenue. 
Now to end up with a number, we also see a softer PC market than we anticipated. And we are looking at a number between $300 million and $310 million, which implies 10% to 12% year-over-year decline. Within this market, we still continue to plan to grow at premium to market like we did in Q1. So even in this condition, we plan to expand our market share and particularly expand our commercial mix. 
As the next year and the year after, we believe the market in the longer term will maintain around $330 million, which is aligned with the IDC and many analysts are search from you at this moment.",372

I think your question about the total inventory exactly comprises of parts as far as finished goods. Our finished goods, I think, mostly PC is over 80% or nearly 90% of those is less than 60 days. So I think the rise, I think you mentioned, I think you asked, is mostly, I think, due to the lockdown and the logistics issue that actually I think seeing the increase. But from our perspective, I think all those inventory are clean and fresh. I think we are very comfortable that I think once the structure, I think, get to go away, I think we cannot see the inventory coming back.",114

Albert's first question is, again on PC market. In the near term, should we expect a weaker than seasonal second half given increasing demand weakness? And he also wanted to know if we will be able to share some comment on channel inventory level and pricing dynamics, specifically in consumer PC. And in the longer term, [indiscernible] the PC market volume should be higher than pre-pandemic level due to higher installed base. But do we expect an air pocket in 2023 before we return to a higher level? 
And second question is on [ RDCG ] ISG revenue, which is record high in our fiscal quarter 1. And there are more and more negative data points in the server space, however, and Intel already slowed down and DRAM vendors also mentioning cloud weakness. Are we seeing similar demand weakness? So those are two questions.",156

Thank you, Yuanqing. So let me start with the first part. On the second item, now we know that the seasonality in the last 2 or 3 years was abnormal, right, due to the heightened demand during the COVID time. So I probably will answer looking at the year-over-year, which we believe that the second half from a year-over-year perspective should be better than the first half. We should remember that Q1 was double-digit down, it was also because of the lockdown in China, while Q2 should be a little bit better than Q1 as year-over-year. And from what we see, we believe that the H2 will be better than H1, still negative, but better than H1.",118

That is what we are seeing now. On the channel inventory, so our business is very diversified. And you probably know that a significant portion of our business is by design without channel inventory. So that includes the relationship, include public sector and include our global account customers. 
Now for the business model that require channel inventory, namely consumer and SMB, the level of the channel inventories generally returned to pre-COVID level in most of the geographies. And the in-transit inventory, which is a bit higher than the pre-COVID, and then is explained by the fact that the logistics time end-to-end is significantly higher than pre-COVID due to the logistic network congestion globally. 
So I think in the short term, the churn inventory is poised to be at pre-COVID levels or slightly above, but we're also seeing that after the holiday season, we'll have a path to return to, let's say, pre-COVID levels or slightly lower. That at least is our plan. I think there was another piece of your ask, do we expect what happened in 2023? I think what we are thinking is now flat or slightly growth but in the range of 1%, 2%, 3%, not the big growth.",213
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2022",2022-08-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3866.0,2625166.0,98973872.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,14,"Yes. Albert, this is Kirk. So from an Infrastructure Solutions Group, relative to demand, I would say, we're in a unique position because we are almost perfectly balanced between public cloud and our on-premise ESMB business, and that's a unique position for us in the industry. If we look at cloud, we're probably less exposed in China than some of our competitors. We see records backlog in cloud. If you look beyond China, the kind of next wave of the next 500 or so hyperscalers, we're seeing well over 100% growth year-on-year. 
And remember, our profitability is growing in that space because we're now building our own motherboards to our ODM+ model that Wai Ming mentioned. We're also expanding from servers into storage, which is higher profit. We're expanding in the next wave accounts, and we're expanding our portfolio from Intel to including more and more AMD and ARM. So all of those are improving our profitability. So I think we still see record demand and growing market share within that demand. 
At ESMB, in April, we created a new ThinkEdge business unit. That business is now growing nearly 100% year-on-year for us with eight consecutive quarters of growth year-on-year. So this edge to cloud phenomenon is also driving a lot of ThinkSystem and ThinkEdge products at the edge in our server business. 
And then lastly, in storage, we're seeing tremendous growth in our storage business. which is now growing 35% year-on-year, which I think from any analyst's momentum, there's multiples of growth above the market. So and that's got a cloud in an on-prem ESMB statement for hyperconverged, traditional storage, software-defined storage and cloud-based storage. So all parts of our business, I think, are strong with record backlog, and we're starting to see supply ease up, which is also going to help our responsiveness to our customers.",308

So definitely. So although we see PC market softness in short term, so we are still optimistic on the longer term. And also Lenovo will continue to drive the premier to the market. And also, we will be more focusing on the premier product. So we are confident we can drive the better average selling price so that our revenue growth will be better than the unit shipment. So that's another additional comment. But beyond the PC, so you see our last quarter's performance. So we believe our three other growth engines will continue to show the strong growth. 
So Kirk just talked about the ISG, so actually, our SSG business, Solution and Service business not only grow strongly, but also with much stronger -- much better profitability. Also, our mobile business grow at more than 20% level. So we think this momentum -- all this momentum can continue. So probably -- so -- Buniac, you can comment on our mobile business. So how we solidify our stronghold in North America and Latin America and expanding to Western Europe and Asia Pacific.",183

So no, I think despite the market was negative 9 points, we grew at 20% in revenue. We have our best Q1 in Latin America ever. But enjoy growth in all regions in the globe. We grew 24% in Europe, 66% in Asia, so we are seeing growth across all the regions. Our AUR is also increasing by $20 year-over-year, showing a better mix. Our AG franchise, the new franchise just launched that's on more on the premium segment is growing from a small base, but growing 700% year-over-year. We expect that trajectory to continue to grow as we have important launches coming between now and September 8. So -- also the Moto G is growing plus 30% year-over-year. So we are seeing growth segments and gross order dues, sustainable growth at ex factory premium to market in the -- over the quarter in the near future.",148

The simple answer is no, we are not seeing that. I think we're gaining share relative to our competitors and the accounts that we are the strongest and seem to be winning in the market. So we're not seeing order cancellations and, in fact, we have record backlog and have confidence several quarters out on a rapidly growing cloud business.",63

So we definitely believe this quarter, probably the second half of the year. So our IT business will continue to grow and very strong growth. And also, so if you read those hyperscale company's performance, you see they're still growing faster. So no matter whether it is Microsoft, Amazon or Google, so their cloud business are still growing strongly.",60

So look, for sure, the gaming segment is a growing one and certainly doing better than the overall consumer segment. Now to make a forecast over the next 12 months for the general market is not easy, but I believe that it will continue to do better than the consumer market. While probably if the entire consumer market is down because of the reasons that we mentioned, the macro, et cetera, et cetera. I think it's reasonable to believe that also the gaming will slow down a little bit, but still remain positive and growing. 
So to give you some data point, we grew, I think I mentioned before, [ 40% ] year-over-year in revenue. And the other thing I'm confident, given our position in the overall gaming sector globally is that we will continue to be able to grow at premium to market no matter what will be the market, so continue to gain share also in the gaming segment, given our portfolio that is really strong, and we have a lot of new products and innovation coming in the gaming in the next 12 months.",188

But since June, so we have seen the positive signal. So definitely not just the consumer segment. Performance is better than we expected, particularly for the June jd.com sales. But also we see the better result in the Commercial segment as well. I still believe second half should be better than the first half in the China market. Luca, you want to?",79

I think I'm aligned with you. We also believe the second half should be better than the first half. The consumer is showing from the June promotion is showing signs of recovery. I think there was also a question on the backlog, I don't know if this was referred to the China business or the overall business. But if it was referred to the overall business, we continue to have significant backlog at the end of every quarter. Now obviously, if you compare it to 1 year ago, the backlog is gradually reducing to more normal levels. But in general, I can tell you that the backlog is still significantly higher than what was the average backlog of quarter end pre-COVID is still the case.",127

I think Lenovo being a global company, I think our business actually spread around the four geographies. I think U.S. account for probably 30% and therefore, while the U.S. -- strong U.S. dollar may be a little bit more challenged. But on the other hand, Lenovo has been less impacted by, I think, company [indiscernible] declined in any one geography because we I think, have a very well balanced global business. So that is also one of the things that while we continue to see that [indiscernible] will be able to maintain the growth and profitability.",108

Your IDG business has been holding up very well. Despite the industry transition is down 15% year-to-year in second quarter, calendar quarter with the third-party data. How did Lenovo's shipments do? And non-PC shipments seem to be -- seem to have helped, does that expected to hold up as well?",61
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2022",2022-08-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3866.0,2625166.0,98973889.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,31,"Yes. So let me start with the end. So we certainly expect to hold it up and do even better. That's our plan. So as you have noted, our calendar Q2, we did well, we grew at premium to market, gaining share. We extended our lead and solidified our #1 position in the PC, and we certainly plan to continue that. 
Now obviously, we are aware of the weather conditions are not full stand. There is maybe a little bit of rain in the short term. And then we are certainly taking proactive actions in several fronts to be able to prudently navigate the situation. We want to continue to deliver industry-leading profitability while gaining share. And at the same time, we will continue to invest in foundational technology, product innovation so that we protect our long-term competitiveness. 
And as you rightfully noticed, our non-PC business continued to grow. Last quarter was at 22%. And obviously, within this 22%, we are happy and proud that our smartphone business, like Sergio was mentioning after many years of work is now in a situation where we are strong in Latin America, strong in North America. And now we have a profitable growth strategy to attack EMEA, Asia Pacific. 
Then we have a strong accessory business growing double digits, strong visual business growing double digit. We are expanding -- extending our service penetration rate in the commercial business. And then our smart collaboration business is also growing very fast. So not only we want to maintain the PC growth, but we also want to accelerate the other growth engines to deliver what we have committed to the market.",275

Now just as Luca said, so in IDG, so we will drive the non-PC business growth, including our mobile business growth. So I'm very confident. So our other two growth engines, ISG and SSG will continue to grow at double-digit -- at least a double-digit level. So that can offset the PC software mix. So but definitely Luca has much more confidence. So we will drive the PC Premier to the market, and we will drive the Premier PC to offset the unit shipment [indiscernible] as well.",88

His first question is on consumer PC demand has shown weakness that companies see any weakness or order pushback from corporate PC market now.

So yes, the consumer PC market has shown weakness, certainly, as we mentioned. While any weakness on corporate PC market or all the pushback, I think we still see a reasonably robust demand, and we have a good pipeline visibility with the corporate and the enterprise customer for the rest of the year that I can say.",66

I think the question was around the regional breakdown of our corporate server market. So the Americas, which would be North America and Latin America is our largest geography and is also our fastest growing geography if you take out the cloud service provider business. We had double-digit growth in North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and our global accounts, which are the largest corporate accounts we covered globally, all had double-digit growth. 
Europe was probably the softest just because of the conflict that we had. But as you saw, we had a record in server, we had record in storage. We had records in Edge. We had records in comm service providers, and we think we're growing at a significant premium to market. ESMB, again, even though some of the analysts have taken the number down is just still at a growth market year-on-year, and we're growing at a premium to that, we believe, as we look forward.",160

Because of time constraint, we will take the last question for this conference call. The last question is coming from [indiscernible]. What is the operating margin outlook for the rest of the year?

So on the PC, I think clearly, as said, right, we will drive -- and this is because this is the segment that gives more opportunity. We will drive more than proportional efforts to grow our commercial business, which comes with better service attach, better accessory attach, et cetera, et cetera. 
So the SMB enterprise public, this will be the segment that offer more opportunity. While we will continue to do our regular consumer business, but this is not probably this year the segment that will offer the best opportunities for growth or margin expansion. 
Talking about margin expansion, probably I should mention that in commercial, we have several drivers that can help to expand the margin, which are namely service penetration rate, visual accessories, more premium devices. We have several new product launches in the course of the year that we believe will help us to raise the AUR and also help us to drive margin expansion. That is for the PC.",191

In the data center space relative to operating margin, I think the way we think about it is improving our margins in the public cloud space. And then separately, can we improve our margins in the ESMB space. I think in both cases, we have confidence we can do that. In the cloud space, our ODM+ model, we're bringing in more of our motherboard design and development in-house. We're expanding into storage at an aggressive rate with new customers and deeper market share in the customers we have, which is higher margin. We're expanding with more AMD and ARM products, which will also expand our margin. So for all those reasons, I think we believe our cloud margins will improve. 
On the ESMB side, again, we're growing storage at 35% overall in terms of our total storage market and our ESMB market is in the mid-double digits as well. So with that and the services and software that get attached to that, I think we're also confident. 
And then lastly, our CPU suppliers are going to be doing announcements throughout our -- the remainder of our fiscal year, and that's an opportunity for us to refresh our pricing with fresh products in the market, and we will have our largest portfolios ever launching time to market with those transitions. So the only issue is what will be the mix of the public cloud business versus ESMB because obviously, there's a blended margin between the two, but that's something we can't necessarily predict right now.",255

I think the growth -- I mean, we cannot define one single item. I think it's -- given the solid execution, we are growing, as we said, in [indiscernible], with record in regions that we are a solid market share like Latin America, but also growing significantly to market in Asia and Europe. And I think also on the segments, if you look on the Edge, that's the new franchisees just launched, we saw 700% growth. We expect that to continue delivering a significant market share gain in that segment. 
Also, we are seeing across our Moto G family, significant gains on net promoter score that's increasing the retention of existing customers and bringing new customers. So I would say our growth is across geography, across product. And even we are seeing now some traction on the B2B commercial side of the market, [indiscernible] Lenovo on a sales footprint. So many areas of growth, very consistent growth much [indiscernible].",175

Indeed, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter that we see a very strong result, double-digit year-to-year growth in terms of revenue and also a relatively high operating margins. As we share with the analysts and media friends today, we continue to see a very strong IT services demand from the market, mainly driven by the digital transformation. And this is what SSG, right? The Solution and Services Group in Lenovo is tasked to drive for the group. 
Now in terms of outlook, we will continue to see the strong demand in specific in two practices. One is the device as-a-service, and also Infrastructure as-a-Service. In Lenovo, we all call it the TruScale as-a-service, right? This is a very strong growth of area, driving from hybrid cloud and also the modern replace solution, right?

Last quarter, as we all know, the global economy, pandemic and the geopolitical tensions continued to create uncertainties. But for Lenovo, our strategic foresight, operational resilience, and consistent investment in diversified growth engines have prepared us well for these challenged times.  
Whether our traditional markets are booming or contracting, Lenovo consistently delivers on its commitments. Last quarter was no different. We delivered a solid performance and successfully improved the profitability as our non-PC businesses made great progress to become new growth engines.  
Today, despite the macro environment changes, the overall trend of digitalization and the hybrid work model continue to accelerate, with global spending on digital transformation expected to sustain strong growth through 2025. 
Last quarter, thanks to the strong execution of our 3S strategy to drive digital and intelligent transformation, we stood up to the challenges and delivered positive net income growth and the net income margin improvement for the 10th consecutive quarter. All our main businesses contributed positive operating profit, and we are making progress towards our commitment to doubling profitability in midterm.  
Our revenue was up almost 3% in constant currency year-on-year. And our new diversified growth engines continued to deliver strong performance. Both Solutions and Services business and the Infrastructure business saw high double-digit growth year-on-year. 
With our healthy cash balance, we remain committed to doubling R&D investments in midterm. Last quarter, our R&D spending grew by 15%, and the head count increased by 26% year-on-year.  
Meanwhile, we accelerated our ESG efforts and drove One Lenovo sales platform to support the future sustainable growth. 
Now I will talk about each of our businesses. Let's start with SSG, Solutions and Services Group. The trillion-dollar IT service market continues to grow steadily, with faster growth to be expected in DaaS as well as Managed Services for data center cloud and edge environment through 2025. Vertical solutions and services spending is expected to remain strong, including in smart education, smart retail, smart city and smart manufacturing.  
Last quarter, SSG's revenue grew by 26% year-on-year with a further improved operating margin. All segments again delivered a high profitability and a strong growth.  
For the first time, revenue from now hardware tied solutions and services account for more than half of our SSG business. 
At the same time, SSG continued to build comprehensive horizontal solutions for vertical industries. For example, our digital store solution embedded with Lenovo AI edge server is now powering one of the world's largest grocery retailers to reduce over 75% self-checkout errors without employee intervention.  
We also further expanded our sustainability offerings. The newly formed Lenovo PCCW Solutions has been running since August of this year, achieving initial success on business synergy. 
Our ISG, Infrastructure Solutions Group, continues to capture significant growth opportunity in the market. By 2025, the server market will reach USD 134 billion; the edge infrastructure, USD 47 billion; the storage, USD 36 billion.  
Last quarter, ISG achieved a record revenue of USD 2.6 billion, up 33% year-on-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, with record high operating profit of USD 36 million.  
Cloud service provider and Enterprise and SMB segments both outgrew overall market forecast. Edge revenue almost quadrupled and storage more than doubled year-on-year, both set new records.  
Meanwhile, we continue to enhance our comprehensive infrastructure portfolio and to invest in innovation, particularly in Edge and Services.
Our operational resilience was further strengthened as we ramped up our new factories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, China and in Hungary, as well as expanded our manufacturing facilities in Mexico. We remain focused on being one of the fastest growing, and ultimately, the largest end-to-end infrastructure solution provider in the world, while maintaining a sustainable, profitable business model. 
For our IDG, Intelligent Device Group, while the market size of PC and the tablets declined in the short term, it is still expected to stably remain at a higher-than-pre-pandemic level in the long term. Meanwhile, as we move from smart devices to smart spaces, the scenario based solution market will continue to grow. 
Driven by our operational excellence and consistent investment in innovations, particularly in the high value-added premier segments, our IDG maintained the industry-leading profitability. Despite the PC market softness, we were able to navigate much better and strengthen our #1 position enlarged the gap with key competitors. We are the clear #1 in 4 geographies out of 5, and an undisputed #1 brand in commercial segment, which represents around 65% of Lenovo PC revenue mix.  
At the same time, our Smartphone business achieved the 10th consecutive quarter of profitability. We remained as a strong #2 and #3 player in Latin America and North America, respectively, and achieved hyper growth in the expansion markets. We launched a series of innovative products and enriched our product portfolio. 
Our scenario-based solutions continued to demonstrate growth potential. Smart collaboration continued to grow at a high double-digit year-on-year, and the revenue from gaming scenario business set a new record.  
Lenovo workstation solutions with artificial intelligence, data science and immersive computing are enabling our customers in automobile, energy and internet industries to improve their computer-aided design processes. 
We continue to focus on innovation to drive the extension from smart devices to smart spaces. We are confident that our success in PC can be replicated to grow our business beyond the PC markets and a further win in more markets, particularly in smartphone.  
Looking ahead, the current external challenges will likely persist for a while. We must remain agile and stay focused on both pursuing our strategy and ensuring ongoing profitability. We will rebalance the resources towards our diversified growth engines, while driving for efficiency and expense reduction throughout the company, especially in areas where we see a softer market outlook. 
And we will never lose sight of the long-term opportunities in this year's Lenovo Tech World. We draw strong interest from the industry and the public, showcasing our progress in innovation and vision in digital and intelligent transformation.  
Lenovo has built capabilities in horizontal solutions across the new IT architecture of client, edge, cloud, network, intelligence to be embedded into vertical solutions. Each of these building blocks, such as IoT, metaverse, edge, hybrid cloud and AI can help us not only address customer needs, but also create scalable, repeatable, sustainable and profitable solutions that will spark new waves of growth beyond our traditional device business. 
Our solid performance last quarter and throughout the past 3 years has proven that we have the right strategy, strong execution, resilient operation to fulfill our commitment and transcend the cycle. 
We are confident that our high-quality and innovative portfolio, unique hybrid manufacturing model-driven strong supply chain, and the global local principle and the capability as well as healthy liquidity will help us capture the opportunities, deliver a sustainable growth and improve profitability. Thank you.  
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1153
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576290.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for Q2 in the 2023 fiscal year. Next chart, please.  
The current economic outlook is deteriorating at unexpectedly fast pace. Despite this, in Q2, we achieved an annual net income growth of 6% to $541 million and net margin growth of 0.3 percentage point year-on-year, marking a step forward our medium-term target of doubling the net margin from fiscal year 2021. Group revenue declined 4% year-on-year in nominal terms, but was up 3% on constant currency.  
Our financial results are a testament to our strength in the non-PC business, which now represents 37% of group sales. ISG and SSG both delivered record-breaking revenue and profits. The weakness in the PC market was widespread, but we continue to outperform. 
Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0454. Today, the Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.08, maintaining last fiscal year level. 
Next chart, please. We continue to make progress in improving our working capital management and cash flow generation remains strong. Our cash and cash equivalent balance reached $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter. And we increased our net cash by $1.1 billion year-on-year to a balance of $1.1 billion in Q2.  
To optimize our working capital, we further shortened the cash conversion cycle by 13 days year-on-year and 16 days quarter-on-quarter. Both days of inventory and payables were contributors to the improvement. Our inventory decreased 4% year-on-year.  
Operating cash flow improved by $523 million year-on-year to a record high level of over $2 billion. Free cash flow also improved by $419 million from last year.  
The group's green bond, which was issued in July, officially made its way into Bloomberg's MSCI Green Bond Index, a key global benchmark for ESG fixed income funds. 
Next chart, please. The financial result of SSG echoes the success of our transformation journey. Its Q2 revenue grew at a healthy rate of 26% year-on-year to $1.7 billion. Operating profit increased 29% to $368 million. SSG continued to build a franchise to increase deferred revenue with a balance of $2.9 billion. 
Within our 3 services segments, revenue of Managed Services increased 69% year-on-year, owing to large contract wins in an asset service, which delivered the fifth consecutive record-breaking quarter in terms of signings.  
Project & Solution Services won signature deals in smart manufacturing and smart education, supported by Lenovo's IPs. For example, we won 2 new VR classroom logos in Q2, leveraging Lenovo ThinkReality platform and VR solution to provide classroom users with a fully immersive education experience. 
Support Services revenue rose 16% year-on-year. Its penetration rate rose to a record high, partly due to the highest level of premium booking, of which penetration weight was above average.  
During the quarter, the combined revenue from Managed Services and Project & Solutions Services went beyond 50% for the first time, reaching 52%, 4 points more than last year. 
Next chart, please. Q2 marked an exceptional quarter for ISG as revenue and operating profit both reached a record high. Sales grew 33% year-on-year to $2.6 billion, outperforming the market and delivering record sales levels across Asia Pacific, EMEA and the Americas. Our Mexico plant has been operating at full capacity while our Hungary plant is expanding to meet the growing demand from contract wins. Q2 operating profit increased by $42 million to $36 million. Cloud service provider revenue reached an all-time high, supported by the segment strategy of growing its client base, product portfolio and designing projects. 
The enterprise and small medium business segment revenue reached a record high for Q2 as enterprise customers continue to pursue digital transformation.  
By product, edge, server and storage all set new sales records. ISG launches largest portfolio ever consisting over 50 new products, Solutions and Services to support its future growth and profitability trajectory. 
Next chart, please. Our IDG business was hit by the far-reaching demand headwinds in the sector. Although revenue declined by 11% to $14 billion, the gross operational resilience enables its operating profit margin to stabilize at 7.4%, a sector high level for profitability. IDG is the undisputed #1 in the commercial PC segment as our ThinkPad X1 sales grew by 19% year-on-year.  
The business group premium mix remained healthy, with sales rising 4% and gaming sales up by 34%. IDG also widened its market share gaps against player #2 and #3 in the sector. 
Non-PC products continue to contribute to IDG's revenue, accounting for nearly 18% in Q2. The smartphone business remained profitable for 10 consecutive quarters despite the challenging market. We defend our #2 and #3 market position in Latin America and North America, respectively, while achieving hypergrowth in the expansion markets. Smart collaboration revenue maintained its double-digit growth year, supported by the popularity of scenario-based solutions.  
Next chart, please. Now let's talk about research and development. Despite the total operating expense decreased by 7%, we increased R&D spending by 15% to fuel various growth engines, business transformation and ESG initiatives. Excluding R&D spend, other operating expenses went down 40% due to efficient cost control measures, highlighting the group's commitment in innovation investment even in challenging market conditions.  
The group's innovative efforts along with the disciplined cost control contributed to a record operating margin level of 5%, while operating profit also increased 4% year-on-year to $851 million.  
Next chart, please. We are accelerating our ESG investment. We just published our 16th annual ESG report for the 2021-'22 fiscal year on our Investor Relations website. We welcome you to have a read through it. We are currently awaiting validation from the Science-Based Targets initiative for our next zero by 2050 target. In the meantime, we continue to strive for progress on our near-term emissions reductions targets for the 2029-'30 fiscal year, which have already been validated by SBTi.  
In 2021, Lenovo began utilizing recycled metals for both the commercial and consumer product lines. We are also utilizing plastic-free packaging by combining bamboo fiber technology with other innovative materials for our most popular ThinkPad X1 and Z series. The group continues to evaluate the application of plastic repackaging to additional product lines.  
We are also committed to making the community a better place through both monetary donations and employee volunteer services. Lenovo was included in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index with a AA+ rating for the second year in a row. We also had the best score in the IT industry. 
Our ESG performance was evaluated on 7 areas from Corporate Governance to human rights and consumer issues against over 575 Hong Kong listed companies. We received our highest scores in the labor purchases and community involvement categories.  
Next chart, please. While the external business environment continues to be volatile, the strategic opportunities in digital and service-led transformations will support long-term growth for Lenovo end-to-end user-friendly product and services solution and dependable devices.  
These external catalysts, coupled with the group investment in innovation and its global footprint are key to mitigating external challenges and achieving the medium-term goal of doubling its net margin. We are building plans to have a meaningful reduction in expense to achieve an expense-to-revenue ratio consistent with the pre-COVID levels to maximize profitability, even as some of our traditional markets contract. We will continue to rebalance investment and build momentum in businesses where we see substantial opportunity for aggressive profitable premium to market growth.  
Looking forward, SSG will continue to serve as the new growth engine. Cost of capital is going up and global interest rate hikes, leading to more cautious spending by enterprise customers and cash outlay by switching technology assets. This trend is supercharge demand for support services to ensure the usefulness of assets during their extended life. Our managed service is well positioned to capture true scale as a service and sustainability demand as enterprise users will also have greater incentives to explore asset recovery services to monetize and recoup the value of their end-of-life assets. 
The constrained head count situation in most enterprise IT departments will translate into additional demand for outsourced services, presenting an opportunity for this segment to provide professional consulting and deployment, further accelerating service-led transformation. 
ISG has built industry-leading end-to-end infrastructure solutions and expanded from server to full stack offerings that include storage, SDI, software and services, all with higher profitability.  
ISG will expand its ESMB portfolio for higher profitability and capitalize on growth opportunity in an AI-powered edge, hybrid cloud, high-performance computing, and solutions for the telco communication sectors.  
For the CSP segment, the group has a unique ODM+ business model to address growing customer demand, diversifying our customer base and procuring new accounts through design wins. 
IDG will lead the global race in device innovation by enhancing features that support hybrid working, gaming, entertainment, green materials, and ESG designs. Meanwhile, the total available market of the global PC sector should remain at a level structurally higher than the pre-pandemic period, thanks to the hybrid work model. The commercial upgrade cycle and the trend of premiumization will help IDG drive premium to market growth. The smartphone business will focus on portfolio expansion and differentiation to take advantage of the accelerated 5G adoption. 
IDG will further invest to score wins in non-PC areas, including fast-growing accessories and work collaboration solutions, which have become increasingly important for growth. Our strong financial position provides a solid foundation for us to proactively pursue growth opportunities ahead.  
Finally, as always, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and profitability for our shareholders.

First question, can the management share the production site of servers? And will the company consider to further diversify server production sites? 
Question #2, can the management update the status of Lenovo's channel inventory and also the channel inventory of the PC industry? When does the company expect the channel inventory in PC market can return to normal?",66
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576294.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,6,"This is Kirk. I can take the first question. Thank you for the question on server production sites. As you know, Lenovo is now operating over 32 different global factories with over 20 million square feet of manufacturing. For server, we've always had a global footprint and have been expanding that. So we have multiple sites in China. We have motherboard and system production in Mexico across our Guadalajara and Monterrey sites, where we've been doubling that production over the last year, supporting both our enterprise, small business and cloud customers. We've recently opened a new factory in Budapest, Hungary, for made in the EU capability and are at an all-time high, again, for enterprise and our CSP customers. And we also obviously manufacture in certain countries like Brazil for the unique needs of those markets. 
Relative to the server and storage channel inventory, we're essentially back to normal levels. So I think we're seeing strong demand out of that business, as you can see it from our business results, and expect the premium to market and improving demand even as we go into this quarter. But no issues on inventory, they're high or low for server. Luca, would you like to talk about PC?",205

Thank you, Kirk, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. So for PC, let me start. Obviously, I will focus on Lenovo. So in the first place, as I commented already some calls ago, our business is quite diversified, and a significant portion of our business is without channel inventory by design. That includes our relationship, our public sector and certain global account business. So here, there is simply no any channel inventory. 
Then for those business models that require channel inventory, which are the transactional consumer and SMB, channel inventories are above the pre-COVID inventory level in some of the regions, not all. And the other element is that in-transit inventory is still a little bit higher than pre-COVID and that is a function of the transit times that are increased due to the congestion of the global logistics network. 
Having said that, we feel generally quite comfortable with our inventory position in all channels and all geographies. We are increasing sellout. The demand for Lenovo product is at record high levels, as demonstrated by the activation share that we track weekly, and we have a precise plan and expecting a reduction of the channel's inventory level. After the holiday cycle, we believe that we will return at or even below pre-COVID level within the end of our fiscal year, so within the March quarter. Thank you.",229

And the next question is coming from JPMorgan's Albert Hung. Question 1. How do we reconcile with averaging data points between weak guidance of server, CPU, DRAM and strong Lenovo ISG performance. And the data center market share gain fully reflect in the numbers. And number two, does Lenovo see any slowdown in enterprise service? And that's number three, for SSG, any speed bump in the near term due to enterprise budget cuts? Kirk, here you go.",80

This is Kirk. I'll answer that question. So I think from a server and storage perspective, we do believe we're executing in a premium to market and are becoming a larger portion of our suppliers' customer base. 
I would say we have a unique business model because we've talked to you about this ODM+ model where we're building our own motherboards, designing our own systems, and putting them into racks around the world. So consistently, we've had a good mix between our public cloud; both the Tier 1 public cloud, where we've supported 8 of the top 10; the next wave hyperscalers, which are doing extremely well for us after we set up a new division to support that. And what we see is continued strong demand for enterprise SMB, not just in clearing our backlog, but also in fresh load. 
I would say that we continue to see even stronger demand in the quarter that we're in right now. So this isn't a slowdown that we think, and our field is consistently now placing demand into our customer tracking tools, multiple quarters out. So we have some more confidence to talk about the future. So I think we do have momentum in the market, not just in server, but also in storage. This quarter, while the storage market might be single-digit growth, we had well over 100% year-on-year growth.
So as supply continues to free up, and we think we're executing better than market on supply, and recovery getting indirect to direct channel inventory back out, and so we are seeing strong growth there. 
And then as you know, edge is continuing to grow very rapidly for us with our new ThinkEdge product line. We saw almost 300% growth in our edge business there as well. So I would say we're seeing good demand and strengthening demand even into the quarter for the customers that we service around the world. So no slowdown that we see, although we've been certainly watching the macro trends as well. That's all from me.",347

Good morning, good evening. Thank you, Albert. This is Ken Wong speaking for SSG. Now when we look at the IT services market, right, based on the aggregated data point that we have got from various research analysts. The overall IT services market is growing at about 5% on a year-to-year basis. 
Now that said, I think, when we look at some of the subsegments, especially for the as-a-service settlement, it's still growing at high double-digit, right? For example, device-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service. This is where our TruScale offerings [indiscernible]. 
Indeed, if you look at our Q2 performance, we were able to grow for the sixth consecutive quarter at a very high growth rate, right? In Q2, we were able to grow at 67% on a year-to-year basis. And also, we were able to add about 100 new logos, right, to our TruScale offering, right? So I think we'll continue to enjoy the growth momentum from the as-a-service market. 
Now when we look back around the hardware services business, yes, I think inevitably, we see some slowdown in the hardware growth, especially around PC, but our execution really upgraded to improve the penetration rate around our hardware business, so overall, if you look at SSG overall in Q2, we were still able to grow at a very high growth rate of 26% on a year-to-year basis. And based on the pipeline that we are looking at and the backlog that we are building up, we're confident that we'll be able to maintain that level of growth for the coming quarters. Thank you.",262

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576301.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,13,"Yes. Jenny, I'll take it. So thank you, Howard, for this question. And maybe let me expand on your question to give a little bit more color, and I think I want to call your attention on some of the particular dynamics of the demand that we are seeing. So first of all, we confirm we feel positive about the long-term trajectory of PC and smart devices. Digital transformation, digital life, these are all secular trends, and we believe we see this certainly at the center of that. 
And additionally, opportunity like 400-million-plus old PC devices to be upgraded or refreshed still will give a lot of opportunity for the mid and longer term. 
Meanwhile, we also confirmed the shift towards more premium devices with a higher commercial mix, better features, better attach rate, and better service rate is happening. This is driving higher AUR and obviously helping the margin a little bit. 
Now to go directly to your question, for this year, we are seeing a range of around 290 million units for the PC market. And for next year, we are modeling flat to plus or minus 4% in terms of the total available market.
But on the positive side, I want to note and to signal that we are getting much more encouraging data from the real end-user demand that we track by the real activation of devices. And there we are seeing only a mid-single-digit negative number in terms of the decline with stable or even improving trends. And meanwhile, we are recording very high activation share for Lenovo. So as this is demonstrating, we are gaining share in the real end user. 
So that means the real demand is healthier than the shipment decline. And I think this is partially a function of the inventory correction that is undergoing in the overall industry. I will not talk about inventory again, but I think this is something we should consider in making the analysis. So the real demand is better than the shipments. Thank you.",339

So I think, to analysts, this is very important information for you from our data. So although selling numbers have high double-digit decline, but actually sell out or activation data is not as bad as that. So actually, we only see a single-digit decline in the activation of sales better. So that means channel is digesting the inventory. So once that thing is processed, so definitely they will restart to give the order to us. So that's the current situation part. So probably, you should realize that. 
So that being said, in the past, probably sellout is less than selling, but not selling is less sales. So now later it will be back to the normal to balance the situation.",121

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576304.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,16,"Yes. I think the question was on giving some color on the strength of the ISG business. I would say very simply, it's very broad-based. We had records in cloud, all-time records, as well as a Q2 record in enterprise and small and medium business. It was broad based from a geography perspective with all-time records in Europe, Asia Pacific and Americas. And again, we're broadening our portfolio beyond just servers into storage where we saw over 100% growth year-on-year. And if you even drill into storage, it was records in traditional NAS and SAN markets in hyperconverged and in cloud-based storage. 
And then as I said in Edge, we had almost a 4x growth in that business, and we recently highlighted customers like Kroger, who are rolling our solutions across about 3,000 self-checkout stores. We worked with the city of Barcelona to put up to 3,000 street cabinets in for smarter cities. So these are just some of the recent public cases we did. 
I would say we have confidence looking into the next quarter for a few reasons. As you know, Intel, AMD, and even Ampere are launching new products, and we recently celebrated our 30th anniversary of Think system. And being in the x86 server business, we launched a product portfolio that was 3.5x larger than anything we've done before with over 51 products, 21 of those which are AMD, so we're seeing a diversification of our CPU portfolio as well, which is allowing us to cover many, many parts of the market. 
And then lastly, we have a unique business model with our ODM+, so that's not just about improving our cloud business by being able to deliver custom products to the largest cloud vendors in the world, but we're also getting economies of scale back to our enterprise and small and medium business boards as well, because we can have common components and common sourcing between our cloud business and our enterprise SMB business. 
So I think we have good visibility for the foreseeable future with improving supply chains and strong customer demand. And I'm confident that this next quarter will be even more of a positive in what we're talking about right now. Thank you.",371

So I want to add a little bit more color here. So actually, over the past couple of years, we are bringing back design and manufacture to in-house. So not just for the system, but also for the motherboard, so that's what Kirk said, ODM+ model. So we think that will give us a very unique advantage, because many of our competitors are just using the ODM model or outsourcing the manufacturing or even design to the third party. So that will give us cost competitiveness. 
The second one is also Lenovo unique. So we are addressing both enterprise SMB customers and cloud service providers. So definitely, cloud service provider, so it's more demanding. It's not easy to make a lot of money from that kind of customers, but that will give us scale. That scale will help us to drive the competitiveness even in the enterprise and SME side. So that's very unique for Lenovo. 
So for our competitors, actually, we could group them into 2 categories. The first is just focusing on ESMB, like Dell. Another growth area is ODM. So they are just addressing cloud service providers. But because of our personal advantage, we have in-house design and manufacturing, so that we can address both. So we don't want to compete with our ODMs. We don't want to share the profit with that. So that's why we think we will be more competitive than our competition. 
And also, we are very familiar with this kind of a model, even in the PC. So when we bought IBM PC. So actually, that business can only address commercial side. They didn't have the consumer business, but we added the consumer business to our PC portfolio. So even today, the consumer business makes less money, but it helped us to become the #1 in total PC and also it helped us to make more profit in commercial side. So I think we can replicate our success in PC to our ISG business. Thank you.",335

The next question is coming from Eastspring's Desmond Lim. So there are two sets of questions. First one is what's our service operating margin, and the percentage contribution to the group profit. And second question is on cash. Given strong cash balance and still positive cash flow generation, what is the company intending to do with the cash. While Lenovo holds a higher cash buffer, given economic uncertainty, reinvest in building the server revenue or maybe reduce some of the debt to lower the impact of higher interest rates? Those are the 2 questions from Desmond.",99

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576308.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,20,"Sure. So I think if you saw the operating profit, while we're thinking that we're executing at a significant premium to market, we're also significantly improving the operating profit year-on-year. So we were up $44 million. And I think this will increase over time for several of the reasons we talked about earlier. The first is the ODM+ model that Wong Wai just talked about. So building our own boards in-house, getting paid for the design, we get paid for the manufacturing, we get paid if someone wants to second source that board, we get paid for the system integration, and we get paid for the RAC integration. So each of those is a unique opportunity. That's number one. 
Number two, we're diversifying our CPU portfolio to include AMD and ARM, which is making us more profitable. 
Number three, we're adding what we call the 3S, Software, Solutions, and Services. So our bookings for TruScale as a Service or Infrastructure as a Service is up almost 4 digits, meaning almost up to close to 1,000% growth off a small base, but that just shows you that the as-a-service model is working. And we recently closed one of the largest insurance companies in Europe, one of the largest banks in the Southeast Asia country, et cetera. So definitely, TruScale is growing not just for Device-as-a-Service, but also infrastructure-as-a-service for us. 
And then as we do more edge, again, there's more service opportunities around that to provide Software Services and Solutions. So I think our goal is to continue to grow profit while we grow at a premium to market in the future. 
And I think if you look at what IDC and others are predicting, for this year, it's still a double-digit growth in the server market for this year.",299

So okay, I think the cash is definitely, I think, for us to build the cash, I think, to support the growth of the business. Let me be a little bit more specific. We actually -- knowing the market is actually going to be tight in terms of liquidity as well as interest rates higher, we actually did, I think, some bonds offering in the beginning of the year, I think, contemplating the interest rate going up. In fact, over the next 15 months, we probably have about 800 or thereabout total bonds for us to get mature, and then we actually get the cash well in our bank account for repayment. 
And secondly, we are also, I think, continue looking for opportunity to move our debt from a shorter tenure to a longer tenure, like the latest one we had, I think it's really doing 5 years and 10 years, as well as 7 years. I think one of the latest ones we captured the market opportunity to do refinancing is the convertible bond, where we actually do it, I think, at the time, I think, with over 40% premium with a conversion price of nearly $10.
So in short, I think we are, I think, getting, I think, ready just in case that the market gets up, I think it's going to support the growth of our business. Thank you.",233

And the next option is coming from Merrill Lynch, Catherine. Do you expect any ASP pressure on PC as peers are all making efforts to digest inventory? And what's the potential impact on IDG's operating margin?",40
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576312.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,24,"Jenny, probably I'll take this one. So look, for sure, we are seeing an intensified competition in the market. which I think is normal in a market that has some channel inventory digestion and the macro outlook is not necessarily pushing strong demand. And additionally, you have the other element, which is the strength of the U.S. dollar that in general is not playing in favor in most of the geography. That is causing probably pressure on GP rather than on average selling price, because average selling price is probably, with a good trajectory, giving a better premium mix, better commercial mix, et cetera, et cetera. 
Having said that, we continue to work towards balancing growth and profitability. We are focusing on more premium mix with a certain success. We are increasing our premium devices mix significantly year-over-year, more commercial mix, better attach rate of accessories, better penetration rates of services, and a number of other actions to mitigate the GP pressure. By doing this, we are confident that we will be able to mitigate a large pile of that additional pressure. And we are working maybe in new areas in IDG, for example, smart collaboration, AR/VR, so in new revenue streams that can help us to further mitigate the situation with additional revenue and the retail GP.
And maybe you didn't ask. But last but not least, we are obviously being very disciplined with expenses, so where we have maybe a little bit of shortfall in the GP, we will make sure we maintain a very disciplined E to R back to pre-COVID, so that we maintain our commitment to industry-leading profitability.

Thank you. And the last question is coming down Jefferies, Conor O'Mara. On the last call, Conor said that, Luca has commented, we could expect PC market to be flat last year. And the Intel and the report from TrendForce yesterday all guided down roughly 5% to 10%. Do you maintain your flat market view? And what growth rate should we expect from Lenovo next year?",68
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2022",2022-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3454.0,2673067.0,100576314.0,Answer,Luca Rossi,,Executives,26,"Yes. So I think, as I mentioned, probably in the previous answer, right now, we are modeling next year to be flat to minus 4% to plus 4%. So in a plus/minus 4%, so you can say, similar or a little bit worse than our previous guidance that you are correct on the last call, we were talking about flat. 
But I think still there are a lot of uncertainties. And the biggest one is the fact that we are seeing, as we mentioned before, activation being significantly better than shipments. So we are not that pessimistic, and we might see a much more stable market once the channel inventory digestion for the total industry is done. 
The other comment is that, obviously, it's not only about units, but it's also about revenue, which is coming much better due to the premium and commercial mix. 
What growth should we expect from Lenovo next year? We are not guiding now an absolute number, but we confirm we will continue to grow at premium to market with the objective to expand and extend our leadership. Thank you.",185
