Last quarter, following our 3-wave strategy, our execution made solid progress. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, I mentioned that Lenovo has entered a new phase of growth. And the last quarter's result confirmed that we have delivered not only our commitment but also our best results in this fiscal year.
Our revenue was almost USD 13 billion, the highest in 3 years. Our pretax income was USD 150 million, up almost 50% year-on-year. It's also the first year-on-year growth in 5 quarters.
Our first wave, PC business, continued to deliver a strong premium to market revenue growth while maintaining industry-leading profitability. We saw strong year-on-year revenue growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa. All geographies were profitable for the second straight quarter. We will continue to drive revenue growth while maintaining our leadership in profitability through continued investment in innovation and high-growth segments.
Our second wave, data center and mobile business, also showed more improvements. In data center, the transformation is making progress faster than expected. Data center revenue reached the highest level in 2 years while further improving profitability. Not only did we achieve strong revenue growth year-on-year in the largest data center markets, North America and Europe, for the third straight quarter, we also realized double-digit growth in China and in Asia Pacific. We also saw triple-digit revenue growth in software-defined infrastructure and hyperscale segments.
These are the fruits of our foundation building in the past years. Taking hyperscale, for example, we have improved our competitiveness by strengthening our in-house design and manufacturing capability and by providing customized solutions to our customers. As a result, we have won 6 out of the top 10 hyperscale customers in the world. We will continue to build solid foundation and invest in product and technology in hyperscale, software-defined data center and networking. We remain confident in our long-term plan to return to profitable growth in our Data Center business.
In Mobile business, we continue to see strong performance in our stronghold, Latin America, with nearly 40% revenue growth year-on-year while maintaining good profitability. In mature markets, our volume in North America outgrew the market by 90 points year-on-year, although we still need to sharpen our competitiveness in the high-end segment.
In emerging markets, we are fine-tuning our brand and product strategy to fit the local markets. We will continue to pursue our strategy for Mobile business, strengthening our leading position and profitability in Latin America; aggressively driving breakthrough in mature markets, including North America and Western Europe; and in the short term, maintaining healthy growth with controlled investments in emerging markets. We remain committed to making this business profitable.
In the third wave, we also made visible progress executing our Device + Cloud strategy. Our non-device revenue, driven by software and services, continued to grow, reaching more than USD 400 million last quarter. In the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, we won a record 80 awards and, more importantly, 2/3 of the awards were from our non-PC smart devices. The best examples include Smart Display, our voice-controlled smart assistant with display; Mirage Solo, our cable-free VR headset capable of reading your body movements; and Mirage Camera, a 3D VR camera that can film and livestream 3D VR content. While we will launch these award-winning star products very soon, our Star Wars AR headset launched during the holiday season was the clear #1 in the consumer AR market for the season. We will continue to develop AR/VR devices for both consumer and the commercial applications and build these devices into platforms so that various content providers can deliver their own content applications and services.
We also continue to strengthen our capability in artificial intelligence around the 3 key elements: data, computing power and algorithms. Our smart devices will leverage big data insights to provide more thoughtful services to our customers. Our supercomputing, cloud computing and edge computing capability will make computing faster and accessible from everywhere. And we will leverage our big data platform to drive industrial intelligence as well. Definitely, we continued to make progress in transforming our company last quarter. While we still have much work to do, I remain confident that we will reach a new stage of strong, sustainable growth.
Now let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",742
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2513.0,1378367.0,55084768.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. Now I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q3 fiscal year 2018. Next chart, please.
Firstly, let me share with you financial highlights for the quarter 3 performance. Our transformation is on track to deliver solid revenue growth, and pretax profit improved both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Led by strong revenue performance from both PCSD and Data Center businesses, our revenue of $12.9 billion reached the highest level in 3 years, representing an increase of 6% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter. Gross profit increased by 10% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter, while gross profit margin increased year-on-year to 13.5%. This result was driven by better product mix from both PCSD and Data Center businesses, offset the impact of component cost increases.
Operating expense increased by 6% to $1.5 billion, E/R ratio stayed constant year-on-year at 12% and improved quarter-on-quarter from tighter cost control. Group PTI was $150 million, up 48% year-on-year. Operational profit before taxation was $212 million, excluding the Wuhan property disposal gain of $61 million, severance expense of $61 million and noncash M&A accounting charges of $62 million. This is the third consecutive quarter that we have had around $100 million quarter-on-quarter operational profit improvement. The improvement was mainly driven by the solid performance from PCSD, while the losses in both our DCG and MBG businesses continued to narrow.
On December 22, the new U.S. tax legislation was enacted, effectively reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% starting from 1st January 2018. As a result, the group recorded a one-time non-cash write-off charge of $400 million in Q3 on our deferred income tax assets, resulting in a loss after tax of $289 million against $98 million net profit a year ago. The write-off does not have any impact on our operations, and we believe a lower tax U.S. corporate tax rate will benefit our operations in the U.S. over time. Next chart, please.
Cash flow from operations remains solid at $211 million in Q3, slightly lower than $364 million in Q2, mainly due to the buy-ahead actions in key components during the quarter. We have net debt at the end of Q3 of $927 million against $155 million net cash in the previous year. The lower cash level compared to a year ago was mainly due to the repayment of $1.5 billion of Google promissory note in July in this fiscal year. However, cash level improved quarter-on-quarter on operational improvements as well as an issue of equity of $500 million during the quarter.
We continue to see improvement in our cash conversion cycle. In Q3, it was negative 16 days, an improvement of 3 days year-on-year. Next chart, please.
Global PC market continued to show signs of stabilization despite the continued component cost hike in Q3. Our PC business continue to do well and achieved a premium to market revenue growth. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth. We recorded double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. Our PC business in China also regained momentum. We also continue to see good growth in workstation and gaming PC in Q3. Revenue in Q3 was up 8% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $9.3 billion, helped by PC ASP increase, thanks to more innovative products and better product mix, while our smart devices also started contributing revenue.
Pretax income was $416 million, up 13% quarter-on-quarter. PTI margin improved 0.1 percentage point to 4.5% level despite the component cost hike. Next chart, please.
Our transformation in the Data Center business is well on track. Revenue reached highest level in 2 years and profitability improved. All geo saw strong double-digit revenue growth as well as profitability improvement. Our transformation actions in China also started showing results in Q3 with both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year margin improvement.
On the product segments performance, we continue to closing the gap with #1 player on the worldwide top 500 high-performance computing vendor list. We also achieved strong revenue growth and margin improvement in our hyperscale business, thanks to the operational improvement Yuanqing mentioned. Meanwhile, our software-defined solutions continue to grow rapidly with our industry partners. 
 Revenue from Data Center business, up 17% year-on-year and 26% quarter-on-quarter to $1.2 billion. Our operational PTI margin improved significantly, and operational loss before tax was narrowed to $56 million in the quarter. Next chart please.
For Mobile business, we continue our strong momentum in our core geography, Latin America in Q3 with double-digit revenue growth and maintained strong profitability. In North America and Western Europe, we continue to strengthen our presence with mainstream models and carrier expansion while continuing to work on the product competitiveness of our high-end models. And in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we continue to face challenges on intense competition. And our brand transition in emerging regions of EMEA was slower than expected. 
 Revenue declined 5% year-on-year but was flat quarter-on-quarter at $2.1 billion, thanks to the increased average selling price despite the slower shipment performance. While operational loss narrowed year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter despite component cost increase, while operational PTI margin improved 0.7 percentage point year-on-year and 2 percentage point quarter-on-quarter, thanks to the margin improvement in both North America and Latin America.
 
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive better performance under our 3-wave strategy that was already started showing results. Although sudden component cost hike may continue to bring challenges to our operations in the short term, especially in Q4, which is typically the slowest quarter in the year. However, operational profit will continue to improve year-on-year on better fundamentals. We will continue to drive premium to market revenue growth and maintain our industry-leading profitability for our PC business. We'll continue to improve user experience with our innovative products and channel reform to drive future growth.
 Our smart devices are now in the go-to-market phase, and starting to contribute to our revenue. To continue the success of our Star Wars AR handset, we will be launching those CES award-winning smart devices soon.
 For Data Center business, our transformation is well on track, and we will continue to improve revenue and profitability over time. We have established a solid foundation with a right organizational structure, product portfolio and sales force to drive sustainable growth. We continue to experience strong momentum in our hyperscale business, thanks to our unique in-house design and manufacturing business model. We continue to demonstrate our fast time-to-market capability as we lead in the Purley transition. Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen in high-performance computing and software-defined infrastructure.
For Mobile business, we will remain in our strong position and profitability in Latin America, strengthen presence in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe and fine-tune our product strategy in key emerging markets to fit local market demand and focus on profitability.
Looking forward, we still see challenges, including component cost increase and a fierce competition in emerging markets that could impact our short-term performance.
To conclude, the group now has a more customer-focused organization and a more compelling product portfolio across all our businesses led by our 3-wave strategy, enabling us to address more market opportunities. Coupled with our competitive cost structure and solid execution capability, we are confident that our profit improvement will continue, and we'll remain confident in our vision and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth.

First, on the data center business, Could you talk a little bit about your strategy on hyperscale? You mentioned that you've won 6 out of 10 hyperscale customers. What has changed I think? And could you also mention how does the economics and profitability in hyperscale business looks right now compared to your core enterprise business? I remember that about a year back, especially in China, it was actually a very low-margin business. How has that changed? That's my first question. Second, on mobile. It increasingly feels like the business is primarily a LatAm and North America business, while in Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe and China, I mean, the market seems to be extremely competitive but no meaningful profitability for any of the players. Is the company starting to think about kind of ring-fencing some of the mobile businesses to the more profitable areas where Lenovo Moto is typically strong? Or do we still have aspirations to try to gain share back in Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe? And maybe touch up on the profitability angle on mobile as well.",185

So as we mentioned in the last earnings call, we've been transforming the business model on hyperscale. Most importantly, we've gone much deeper in engineering and customer centricity and understanding the unique needs of our hyperscale customers. So we are building now a unique engineering team which understands the environment that each of these unique hyperscale customers require. So we're building customized products that we hadn't done, for example, a year ago. That starts at a customized motherboard level. We're then putting into our own motherboard factories, which is the unique differentiation Lenovo has relative to other multinational companies, and we're also expanding the capability we have at system level integration, all the way at the rack level. And we've opened up new factories, for example, in Europe that's enabling us to have a much more efficient supply chain. So it's really a completely transformed business model where we're able to deliver much better profitability but also better customer centricity by meeting the unique needs of each of these customers, which, at their scale, they require customized solutions. And then lastly, I think we've got a -- in many parts of the business, we have a different leadership team. So this business is now being managed by Paul Ju, who is one of the founders of originally Wiwynn, so he knows how to do this very cost effectively. And so I think we have a very cost-centric view of the world as well. So I expect that this business will continue to improve its profitability as the mix shifts from Broadwell to Purley. We have a better cost structure around Purley. And so as we move that business model, you'll see both the revenue and the profit continue to improve in the future.",294

Regarding the mobile business, so as I said at the opening, so we have a clear strategy for this business. We will continue to strengthen our leading position and the profitability in Latin America. So we will try to break through in mature markets, particularly U.S. and North America. And in the short term, we will maintain healthy growth with controlled investment in emerging markets. We remain committed to making this business profitable. So actually, last quarter's performance, so you can see, so we still have a very strong business in Latin America. So not only do we grow by -- so that's 7% year-on-year. So actually, we made money from the market. So in North America, actually, we grew by 85% year-on-year so by volume. So -- but definitely, we still need to sharpen the flagship product to attract more share in the premium price in mature market. So that will be the overall strategy for our Mobile business. Thank you, Gokul.",164

Yes, so I think 2 things. One, North America, I think, is again recovering quite nicely for us. The services and the attach rate on services continues to go up. It's mitigated by the fact that our installed base has been shrinking. But I think as you look at the number of attach rates of the new servers that we're bringing into the marketplace, our services attach rate is up -- they're up nicely with obviously improving margins. So I think we -- what you see as a result is installed base has been going down overall, so that has mitigated some of the growth. But I think our sales force is doing a nice job of delivering a higher services attach on the new platforms around the Purley transition, North America and globally.",136

It's because at the beginning of this year, some semiconductor players, they are very positive on the deferment of high-performance computing. So what -- how do you see the trend of high-performance computing? Would it become a major growth driver for your enterprise segment? That will be my first question. And my second question is that I also look in some of also your PC and Enterprise segment, they talk about that actually in high-performance computing, they could capture more value, so what is your opinion on that comment? Would maybe high-performance computing become a kind of an enhancement, also bring some enhancements to the profitability of your enterprise segment? That's my second question.",123

One is, I think, top 500 supercomputing and how HPC and AI play into that, and then the broad HPC market. So I believe IDC still views the broad market and Lenovo as the fastest growing HPC company year-on-year, about 17% growth. Within the top 500, we've significantly improved our position relative to the goal, I've said publicly, of becoming the #1 supercomputer company by 2020. I think we're well on track, if not slightly ahead, of our plan to do that. This quarter, we announced our largest-ever supercomputer win in North America, it's SciNet, also largest computer in Canada. We also announced the largest supercomputer win ever in Europe, which is almost I think 3x the size of what we've installed, which is the largest Purley supercomputer in Barcelona, Spain. So with LRZ in Germany, we now have the largest supercomputer in Germany. So that means we have the fastest supercomputer in Italy, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Australia, Canada and #1 in total number of installations in China. So I think that shows strong momentum. On top of that, each of these folks are starting to play artificial intelligence. So we've announced a significant investment in 3 different artificial intelligence labs in Beijing; Stuttgart, Germany and Raleigh this quarter. And I think lastly, our products, as we've said, the Purley transition from Intel was a significant momentum shift in the industry where we're gaining share. So at the latest supercomputing show, we were named Readers' Choice for not only best server but best storage in the supercomputer market. That's -- so that wasn't a magazine, that was actually the readers voting, and Lenovo achieved so both the best server and best storage award. So we feel quite strongly about our global position for HPC and supercomputing, and it's a foundation for growth in AI that we'll see in the future as well.",324

I think this is clear innovation that we're doing. We're in our third generation of warm-water cooled supercomputers. So obviously, these computers take a lot of energy, they're actually analyzing things that are good for the world like helping solve climate change. But we're also sensitive to how much energy these computers consume, so we have multiple dozen patents pending on our water cooling technology. And for example, the Germany supercomputer, Peking University and also now one of the large supercomputers in India for the space administration, all are using our warm-water cooling technology to deliver not just the fastest supercomputers but some of the most energy-efficient computers on the planet as well.",116

We -- if we can just switch gears maybe to the PC business, saw very strong growth this past quarter, much better ASPs, pass-through component cost. I guess as a 3-part question, just really going to 2018, maybe we can kind of explore how Lenovo sees the gaming market and kind of how Lenovo plans on attacking this category. Also just a quick update, if we can, on the partnership with Fujitsu. Is that on track to close? I think it's -- it was originally targeted by the end of March 2018, if we can just get a quick update there. And then just bigger picture kind of where we are kind of in the current PC cycle. Where do you expect growth in over the next 12 months? And is it going to be a continuation of Asia Pac, LatAm and EMEA?

I think the good thing is that we are #1 now both on revenue and unit, with even stronger growth on both revenue and units than the market. So clearly, what we have been doing during the last 12 months in terms of new product and new platform introduction is paying off.

We don't see any major obstacle or any issue preventing us to close by end of March. When we look at PC, I think one good sign last quarter, it told us for the first time after I don't know how many quarters, not only revenue but even units, they were back to growth, right? And revenue, I think, will continue to grow in 2019. I'm not confident that CA will continue to grow, but probably CA will stabilize, but revenue will continue to grow also next year. And our plan is, again, to maintain the 5-point premium to the market in terms of revenue growth. So we see -- overall, we are quite positive about 2019. And if you look, all the geographies today are profitable in terms of PC. Even in the geo like U.S. where we have been slowing down in terms of growth simply because we didn't want to compromise profitability too much, we are still profitable even better than last year. Then of course, there are regions like EMEA and AP that we -- and even Latin America, where we see double-digit on the high side of the double-digit growth. I think we will continue to see the same growth in 2019. One good sign is China. China is finally poised to revenue growth in Q3, and we think we can continue for the entire next year. And we also plan to come back in U.S., we are stabilizing the organization. We announced a new leader in U.S. that we took some action in terms of channel inventory and even product mix. So I think we are also ready to come back in U.S. with a strong growth going forward.",319

So if you look at last quarter, so AP grew by 18%; EMEA, 15%; Latin America, 28%; PRC, 2.5%. Only North America has declined by 5% because of -- we are transforming the business there. But even in the U.S., our PTI still improved by 0.5 point year-on-year. So we are very confident in the next year also we will further grow our PC business. So we definitely will keep like a 5-point premium to the market. So that's our goal. And hopefully, we can further improve our profitability. And we will drive the growth through the high-growth area like [ C&M ] products, like workstation, like gaming.",109

We're not breaking out the business at that level right now, but I think we're seeing triple-digit growth in both software-defined across all our major partners. So on Nutanix, we're their fastest-growing OEM, so we're seeing significant growth on both [ your ] stack and vSAN with our VMware solution. So across all 3, ThinkAgile and, again, on our new brand, we're seeing good transformation and triple-digit growth. In hyperscale, you're going to see continued triple-digit growth from us as well as we transform the business model. And then in the traditional enterprise, just as an example, I think in the last year alone, in North America, we picked up about 770 new customers. So we're seeing significant growth in the traditional business as well. But we aren't breaking out the exact percentages. But obviously, given our results, what I'd told you is that software-defined, while we don't have the same legacy as a traditional networking or storage vendor, we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. And Lenovo is and is perceived as a disruptor and will continue to do that. And so hyperscale and software-defined, I think, are still our fastest-growing segments followed by the other segments.",198

Thank you for joining us here today. I'm pleased to discuss our last quarter results. We definitely had a strong quarter, demonstrating our progress in executing our 3-wave strategy. And as I mentioned in the previous quarters, Lenovo has now passed the turning point and entered a new phase of growth. 
Last quarter, our revenue was over USD 10.6 billion, up more than 11% year-on-year. We resumed our double-digit growth journey. We also improved the profitability in all 3 key businesses, core businesses, year-on-year. And the pretax operational performance, excluding onetime nonoperational items, improved USD 255 million year-on-year.
Our PC & Tablet revenue grew almost 16% year-on-year. That is the highest growth in the past 4 years. Pretax income margin also returned to 5% after a year.
In Data Center, we showed even stronger growth momentum than last quarter. Our revenue grew almost 44% year-on-year, and we saw growth in all segments and all geographies. Overall profitability improved by over 11 points year-on-year, narrowing our loss for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Our Mobile business overall is definitely not as good as we expected. We are refining our branding strategy and the business model in emerging markets. But we still showed our strength in North America and the Latin America, and we have taken actions to cut expense by 30% to reshape the business for the new fiscal year.
In our 3rd Wave business, we delivered a concrete progress. Our non-device revenue driven by software and services increased almost 30% year-on-year. In new smart devices, we are already the worldwide #1 AR device player with Mirage. And the last quarter, we launched the Mirage Solo VR headset, VR camera, Smart Office, ThinkSmart Hub and many other new smart devices.
Now as we move into the Smart IoT era, more smart devices are emerging, generating huge amount of data, fueling intelligence. To adapt to the change in the world, we combined our PC, Mobile and the Smart Devices into Intelligent Devices Group, or IDG. This new group will enable us to leverage shared platforms like global supply chain and services for lower costs and higher efficiency; accelerate the technology convergence between computing and communication; even more importantly, this group will drive a new UDS platform to connect our users, devices and cloud services. 
Looking forward, the new Intelligent Devices Group, or IDG, will strengthen our leading profitability and the market position in PCs and Tablets, reshape and improve profitability in our Mobile business and then return it to financial health. At the same time, we will focus more on high-growth smart IoT segments, building UDS platform and then increasing our service penetration rate.
Our rapidly growing Data Center business will become a profitable, sustainable growth engine. In the new year, we aim to more than double our hyperscale and software-defined businesses through continued industry-leading innovation. We remain committed to significantly improving profitability year-on-year.
And to pioneer in the intelligence era, we will build our capability in Vertical Intelligent Solutions using IoT, big data and AI technology.
Lastly, we see that our strong execution has returned our business to growth. In the year ahead, I'm confident that you will see us continue to grow our revenue and profitability as well as build competitiveness in the smart IoT and intelligence era.
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",565
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, May 24, 2018",2018-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2869.0,1489869.0,59027384.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. Now I will take you through the Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q4 and fiscal year 2018. Next chart, please. 
So let me first share with you the financial highlights for our quarter 4 performance. Our quarter 4 performance continued to show solid momentum. Revenue grew 11% with strong operational profit improvement year-on-year, led by a strong revenue performance from both PCSD and our Data Center businesses. 
Gross profit increased by 13% year-on-year while gross profit margin increased by 0.2 percentage point year-on-year to 14.5%. The result was driven by better product mix in PCSD businesses, which helped offset the impact of the component cost increase.
Operating expenses increased by 11% to $1.4 billion. Our E-to-R ratio increased slightly year-on-year to 13.6%, mainly due to the onetime items recorded last year that offset the overall expenses. 
Group PTI $37 million, up 143% year-on-year. Group operational performance was $76 million, improving $255 million from a year ago. The improvement was mainly driven by the solid performance in PCSD, while the losses in both of our DCG and MBG businesses continued to narrow year-on-year.
For the full year, revenue was $45 billion, up 5%, resuming growth momentum. Gross profit increased 3% year-on-year while margin decreased by 0.4 percentage point to 13.8%, impacted largely by the component cost increases during the year. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $5.9 billion, largely due to the onetime items recorded in the previous year that offset the overall expenses. 
Group reported pretax income was $133 million. Group operational performance was $193 million, improving around $100 million from a year ago.
Profit attributable to equity-holders for Q4 was $33 million, and the year-on-year drop was due to a tax credit recorded in the previous year. We recorded $189 million loss for the full year, mainly due to a onetime noncash write-off charge of $400 million in Q3 on the deferred income tax asset, which we have already announced in the last quarter. The year-on-year drop was largely due to the onetime items and the tax credit recorded in the previous year.
Basic loss per share for the year was USD 0.0167 compared to earnings of USD 0.048 -- sorry, USD 0.0486 last year. The board decided in this morning's meeting to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.205 per share. So next chart, please. 
So cash used in operation was at $753 million in Q4, mainly due to our buy-ahead actions in key components for our businesses during the quarter. 
At the end of quarter 4, we have net debt of $1.8 billion versus $86 million of net debt in the previous year. The higher debt position was mainly due to the utilization of our revolving facility. The lower cash level compared to a year ago was partially due to the paydown of the Google promissory notes during the year in addition to the buy-ahead actions in key components.
In Q4, we have successfully refinanced our $714 million of our U.S. dollar bonds, extending the maturity date from the initially May next year to March 2023. We have also refinanced our syndicated U.S. dollar revolving facility, extending the availability for another 5 years and expanding the facility from $800 million to $1.5 billion.
In Q4, our cash conversion cycle was negative 17 days, 5 days worse year-on-year, due to the longer inventory days that resulted from our components buy-ahead plan for our businesses. We expect the buy ahead to moderate and subside in the few -- in the coming quarters with inventory days improving. Next chart, please. 
The global PC market continued to show signs of stabilization in Q4. Our PCSD business delivered a strong result, with a sixth consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth. We recorded double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in 4 out of 5 key geographies we operate. Our PC business in China also regained momentum with premium to market revenue performance. 
For the full fiscal year, PC business -- PCSD business also resumed its growth momentum, thanks to the solid commercial business and our strong performance from workstation and gaming PC. Both our workstation and gaming PC business are now a $1 billion business.
Revenue in Q4 was up 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion, thanks to more innovative products and a better product mix. Pretax income was $384 million up 33% year-on-year. PTI margin improved 0.7 percentage point to 5% level. Our PTI margin has shown quarter-to-quarter improvement throughout the financial year. 
For the full fiscal year, revenue was up 8% year-on-year to $32 billion. Pretax income maintained at around $1.5 billion, similar level to the last fiscal year, while margin dropped 0.5 percentage point year-on-year mainly due to the component cost hike during the year. Next chart, please. 
Our transformation of -- our transformation in Data Center business is well on track. Q4 revenue growth is the highest since the acquisition and the profitability continued to improve throughout the year. Geos outside China saw strong double-digit revenue growth, especially strong in America and EMEA, while China continues revenue growth momentum since quarter 3. Our margin has also shown both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year improvement during the quarter.
On the product segment performance, our hyperscale segment achieved triple digit revenue growth, while margin improved significantly, thanks to our previous efforts to refining the business model. Our high-performance computing and software-defined segments also achieved double-digit revenue growth during the quarter. 
For the full year, our transformation actions to build in-house design capability helped our hyperscale business improve its customer mix and grow this business outside of China rapidly, that's also achieving revenue growth year-on-year. Our software-defined segment achieved triple-digit revenue growth, while we further narrowed the gap to challenge the #1 supercomputer position.
Global accounts grew 5 quarters in a row and 147% year-on-year for the quarter. We have not only returned to the year-on-year revenue growth, but also continue to reduce the loss for 4 consecutive quarters. This reflects the execution to the strategies set last year to drive dedicated DCG sales, supply chain and quality capability, leading the Intel Purley Xeon transition with the best customer satisfaction in the industry, introducing our most comprehensive data center road map in history and delivering higher attach rate of storage and services to our growing server business.
Revenue from Data Center business was up 44% year-on-year to $1.2 billion in quarter 4. Our operation PTI margin improved significantly, and operational loss before tax was narrowed to $34 million in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, revenue up 8% year-on-year to $4.4 billion. Operational loss before tax was narrowed to $305 million. Next chart, please. 
For our Mobile business, we continue our strong momentum in our core geography, Latin America, with double-digit revenue growth and maintained strong profitability in Q4. 
In mature market, our volume achieved double-digit growth year-on-year. Specifically, we continue to strengthen our presence in mainstream models and carrier expansion, and achieved a very strong shipment growth in North America. In emerging markets, we continue to face challenges of intense competition while we continue to refine branding strategy, product portfolio and business model by focusing on profitability.
Revenue declined 24% year-on-year in Q4, which was mainly due to both external challenges and our continued and deliberate adjustment in strategy to reposition in the emerging market. Operational loss narrowed while margin improved 1.8 percentage points year-on-year, thanks to the expenses control across the geographies. For the full year, revenue declined 6% year-on-year, while operational loss narrowed by more than $100 million and margin improved by 0.9 percentage point.
Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on driving better profitable growth, building on strong results of the last few quarters. We'll continue to drive premium to market revenue growth and maintain our industry-leading profitability for our PC business. We'll continue to improve our user experience with our innovative products and channel reform to drive future growth. Our smart devices are now in the go-to-market phase and starting to contribute to our revenue. 
To continue the success of our Star Wars AR headset, we also just launched the VR device Mirage Solo in May, and will be launching more Smart Home and Smart Office devices soon. 
For Mobile business, expense control actions including optimizing cost structure, leveraging shared platforms and streamlining portfolio are underway to significantly reduce operating loss. Meanwhile, we will focus on driving profitable growth from core markets such as growing a strong position and profitability in Latin America and strengthen our presence in the mature markets. Nevertheless, the fierce competition in the emerging market may still impact our short-term performance. 
For our Data Center business, we are confident to deliver sustainable profitable growth over time. We established a solid foundation through our stronger organizing structure, product portfolio and sales force to drive long-term growth. We continue to expect strong momentum in our hyperscale business, thanks to our unique in-house design and manufacturing business model. Meanwhile, we'll continue to strengthen our position in high-performance computing and outgrow the market in software-defined infrastructure.
As Yuanqing mentioned, the formation of the Intelligent Device Group, combining the PCS and MBG, will allow us to leverage the shared platform that we have been building. Our industry has emerged from the PC [indiscernible] era to a mobile Internet era, and now quickly moving into the smart IoT era. Accelerating the convergence of the different technologies and devices enables us to address more market opportunities in the future and to drive our smart IoT plus cloud businesses to the next level.
Coupled with our competitive cost structure and efficiency, we are confident that our profit improvement will continue and remain confident in our vision and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth.

Chromebook, it's a nice business in terms of volume, it's a terrible business in terms of profitability. So we are -- so this is, I think -- so very, very careful in terms of managing growth and profit. The other things we did, we also look at our product portfolio in terms of optimizing the product portfolio and avoiding duplication. And so making sure that we have a good offer covering all the segment, but without any duplication. And we have been able to move resources from PC to invest on the smart devices without compromising PC growth, right? So this is -- it's another important thing. The other thing, we have been focusing on some segment much more than before. Frankly speaking, we have been working for almost 18 months, but now you see the result. Now we are #1 on gaming, both volume and revenue for the last 3 quarters -- for the last 3 months, sorry, and it's more than $1 billion.

And second one is to Kirk. So we're actually quite impressed, your high growth in the Data Center market. And so if we -- our memory is right, like hyperscale actually bring down the margin in the past. So why will it be different this time, and can you share more color on what's your vision and also maybe technology innovation?",64

First 100 days was to analyze what went right and what could be improved after the IBM acquisition. Second 100 days, we spent putting those fixes into the market outside China. Third 100 days was making sure those fixes were transforming and generating better profit and share results. And then the last 100 days, we implemented those changes in China. So I think the first thing is if you just look at our transformation, you see growth like 92% in North America. You see 60-plus percent in Europe. China looks only like 8%. But remember, it's 100 days behind in the transformation, okay? That's the most important thing. It was done purposefully, okay? On hyperscale, the business models completely changed year-on-year. Last year, we just took off-the-shelf motherboards from Taiwan and sent them in to the hyperscalers. This year, we built out a team led by Paul Ju, the founder of Wiwynn. He knows how to do things very cost effectively. We're building over 33 custom products now, deep engineering with the 6 design wins we have of the top 10. Then we're putting it into our motherboard factory, which we didn't do last year, and into our systems factories around the world and then using our supply chain and procurement power. So we can do this profitably because relative to the ODMs -- everyone asked, ""Can you compete with the ODMs?"" We have far more purchasing power because of the 2 gentlemen on my left here being in the phone and the PC business than a typical ODM, number one. Number two, relative to the system integrators that are local, supplying some of the top hyperscalers, we ship into 160 countries in the world. So we've seen great success shipping into Brazil, South Africa, India, this kind of thing, because of our global supply chain. And then third, we have world-class reliability and quality, and that is appreciated even by the hyperscalers. So for this reason, we think we can grow triple digits sustainably for some time. Thank you.",365

So first question just to belabor the point on hyperscale, could you talk a little bit about what is hyperscale going to be a portion of the mix for Lenovo Data Center business, let's say, in 18 to 24 months? It looks like for the market, it's already getting to be 40% to 50% in terms of volumes at least. And what is the strategy for hyperscale in China? Because it feels like that China hyperscale competition has been even more fierce compared to the global hyperscale market.",94

So I think first and foremost, we did rebalance our mix. We did move some of the business out of the top hyperscalers in China until we got to the new business model. So the old business model, obviously, was not working for us if you looked at our financial results. The new business model, we think, absolutely can work with us. Secondly is if you look at the second kind of wave of companies in China like JD.com or DiDi or these other kind of companies, they're also getting very, very large, right as well as the second wave of companies. I think the number like 11 through 200 still represent about 40 -- more than 40% of the market. So there is a business in that public cloud numbers 11 through 200 to be had. And then lastly, I think we're seeing higher-end workloads move to the cloud, right? It used to be HR applications or e-mail, but now we're seeing more mission-critical workloads move to the cloud. This could mean 8-way servers, 16-way servers. And traditionally, IBM has been the industry leader of delivering Xeon-class scale-up computing. So I think you shouldn't think of just very, very low-end pizza boxes going into the cloud. Some of the bids we're working on for the large hyperscalers, the servers could be up to $1 million apiece. That's very different than selling a $1,500 server in high volume. And obviously, I think you can make a little bit more margin when you do that. Thank you.",259

Could you outline a little bit more detail in terms of the expense reduction, the 30% expense reduction that we are targeting? How much of it is already done? Is there more to come in fiscal '19? And what is the kind of strategy in mature markets now that we have broadened out the coverage in North America? What is the threshold in terms of profitability to be looking at some of these markets?",81

We're going to see the results coming through this fiscal year, through the year, but all the actions have been taken and are underway. So it included like -- it was across the board, functional areas, R&D, regions. It was a very broad approach. So that's the first part of the question. The second like -- no, our -- well, the second came with a very big reduction in complexity. So we are taking, like, from 15 products to 9. We are -- from the 9 products that are left, we are taking like chipsets from 10 to 4, we are taking front cameras and, like, back cameras from 10 to 5. So when you see the new products coming, probably through the end of the year, we'll see a lot of this complexity going down. I think you cannot exactly measure, but once you take this out, you do less training to the sales force, less calls in the call center, less software development. There are a lot of things that come as you take this complexity out.",191

So that's the framework on the plan we have. In terms of markets, in Latin America, we are #2 in every market. It's not about being #2. We are #2 in Argentina. We are #2 in Brazil. We are 2 in Chile. We are #2 in Peru. We got to be #1 in Q3 in Mexico. We are very close to #1 last quarter. So even in Latin America our portfolio is much more solid. In the past, a big part of our profitability come from Brazil. It's much, much more spread now. So that's Latin America. When you go to North America, we are growing, right? We're taking -- we are growing 50% year-over-year. This year, the ranging we got, North America carriers has grown 54%. Wide-ranging in North America is the only indicator of growth. I believe this growth is going to sustain. And we are now ranging -- in the past we have 2 streams, super premium and a low tier, now we are coming for the Moto G family ranging in the mid-tier, so [ reasonably ] well. In Europe, we are growing especially in Western Europe. It's over a small base. There are very encouraging results like if you look to Germany, for example. It's one of the biggest markets. In absolute growth, we were #1 last year. So we see those 3 markets like pockets of growth. When you go to emerging markets, the approach we are taking is to de-risk, right? Last year, the strategy was to try to grow very quick to get scale, we are de-risking. We can give you an example in a very tough market today like India, where we were 100% online. It's a good model, but very easy to copy. I mean, we saw competition coming very fast. We are now de-risking that market. We're going to sell a little less. We are splitting 50-50 between off-line and online. We are growing off-line very quickly. We are only taking 30% of the online market because it can go very expensive in India if you try to have multiple tiers of distribution. So when you combine all this, we see our losses narrowing quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year moving forward. So it's a reduction of expenses that combine with complexity and a combination of using the markets where we know how to do well. We also are going to be way more sophisticated the way we do innovation. We are going to take a much de-risked approach. The [ profit ] potential is not so big, but it's much easier to contain to a good level of profitability.",472

Our plan is to continue to maintain double-digit growth in terms of revenue still with a good mix and so on. I think we will also be able to continue to deliver industry-leading profitability moving forward. I think we are in much better shape than last year, no doubt. We need to see then component cost. There are a lot of things that -- they are not so stable. Frankly speaking, if I look today, component cost and -- looks better than before. There are other things in shortage, and I think it's a [ pass-through ] component and small things, but you still need them.

So if you see the volume of our PC shipment, so actually, we were flat year-on-year. But our revenue grew by 16% year-on-year. So that means average selling price was increased significantly. So that can prove -- so our strategy is right and that it works because we are focusing on the premium products like gaming, like workstation. So that help us to improve the profitability. But definitely, meanwhile, we lose the volume in the low end, in the Chromebook kind of things. But it doesn't matter, we don't care about that. So the volume or the market share is not everything, right? So that's why you see our -- we improved our profitability, but our competitors are getting worse.",131

Of course, we don't have a date for the breakeven. But I mean, we'll see continuous progress. As I said, I think the expense reductions are going to -- well, with the expense reductions, you see our sales are down year-over-year, but our activations are flat. It shows we are depleting inventory very aggressively. So I mean, I guess, probably the turnaround point for the inventory is around July, August time frame, the expense we're going to keep through the year more heavily like 100% starting in August. So I mean -- and then when we launch the new families, we will take a lot from the platform. So these things are going to add, and then we'll see -- we are very confident we'll see a path for continuous improvement, right? So that's the framework. A firm date we don't have for breakeven.

No, gaming -- first of all, you need to look at the market, right? I think market is, today, are the gamers and the casual gamers, let's say or if I can say. There are people spending the night gaming rather than sleeping and people that they may play 2 or 3 hours, but then they're able to socialize. And so we don't want to address or we are not addressing the people not sleeping. They -- usually, they go with big gamers provider like Alienware and some other people. It's not growing in terms of market, it's more or less stable to slightly growing, and you need to think about also in terms of device, a very special device, and [ these ugly ] things that you see that, most of the cases, the normal people don't like. And the other piece is the piece that is really growing. But you need to address these people with a product that are gaming product, of course, so with good graphical, good display, special keyboard, some lights and so on. But you still need to deliver product that are, in terms of look and feel, they feel appealing. So if you look at our product line today in terms of gaming, Legion, it's a -- I would say, it's a notebook or it's in a desktop that you can easily carry with you. Most of the cases, a gaming machine you don't carry with you because it's really something -- so we are -- this market is growing. It's growing in China and it's growing outside China in a lot of different geographies. So we have been working during the last 12 months to redesign completely the product in terms of material, look and feel and so on, and also in terms of performance, in terms of specs. You still need the high-end graphical, it's not that you don't need high-end graphical or you need certain things. But -- and then you need to do promotion because this market or this business is very special. You have all these esport event or this gaming event we are sponsoring different things in -- or different event in different part of the world. We have a dedicated team and a dedicated [ BU ] group of people. So we are addressing the part of the market that is, first of all, is growing, will continue to grow, and we will continue to develop product. But I think we address the right part of the market. We are not really too much -- we also have some solution on the other side, but we are really not too much focused on the other side.",457

If you -- okay, you can segment the market between the low end, the mid-end and high end, right, of course. In the low end, first of all, when you see the market, low end anyway is shrinking. The only thing that is really growing is Chromebook, and Chromebook is probably 12 to 14 million units per year mainly in the United States, and this is where our competitors are very, very focused in order to get share. Then you need to address the mid and the high end. It is true that -- but then you need also to develop product addressing mid and high end. It's not just a matter that you increase price, if you increase price on the product that is not high end or mid-end, you will never sell it. Because if you take FIAT 500 and you think that you can sell it at a Mercedes price, it doesn't work, right? People are not coming. So you need, first of all, to develop the product, addressing mid and high end. You need to build the brand addressing mid- and high end. It's just -- it's not a very simple exercise. Of course, competition can come, but they probably need to spend 12, 18 months before they can do it. And when you do these things, it's also the product is for sure is more expensive. If you look within the improved margin in terms of -- because our margin is more or less flat. In terms of GP, gross margin, we improved our selling price. So if you do the exercise [ then completion ], but it's much more easy to fight on the low end and to be aggressive on low end and reducing price. It's much more difficult to do the same exercise on mid-end and high end. And you need to, as I said, you need to first you need to have the product.",337

We will first start with our presentation. After that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing. Yuanqing, please.",94

Thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results of the first quarter fiscal year 2018/'19 and our progress in executing our 3-wave [ strategy. ] 
Four quarters ago, I shared with you that Lenovo has passed the turning point, and now we are in the face of acceleration, accelerating our transformation strategy execution as well as the upward momentum in business performance. 
For the second straight quarter, we saw strong double-digit growth in revenue year-on-year. Global revenue reached almost USD 12 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Profits also followed the momentum. Our pretax income was USD 113 million, an improvement of more than USD 182 million year-on-year. Our profitability improved across all our businesses. 
Since we combined the PC, mobile and the smart devices into Intelligent Device Group last quarter, the new group is energized by synergy from the shared platforms and resources. IDG delivered a double-digit top line growth and improved the profitability year-on-year. We remain committed to driving the convergence of computing and communication technologies to enable smart IoT and capture future opportunities through executing our 3-wave [ strategy. ] 
In the first wave, our PC+Tablet business continued to deliver strong double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter, while we maintained the industry-leading profitability of 5%. In PC, we were the fastest-growing player among the top 5, according to IDC. Our revenue grew almost 20%, 12 points premium to the market, driven by strong growth in commercial segments. 
Commercial mix reached historical high of 63%. The integration of Fujitsu further solidified our position in PC industry. We have returned to worldwide #1 last quarter in PC by Gartner. We have been #1 in overall PC+Tablet for 4 consecutive quarters by IDC. 
We will continue to sharpen customer engagement through direct route to market like e-commerce, relationship model for large accounts, invest in high-growth segments like workstation, gaming, thin and light to drive growth. And we will continue to strengthen our focus on premium products to achieve higher average selling price for better top line growth and profitability. With these efforts, we are confident in sustaining our premium to market growth while maintaining industry-leading profitability.
Our second wave business, mobile, is definitely improving its health through executing the clear [ strategy. ] First, we'll reduce operating expenses by more than $100 million year-on-year. In fact, our goal for this fiscal year is to control the annual operating expense of Motorola business to below USD 1 billion. This means we will reduce the expense by USD 800 million since we acquired this business over 3 years ago. 
Second, we'll refine our product portfolio and successfully launch the Moto G6 and the E5 products. Third, we focus on selected markets where we can compete and make a profit. 
In Latin America, we continued to outgrow the market in both revenue and volume for 7 quarters in a row. In North America, our volume nearly doubled year-on-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 50% year-on-year growth, driven by the wider scaling strategy to expand to all 4 major carriers. 
In key emerging markets, China and India, we are committed to further investing in the right brand [ strategy ] and the product portfolio and quickly return to healthy growth. We will continue to invest in innovation. And this month, we announced that the 5G upgradable phone, Moto Z3, in the U.S., with the 5G mod scheduled to ship early next year. We will be the first company to provide the 5G mobile experience to customers.
 
Another second wave business, data center, is on track to become a sustainable growth and a profit engine for our company. Revenue grew almost 68%, highest since IBM x86 acquisition. And the profitability improved 11 points year-on-year, accelerating double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter, driven by software-defined infrastructure, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence and hyperscale. 
Hyperscale revenue grew triple digit once again while improving gross profit and diversifying our customer base. In addition, Lenovo surpassed HP to become #1 supercomputer provider on the TOP500 supercomputing list with 117 systems. Software-defined accelerated further, driving triple-digit growth year-on-year as well. 
We will continue executing our current strategy to improve our hyperscale business model by further expanding our in-house design and manufacturing capability, strengthen our leadership in high-performance computing and AI, grow storage and networking and continue to drive service attach and revenue growth. We will also move aggressively into growth markets like NFV and Edge computing.
In the third wave, we are also making good progress in Smart IoT + Cloud and Infrastructure + Cloud. We are shipping Mirage Solo VR headset and camera smart display in the United States and received very positive feedback. Our consumer smart IoT-based services started to generate revenue in China, Japan and Brazil. Similarly, our smart office also provided key wins at commercial customers like Microsoft and [ Michelin ]. 
And the Device-as-a-Service business has acquired large deals in Asia Pacific. We are also providing Vertical intelligent solutions and piloting commercial IoT-based industry solutions in selected vertical industries. 
Driven by these efforts, our services and software revenue reached almost USD 460 million. With a firm belief in our direction and persistent execution, it is clear that Lenovo has turned the corner. I'm confident that as our execution of transformation strategy and the performance growth accelerate with all cylinders fired up, sustainable returns will follow. 
Thank you very much. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",916

I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2019. 
Next chart, please. Let me first share with you income statement highlights for the quarter 1 performance. Our transformation actions continue to show consistent and accelerated result improvement in Q1. Our revenue grew 19% year-on-year and achieved a record high first quarter with strong PTI improvement year-on-year, led by strong revenue performance from both PCSD and DCG. 
Gross profit increased by 20% year-on-year, while gross profit margin increased 0.01 percentage point year-on-year to 13.7%. The result was driven by better business performance in both PCSD and DCG. 
Operating expenses increased by 6% to around $1.5 billion, where the expenses to revenue ratio decreased 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 12.2% mainly due to the expense saving from both the repositioning of strategy in MBG and the group revenue growth. 
Group PTI was $113 million, which showed an improvement of more than $180 million from a loss of $69 million a year ago. All business group profitability have been significantly improved. 
Profit attributable to equityholders for Q1 was $77 million, also meaningfully improved from a $72 million loss from a year ago. Basic earnings per share for the quarter was USD 0.00065 (sic) [ USD 0.0065 ] compared to a loss of USD 0.00066 (sic) [ USD 0.0066 ] last year.
Next chart, please. Cash generated from operations was at $336 million in Q1, improved from growth year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter thanks to the operational and working capital improvement during the quarter. At the end of quarter 1, we have net debt of $1.8 billion versus $1.3 billion of net debt in the previous year. The high debt position was mainly due to the utilization of additional revolving facilities to finance business expansion. 
In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was negative 8 days, 7 days worse year-on-year due to longer inventory days that resulted from our component buy-ahead plan for PCSD and DCG businesses. We expect the buy-ahead will subside in the upcoming quarters with inventory days improving.
Next chart, please. In the first quarter, after we combine PCSD and MBG into the Intelligent Device Business Group, IDG has been able to drive synergy from shared platform and infrastructure, which helped the group expand our ecosystem and achieve healthy revenue growth with profit improvement both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter on a pro forma basis. The strong double-digit revenue growth were driven by our strong PC business. The PTI margin improved year-on-year for 3 consecutive quarters, driven by PCSD business, which was able to give us industry-leading profitability of 5% while MBG continue to improve its profitability as planned.
Next chart, please. Our PCSD business delivered another strong quarter with 19% year-to-year revenue growth, which is the second consecutive quarter to achieve the double-digit growth even without the contribution from the JV with Fujitsu with our organic growth at 12%. The strong growth not only come from the continued healthy growth from our commercial businesses and workstation products but also from the continued strength in the fast-growing interest, including gaming, thin and light, and visual products, which all achieved double-digit growth in quarter 1.
The group third wave transformation also shows solid growth in Q1 in ramping up its services and e-commerce business that recorded strong double-digit revenue growth, showing our strength in direct reach to users. In addition, the group also launched several new smart devices in consumer smart IoT, including Mirage Solo, Mirage Camera and Daydream, Smart Display with Google, and in commercial IoT, including Smart Office or core Hub 500, smart enterprise solutions with Lenovo big data and Lenovo Connect. These smart device launches demonstrated the group's innovation and leadership in technology. 
Revenue in Q1 was $8.3 billion. Pretax income was $418 million, up 43% year-on-year. PTI margin improved 0.08 percentage point to 5% level. Our PTI margin has shown quarter-to-quarter improvement since the previous financial year, driven by improved product mix, focusing on high-growth premium segments and with improved services attach rates.
Next chart, please. For our Mobile business, our execution of turnaround strategy was on track to improve profitability during the quarter thanks to the continued strong momentum in Latin America and North America and the inventory clearance along with our repositioning in emerging markets. Our expense reduction actions were also executed well, thus resulting in a more efficient cost structure and improved margins. 
Revenue improved 23% quarter-to-quarter, and pretax loss was narrowed by $44 million quarter-to-quarter and $75 million year-on-year, reflecting signs of business stabilization with our repositioning strategy. We will continue our strategies to streamline product portfolio to reduce the business complexity and continue our focus on increasing scale in the mainstream segments to further improve profitability over time. Reported PTI margin improved 4 percentage points year-on-year thanks to the expense action, resulting in a more competitive and efficient cost structure.
Next chart, please. Our Data Center Group is on track to become a sustainable growth engine for Lenovo. Q1 revenue continued its double-digit growth for 3 consecutive quarters, and the growth of 68% in Q1 is the highest since the acquisition, while the PTI margin continued to improve for 5 consecutive quarters, our GEOs saw high double-digit revenue growth. In North America, we even achieved a triple-digit growth, which is already the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. 
In China, we also deliver our record revenue in Q1 with more than 50% growth year-on-year. Our product segment performance, our hyperscale segment achieved triple-digit revenue growth, while margin improved significantly. Our gross margin showed an increase of 13 percentage point year-on-year thanks to our previous efforts in building our in-house design and manufacturing business model and diversifying our customer base. 
Our high-performance computing business has become worldwide #1 in the TOP500 list, and the software-defined segments also achieved triple-digit revenue growth during the quarter. Meanwhile, our traditional infrastructure business continue its positive growth trend with strong momentum in the Flash-based storage solutions with more than 40% growth year-on-year. 
Revenue from Data Center business was up 68% year-on-year to $1.6 billion in Q1. Our PTI margin improved significantly by 11 percentage points, and pretax loss was narrowed to $63 million in the quarter.
Next chart, please. Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on driving profitable growth, building on the strong results of the last few quarters. As Yuanqing mentioned, the formation of Intelligent Device Group, combining PCSD and MBG, allow us to drive synergy from the shared platform that we have been building. We'll continue to drive premium to market revenue growth and maintain our industry-leading profitability for our PCSD business. We'll continue to improve the user experience with our innovation products and to drive future growth. Our smart devices are in the go-to-market phase, starting to contribute to our revenue.
For Mobile business, we'll continue to execute a strategy of reducing complexity, streamlining portfolio, driving a more competitive cost structure and continue to significantly reduce operation loss. Meanwhile, we'll focus on driving profitable growth from core markets, growing our strong position and profitability in both Latin America and North America, and strengthening our presence in mature market. We'll also continue our investment in innovation, just like our recent effort to launch the first 5G upgradable phone in the world.
For Data Center business, we are confident to deliver sustainable profitable growth over time. We establish a solid foundation through our organization structure, product portfolio and sales force to drive long-term growth. We'll continue to outgrow the market in software-defined infrastructure. Meanwhile, we'll continue to strengthen our leadership position in high-performance computing and AI; invest further in servers, storage and networking; and continue to expect momentum in our hyperscale business thanks to our unique in-house design and manufacturing business model.
Our industry has now quickly moved into the Smart IoT era. Hence, we will accelerate the convergence of the different technologies and devices, enabling us to address more market opportunities in the future and to drive our Smart IoT + Cloud business to the next level. Coupled with our competitive cost structure and efficiency, we are confident that our profit improvement will continue, and we remain confident in our vision and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth.

Can you talk a little bit about the strategy in mobile? Is there any strategy to come back into markets like China and India once you strengthen the portfolio a little bit? And the second question I had -- or second part of the question is, is there any profitability target that you have in mind now given the losses have started to narrow quite a bit? That's my first question. The second question is, you are starting to break out your services and software revenues in the last several quarters. I think last year, it hit about $1 billion-plus of revenues -- last fiscal. And this quarter, I think it's about $450 million. Could we have some detail in terms of what exactly are the parts that are included in the service and software revenues? And what is the underlying profitability in the segment compared to the hardware business? Obviously, it's likely to be higher, but could you give us some indication about what the profitability looks like in the segment?",178

So number one, we're still playing in emerging markets, including India. Warranties, we took a more conservative approach as we -- our target this year is to reduce the loss, right, and keep an eye on the losses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. But the dealer is still the same, right. We want to align our expense and shore up stability in that in core strengths. That includes playing the emerging markets with a more conservative approach, reduce complexity, keeping that innovation and profitable [ term ]. So nothing has changed. And in terms of profitability, our commitment still is to narrow the losses on a continued basis quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, not more than quarter-over-quarter because of the magnitude.",118

So I think the period is we have the clear intent for this business. We want to turn around the business as soon as possible. So we have to further the initiatives and be focusing to achieve this [indiscernible]. So first, we've reduced the expense significantly. So last quarter, we have reduced more than $100 million year-over-year. So actually, we are very confident that this year, we can lock our Motorola business. So Motorola is the majority of our MBG business. We have run our Motorola business at below $1 billion expense. So that represents almost 50% year-on-year reduction if you compare to 3 or 4 years ago or right after we acquired the business from Google. Second is we are focusing on the mainstream products. We have successfully launched the G6 and the E5. So that's the reason. The third reason, we are focusing on the selected markets. So definitely and anyways, it's still our stronghold. So -- and also, we think we have more better opportunities by -- in mature markets, particularly North America. So actually, last quarter, we almost doubled our volumes in North America. So these strategic directions definitely give us the good results. But regarding of the emerging markets, so we will only be focusing on China and India to invest. So -- but definitely, the focus is to drive the profitable growth to our largest market in the world over time but definitely in China and India. So not only with sales of Motorola but also with sales of Lenovo as well. So that's related to the Mobile business. Yes, so we are more focusing on the -- our service business, so -- because we believe service business is one of the 3 pillars of Lenovo customer-centricity transformation. Another 2 are customer experience. So we must ensure the product experience, delivery, quality, so these kind of things, to customers. But secondly, the customer engagement. So we must ensure we have direct win [ deposit ] with our customers. So that means we must strengthen our e-commerce, our larger account directed relationship with this model. And also, we need to strengthen our consumer first class, so this kind of thing. That -- those are the first 2 pillars. The number -- the third pillar, our pillar -- the third service business, so definitely, we believe if we can expand our service business, that we will strengthen our customer-centricity transformation as well. So we have made a lot of progress in the past couple of quarters. So we are now focusing on the upscale service -- extension warranty service, premium service. And also -- and so those are related to the devices. And -- but meanwhile, we will strengthen our IoT+Cloud service as well in both the consumer side and the commercial side. So last quarter, I shared with you how we want to build the UDS platform: user, device and the services. So we have in the first half the result in China, in Japan and in Brazil. So we're quickly building the team to establish this business. And also, we see -- we are focusing on providing the intelligent solution for some vertical industries, leveraging the commercial smart IoT, so some active vertical industries. So that's why we can have the better service revenue last quarter. So we have things like the booking revenue for our service is increasing. So actually, last quarter, so the booking revenue increased by more than [indiscernible]. So that's a good segment to us. So over time, we're still going to have the better service -- or even better service revenue. So Gianfranco, you want to add something to the service?",623

We start to see some very good results. The pipeline is huge. But we also start to see some conversion from pipeline to contract.

Between 3 to 4x the margin we make on the devices, just to give you an idea. And it's a combination of premium service and Device-as-a-Service.",94

I think on unit is the first quarter after, I don't know, I even don't remember how many years that it was negative. It is currently, in fact, speaking from, for sure, the upgrade to Windows 10 from enterprise. But we also see a very good growth on SMB, and this is coming from, I would say, overall economic environment. It's not really only coming from Windows 10 transition. Consumer is still slightly behind, I would say, mainly from emerging market. But if I look over the next -- for this year, I think we will continue to see good revenue growth and also some -- [ also ] decent [ CA ] growth in terms of the market. The only question mark is probably exchange rate. That is partially compensated by component growth because it's finally start to go down. But on the other side, we see the exchange rate going up. But I think, overall, we are quite positive. We are quite positive on PC in terms of PC demand and growth. We will continue to see the same growth at least for the next 2 or 3 quarters.",223

On data centers -- this is Kirk. I think for hyperscale, as we mentioned last quarter, we have design wins now with 6 of the top 10 global hyperscalers. Our profitability is improving, and we still continue to see strong demand as we bring these design wins to production, which will happen over the next month and next several quarters. So some of these new design wins will be coming into the marketplace next quarter as well as the following quarter. So we've diversified the customer base outside of China. We've also diversified the customer base beyond the top 10 to the next 50 or so because about 40%, I think, of the volume in hyperscale is beyond, say, the super 7. So I think the business model we're using -- we're using our own factories now both in a motherboard level as well as a system level. And now doing over 30 custom products, customized to the unique needs of the super 7, is playing out quite well for us. I think we have more procurement power that's typical of yen. We have a supply chain that sells into 160 countries. And I think our quality has been world class. So I think we're quite bullish on hyperscale. Having said that, it is lumpier than a traditional business. So I think we just have to be aware of that. On the onprem, I think we do see a resurgence on the onprem as well. You see our results in software-defined infrastructure are triple-digit growth. Again, I think it's a testament to a few things. We don't have a legacy network or a storage business to protect, so we're very aggressively moving to the next generation of hyperconverged infrastructure. We've been the fastest or close to the fastest-growing OEM on the planet in software-defined infrastructure now for several quarters. So we're basically seeing a move from a traditional infrastructure to a software-defined. We're seeing us grow our share either 2x or 3x in that move. So the ThinkAgile brand, I think, from that perspective is quite strong. So we do see a resurgence of things like some of these hyperconverged infrastructures are providing a better cost structure for people that want onprem solutions. And as you saw this quarter, we announced the new composable cloud solution around ThinkAgile CP in an exclusive partnership with Cloudistics as well. So we're continuing to expand the portfolio beyond what we've been doing with VMware, Nutanix and Microsoft, Pivot3 and others. So thank you for the question.",424

So we grow at a hyper rate, fast, so for example, our Fujitsu business, our enterprise public revenue grow close to 40% year-on-year, right. So our SMB grow by 27%. So actually, last quarter, our commercial mix reached 63%, a historical high. So I think that will also help our profitability because we can make a better profit in the commercial side.

So in Page 10, you highlight the revenue up over 60% and also profitability improved significantly. So can Kirk tell us that -- what drives the big change and also the -- what we can expect in the next 2 years? This is my first question. And second question is some investor, they just need to ask. Recently, they have been observed the server DRAM spot price start to decline, and they wanted to know is the positive impact to your profitability or actually is the size of the global server demand could be softening? This is my second question. That's it.",111

I think if you look at the year-on-year revenue growth, it's been driven by things like our triple-digit growth in software-defined infrastructure, triple-digit growth in hyperscale computing. And then, as we have expanded our portfolio of storage solutions, particularly in Flash arrays, more than 40% growth. On top of that, we've grown our professional services business over 30%, and it's a profitable and growing entity. And we're increasing our premier services as well associated with that. It's quite good margins. So all of those are growth drivers. I think in the future, you should expect it to continue to increase our network attach, our storage attach and our services attach to continue to make inroads on profitability, I think -- overall, I think SSD pricing obviously has been okay and things like that, so that's...",136

They start to go down, but it's not because the demand is slowing down. It is because, most of the manufacturer, they are moving to -- they move to 3D and now capacity is much bigger than 6 or 12 months ago. It's not really because demand is slowing down. It is because there is much more capacity available.",66

So over the last year, we've trained over 11,000 certified experts. So they have the ability to sell higher-end, more profitable solutions versus just doing box pushing. So it's a more profitable sale for us based on a more technically trained channel and sales force.",65

But in this reporting season, we've been kind of picking up some data points around a major CPU platform shortage risk in the second half of '18. Can you comment about how this could impact your business? Any risk -- any mitigation plans to move to a different CPU platform? That's my first question.",82

There is a shortage. It's mainly on the new technology, while -- if you run on the tradition on the [ tabulator ], you -- it's more or less okay. The real issue that we've been working during the last quarter to go back to the old platform. On that account though, we are also running or working on alternatives to Intel CPU. I think we have today a very good offer from the AMD CPU, too. But we will probably need to do increase even more with the current situation. So there is an impact -- frankly speaking, I would say, we can manage the impact -- we can manage the negative impact within something very, very small. And then, what we said is that we will continue to see double-digit growth and on the high side of the double digit. We also take in consideration the CPU story. Without the CPU story, they probably can be even better. But I don't think that is going to impact -- frankly speaking, most of the industry is moving back to older technology or it's moving to alternative platform.",210

I would've thought with the higher mix of corporate in the quarter, we could have seen even better performance on operating margin or pretax margin. A very good job at 5%, but I thought we could assume better scale. How should we think about Fujitsu? Was that a headwind for margins? And if so, how can we think about cost in scaling over the next 12 months? That's my first question. And the second question has to do with the repurchase of the stake and the manufacturing plant for notebooks. How should we think about that plant's utilization over the next few years? Is that intended to build more notebooks? Or is the idea to transition that to build more data center to components like server motherboards? How should we think about that manufacturing within your overall production plans for your businesses?",151

I don't think you find any other company with the same mix today. Even though the other company, they said they are very focused on commercial, but at the end, what they push is consumer or Chromebook. Our percentage of Chromebook within the 63% is much smaller than other people. So this -- on -- the other thing when I look at -- when you look at the year-to-year improvement in terms of profitability, I think we are -- it's almost 1 point, right, 0.8. So we are from 4.2% to 5%. So it's a very good improvement, and it's mainly coming from, of course, commercial business. It's not coming -- commercial means both enterprise and SMB but not all consumer. The last thing, if I look at PC alone, only PC, our profitability 5.5%. Then we -- when we include the smart device, tablet [ there, ] it's going down to 5%. And I don't think we can expect much better than 5.5%. We will do our best to keep this for the next -- for the rest of the year. But if you compare with competition, we are running already at probably 2 points better than competition. So -- and SCOC I think just is -- and then I think when we can be much more beat than meet. But we are already running -- we are already producing something between 20 million to 25 million notebook a year in SCOC. So it's a big portion of our notebook, both consumer and commercial. And we'll also start -- starting -- we also produce both for third party, and we're also starting to produce both for DCG.",297

Last quarter, I said that Lenovo had ended a phase of acceleration in both our business performance and our transformation strategy execution. Today, I'm pleased to say that our acceleration continues and that we now have even stronger momentum.
Our global revenue continued double-digit growth year-on-year for the third consecutive quarter, reaching USD 13.4 billion, highest in almost 4 years.
Our pretax income reached [ USD 213 ] billion, 6x as much as the previous year as all of our businesses improved profitability.
Our Intelligent Devices Group continues to deliver strong results, thanks to the synergy from the shared platforms and the resources. We will continue to drive the convergence of the computing and the communication technologies to enable Smart IoT.
In PC, we returned to undisputed #1 by both IDC and Gartner with a record market share of 24%. Our PC revenue grew more than 20% year-on-year, 17 points faster than the market. Our PC plus tablet or PCD revenue reached USD 10 billion milestone for the first time. We achieved all this while improving our industry-leading profitability year-on-year to more than 5%.
We will continue to focus on customers and investing in high-growth segments, including workstations, gaming and thin and light. We are confident that this business will continue to survive at a premium to the market in volume, revenue and profit.
Our Mobile business reached an important milestone last quarter as operational PTI of the Motorola brand become profitable at USD 2 million, reaching breakeven.
This past quarter, we continued to execute our focus strategy. We reduced the operating expense by USD 175 million year-on-year, on track to control the full year expense to less than USD 1 billion.
Our investment in products and innovation showed clear results. Our Moto G and Moto E product lines gained market traction, and we are the first to launch a 5G-upgradable phone in the industry.
Our forecast on selected markets continued to deliver strong progress. In North America, shipment grew more than 50% year-on-year for the fifth consecutive quarters, and the market share reached almost 8%, ranking #4 by IDC.
In Latin America, we continued the top line growth and become #1 in Mexico, while maintaining solid overall #2 regionally. In China, revenue grew almost 85% year-on-year.
We will continue to execute the strategy to further improve the health of our smartphone business.
Our Data Center business is on track to become a sustainable growth and profit engine. Revenue continued a strong double-digit growth at almost [ 58% ] and profitability improved almost 10 points year-on-year. This performance was driven by yet another quarter of triple-digit year-on-year revenue growth in Software Defined Infrastructure and hyperscale. We are now the worldwide #4 in cloud infrastructure vendors and the fastest growing player among top vendors, according to IDC.
We will continue to invest in technology leadership and strengthen our capabilities in software-defined storage and networking.
Our multibillion dollar partnership with NetApp, announced in September, significantly expanded our storage and the data management market coverage. In addition, we will continue to refine our hyperscale business model, strengthen our leadership in high-performance computing and AI and drive service revenue growth.
In our annual flagship events, TechWorld and Transform, last quarter, we clarified Lenovo's mission to become the leader and an enabler of intelligent transformation and showcased how we were driving these transformation through Smart IoT, smart infrastructure and smart vertical solutions. We also displayed our Lenovo smart essential, smart home products at the events, including the smart plug, smart bulb, smart camera and smart door lock after successful launch of Smart Display under the Mirage AR VR series last quarter.
Also, device-as-a-service continued its rapid growth, with booking revenue up 1.5x quarter-to-quarter. Big data and AI-powered smart vertical solution revenue, was also up 44% year-on-year. In addition, overall service and software revenue reached USD 688 million.
Strong execution is one of Lenovo's key capabilities. With a clear mission and transformation strategy, it is now reflected by the strong momentum we have today. I'm confident that we are in a period of robust sustainable growth and we will continue to drive even stronger results.
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",710
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2825.0,1758867.0,68869736.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I'll take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q2 fiscal year 2019.
Next chart, please. Let me first share with you the financial highlights of our Q2 performance.
Our transformation actions continued to show accelerated improvement in Q2. Our revenue grew 14% year-on-year and grew 18% year-on-year if currency impact is excluded. This is the highest quarterly revenue in nearly 4 years, led by strong performance from both PCSD and DCG.
Operating expenses decreased by 1% to $1.5 billion, and the expense-to-revenue ratio improved by 1.8 percentage points year-on-year to 11.2%, mainly due to our revenue growth and expense savings in MBG.
Group PTI was $213 million, up $178 million from $35 million a year ago. Our PTI has shown consistent Y-to-Y improvement for 4 consecutive quarters, thanks to our PCSD improved industry-leading margin of 5% as well as better profitability performance by both MBG and DCG.
Profit attributable to equity holders for Q2 was $168 million, up 21% from a year ago. The small improvement compared to PTI was mainly due to a $180 million tax credit recorded in Q2 last year.
Basic earnings per share for the quarter was USD 0.0141 compared to USD 0.0126 same period last year. The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.06, representing the same level of interim dividend paid last year.
Next chart, please. Our operational cash flow continued to improve. Q1 versus Q2 cash performance was affected by payments [ made ] between quarters. If excluding this timing difference, Q2 cash flow will show Q-to-Q and year-to-year improvement. On half year basis, our operational cash flow for first half fiscal year '19 showed strong expansion over second half fiscal '18 and first half fiscal '18. We will continue to use our cash resources to invest in growth businesses.
Next chart, please. In the beginning of this fiscal year, we combined PCSD and MBG into Intelligent Device business group or IDG. Through its first 2 quarters, IDG has benefited from synergies of the shared platform and infrastructure, which helped to expand ecosystem. This enabled us to achieve healthy revenue growth, with profit improvement both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Revenue growth remains strong at around 10%, driven by our strong PC business.
The PTI improved year-on-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by PCSD business. And both revenue growth and profitability improved to 5%, while MBG achieved its operational breakeven outside of China and Motorola, globally. Next chart, please.
Our PCSD business achieved record-high revenue and, for the first time, surpassed $10 billion in the quarter, with 18% year-on-year growth. This is the third consecutive quarter that we achieved double-digit growth. Besides the strong growth from the commercial business, it's also attributable to the fast-growing premium segments, including gaming, workstation, thin and light and visual products. All of them achieved double-digit revenue growth in quarter 2.
The [ group's intelligent transformation ] saw solid progress in building capabilities in Smart IoT, smart infrastructure and smart vertical solution in Q2. We showcased the smart essential products at our TechWorld event in September to demonstrate our innovative capabilities.
Our Device as a Service business continued rapid growth, with booking revenue up 1.5x quarter-on-quarter. Our big data and AI-powered smart vertical solution revenue also grew 44% year-on-year during the quarter.
Meanwhile, our services and software revenue has surpassed 5% level of the growth revenue.
PCSD revenue in Q2 was $10.2 billion, pretax income was [ $515 ] million, PTI margin improved 0.7 percentage point to 5% level. Our PTI margin improvement was driven by improved product mix in high-growth premium segments and increase of service attach rates. Next chart, please.
For the Mobile business. We achieved an important milestone at the business in market outside of China and Motorola, globally, became profitable operationally in quarter 2. The profitability improvement was the result of a continued strong momentum in North America, solid business performance in Latin America and well-executed expense reduction. Reported PTI margin was thus improved 4.8 percentage point year-on-year and 2.8 percentage point quarter-on-quarter.
Our strategic focus on core markets resulted in short-term revenue decline. However, we believe we have stabilized the business and built a solid foundation for sustainable future growth. Next chart, please.
Our Data Center Group is on track to become a sustainable growth engine for Lenovo. Q2 revenue continues doubled-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter, while PTI margin continued to improve year-on-year. Modules saw high double-digit revenue growth.
In North America, we continued to maintain triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and all other geos also achieved double-digit growth.
In terms of products and performance, we have become the worldwide #4 cloud infrastructure vendor and the fastest-growing supplier in the industry. Our hyperscale segment maintained its strong triple-digit revenue growth, with margin improvement year-on-year, thanks to the continued optimization of our in-house design and manufacturing business model, while diversifying our customer base.
Our Software Defined Infrastructure achieved triple-digit revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Flash Arrays growth also grew at a triple-digit rate, which is more than double the market rate.
Revenue from our Data Center business was up 58% year-on-year to $1.5 billion in quarter 2. Our PTI margin improved significantly by 9.5 percentage point year-on-year in the quarter. Next chart, please.
Looking ahead, we'll continue our track record to deliver profitable growth, building on the strong results of the last few quarters. As Yuanqing mentioned, we have entered a phase of acceleration in both business performance and transformation strategy execution.
We aim to drive premium to market revenue growth and deliver industry-leading profitability for PCSD business. We'll continue to improve the user experience with our innovative products and drive future growth.
Our investment and capability building in the smart devices and Smart IoT are gaining traction to become a future growth driver.
For Mobile business, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve sustainable profitability. This include reducing capacity, streamlining our product portfolio and driving a more competitive cost structure.
Meanwhile, we will focus on driving profitable growth from core markets, including Latin America and North America, and strengthening our presence in mature markets. We will also continue our investment in innovation, such as our 5G-upgradable phone, which will soon be available in the U.S. market.
For the Data Center business, we are confident we will deliver sustainable profitable growth over time. We have established a strong foundation through our organization structure, product portfolio and sales force to drive long-term growth.
We aim to continue to outgrow the market in every segment where we participate, from IoT, to telecom, to Software Defined Infrastructure.
Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen our leadership position in high-performance computing and AI, and we expect growth momentum in our hyperscale business to continue, thanks to unique in-house design and ODM plus manufacturing business model.
With respect to accelerating growth in storage and data management, the NetApp strategic partnership and JV will enable us to increase coverage from [ 15% ] to over 90% of the storage market. We will accelerate our intelligent transformation in driving long-term growth across all our businesses. We will focus on converging different technologies and devices, thereby address more market opportunities and drive our Smart IoT plus cloud business to the next level.
Coupled with a competitive cost structure and strong execution, we remain confident in delivering long-term profitable growth.

Great progress so far, pretty strong growth across the categories. Could you also talk a little bit, now that we are very close to reaching breakeven point, could you talk a little bit about the path forward? If you look at your larger competitor in the U.S., they have probably 2 to 3x size of revenues, but they make about 10% operating margin. If you think about longer-term server profitability as well as size of the business that you're comfortable with, could you talk about what are the next targets for the data center BPO for the next couple of years? And I had a follow-up.",116

This is Kirk speaking. So, thank you for the question. I think our short-term goals are to continue to grow at nearly double the market. Our short-term goal is to grow at nearly double the market across not just hyperscale, but in software-defined and in Flash Arrays. So I think we're seeing that consistently, that we're not seeing just one part of our business grow, that's why we had shared in our guidance more than 100% growth in Flash Arrays. That's even before our NetApp joint venture as well as in software-defined and in hyperscale. So I think we're seeing quite good balanced growth. I think, the other thing that should be exciting to investors is that we've now had 7 consecutive quarters of our services business deferred revenue growth growing year-to-year. So this is helping our balance sheet as well in, obviously, one of the most profitable parts of our business as we've increased our professional services and our premier services around the world. And then, of course, with the NetApp joint venture. Prior to the NetApp joint venture, we were still growing at 2x the market, but we're only participating in the entry space, in about 15% of the market. After the NetApp joint venture, we'll be able to -- we're participating now in more than 90% of the storage and data management market in more than 160 countries. And those products, as we mentioned at our TechWorld and Transform are already shipping into the market, and we're seeing strong demand from our customer base on that. So that's something we're quite excited about. I think our immediate goal is to continue to improve profitability every single quarter. And we're -- we remain confident for as long as we can see in the future that we'll be outpacing the market. Okay?",305

Maybe a follow-up question on that part. Could you talk a little bit about what you're observing from a demand perspective between the data center market, both for hyperscale as well as for enterprise? It seems like enterprise could see some turning point in terms of the peak of the cycle approaching. Would you agree with that classification? And what would you be focusing on when you think about going into the next year or so, given that the last 12 months have been extremely strong growth for the overall market as well?",94

Our growth strategy will remain to do that, but also to grow into the Tier 2 and Tier 3. So we're building out a more aggressive sales force to cover the Tier 2 and Tier 3 hyperscalers, and we're seeing strong demand there, as well as using our supply chain, our own motherboard development to improve the profitability of hyperscale. We're also seeing hyperscale and the public cloud not just the single-socket or 2-socket systems, but we're seeing demand as more enterprise workloads go into the public cloud to deliver 4-socket and 8-socket machines as well that's improving the profitability as well as GPU-based and FPGA-based design that are also more margin-rich. So that's the hyperscale answer. In software-defined, we have announced several new collaborations this year. We have an exclusive relationship with Cloudistics around [ composable ] cloud. I think we remain the fastest-growing OEM, and we're also seeing strong demand on both vSAN and Azure Stack. So across pretty much every part of software-defined, we're a little bit more public this time in saying it's not just 7 consecutive quarters of 100% growth, but now we're growing at over 150% in software-defined. So we also have a relationship with [ m three ] we had the city Bogota, Colombia and sold 3,000 video surveillance cameras for public safety. And we had them at our Transform events, and we've done edge computing and scale computing as well. If you look at the investments we said at Transform, there's 3 things that we'll continue to be on track for. Number one, building out a whole set of edge servers and edge gateways to compete in the rapidly growing edge space. Number two, moving into network function virtualization, we had both China Mobile and China Telecom in our booth at Mobile World Congress, so we're getting aggressive pull for our network optimization as part of the 5G buildout. And then third, is starting to move into as-a-service offering. So we've been doing this on the PC side, but we're on track to launch as-a-service offering in a significant way in the data center side as well by the end of our fiscal year. So those are all incremental growth areas in edge, IoT, telecom and network function virtualization and as-a-service.",410

Can you walk us through some of the different components, such as, number one, the component shortage in paper supply? And also, the second thing is investor are pretty concerned about the China consumption, its impact. And the third one is can you continue to gain share from the Tier 2 players?

So definitely, I believe this strong growth and [ will go well ] will be [ possible ] . So we -- over the past couple of years, we have built a solid foundation for all 3 core businesses. So I know we [ set a wider strategy for each of that part ] . For Mobile business, first, definitely we are focusing on our product. So we adopted a product strategy. We focused on selected markets, we focused on the management of product. We focused on cutting the expense. So that strategy has been very sustainable, so you will see the significant improvement on the profitability in our Mobile business. So, actually, if you only consider [ Motorola ] business or rest of the -- outside of China business, so actually for the first time, we believe the positive $2 million PTI in probably in many years, probably 10 years. So we are very confident, and now we can [ compute a little expense below $1 billion a year ] . So that's Mobile business. We will continuously improve the profitability. So probably, Gian could articulate more on that. So meanwhile, we have seen the positive growth in Latin America, in North America, in China as well. So that's the first one. Definitely -- so basically, we want -- this business will be our growth engine to really deliver the strong growth. So we -- and also, with a higher scale and bigger volume. Now we are approaching to the breakeven so -- as well. So we are very confident that we can further improve the profitability over time. Definitely, PC is our -- certainly our core business, so -- but this is not just our profit engine. So, actually, we leverage in the consolidation of the industry to further grow the business. So you can see the entire PCSD we grow by 18%. So if you only compute the PC, we grow even higher today, definitely. So we have a much stronger foundation in all 3 core businesses today. Meanwhile, we have very clear strategy. So we clarified that at our TechWorld and the Transform event. So we understand IoT is a trend, called the computing -- edge computing is the trend, and the artificial intelligence are the trend. [  Unfortunately ] , with the Lenovo's business, with our strategy, we have to create all these trends. So our IDG, Intelligence Device Group, we address the smart IoT trend, for sure. So not only we will keep our leadership in the PC and the smartphone, we will develop more opportunity in the Smart IoT area. And also our DCG, we are -- smart infrastructure or cloud computing, edge computing trend. So meanwhile, we are trying to address the smart vertical in manufacturing, in health care, in retail, in education. So we are driving the solution, driving the service. So we have seen some growth in this area as well. So I'm just trying to give you an overview of Lenovo. So with this vision and strategy, definitely, I believe we can sustain our growth in both revenue and profit. So, Gianfranco, you want to talk about the -- some more on PC? Speaking of IoT?",559
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2825.0,1758867.0,68869748.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,14,"On PC, it's true, there is some -- we are facing some shortage, as you said. It's also already true last quarter, it's still true this quarter, and probably even Q1 calendar next year. One thing in that situation, usually, if you have a big scale, you can manage the shortage and the issue much better than if you have a smaller scale. Not only, but I think we have also been able to move demand from one CPU supplier to another CPU supplier. So that -- we don't have any problem in terms of shortage. We are aiming to grow the [ shelf ] , and I think we did that. So I think that we will continue to manage the shortage for the next -- for this quarter and next quarter. And we'll continue to see good opportunity to show and to report a double-digit growth in terms of revenue moving forward. One good thing when you look at the market is that PC, in terms of unit, is declining, but in terms of revenue, we grow. And it's growing including China, even China in terms of growing -- revenue, market is growing. It's declining in terms of unit, but it's growing in terms of revenue. And I think we will continue to see that upgrade to Windows 10 for the entire next year, including China. So I'm not so worried about the consumption in China, honestly. When I look at the consumption in China, from revenue point of view, the market is growing. And transition to Windows 10 is happening like in the other geo. And we will continue to gain share, as I said. In this difficult environment from supply point of view, we will continue to gain share from second year, no doubt. But I think we are still very, very positive on the outlook of PC. We are also investing on new area that where we see big growth, like workstation, gaming, thin and light. We have seen growth in the range of 25% to 35%, depending on the different segments. And then as Yuanqing said, that this is not big in terms of revenue yet, but it is big for the future. We are investing on IoT, particularly when we look at the commercial IoT on retail and manufacturing and AR/VR in terms of maintenance, education and health care. Not just in terms of device, it's device, platform, salaries and the entire system integration. Then I give to Sergio on MBG.",418

Laura, it's Wai Ming. Well, I think we definitely see, I think, significant fluctuation of currency, I think, in countries or in regions like Latin America in particular. You see the Argentina, Brazil. But I think there are 2 things that we're actually doing well on a consistent basis. Again, that is the reason why you don't see that there are significant, I think, decline in profitability. I think one is, I think, we actually had a very, I think, diligent hedging policy. It's really protecting, I think, the business going forward, especially in -- I think, we will do hedging unless the hedging cost is too high, therefore, business will do hedging. For those country that we do not do hedging, we obviously have a much more frequent repricing of our products, really looking at, I think, taking in the -- I think if you're operating in a depreciating currency country, obviously, your costs will go up and, therefore, your -- in order to maintain the margin, I think you need to reprice to the extent that it does not damage the market. At the same time, we also look at, I think, in running the business, and in fact, our smartphone colleagues in Latin America demonstrate that I think really looking at the entire profitability business on one hand that continue to do repricing to mitigate as well as looking at the expenses. So I think running a global company where we actually don't have one geography account for 60% to 70% of our business, I think it's such a diversified. We'll have a very, very tight discipline as really, I think, dealing with the fluctuation in foreign currency. So that's really demonstrated the result that we've demonstrated that we've actually been executing very, very well.",299

So [indiscernible] we expect in terms of higher network attach, higher storage attach, higher services attach and higher configurations per server are all on track to help improve profitability over time.",105

This pertains to the Data Center business and kind of the tariffs that you're seeing. From our understanding, there appears to be some impact on certain motherboards that are sitting and residing within servers. How are you and your suppliers kind of adjusting for this impact? And the second question is, because of these tariffs, is there any direct impact to the business with orders being pulling in or deployments in your data centers being pushed out?",94

This is Kirk. I think one of the advantages of Lenovo is we're now ranked #5 in tech across our supply chain, and Gartner has us ranked [ #26 ] of all companies worldwide. So our supply chain, I think, is world-class in helping us earn business. I think other players have had more difficulty handling these issues than Lenovo has. We have factories in United States, Mexico, China, Brazil, Hungary and India. So we're able to very aggressively move things to meet the customer demand and are helping customers through this transition. So I think we've actually gained share through this transition by helping customers manage through the tariff impact. But we've seen relatively little impact to our business, and obviously, our profitability continued to improve. So I think, if anything, we think this is a benefit to Lenovo versus our competition.",144

So by the way, so, if you look into our detailed performance, so you can find, actually, our North American business grew pretty strong. So actually, we grew all 3 businesses strongly in North America. So PC, we grew by 25%. Probably, we are the fastest-growing player in the market. Mobile business, as I said before, so we grew 15% year-on-year by volume for 5 consecutive quarters already. And also, DCG business saw almost triple digits, right?",78

Looking through the slides, I think on the outlook slide, there is some talk about launching hardware as a service for the DCG business? Can you give us a little bit more color kind of what's strategy and thought process behind this?",43

So I think what our customers are saying is that the current offering in the data center market are almost glorified leasing models. Lenovo developed IT to do a group OpEx metering service where you'll only pay for what you use. That includes dynamic [ read ] models for going up and down on your capacity. And we are on track to the commitments we made at TechWorld to launch these as-a-service offerings across our server storage products by the end of our fiscal year. And you'll see those announcements soon. And we're already seeing strong demand from the market for that kind of capability. So this is much more than what our -- what we think we're hearing from the market is basically just glorified leasing models because we'll be able to meter up and meter down on demand.,141
