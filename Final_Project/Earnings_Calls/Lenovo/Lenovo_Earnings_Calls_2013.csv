Happy new year to all of you. Lenovo had another record-setting quarter. I cannot wait to share our fantastic results with you. 
Last quarter, we achieved a record volume, record revenue and record profit. Let's start with our traditional PC business. Our PC sales volume grow almost 16 points ahead of the overall market. Our global market share reached another historical high, 15.9% with more than 14 million units shipped. Now, we have grown faster than the market for 15 straight quarters and have been the fastest-growing major PC company for 13 straight quarters. Our strong growth comes with record profitability. Our pretax income ratio reached 2.6%. That's 0.3% points better year-on-year, and our earnings increased by more than 33% year-on-year to reach USD 205 million. 
Record profits with record market share, this demonstrates that we have a very healthy business driving balance the growth worldwide. We did this by outgrowing the market in all customer and product segments, as well as geographies. 
EMEA, we outgrew the market by 36 points with strong performance across all parts of our business. We also steadily improved profitability in our consumer business while increasing its mix in overall revenue. In early 2009, we were #7 with less than 4% of the market share. But now, we reached the #2 in PCs with our record market share of more than 11%. It is even more impressive considering the challenging economic environment in the region. 
In our Asia Pacific, Latin American geo, we grew 13 points faster than the market. And then we improved profitability year-on-year. North America, outgrew the market by 18 points. In the U.S., we had a record share of 8.6% and continue to have a strong, profitable commercial business. 
In consumer, not only did we continue our strong growth, but we also saw initial success in the premier space. Our Yoga and the Twist now almost 30% of $700-and-above Windows 8 retail market. Even more impressively, we have 49% retail market share of Windows 8 device sales that were priced over USD $900. 
In China, our PC business remains strong even in our slower market, and we protected our profit pool perfectly to fuel our growth in other areas. We once again increased our market share and further improved our already healthy profitability by another 0.3% points year-on-year. Clearly, our PC business is healthy and will continue to get stronger. More importantly, beyond the PC, we have built a strong foundation for our PC Plus businesses, which is growing even faster. Our PC Plus growth starts with our strong performance in phones. Total phone sales grew more than 50% year-on-year to reach 9.4 million units of which, smartphone growth was even more impressive. In China, our smartphone business actually doubled year-on-year. 
Outside of China, we had a strong early response in Russia, India, Indonesia and other new markets. Globally, we sold over 9 million smartphones last quarter. Best of all, for the first time, we were profitable in smartphone sales globally. This is another milestone. At the same time, our worldwide tablet business not only grow almost 80% year-on-year to reach almost the 800,000 units, but also was profitable. Overall, our Mobile Internet Digital Home businesses now accounts for 11% of Lenovo's overall revenue. While we are still focusing on growing our MIDH business worldwide, we are now driving profitable growth in China. 
Today, according to IDC, in overall smart connectivity devices including PC, smartphone and tablet, Lenovo ranks #3 worldwide behind only Apple and Samsung. But definitely, we are not satisfied, and we'll continue our march to the top. 
Our strong growth, record profitability and rapid expansion as a PC+ company, all have been guided by our Protect and Attack strategy. There are 4 critical elements to our success in all these areas. The right strategy, efficient business model, Innovative products and our diverse team and the global culture. Combined with our world-class execution, we have delivered excellent results in various market conditions. In fact, we've reached the important milestone this quarter. Our Attack business now accounts for 50% of our total revenue. Now, our strategy, we have continued to guide us as we reorganized to aim for even stronger future growth. 
Given our record performance, you may ask why we are reorganizing now. When we established our current structure, we were much smaller and had only one business outside of China, which was our commercial PC business. Today, we are much more diverse business. In addition to commercial PCs, we have a strong global consumer business and have a fast-growing MIDH business as well as servers and storage. These businesses require different business models. The transactional business is more about speed and efficiency while relationship focuses more on quality and the customerization. So we are creating 2 end-to-end business groups to enhance each business model, Lenovo Business Group and the Think Business Group. The new structure will significantly improve our product development cycle, time-to-market, marketing campaign as well as day-to-day operations. 
Also, we want to expand our presence in the premier space. Our legendary single brand already has a strong position in commercial, and we believe we can extend to that into consumer as well. So the new end-to-end organization, we want to further leverage our innovation excellence to lead in both commercial and the consumer premium space. Our innovative products have long been a critical part of our success. Innovation enabled us to break through in the premier market in North America, a market we were never able to enter in the past. 
With our best-selling Yoga and the Twist, we did not reach this point by accident. We have dedicated years of hard work to innovation. At CES in 2010, we broke new ground with the IdeaPad U1, the early idea of our convertible PC. Last year, with the successful launch of Yoga, we formally showcased our fully developed concept of convertibles. Our best-selling products now are the outcome of continuous enhancement through the years. In the last couple of years, we build our own smartphone and tablet businesses from scratch. In fact, the groundwork of our Mobile Internet research and technology began 6 to 7 years ago. We have not reached here by following others' footsteps. And at this year's Consumer Electronic Show, our award-winning Horizon table PC is the latest convincing examples. We created a new product category and even more, it helped build the image of Lenovo as the global innovation leader. Also at CES, with our other newest products like the K900 smartphone and the Helix convertible PC, we owned a record 15 major awards, by far the biggest winner at the CES. It is more evident than ever that the Lenovo's innovative image is more and more recognized globally. Innovation is in our DNA, and we will continue to drive our growth in PCs and the PC Plus products. 
Looking ahead, we are committed to the PC industry and definitely are in a stronger position than other competitors. While we are on course to become the worldwide PC leader, we will continue to focus on improving profitability. 
Last quarter, I committed that our goal is to improve our PTI margin by 1 point over 3 years. And now, I still stand firm to that commitment. At the same time, we will continue to focus and to grow faster in all smart connected devices. We believe this will yield healthy returns for our investors in the long term. 
Thank you, everybody. I'd now turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1261
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2013",2013-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3426.0,407202.0,19225409.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. Hello, everyone. This is Wai Ming. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 3. Next chart, please. 
We continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion even when the global PC market declined in quarter 3. We have delivered 13 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Our balanced performance has been driven by our successful execution of our Protect and Attack strategy. I think the strong performance of our Mobile Internet business is a significant strength that we believe will help us drive sustainable growth even in challenging market conditions. 
Our PC shipments in quarter 3 were up 8%, and PC sales were up 7% year-on-year to $8 billion. Our strong performance in Mobile Internet business, especially smartphone, have continued more to the group's strong revenue growth. Sales in our Mobile Internet business were up 77%, year-on-year to $998 million. Sales of other goods and services were $393 million. 
Group sales grew 12% year-on-year to approximately, $9.4 billion. Gross profit was about $1.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Gross profit margin improved by 0.4 points to 11.8% year-on-year primarily due to scaling benefits, but dipped slightly from 12.1% in quarter 2 mostly due to increased mix of the consumer business. 
Operating expenses including our continued investment in R&D and branding increased 13% year-on-year to $838  million to support our growth. Our E-to-R ratio was relatively stable year-on-year at 9.2%, but down from 9.7% in last quarter due to our continuing efforts in efficiency improvement. 
Operating profit was $243 million, up 26% year-on-year. Pretax income was $246 million, up 28% year-on-year. This is a record high level for the group. PTI margin was 2.6%, up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Effective tax rate for quarter 3 was slightly below 20%, as a result all better margin. Profit attributable to equity holders is $205 million, up 34% year-on-year. Net margin was 2.2%, an improvement of over 15% quarter-on-quarter and 20% year-on-year. Basic EPS improved to USD 0.0199 representing a 33% increase from USD 0.015 last year. 
Next chart, please. Our balance sheet in quarter 3 remains strong. Noncurrent assets were about $4.3 billion, slightly higher compared to the level at 30 of September 2012. Changes in current assets and current liabilities were largely due to increased activities during the quarter. Increase in the inventory level is due to the preparation for the Chinese New Year holiday sales, expansion into emerging markets, as well as increasing component inventory due to pricing benefit and more in-house inventory. 
We had net current assets of around $349 million at the end of December. The noncurrent liability were around $2.1 billion. 
Now, let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. Our cash flow continued to be healthy in quarter 3. As a result, our bank deposit and cash level was higher compared to last year and last quarter. Our net cash reserve was strong at $4.2 billion compared to last year and last quarter. We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Inventory days were 20, up 3 days again last year and 1 day compared to last quarter. Receivable days were 36, up 2 days and 3 days compared to last year and last quarter as well. Both increases are driven by our expansion in consumer business. 
Payable days were 61 days in quarter 3, flat quarter-on-quarter. The decline of 7 days compared to last year was, again, due to our expansion in the consumer business. We expect it to be -- remain stable. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 3 was a negative 5 days, again, negative 17 days last year and negative 9 days last quarter. The change was driven by our strategic business decision in the emerging markets and consumer business, including MIDH, together with our hybrid strategy of increasing our mix of in-house manufacturing to enhance end-to-end efficiency and product time-to-market. Nevertheless, the group cash position remains at a very strong level to drive future growth. 
Next chart, please. The group has record high shipments and market share in quarter 3, even as the China PC market slow down, and we also see strong performance across the board relative to the markets. We continued to perform well in China in both PC and Mobile Internet business. Despite the negative growth in China PC market, we recorded a 17% growth revenue year-on-year to about $4.1 billion in China. Our PC sales increased around 6% year-on-year to about $3.2 billion driven by our strong growth in emerging cities and the goal organization. We achieved record higher market share in quarter 3, and our market share is even bigger than the total of the next 4 players. 
China PC operating profit increased to $200 million, also a record high level for us, while our margin further improved to 6.3% year-on-year. 
Our Mobile Internet business in China continued to show strong growth and provided a strong support for our continuing high growth in China in quarter 3. Sales increased by 83% to $895 million, which accounts for 22% of the China total sales revenue in quarter 3. MIDH profitability also saw continuous improvement in quarter 3 particular, with the help of our strong China's smartphone business, which turned profitable for the first time in this quarter. We will continue to invest in the PC+ area to drive our future growth. 
APLA. Sales were down 1.6% year-on-year at about $1.7 billion in APLA despite our shipment growth against the declining PC market in the region. Operating profit improved slightly against the loss recorded last year, but it dropped quarter-to-quarter. Latin America and Brazil where the markets account for the majority of the loss in this quarter. We expect our new manufacturing hub and the acquisition of CCE in Brazil that we closed at the beginning of this January will help accelerate our expansion in the country and therefore, contribute to the further development of the region's profitability over time.
EMEA. We had a very encouraging quarter in EMEA as sales grew 17% year-on-year to about $2.3 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets in the region like Eastern and Southern Europe, Middle East and Africa, as well as consumer business, contributed to the strong growth in the region. In Quarter 3, we maintained #1 positions in Russia and Germany. We achieved record high market share in Western Europe at 11.3% and became the #2 PC player for the first time. 
Operating margin remained stable both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter at 2%. Our Attack in the consumer business in the region continued to gain traction that resulted in share gain. Our consumers in EMEA continued to be profitable with improved margin in quarter 3 from better scaling. We will continue to attack in the consumer business and expect it to provide additional support to our margin improvement over time.
North America. We continued to achieve strong growth premium against the market decline in the region with record share in the U.S. in North America. Sales grew 8% year-on-year to about $1.3 billion. We had a successful drive in our consumer business especially with the high-end Window 8 products like Yoga, leveraging the Christmas holiday season to build a solid foundation for future growth. This is a first time that are premium-priced consumer product has broken into the main retail chain in the U.S.. The increased mix of our consumer business at the of [indiscernible] of scale led to a decline in the operating profit from $38 million last year to $34 million this year. 
Next chart, please. We have a more balanced product portfolio helped by our expansion in consumer PC and Mobile Internet business. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 9% and 8% year-on-year respectively. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 6% and 1% year-on-year, respectively. 
Our MIDH business continued to show strong performance, up 77% year-on-year in sales, led by the smartphone business, which fueled the strong growth of our group. Our smartphone business has become profitable, and we have also started to expand into 7 countries in emerging markets. 
Our tablet business also showed strong growth in quarter 3. We will continue to invest in innovation and broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitiveness and service to our customers. 
Next chart, please. I want to take this opportunity to report the stages of our recent corporate transactions. In this chart, we have included highlights of the deals and their progress for your reference and how they fit into our existing strategy. The integration of all of these transactions is well on track. We expect this transactions will help provide a steady contribution to the company alongside our organic engines. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite uncertainties in the global economy impacting the PC market growth in short term, we remain confident that we can continue to outperform the worldwide PC market and to improve our operating margin. While our core PC business is performing well, our Mobile Internet business, especially our smartphone business in China, has also started contributing to the group work in sales and improving profitability. We have also began to invest our smartphone businesses in 7 countries in emerging markets. This balanced performance is a significant strength that will help us drive sustainable growth even in challenging market conditions. We will stay focused in our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunities. We'll continue to invest in core competence building and product innovation to drive sustainable future growth. 
These investment, however, will cause the expense-to-revenue ratio to increase in the short term especially during quarter 4, which is a typical low season for us, and the ratio will be higher, sequentially, compared to quarter 3. We have a healthy balance sheet, and we will continue to look for M&A opportunities in areas that can help us to accelerate our growth.
Now thank you very much. We will take your question now.",1669

Our MIDH business has we performed really well including our smartphone business and the tablet business, both. So we shipped a total 9.4 million, from the amount that 9 million are smartphones. So we doubled our volume in China. So our launch in other emerging markets like Russia, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam have been -- so we have seen the first, indiscernible] so we have reported what the response are to our smartphones. So we are -- so regarding our tablet, so last quarter, we grow by almost 80% year-on-year. We've shipped almost 800,000 units of the tablet. So we are definitely confident that we will continue to have the high growth in both smartphones and in tablets. So we believe we have a very, very strong product portfolio. So much of it is in China, so but also for the rest of the world. So that's -- our MIDH mix in our product revenue will continue to grow.",161

I think it's very difficult to give a specific guideline of this sort of mix. I think MIDH has the mix of our PC business because I think we are very sure that we will, I think have a wonderful growth in our smartphone business. But that is the mix, I think, you have a problem as to how the PC growth is going to be. So I can tell you that MIDH is, I think, if you're really looking at, I think, quarter 3, I think, we have overall growth of revenue of about 12% of which I think the -- a lot of growth coming out of MIDH. And going forward, we will continue to see I think MIDH as a standalone, a very, very high rate of growth, but as a mix of our business, it all depends on how quickly I think the PC recovery and invests. So there's too many variables, but I can assure you I think from our perspective that, we are very, very positive, I think, of us getting into the PC Plus expanding our revenue and obviously, the MIDH. Not only smartphone, but also tablet will continue to be a driver, I think, for a very, I think, a very reasonable growth in our top line as well as our bottom line.",228

We made money from tablets. We lost the money in Smart TV. So over time so we are very confident that we will have a profitable growth by -- in China's smartphone market. But definitely, we will continue to invest in the rest of the world for our smartphone business. So tablets, so I hope that we can have a profitable growth. But it depends on the competition. It depends on how they will be aggressive to -- again this year. So I cannot give you the reference on tablet now, yes.",111

My first question is, also on MIDH. I'm just wondering, for the company to set targets to improve the PTI margin by 1% in 3 years, does that may imply that MIDH could also improve by the same level or actually, even higher level? Actually, the question is coming from an angle that like, how much do you think the operating margin of MIDH could really become? Could it reach the corporate average or could it even reach the China margin? What's the more reasonable target?",92

So why are I'm very confident? So over years, so over 3 years, we can improve our PTI margin, our net profit margin. So first thing, we will improve our margin in the PC. So that's the most important part because the PC still comes out to 90% of our -- of our -- almost 90% of our total business. So we, with the scale we have built, with the market share we have built in the emerging market as well as in consumer business, so we are very confident that we can further improve the -- much of the gross margin, but also the net profit so -- of the PC. So definitely -- so for MIDH business, so we wish we could have the at least the similar GP margin that we have in the PC area not just in China, but also the rest of the world.",151

But at the same time, we are very mindful that I think the existing, I think, profit generator, I think, in this case maybe PC, maybe the China smartphone have profitable growth. So we actually think a balance yield on one hand, assuming we will manage the growth so we will continue improve the overall growth profitability by 1%, but in terms of specific area, we obviously, will have different consideration as to which area we should go aggressive, but nevertheless, the end of it, I think, we will have, I think, improve the growth net margin by 1%, I think, over the period.",181

But firstly, brand -- the first thing is brand. So we will further invest on the branding part, so that we can leverage our brand awareness and the brand reputation and to improve the margin worldwide. So our current strong momentum, our position in the PC industry, we are definitely have to promote -- for the promote of the brand part. So that's one point. Another point is we are further invest on the innovation, on the product. So that will definitely give us an advantage to improve the -- to improve margin size. So we are very encouraged by our recent sales in North America, particularly in U.S. retail market. So with the Yoga and the Twist, so now we have 30% market share in the $700-and-above Windows 8 specifically. We have 49% market share in the $900-and-above retail market, Windows 8 brands. So that has never happened before. So in the past, that we could only sell, what, $299, $399 products in Best Buy and other retailers, but now, in those high-end product category. So we -- not only we can have the presence, but also we can have the high share. So that's where we are coming, definitely those categories are much better than the low end.",231

I think my impression was usually in the past, you grow like 5% to 10% faster than the market. But in the December quarter, I think China market probably only flat to up slightly, but you grew 17%. So should we review the way how you grow the -- I mean, should be review how the way we model the growth for you in China because this is almost impossible. You already have a dominant share, but still, your growth was amazing there. So what's your view about the demand and growth in market overall and yourself?",103

So the 36.7%, almost with 37% market share in China, it's that high of market share. So you can not always expect us to outgrown the market significantly. So I think it would very -- to grow with the market, so it's actually our target for our China team. So otherwise, we will build more resources, or we have to sacrifice more profit to get more market share. So that's not a good return. That would be not a good return. So -- but you still can expect on -- over our China market growth. So actually, we separate China by China mature market and the China emerging markets. So in the lower [indiscernible] so we think the penetration levels are still very low. We still have a lot of opportunity to grow in those areas, but definitely the mature market is just like the U.S., the Western Europe. So that's regarding of the PC. But they're definitely there for Lenovo China, we -- our strategy is different there -- is different from the rest of the world. So not only we want them to protect the PC division, we also want them to be more aggressive to attack the PC platform opportunity, so which are of obviously, smartphones and the tablet and the server area. So if you had our overall growth rate last quarter in China, so it's not slower. So actually, our combined growth rate was 17%. You combine the PC and MIDH, the solo business. So we still -- the 17% year-on-year growth rate is not slow.",270

I think, Arthur, just to make sure you understand the numbers correctly, I think, from a PC perspective, I think, we are growing 6% revenue and the 17% is really from the tremendous amount of work from MIDH. We've been growing about 83% year-to-year. I think that is really the -- I think, the key driver of a slow growth PC environment. I think while we are pursuing the PC Plus strategy, that will still give us a very handsome, I think, high teens sort of year-on-year growth. But one thing that I think I just really want to focus back on the sort of overall profitability of the growth I think China, the PC, we definitely will take all the opportunities available to us I think to do more business in a profitable way. But again, while you understand our Protect and Attack strategy, our PC business in China is in the Protect area, we definitely would not, I think, give away profit just for increasing market share in the PC in China. But -- and therefore, what I want to summarize, 2 points, is one, I think that our PC Plus strategy successfully executed in China. I think while the PC area may be a slow growth, but we still have, I think, a very decent double-digit growth in revenue and the second point is on profitability. We definitely, on the PC point -- on the PC side, we will not, I think, give away profit just for the sake of getting increasing market share. We will maintain a very efficient and profitable PC business going forward.",270

So we will continue the -- our product strategy to leverage both in-house manufacturing and outsourcing strategy so we want to have the balance manufacturing. So but definitely,  we will not give up the in-house manufacturing. So because the not only that it will give us the motivation, but also it will serve to strengthen our innovation capability. So it will serve us to keep the connection with the upstream suppliers, component supplier, so that we can find more opportunity to innovate. So that's Lenovo's vertical integrated innovation model. So that's the -- from an in-house purpose, we keep the in-house manufacturing. Well actually, today, we'd -- most of our desktop business are in-house manufactured. So most of our smartphones are in-house manufactured. So the tablet -- in the notebook and the tablet, so probably, we have less than 50% in-house manufactured, so more than 50% out of house, to the third party. So we will want to keep both balanced. Your [indiscernible] 111 example, I think to demonstrate what Yuanqing just said, I think our in-house manufacturing obviously, the key to that is to improve our overall product innovation. I think one of our price-leading products is actually done in-house. You can actually see I think we take a balanced approach, rather than just taking one approach, I think different business models will have different benefits and going to the customers and we will continue to adapt that approach.",243

First of all, on the PC demand said, enterprise was quite weak through most of last year. I guess, how are you guys looking at the enterprise demand overall, talking to your customers. Especially given that XP is coming up early 2014, do we have any possibility of a refresh activity going into second half '13? And second question for Wai Ming. We have other income of about $20 million from the recognition of [indiscernible] concentration. Is this something that is a one-off, or given that there are further commitments to any NEC, EMC and Stoneware in the future, do you see this coming in pretty much every quarter over the next couple of years?",120

So the enterprise demand on IT product have been really weak, so that's kind of the situation, but I think with the macro economy recovers so and the enterprise customers still needed to buy PC, to replace their PC  and also the new technology like Windows 8, like Ultrabook or convertible PCs will drive the replacement, will drive the new demand. So this is my view, so I believe 2013 will be better than 2012.",87

I think that relates to the acquisition of Medion I think about a year ago. I think the original deal was, we were going to set certain I think financial targets and related to the business plan and subject to achieving that we will actually I think, buy the remaining shareholding of Medion by Gerd Brachmann. But since I think with the arrival of [indiscernible] our EMEAn leader, I think there is modification of our overall strategy in hitting EMEA. So there's an acceleration of I think acquiring the Medion shares. As a result of that, that actually gives us a savings of I think what we have to provide in accounts of around $20 million. We're actually aware of that we're already on. I think in the early October I think what we'll do is I think bearing in mind that I think what the onetime accounting benefit we actually going been aggressively, I think reinvesting that amount of money I think in [indiscernible] brand as Yuanqing  said earlier, I think we have a success in one of the most, I think, market-leading growth as Yoga. We actually spent, I think, more, again to really take advantage of that.

I think it will be too early for us, I think, to actually say what exactly are the financial targets, but we are very, very confident, I think, with the brand there, I think with the PC Plus business not only do they have PCs, they also have smartphone and also a little bit of TV. And Brazil, is I think on the verge of, I think, having significant global events like football as well as the Olympics. I think the solid foundation that we buy because it's actually a well-run company, have a relatively long track record proven to be successful. So we are very, very confident that we will, I think gradually be improving the overall performance, definitely applying the Lenovo formula, we definitely believe we can outgrow I think the market at the same time improve the overall  profitability, but trying to make a date or specific date or a period of specific financial target I think we probably need over more time, I think to go through to truly integrate. We'll begin to integrate, but we are really just about a month away off of the official acquisition of the company. So we probably will share with you more information maybe in the next quarter or maybe the quarter after.

So good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Even in a challenging economic and market environment, Lenovo had a strong fourth quarter to close another record of fiscal year. 
I'm excited to share our fantastic results with you and to discuss our strategy for the year ahead. 
Now let me start with our fourth quarter. We have now been the fastest-growing major PC company for 14 straight quarters. We delivered a strong performance in a difficult market. Lenovo was only the PC company to increase the volume year-on-year. We've reached our PC market share of over 15% -- 15.5%, gaining more than 2 points year-on-year. On the PC Plus side, our smartphone business in China, more than doubled in volume year-on-year, and we were profitable for the second straight quarter. We also rolled out the smartphones in over 6 markets and increased the tablet sales worldwide by 23% year-on-year. We also delivered a strong profitability. Our pretax income ratio grew almost 1 point year-on-year to more than 2% up, and our earnings increased 9% to 10% year-on-year to reach $127 million. 
Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to another record-setting year for Lenovo. For whole fiscal year, Lenovo outgrew the market by 18 points to reach our record PC volume of over 52 million units and our record PC market share of nearly 16%, up 2.6 points year-on-year. 
Our revenue reached an all-time high at almost USD 34 billion, up 15% year-on-year. More importantly, at the same time, we achieved a record profit with a record earnings of USD 675 million, up 34% year-on-year. Two quarters ago, I was committed to you to improve our profitability. We actually delivered that -- delivered it. What I'm most proud of is these record results came from balanced growth across all geographies, as well as product and the customer segments. 
In EMEA, despite a very challenging economic environment, we outgrew the PC market by more than 36 points, and gained 3 points this year year-on-year, and reached the double digit market share for the year for the first time. We jumped from #5 to #2 player in just 1 year. While growing rapidly, we still improve the segment operating profit for USD 147 million, up 77% year-on-year. This was thanks largely to our strong profit improvement in the consumer space. 
In Asia Pacific and Latin America, we outgrew the market by over 20 points, gaining more than 2 points of the share to over 11% for the year. At the same time, this geo started to contribute the profit to our company. 
In North America, we outgrew the market by 20 points to reach our all-time high, almost 9% market share for the fiscal year, while the segment operating profit improved for USD 168 million. We also had the record market share in the United States of 8.5%. 
And in China, we face the more challenged last fiscal year, but we still increased our market share by 2.6 points to nearly 35% for the fiscal year. 
We also increased our PC margin by near -- nearly 0.5 point to more than 6%. We did well despite a weaker market, which we believe is a short-term issue tied to transition, changes to rural subsidiaries policy, real estate price control and other short-term measures. But we still low penetration rates of the PC and smartphone and the continuing urbanization, that market will grow in the long term and provide more growth opportunity for Lenovo. 
Our PC business definitely delivered a record year. While we expect to continue this strong performance in PCs, we are now focused on becoming a true major player in PC Plus. 
In smartphones, we strengthened our #2 position in China, with volume up over 368% year-on-year. At the same time, we have now entered the phase of profitable growth. Worldwide, we have a strong early results in all 5 new markets.
In tablets, our worldwide sales were up 74% year-on-year, establishing a strong foundation for even faster growth in the coming year. Overall, while we where #3 in worldwide Smart Connected Devices, which includes PC, tablet and smartphone. And for the year, our mobile business contributed a 9% of Lenovo's overall revenue, almost double that of last year. We are confident that we will deliver even more PC Plus growth in the year ahead. Our record profitability and the PC market share, as well as our rapid expansion as a PC Plus company, have been guided by our Protect and Attack strategy. Our future success will continue to be based on 4 critical elements, the right strategy and the good execution. Efficient business model, innovative product and our diversity and global culture. Now I want to discuss our updated strategy and how we will drive even stronger future growth and the PC Plus era.
In PCs, while we will continue our Protect and Attack strategy, protect China and the global enterprise business and attack emerging market consumer and SMB, we will be more focused on improving profitability. 
Overall, we have a strong PC business foundation that we are confident we'll be even stronger and more profitable in the year ahead, which we will help us deliver our commitment of improving profitability. But at the same time, we are now much more than just a PC company, and our PC Plus business will grow even faster next year. 
In smartphones, we first want to become the market leader in China. In addition, we will grow very aggressively in emerging markets by leveraging our rich product portfolio, strong brand and broader channel networks. This strategy led to our successful launch in Russia, India in Indonesia and other markets. And we will definitely expand to even more countries this year. At the same time, we will focus more heavily on our tablet business to grow even faster. We will attack this opportunity by leveraging our deeper understanding of both Android and Windows to deliver a differentiated product portfolio that satisfies both consumers and the business users. Our target is within 2 years to achieve the same level of the market share that we have in notebooks today. 
In addition, we will grow our server and the storage business to become a relevant global player in the next 3 years. 
So this will be our strategic direction. Side-by-side with our strategy, we will continue to strengthen our business model. First, our reasonably organization will drive better execution of our strategy. As I said the last quarter, we have reorganized our structure and established the 2 end-to-end business groups and Lenovo business group. The new structure will significantly improve our product development cycle, time to market, as well as day-to-day operations. 
Second, we continue to strengthen our vertical integration. While collaborating closely with our partners, we will further enhance our in-house manufacturing capabilities. In the last year, we have begun production of the new facilities in China, in Brazil and in United States. Looking ahead, our end-to-end model will give us a unique competitive advantage in the PC Plus area. Last but not least, we will continue to improve efficiency across our company. Every function will continue to focus on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and shifting investment to growing and strategically important areas. With a strong business model, innovation excellence is even more critical to succeeding feeding into PC Plus area. In the future, you will see us differentiate our products based on our core technology breakthroughs. You will see us integrate hardware, software and services perfectly for the best possible user experience. Our goal is to leverage our innovation advantage to win through differentiation. With the right strategy, efficient business model and innovative products, our diverse team and unified global culture is the foundation for everything we do. And this diversity and unity will continue to be our competitive advantage. 
Looking ahead, it's clear that our industry has changed. We are now in the PC Plus era. At Lenovo, we have built the foundation and are well-positioned to continue our strong momentum. We are ready to start another journey into PC Plus era to continue outpacing the market just like we have done with the PCs in the past 4 years. So thank you, everyone. Now let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming. Thank you.",1386

Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo financials and operational performance for our quarter 4 and for the full fiscal year 2013. 
And next chart, please. Yuanqing has just shared with you our fiscal year 2013 performance, which is a year of success for Lenovo. Quarter 4 obviously is another good quarter for us. We continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion even with the global PC market decline in quarter 4. This is in fact the 14th consecutive quarters that we achieved this year-on-year growth despite the PC market has showed a growth for the last 4 quarters. Our balanced performance has been driven by the successful execution of our Protect and Attack strategy that enable us to continue to grow our top line without losing or giving up probability. 
Against a very challenging market environment, our mobile Internet business is a very significant strength that had helped us to drive the sustainable growth. Group sales grew 4% year-to-year to around $7.8 billion. Our PC shipment was flat year-on-year against a global PC market decline of around 13% year-on-year. Lenovo is the only PC company that maintain shipment volume year-on-year among the top 5 players in quarter 4 according to IDC. PC sales were up 3% year-on-year to around $6.9 billion.

Gross profit margin improved by 1.5 points to 2.3% year-on-year, primarily due to the lower base last year caused by the shortage of the hard disk drive. It was also 0.5% quarter-to-quarter, mainly due to improving MIDH margin and the scaling benefit. Operating expenses, including our continued investment in the research and development and some cost incurred in the integration of our recent acquisition, increased 13% year-on-year to $794 million to support our growth.

Next chart, please. Our balance sheet has remained strong. Noncurrent assets was $4.5 million. The increase from that of 31st March 2012 was due to the consolidation of our recent acquisitions, the new joint venture plant and investment in the IT system. Increasing the inventory was largely due to the increase in our in-house manufacturing, consolidation of recent acquisitions by CCE in quarter 4, increased mix of our consumer product and also increase on our sales. Other changes in current assets and current liabilities were largely due to our increased level of activities. Overall, the balance sheet remains healthy despite quarter 4 typically being a low season for us. We have net current assets of around $299 million as of 31st March 2013. The noncurrent liability was around $2.1 million. 
Next chart, please? Bank deposit and cash level were lower compared to last year due to our capital expenditure and settlement to complete our recent acquisitions. Changing our cash conversion cycle has also impacted the cash flow in quarter 4, as we increase the mix of our consumer in mobile Internet, device business and in-house manufacturing and started integrating our recent acquisitions. We drew down an outstanding bank facility at the end of quarter 2 before that resulted in higher bank borrowings compared to the last year. The net cash reserve dropped to around $3.1 billion. 
We continue to do well in managing our working capital inventory days 26 come up 8 days again last year, due to the expansion into the consumer business and emerging market ramped up our new in-house manufacturing and integration of our recent acquisitions. Receivable days were 40 days, up 5 days compared to last year, driven by our expansion in consumer business and mobile Internet devices, as far as the integration of our recent acquisitions. Payable days, 73 days, up 3 days compared to last year, as result of cash conversions cycle in quarter 4 was negative 7 days against the negative 17 days last year. 
For the full year, our cash conversion cycle change from negative 19 days to negative 8 days. The change was driven by strategic business mix expansion into emerging market and our consumer business, including MIDH, together with a hybrid strategy of increasing our mix of in-house manufacturing to enhance our end-to-end efficiency, as well as product time-to-market. Nevertheless, the group's cash position remain very strong level. We still have a very strong level of cash to drive our future growth. 
Next chart, please. Now looking at the geography, we continue to do well in all geographies in quarter 4 for both our PC and our mobile Internet business, and our PC Plus strategy resulting in a margin improvement in all regions year-on-year. Despite the decline in the global PC market in quarter 4, the group continued to show shipment growth in most of that geos and share gains in all geos, with record high market share in APLA, EMEA and North America, while our mobile Internet device business, especially our business in -- especially our smart business in China, continue to show strong growth momentum.

Our smartphone business in China continue to be profitable in quarter 4 for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue from our PC business was down 2% year-on-year. However, owing to -- due to the decline in the overall PC market in China but we manage to hold up and further improve our PC operating margin. It was up year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter to 6.4% as we focus on upholding margin in the declining market. As a result, overall margin in China was up 1.5 point year-on-year and 0.02 points quarter-to-quarter to 4.9%.

Operating profit improved slightly compared to last year, breakeven level, even though under the yen -- even though with the yen begin depreciation impact. Latin America and Brazil remained a key market showing loss this quarter. We have included the CCE figures for the first time in this quarter.

Operating margin continued to improve year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter to 2.3%. Our consumer in this region was profitable in quarter 4 and achieved profitable for the full year for the first time. We have the right innovative product, the right organizational structure and strong leadership, and we have built a much more effective business model in the consumer -- for our consumer business in the region, and we are very confident to outperform the market or to continue to outperform the market and that will support the margin improvement over time. 
For North America, we continue to achieve a very strong growth premium against the market decline in the region and record share in U.S. in North America. Revenue for North America was up 13% year-on-year to about $1.2 billion. Continue to outperform well in the commercial business, while building foundation of our consumer business to drive future growth in the region.

Before I end my presentation to my want to give you some color on the market outlook. Our PC Plus strategy has been working well to drive the good growth in sales and profit, with margin expense and in the past several quarters and years. Strong growth momentum in our business -- in our mobile Internet device business, especially our smartphone business in China, has helped to fuel the group's solid growth with the improving profitability we expect this trend to continue. We will continue to roll out our smartphone business in emerging markets and our tablet business in mature market. Our core PC business is performing well despite the uncertainties in the global economy impacting the PC market growth in the short term. We remain very confident that we can continue to outperform the global PC market and to improve our operating margin. We have been successful in upholding our share and profits in the Protect strategy in China and enterprise business, while at the same time our investment in our Attack strategy in the past several years have already enable us to reach critical mass with most emerging market in our consumer business, which I've already shown profitability. We expect this investment to start generating returns to the group even in a very challenging market environment. We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiative in growth opportunities. We'll continue to invest in our core competence building and product innovation and redeploy resources to invest in the high-growth area and to drive sustainable future growth. We have a very a high healthy balance sheet, which provides us the flexibility for executing our M&A strategy in order to capture the opportunities in the high-growth area, which obviously would help to accelerate our future growth.

I believe some of your competitors is talking about getting more aggressive in pricing but it seems like the result is not really showing any impact to your performance.

So from 1 aspect that we protect our strong holding on the commercial side because we have much more competitive product, more reliable products. Meanwhile, we are more aggressive to attack the consumer market, because other market share is still low, so we have a lot of room to further improve the -- to increase the volume and improve the market share. So that will be -- that will continue to be our strategies so we think we will reach the double-digit market share even in that market where very quickly. So good product, efficient -- cost-efficient so will be our key win market, to win that market. So I don't know whether I address there.",135

Maybe I add a little bit color. I think you probably have been hearing us saying protect and attack. And it is very, very meaningful. These are not 2 words or adjectives. I think we actually execute and have a very strong execution for that. And we'll begin to see results. I think 1 best example for is obviously we continue -- we again have been saying that we will invest in innovation and invest in branding. Now the innovation give us a premium of very, I think, best in class of product like X1 Carbon, I think if you have already buy one, I think you should buy one. I think it's one of the best commercial product, which exactly, and I hate to say exactly give us a good margin and was very market, very strong demand. And of that, because of our continued investments in their brand and product innovation, and if you recall, I think, in last quarter, we reported back the first time that our Yoga product get into the high-end consumer. Now this is -- this does not happen overnight. This has been a consistent execution of a strategy very, very strong execution, and we begin to see the result. We continue to see opportunities in front of us because of our -- we begin to see the result and we will not be happy to stop here. And we will continue to do it and obviously product execution looking at the market opportunities, there are still a lot of room for us to grow even in a challenging market.",270

No, I think that we will first of all I think the EMC joint venture worked pretty well. I think the real value of when would be EMC is really the cooperation for them to help us view our server capability, so that they become one of our anchor customers, and I'm happy to report that this is on track. So I think that relationship fit in our overall strategy very well.

I have 2 questions. Page 10 of PPT, PC Plus strategy of the company. I would like to ask you the first one is about overseas smartphone strategy. The measured target, can you explain more about the price range? Who are your major smartphone competitors? Second question is about tablet. For low-end tablets in the Mainland with Android base, they are growing very quickly in the market, so for Chinese PC consumers, is it bringing negative impact, or there are also some positive impacts?",91

First of all, in China we have fairly good foundation. We are #2 in terms of market share with 11%. The final quarter market share was 13%. So we trust that we will become the market leader very soon. At the same time in emerging markets, we feel that there demand for such products are similar to China. Our products are really ready. We have already established good channels. We have established good brand image so it will be easier for us to develop our smartphone business. Therefore, this is going to be a key strategy we are getting prepared to enter into mature markets as well. According to our experience, smartphone growth will be substantial. Last year, we sold nearly 30 million. This year's target 50 million. As for our tablet business, last year, we sold 2 million. Previously, the market was dominated by the iPad, including -- Android was also affected and some Windows systems which were too expensive. So I trust that in the coming year, there will be fundamental change as to the tablet market. With the dominating trend, Android will enter the market and Windows will provide more new products, so Lenovo's advantage is that inside these 2 ecosystems, we're highly competitive. We understand both ecosystems very well. Our growth is very obvious and our target will be 10 million for tablet. You also talked about another point. When any new product comes into the market, the situation in China is that there will be some short-lived enthusiasm, but it is not sustainable. This is what we can see from previous experience. For example, when desktops where first developed, at the end, people care about the brand and also after sales efforts, because brand represents quality so don't worry too much about the low-end products in China.",310

I want to ask margin, if you look at component, for example went up over $10, $10 to $15. Based on our calculation, you guys made around $18 EBIT per PC last year, so I'm little bit concerned about margin. In one hand, you said you increased margin but there's price headwind going forward so can you talk about this trend?",65

I wish we could manage it that well, but definitely the way I have a little bit negative impact on our margin or profitability. But from a long-term point of view, as I committed to you, so we will further improve our margin profitability. So I give you my commitment, so 2 quarters ago, so in the next 3 years, so we will improve our PTI ratio by at least 1 point, so this is still my commitment. It still my commitment but definitely it will not happen in 1 day so gradually so we will improve that. That's because our good execution of the strategy. So in the past 4 years, so we invest a lot in the new business to drive the growth, to drive the shares. Once we reach the double-digit market share, we will quickly shift to the focus from the growth building the volume to the profitability. So now, our 3 new businesses, so emerging market, mature market, consumer and SMB business and mobile Internet business all have reached a very decent scale and the market sure. So I think it's time to pay off. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years, so we will further improve the profitability.",219

I think you're absolutely right that the prices went up. But I just want to I think telling how we're going to do with it. I think prices go as far as a mother component prices come down. So I think I would just give you 1 example. A couple of quarters ago, when we have a very fortunate Thai flood there, I think half of this was exactly even much higher, and yet, I think there are ways for us to manage overall costs. So DRAM is not 100% of the cost. But I can assure you that it is a challenge, but not does not necessarily translate the increase in DRAM price and yet our PTI. It's not like that.",127

I probably know why it is. I think partly because again, we begin to change about the business model. I think partly change the business model by changing really from the traditional ODM, I think, to moving more a little bit more towards the in-house manufacturing. Now in a traditional ODM, I think normally you have to be a buy side relationship meaningfully buy the component, we sell the ODM. ODM sell it back to us. But so you can see the same component go to accounts, go to the ODM and then come back to me. So I think that in summary, you can happily say that it's the same component But for in-house manufacturing, we component we do what we sell. I think a large part of that exactly from the change in, I think, the account payable. The other thing or the change in account payable, if you're looking at the quarter 4 number, I really need to exactly the number we referred to, but if it is a quarter-on-quarter, can tell you the reason being that I think quarter 4 obviously is the smallest quarter and is obviously a very challenging quarter so the way we manage businesses how do we I think at the beginning of the quarter, I think honestly, the market I think if you really look at PC, the market is probably not dropping may be 2% or 3%. I mean, only during the middle of the quarter 1 we operate the business come I think we've found out that the drop is even much bigger so what do we do? We probably control expenses and therefore, I think in quarter 3, I think you spend your money, you still have -- some of that will not be paid under normal trade condition because you have the account payable period so you have a much higher account payable and in quarter 4, we obviously spent significantly less because obviously the market becomes, I think, come down to the account payable become smaller. So I think these are the factors, but I'm more than happy to take rather than I think to go for detail with you. I think to me, as I explained in my presentation, the change or I think the cash conversion cycle, I think, pretty much reflect the way that we want to execute the strategy. We want to grow very aggressively emerging market. We want to maintain the growth and profitability as well, so we fully leverage the ability of cash on our balance sheet I think to drive our strategy. So I think that is well-within our expectation and our cash level we feel very, very comfortable.",459

So I think the demand has dropped significantly probably with the finish of transition so we can hope the market that we are recover again. And also I believe currently the penetration rate of the PC in China is still lower if you compare with the mature markets developed countries. So would the trend of the organization so I believe that we are still driving the growth of the PC demand so that's my. Regarding of the MIDH so actually, I don't know so what do you mean the shortage of the component, what kind of components is in shortage.",119

I think generally, we definitely I think the way we manage our overall PC, I think we obviously have a reasonable buy ahead, I think, to hedge ourselves, I think, for shortage of supply. I think this is a general industry trend that resulting increasing component, as I said. I think not all the components will go up. I think some component go up. Some components will come down. And again, one very important I think principle you have to remember is, I think the cost of components is always related obviously to volume. So if you actually be able to be a significant player, you obviously have the better ability I think to manage your cost of the price. And therefore, that's the reason why I think on one hand we balance, I think, the growth and profitability on the other hand, we actually drive very, very high growth on top line to increase our market share.",179

It's on MIDH business. We estimated that your MIDH operating margin last quarter was about minus 70 basis points, and this quarter was about minus 50 basis points. Now that sort of slow down the trend we're used to be a lot less profitable, and do you think that is that do we expect profitability in entire MIDH unit to be slower than expected from what you were thinking, or are you still seeing this to be on track with your forecast, or you're thinking for the unit as a whole?",94

I think the way we look at MIDH business well, first of all let me just explain the way how we manage our overall profitability. We obviously again because of sorry to use the word yet another Protect and Attack, we have been able to generate more profit from protect, we will grow aggressively going to the attack area. The attack area obviously does not necessarily carry, I think, initially profitable profit in the first place when the business is small. Now insofar as Lenovo Group is concerned, PCs our protect. That is going to generate cost. Now if we're able to bid our competitors to generate more profit, no doubt we will invest aggressively in MIDH and go into more countries in a more aggressive ways market share. And in that sense, we're going to have to say, well, MIDH exactly I think losing more money. But within MIDH, I think we have to look at it very carefully. MIDH, the smartphone business in China, that will continue to grow with increasing profitability. For the rest of the world, I think countries like, for example, in the recent quarters that we go in like Indonesia, Vietnam, and so forth come I think it will not be profitable for us for sure but as to how likely how aggressive we want to go it all depends on how much money will actually come out from the protect. So in a way that I think we are absolutely on track in expanding our MIDH business.",267

So but in short term, we think we still need to invest more on the R&D and marketing so to drive the future so capability-building.

Now, let me turn it over to Yuanqing.",71

Last quarter, Lenovo once again delivered very strong results. Although the global PC market continued to decline, last quarter it shrank 11% year-on-year, Lenovo still delivered strong results. Our market share was up almost 2 points year-on-year to reach our record share of 16.7%. Now we are the clear #1 PC company in the world for the first time. This is an important milestone and our balanced business is the main driver to achieve this dream. Last quarter, China PC market declined by 14% year-on-year. 
Although Lenovo's business is still very healthy and even improved the profit margin by almost 1 point, the fact is that, in the past, if the China market lags behind the global market, it would inactively impact our overall growth significantly. But today, our Europe and Americas businesses have become another pillar to our company. They outgrew the market significantly, and ensured our PC business revenue growth is still positive and our overall business is still strong. 
Here, we must thank the successful strategy and the execution over the past few years. Our successful attack battle for emerging and the consumer business has given us the momentum. We can see, not only rapid growth in emerging markets, like Eastern Europe, Middle East/Africa, Brazil and Asia. But also, our consumer businesses in North America and in Western Europe have turned into growth engines for our overall business. 
Today, we not only have our more balanced business across geographies but also, achieved a greater balance between commercial and the consumer segments. In fact, we used the 4 to 5 years to build our previously China-only consumer business into now the world's largest consumer business. Of course, other than ensuring a healthy PC business under such a tough environment, we have long realized the industry would go through major changes, and it is at a turning point right now. Fortunately, Lenovo has been preparing for this change for a couple of years and now, our efforts are starting to pay off. 
In smartphones, we grew our volumes significantly. Last quarter, our worldwide volume grew by 130% year-on-year and we are now #4 player in worldwide smartphone share according to the latest IDC report. In China, the world's largest smartphone market, we sold more than 11 million units and continued to strengthen our #2 position and because of that, our China business, overall, still grew by 6%, even with PC market in significant decline. 
In markets outside of China, we also met good progress, like in our first wave of Indonesia, India, Russia and Vietnam. Most recently, we expanded into even more markets like Brazil, Thailand and Malaysia, and have received good initial results as well. 
In tablets, our 4 geos all revved up their motors and then they drove our sales volume to more than triple year-on-year. Last quarter, our combined sales of smartphones and the tablets surpassed the PCs' for the first time. Our revenue from mobile internet businesses now account for 14% of our overall business and once again, we had our record share in global smart-connected devices with over 7%, which includes smartphones, tablets and PCs. Now we are transforming from a PC company to a PC Plus company in full speed. We are confident that we will achieve even greater success in the future. Our confidence still comes from the same success factors that we always talk about: right strategy, efficient business model, innovating products and a diverse team and a global culture. 
Today, I want to emphasize on innovation and the business model. The first is innovation. We will center on user experience by blending hardware, software and applications for greater end-to-end experience and we will win more customers with products that are more stylish, more exciting, and more user-friendly. 
 
In fact, Lenovo will launch a series of cool products for this holiday season. We will unveil the next generation of our multimode products, including the new Yoga and the uniquely designed tablets. Our new wave of smartphones will be even thinner, lighter with more and better features, particularly around the security, collaboration and cloud. 
Okay, I'd better stop here and come back to the rest for my earnings announcement. 
The reason the industry trends also gave us confidence is they clearly favor our business model. The industry is entering a phase of transformation. According to IDC data, the premier smartphone and tablet markets have slowed, while the mainstream and entry-level markets continued to see rapid growth. At the same time, the market growth is also shifting from mature markets to emerging markets. Even within mature markets, customers are switching phones much more quickly than before. In fact, in the U.S., some carriers are starting to change their policy to allow customers to switch their phones every 12 months or even just 6 months instead of 2 to 3 years. So this customer behavior change gives companies that can offer fashionable, affordable products and develop products quickly, more growth opportunity. Lenovo is this kind of company. 
We have a rich product portfolio that covers all price bands, thanks to our speedy product development cycle and frequent product upgrades. We have a very efficient end-to-end business model with disciplined operation. Our in-house manufacturing can quickly turn our innovations into high-quality, cost-efficient products for customers in both mature markets and the emerging markets. 
At the same time, even though we are consistently improving our profitability, we set reasonable margin targets. This means we are able to provide customers, especially mainstream customers, truly affordable products. 
In 1996, a PC with a Pentium chip was a premier product in China. With our highly efficient business model, Lenovo launched a campaign to offer it at less than RMB 10,000. That premier product overnight became affordable to mainstream customers. It was the time when the PC market in China transformed from premier to mainstream. And the Lenovo grasped that critical opportunity and built a solid foundation for our success in PCs. 
Smartphones and the tablets are going through a similar transformation. With our core competence and the success for experience in PCs, we are confident that we can replicate that success in the PC Plus area. 
Thank you. Now, let me turn it to our CFO, Wai Ming.",1047
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 14, 2013",2013-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3698.0,505047.0,23320028.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 1. Next chart, please. 
We continue to grow in both sales and profit with margin expansion even when the global PC market declined in quarter 1. This is the 15th consecutive quarters that we achieved this year-on-year growth, despite the worldwide PC market showing negative growth for the last 5 quarters. 
Our performance has been driven by the solid execution of our Protect and Attack strategy that enables us to continue our growth in top line without giving us profitability. Over the last few quarters, which we witnessed a challenging PC market environment, strong growth in our mobile internet business has continued to help us drive sustainable growth for the group. 
Group sales grew 10% year-on-year to around $8.8 billion. Sales in our mobile internet business were up 105% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. Strong performance in mobile internet business, especially smartphone, helped drive the group's top line growth. PC and related sales were up 2% year-on-year to around $7.3 billion. Sales of other goods and services were at $277 million. 
We reported in the last quarter that we have changed the way we organize our back-end operations by setting up 2 business group units, namely the Think business group and Lenovo business group. This helps enhance our end-to-end operating efficiency and innovation. This also resulted in some changes in cost classification. As a result, effective from this fiscal year, certain item used to be in the cost of goods sold, such as global supply chain and surface overheads, have now been reclassified into operating expense. There is no impact to operating profit, although both gross profit and expense will increase by around $65 million in quarter 1. 
Gross profit was about $1.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Gross profit margin was 13.6%, improved by 0.5 points year-on-year on a like-for-like comparison. The year-on-year improvement is largely due to modern improvement in PC from better average selling prices and probability improvement from our mobile internet business. 
Operating expense increased by 14% to $989 million. The operating expense in quarter 1 has included expense incurred in the CCE and EMC joint venture that we have just started the integration in the last quarter 4. Meanwhile, as part of our Protect and Attack strategy, we have taken resource actions to further improve our profitability in our PC business and continued to deploy resource in our PC Plus strategy, in order to drive further growth in revenue and profitability. This resulted in a $17 million severance expenses incurred in quarter 1. Our E/R ratio was up year-on-year to 11.3% against 10.8% last year. But if we exclude the severance expenses, the E/R ratio would be lower. 
Operating profit in quarter 1 was $202 million, up 11% year-on-year. We recorded a net nonoperating income of $13 million, mainly from incentives received for our investment in Wuhan mobile internet and manufacturing hub. Pretax income was $215 million, up 16% year-on-year. 
I want to highlight that netting of both nonoperating income and severance expenses, expansion in both our operating and PTI margin have been on track to close to 2.5%. The effective tax rate for quarter 1 was 21%, in line with our average run rate around 20% to 25%. Profit attributable to equity holders is $174 million, up 23% year-on-year. Net margin in quarter 1 was 2% against 1.8% last year. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet in the next chart. Our balance sheet in quarter 1 remains strong. Noncurrent assets were about $4.65 billion, slightly higher than the level at 31st March 2013. Increase in the inventory was largely due to increase in parts and components inventory needed for our increasing in-house manufacturing in China and Brazil. Consolidation of recent acquisitions like CCE, as well as finished goods, especially mobile internet device, to prepare for the summer sales season in quarter 2. 
In summary, our inventory level is at a healthy level, taking into consideration of our business growth. Other changes in current assets and current liabilities were due largely to increased activities during the quarter. We had net current assets of around $331 million at the end of June. The noncurrent liabilities were at around $2.2 billion. 
Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. We have continued to leverage our strong cash resource to support our growth in driving strategic expansion in high-growth areas, such as consumer business, emerging markets and mobile internet device business. But as a result, the cash conversion cycle has come down to negative 1 day in Q1, again negative 13 days last year and negative 7 days in last quarter 4. Our bank deposit and cash level remained strong in Q1. It was lower compared to last year due to our capital expenditure and settlement to complete our recent acquisitions, as well as changing our cash conversion cycle. We drew down an outstanding bank facility in last Q2 before it lapsed, that resulted at -- in a higher bank borrowing compared to last year, but it was similar to last quarter 4. The net cash reserve declined to around $3.1 billion compared to last year, but flat against last quarter 4. 
Inventory days were 27 days, up 8 days again last year, due to our expansion into consumer business and emerging markets, ramp up for our new in-house manufacturing and integration of our recent acquisitions. They were up 1 day quarter-on-quarter due to increase in mobile internet device business and ramp up for our in-house manufacturing. Receivable days were 36, up 2 days compared to last year, also driven by our expansion in consumer business, as well as integration of our recent acquisitions. It was down quarter-on-quarter due to improvement in collection, as well as quarter 4 is typically our low season. 
Payable days were 64 days, down 2 days compared to last year, and 9 days compared to last quarter 4. The year-on-year change was in line with our normal trend, and the quarter-on-quarter change was due to seasonality. We remain at a very strong cash position for working capital needs to drive future growth. 
Next chart, please. We continue to do well in all geographies in quarter 1 for both our PC and mobile internet device business and our PC Plus strategy, resulting in margin improvement year-on-year in most regions. Our balanced geographic exposure, especially markets outside China, including Americas and EMEA continued to help contribute to our top line growth. We continued to record share gain across product and customer segments. 
We have combined Latin America with North America to form the new American region beginning from quarter 1 to further facilitate our operating efficiency, and we have reported our performance this time under the new 4 geographic classifications. We have enclosed in the appendix the historic performance for your reference. 
China. The revenue from China was up 6% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in our mobile internet device, which grew 76% year-on-year. Our smartphone business in China continued to be profitable in quarter 1 for the third consecutive quarter. Profitability of the overall mobile internet device business has also improved. Revenue from PC business was down 7% year-on-year. However, owing to the decline in the PC market, but we continue to strengthen our leadership and further improve PC operating margin. It was up year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter to 6.8%, as we focus on upholding margin in a declining market. As a result, our overall margin in China was up 0.6 points year-on-year and 0.5 points quarter-to-quarter to 5.2%. We remain confident that our PC Plus strategy is fully operational in China, and can continue to drive growth in sales and profit. 
Asia Pacific. Revenue was down 9% year-on-year to about $1.3 billion in Asia Pacific, which is a result of our decision to focus on profitability. We have given up some nonprofitable government-related transactions in the region, which resulted in the decline of our market share. Nevertheless, we continued to perform well in Japan and solidify our leadership position with share gains. We also recorded record high market share in ASEAN. Our operating margin was up 0.1 points to 0.9% year-on-year. 
EMEA, we had a very encouraging quarter in EMEA with record high market share. Revenue grew 18% year-on-year to about $1.9 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets and consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. We're #1 for the first time in Eastern Europe and we achieved #1 position in 10 countries, including Germany from 2 countries last year. Our operating margin was up 0.4 points to 1.5% year-on-year. 
Americas, we continue to achieve a strong growth premium against the market decline in the region, with record high market share at 9.7%. We continued to record strong growth in North America, up 17% for the first time to reach double-digit market share, driven by strong growth in the U.S. commercial business. We also performed well in Brazil. We showed a record high market at 9.5%. Operating margin, however, was down year-on-year, as we are still investing in Brazil, and consumer business in the region and integrating CCE operations in the short term. 
Next chart, please. We have a more balanced product portfolio helped by our expansion in consumer PC and mobile internet device business. Notebook units shipments were down around 2% with a 10% premium to the market, but sales were up 5% year-to-year, respectively, as the average selling price was up. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were flat, with a 10-point premium, but sales were down 3% year-on-year. 
Our mobile internet business continued to show strong performance, up 105% year-on-year in sales, led by smartphone and tablet business, which fueled the growth of the group. The mix of mobile internet device further increased to 14% from 7%. While becoming #1 in the PCs for the first time ever, we actually sold more smartphones and tablets than PC during this quarter, against for the first time ever. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Our PC Plus strategy has been working well to drive the group's growth in sales and profit with margin expansion in the past several quarters. Strong growth momentum in our mobile internet device business, especially our smartphone business in China, has helped fuel the group's solid growth with improving profitability. 
We expect this trend to continue. We'll continue to roll out our smartphone business in emerging markets, and our tablet business in mature markets. Our core PC business is performing well despite uncertainties in the global economy, impacting the PC market growth in the short term. There are still enormous opportunities for growth in the traditional PCs. We remain confident that we can continue to outperform the global PC market and to improve our operating margin. 
Lenovo will succeed in the PC Plus area, because we are best positioned to capture the opportunity where the market is going from a premium to mainstream and entry-level and from mature market to emerging markets. This is our strength, where we have proven with our success in PC, and we will replicate this success in the PC Plus era as well. 
We will stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in core competence building, and product innovation and redeploy resources to invest in the high-growth area to drive the sustainable future growth. We have a healthy balance sheet, which provide us the flexibility for our M&A strategy to capture opportunities in high-growth area that can help to accelerate our growth.

This is Wai Ming Wong, let me deal with the China channel inventory issue. Obviously, the -- I think the China market declined, but we actually been keeping a very healthy channel inventory. So I think we do not necessarily -- definitely from a Lenovo perspective, I think we have a very tight control over our channel inventory. I mean, that obviously applies normally in China than on a worldwide basis. I think, today, our channel inventory remains very, very healthy. So I think, going forward, obviously, China, I think we see some signs, I think, of I think the market -- I think the PC market, obviously, is a good reflection of the overall economy. We definitely see that. I think the reason -- I think the recent government policy, I think does have some stabling element in the economy. Although that may not have an immediate impact over the next 1 or 2 quarters but definitely, we are very optimistic about the, I think, the -- I think the further stabling of the economy, as a result, that will benefit, I think, the PC and the PC Plus demand.

Brazil, I think we begin to fully integrate Brazil. As you can see, I think, Brazil, we actually take an investment, not only in CCE, but also we've been investing including our own factory. As you can -- well, I think that based on the latest IDC number, in fact, Brazil, we actually jumped to a market share of, I think, we grew about 130% and we actually have a 9.6% market share, which is the mature, I think in PC, as well as the mature in tablet. Obviously, we still need to ramp up because of the investment that we've made in Brazil. As I said, this is not only CCE, but also I think we're investing in the -- I think, in the factory. I think we are actually making good progress. But integration, I think we are going to have a fully integrated, I think, Lenovo operation comprising of, obviously, the Lenovo brand, as well as CCE brand, I think, to hit, I think, different segments of the market. We would expect that as and when we grow the business, I think we will [indiscernible]. I think it's definitely, I think, reduce the operating loss, which we recorded in the previous quarter.

I'm just wondering, was there any change in the sales exposure to the wireless carriers and the retail channels that helped the improvement in the profitability? And also related to the smartphone, with Samsung getting more aggressive in pricing and Apple is likely to introduce a low-cost iPhone, plus the recent preorder of the Hongmi since received a lot of attention. So it seems the competitive pressure in the smartphone area is getting more intense. So do you foresee that profitability in the smartphone business to sustain or actually, we could see more pressure to cause some downturn?",105

So particularly, in China. So our business profit and also, we have a very different margin. So actually, our smartphone business margin in China is higher than our PC business. So but in short term, we think it is still in the investment period. We still needed to invest on the branding, we still needed to invest on the channel network building. So we don't expect to -- our smartphone business will contribute significantly to our overall profit, particularly outside China. So we will focus our emerging market to develop. So we still needed to invest in that area. So that's about the margin and the profit. So regarding of the competition, so we have never been scared with the competition, actually. So we think the market -- the recent market trends favor Lenovo and [indiscernible]. So we have seen this trend. So the market is shifting from the premium part to the mainstream. It's shifting from the mature markets to emerging markets. Actually last quarter, our
emerging markets accounts for more than 6% -- 64% of the total smartphone market. And also, even in mature markets, we see a refresh -- I mean, cycle is becoming faster and faster from the carriers. Carriers allow their customers to replace their phones in 1 year or even just 6 months, so like AT&T and T-Mobile. So I -- so we think this trend definitely is more appropriate -- the Lenovo business model. So as you know, we have very rich product portfolio across the whole price band. So we have very fast product -- revenue cycle. We emphasize our time-to-volume -- our time-to-market and the time-to-volume. So that's our long-term stronghold since our PC refresh [ph]. And also, we have a very efficient underlying business model with disciplined operation. So our in-house manufacturing can quickly turn our innovation into high-quality cost -- cost-effective products. So meanwhile, so although we are trying to improve our profitability, we always set a reasonable margin target. So this means that we are able to provide the customers, especially mainstream customers, truly affordable products, so compared to our current leaders in the smartphone and the tablet area. So that's 1 reason we are confident on the competition, definitely. The second reason is we are also are a very innovative company. So we are innovating not just in the sufficient PC area, we're innovating in the smartphone and tablet area as well.

My first question, please, is on the outlook of the mobile industry. We all know that PCP may have been pretty weak for several quarters. But starting in 4Q, we're going to have several new products, such as Intel's Haswell and Bay Trail, also Windows 8.1. Just curious for your view, do you think those may be a catalyst for better PC outlook in 4Q this year?",71

And so -- but we do have seen some positive signal here. So first is in the commercial segment. So actually, now more enterprise customers need to refresh their old windows XP-based system to either Windows 7 or Windows 8. So we have seen this cycle, particularly in U.S. So that's one to think about. The second thing is China's economy is the key reason, so to attract the PC market up. But we believe that China economy will become stable because the government has sent the message to the market that we'll ensure the GDP growth of the economy -- the economy housing part. So I believe that will help the China market. And also, I believe the innovation on the PC, so like Lenovo, so we launched the multimode products, including Yoga, Helix and ThinkPad tablet, these kind of things. So that will help to drive the healthy growth in the industry as well. So I believe in the second half of the year, not just the Lenovo, but also other players in the industry. We are launching more convertible, multimode products in the market to help drive the industry health. So I believe PC is still more powerful and a full function computing device. So people still need this product. So it's still a $200 billion market -- industry in the market. So we are rather confident so -- in the future. I don't believe the market will drop by double-digit half-year ago -- half years later, sorry. So that's my view on the PC market.",278

I think earlier, you mentioned is that your strategy is to sell tablet in the mature market, smartphone in the emerging market, it is from your forecast. For emerging market, discussed about Hongmi earlier, we have seen some local vendors coming out with very low ASP tablet products. So just curious that do you think those low-ASP products, would they put pressure on ASP or even profitability for Lenovo? As you know, Lenovo is making money for 3 quarters in a row on smartphone. So again, just curious that, will those product putting any pressure on ASP or profitability, please?",104

So actually in North America, for the first time, we reached the double-digit market share part. We have more than 26 points of premier to the market. So that's a very positive result. So as I said before, so actually, so we are stronger in the commercial side. Now we have fully leveraged the kinds of refresh cycle of the commercial customers. So to drive the growth, including large enterprise to customers and SMB customers. Meanwhile, we are more operative in the consumer spending. So we're entering to Best Buy and other retail stores to drive the growth.

Obviously, it begins to show the effect of our overall execution of strategy. What I mean is, I think we've not only have the innovative products. I think on the commercial side, I think we hold our margin. But over the last couple of quarters, we actually been also improving our overall services, I think, to customers. I think if you, I think, follow the industry trend I think there is a well-known independent research firm called TDL, [ph] I think that actually ranked Lenovo #1 in, I think, the services to the customers. So you can actually see the -- with our overall I think quality of our product, quality of our services in terms of, I think, supply chain services to customers, we've obviously been very focused. And I -- one thing that I believe that we are well above our competitors, I think, in mature markets, in particular, the USA is our focus in delivering, I think, the products to our customers. While our competitors may have multi, I think, objectives in delivering different businesses. And as a result of that, I think the end customer recognize our value and begin to actually move the business to our side.

Could you comment on your progress in terms of achieving those targets?",58

And so -- but now, we become more and more confident to achieve this target. So from the results of the last quarters, so you can see we have a very successful first step. So last quarter, we shipped almost 12 million smartphones, so 1.5 million tablets. So with that number, definitely, you can believe. So 15 million smartphones is in our reach. So and also, for the tablet -- so our -- all our 4 geos now are gearing up. So I believe this quarter. So you will see even higher shipment. So to ensure we can deliver that commitment. We fully leverage our current PC channel and a reputation to develop the tablet business across the world. So that has been very successful. But definitely, our product is also very attractive to the customers, so that's another reason. As I said before, so the industry trend is definitely stable and Lenovo -- Lenovo's business model. So the market is shifting from premier to the mainstream. It's shifting from mature markets to emerging markets. So more frequent or faster refreshment cycle. So these kind of things are definitely, stable Lenovo -- stable Lenovo's business model. So because we are stronger in emerging market, we are stronger in mainstream. We -- our product development cycle is shorter now -- competition time. So we are focusing on the time-to-market and time-to-volume. We are focusing on building end-to-end integrated, efficient business model with disciplined operation. So these kind of things will give us a very strong competitiveness. So we not only we are confident to give you -- to deliver this 15 million, 10 million target, but also, we will become a stronger player in both smartphone and the tablet area.",297

First of all, MIDH still seems to be losing about USD 20 million in the last quarter. Could you explain, one, where that is coming from, given that smartphone is already profitable? And second is on China PC margins, adding 6.8% China PC margin is probably the highest that we have seen for quite some time. Could you talk about what you're doing in declining PC market, which is enabling this kind of margin, and should we expect that to continue, given that we get into the traditional promotion season in the next quarter?",107

So because the market was declining, so we actually asked our team to focus more on selling the high-end or premier products and keep the healthy margin and our profitability. So definitely, this strategy has worked very well. So you can see, although our overall PC unit shipments dropped a little bit, which have been -- we are better than the market. But our overall PC revenue increased a little bit. So that means our average selling price was higher year-on-year. So this is in Europe. Typically, the PC has seen a drop year-over-year. So in Europe, because of our guidance to achieve, so we -- our premier products mix in our total PC shipment increased. That gave us the better margin, so that's first point. The second point is definitely, we have more innovative products like ThinkPad tablet, Helix, Yoga. So these kinds of innovative products help us to drive higher margin. The third one, the third point is -- so we have more disciplined operation to manage the cost, to manage the expense. So actually, last quarter, so our China team significantly reduced the expense. So that helped us to improve the profit. So these couple of things, their combination helped us to improve the margin, not just in China, actually, worldwide. So that's the answer to your second question. Regarding of the reported figure of mobile, our mobile business -- MIDH business. So probably your message is wrong. Wai Ming, you can?",254

Please, maybe I ask you refer to the chart that we prepared which is on Page 8. I think which is under the headline of performance by geography. Now, if you really look at the segment operating profit, we break down into China, we have an operating profit of $194 million and PC, $188 million. So I think you probably may be misreading the next column, which was Q1 last year. I think that recorded an operating loss of, probably, $20 million. But as you can see, we also showed the quarter 4 number, which is an operating loss of negative 3 in quarter 1 this year. And operating profit, I think by using that deduction is about $900 million -- about $6 million. So we can actually see the increasing, I think profitability of our MIDH business in China.",141

I'm pleased to report that Lenovo once again delivered record results. Our formula for success starts with our clear strategy driving our strong execution. Our Protect and Attack strategy now focuses on protecting our core PC business, while aggressively attacking growth in PC Plus, which includes tablets, smartphones, and the servers. This clear strategy guided us to yet another record performance. Not only was our nearly $10 billion revenue was an all-time high, but more importantly, we achieved a record profit of $220 million, up 36% year on year. We promised to keep improving profitably and we delivered that. 
For PCs, Lenovo grew market share by more than 2 points year-on-year, and we remained the world's #1 PC company. Our market share reached the record of 17.7%. Our PC growth and the strong profitability were driven by our balanced global business across all geos. 
Now, Lenovo is #1 in 5 of the top 7 markets: China, Japan, Brazil, Germany, and Russia. And we are #3 in India. At the same time, we have reached a double-digit market share in U.S. for the first time. Brazil is particularly a highlight. Through the acquisition and the integration of CCE, we quickly built our foundation. It took us from #7 to #1 in just 3 quarters with the improved profitability. This exceeded our expectations. 
While we continued our success in PCs, our PC Plus business also had a very strong quarter. In smartphones, we continued to see strong growth last quarter. Our worldwide volume grew by 78% year on year to reach 12.2 million units and continued to close the gap to #3 player worldwide. 
In China, we strengthened our #2 position. At the same time, our expansion in our worldwide markets gained a real momentum. 
In just 4 quarters, we have reached double-digit shares in Indonesia, which has the fourth largest population in the world. And we are also seeing strong progress in key markets such as Brazil, India, Russia and Vietnam. 
Over the next couple of quarters, in our second wave, we are expanding to at least 20 more countries. We saw even faster growth in tablets, with sales volume up more than 400% year-on-year. This hyper growth came from balanced sales worldwide. At the same time, our tablet business continues to be profitable. I will talk a bit more about tablets in just a moment. 
Our combined sales of smartphones and tablets surpassed the PCs for the second straight quarter, and they now account for 15% of our overall business and continue to improve profitability. In both PCs and PC Plus, we delivered very strong performances. This definitely proves that our PC Plus strategy is working very well and are driving strong execution. 
We are confident that we can sustain this momentum quarter after quarter because in addition to our clear strategy, our investments in innovation and the business model will continue to pay off. 
Lenovo continues to refine PCs with innovative products like we did with the multimode portfolio: Yoga, Horizon, Helix, which were offering more growth and opportunities. At the same time, we will accelerate our growth in PC Plus products. 
In smartphones, we launched our flagship Vibe smartphones. Not only do they have more competitive features and a stylish design, but they will become a platform for Lenovo to expand our premium smartphone business globally. And just last week, Lenovo launched the highly anticipated multimode, uniquely designed Yoga tablet. It can really solve some pain points of current tablet customers. We do hope it will be one of the best-selling tablets for the holiday season. 
The Yoga tablet launch was also our latest brand building effort, which will be our next focus area. Ashton Kutcher is a superstar actor and he will definitely help us showcase our technology and innovation. 
And in addition to hardware devices, we will continue to invest in our ecosystem. So far there are over 400k apps in Lenovo store and over 20 million downloads daily, and these numbers are still growing.  
Actually, I hope you can try some of our most popular apps, such as [indiscernible] and the Lenovo [indiscernible]. Meanwhile, we will continue improving our business model, which has led to lower cost and a higher efficiency. Our new factory in Itu, Brazil was critical to our rapid rise to #1 in the Brazilian PC market. And just next month, our mobile product factory in Wuhan, China will officially start production, further strengthening our in-house manufacturing capability. Our business model is our competitive advantage and we will keep investing in it. 
Looking to the next few quarters, we are confident, not only because of our clear strategy, but also because we see the PC market improving and the growth in tablet shifting to our favor. Benefiting from our corporate refresh and the China market improvement, the sharpest declines in PC sales are now over. And just like I mentioned earlier, we are helping the PC market to recover with more and more innovative products. Although according to most industry analysts, customers no longer see tablets as a replacement for PCs. The vast majority of tablet buyers say tablets only prevent them from buying a PC. 
Actually, tablet is shifting to mainstream and entry-price brands, and are replacing notebook to become the important part of PC, particularly in emerging markets. If you combine PC and the tablet, you still can see very decent growth over the past couple of quarters. So with the PC market improving and the growth in tablets shifting, the key industry trends are moving to Lenovo's favor. In fact, if you combine PC and tablet together, Lenovo is already #2 worldwide in this measure. We want to firstly become the #1 in this category, and then challenge the top in all smart connected devices. 
Looking ahead, we are confident that Lenovo will continue to deliver outstanding performance in both PC and PC Plus, and we have proven that we deliver on our commitments, time after time, for now 18 straight quarters. 
Thank you very much. Now, let me turn to our CFO, Wai Ming.",1025
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2013",2013-11-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3474.0,548471.0,25111691.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 2. 
Next chart, please. We continue to grow in both sales and pretax income with margin expansion, even as the global PC market declined in quarter 2. Lenovo recorded growth in all its key businesses: PCs, smartphone and tablet. Strong growth in our smartphone and tablet business has added an important new source of sustainable growth for the group and this has now accounted for 15% of the group's turnover compared to 8% in quarter 2 last year. Group sales grew 13% year on year to around $9.8 billion. This is a record high level for Lenovo. Despite the market dropped 10% year-to-year, revenue derived from our PC business has recorded a 4% year-on-year gain to about $8 billion, driven by both shipments growth and increase in our ASP. 
Sales in our mobile Internet business were up 106% year-on-year to $1.5 billion. Gross profit was about $1.3 billion, up 11% year-on-year. Gross profit margin dipped slightly to 12.9% from 13.1% last year and 13.6% in quarter 1. The decline is largely due to the increased mix of our consumer and mobile Internet businesses. 
Operating expenses increased 5% year-on-year to $982 million to support our growth. The operating expense in quarter 2 has included expenses incurred in the CCE and EMC joint venture, in which we started the integration in quarter 4 last year. 
We have continued our efficiency improvement program started last quarter which involved in taking resources reduction in our PC business, and deploying some of those in our high-growth PC Plus businesses. This result in a $50 million severance expense incurred in quarter 2. The E/R ratio was down to 10%, from 10.8% last year and 11.3% last quarter, due to better scaling benefits and shrink in expense control. Operating profits was $283 million, up 38% year on year. Increase in other non-operating expense was largely due to additional financing and hedging costs. Pre-tax income was $265 million, up 30% year on year and this is a record high level for the group. 
          
PTI margin continued to improve year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and we are on track to deliver a 1% PTI margin improvement over 3-year period as disclosed in quarter 2 last year. 
The effective tax rate for Q2 was around 20%, which is in line with our average run rate around 20% to 25%. Profit attributable to equity holders is $220 million, up 36% year on year. Again, this is also a record high level for the group. 
Basic EPS improved to USD 0.0212 from USD 0.0158 last year. The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.06 per share, representing an increase of around 33% compared to last year.  Next chart, please. 
Our balance sheet in Q2 remains healthy. Noncurrent assets were about $4.7 billion, similar to last quarter. Current assets were also similar to last quarter, with a decline in cash and bank deposits, offset by increase in receivables, which is in line with our business growth. 
Inventory was relatively stable under tight control, even as we continue to increase our in-house manufacturing in China and Brazil, consolidation of our recent acquisition like CCE, as well as finished goods, especially for mobile Internet device to prepare for sales season in quarter 3. 
Net current liabilities were around $144 million, at the end of September. The noncurrent liabilities were at around $1.8 billion. 
Let's go for the cash and working capital in the next chart. We continue to leverage our strong cash position to support our strategic business expansion into high-growth areas, such as consumer business and mobile Internet device business, as well as enhancing our capability through increasing in-house manufacturing mix. This strategy continued to be in progress in quarter 2, as reflected in an increase in inventory to support the growth of both MIDH and Consumer business, as well as ramping up our new plants in China and Brazil. Adoption of this strategy also reflected on our cash conversion cycle trend. As a result, the cash conversion cycle has come down to negative 3 days in Q2 against negative 9 days last year. 
We recorded an operating cash outflow of 109 -- $189 million versus approximately an inflow of $140 million in Q1 this year and $143 million in Q2 last year. This yearly change is primarily due to a reduction of our cash conversion cycle of negative 3 days in Q2 versus negative 9 days last year as explained before.  The change when compared to Q1 is mainly due to the timing difference in relation to payment to certain suppliers. 
I want to emphasize here that the reduction of our cash position is a result of our strategic decision to leverage our balance sheet to invest in high-growth areas that resulted in our strong shipment growth in Q2. We expect this investment will help to continue our growth which, eventually, will be cash-generating in the near future. We expect the cash position to increase in Q3 and remain at a very strong cash position for working capital needs to drive future growth. Next chart, please. 
Despite the significant decline in the China market for the last few quarters, the group continues to maintain its overall growth in revenue, contributed by other geos that have been successfully expanding their business and recorded share gains. This resulted, the group now has a more balanced business derived from all our 4 geos. We continued to do well in all geographies in Q2 for both our PC and mobile Internet device business and our PC Plus strategy. Our balanced geographic exposure, especially markets outside China, including Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, continue to help contribute to our top line growth. We continue to record share gains across geographies, products and consumer segments. Result of our initial expansion of our smartphone and tablet business in market outside China was encouraging. 
Total revenue from China was up 1% year on year driven by strong growth in mobile internet devices which grew 45% year on year. Our overall margin in China was up 1.3 points year-on-year, and 0.1 point quarter-to-quarter to 5.3%. This reflected the successful execution of our Protect and Attack strategy to protect China PC profit through tighter control on pricing and expense control, which resulted in improved PC operating margin, while continuously attacking into mobile Internet markets, which resulted in overall increase in revenue. 
Our smartphone business in China continued to be profitable for the fourth consecutive quarter in Q2. As a result, we remain confident that our PC Plus strategy is fully operational in China and can continue to drive growth in sales and profit in China. 
Asia Pacific. Revenue was up slightly 1% year on year to about $1.5 billion in Asia Pacific while operating profit increased over 30% year-to-year to $25 million, which is a result of our solid PC Plus execution. 
We continued to do well in Japan and maintained our leadership position, but depreciation of Japanese Yen had negatively impacted sales in the region. Our drive in smartphone in this region has been encouraging, and we have reached 10% market share in smartphone in Indonesia, according to preliminary industry estimate, a strong growth also in tablet shipment. 
Our operating margin was up 0.05 points to 1.7% year-on-year, under the strong progress in the PC Plus area. 
EMEA, we continued to have a very strong encouraging quarter in EMEA, with record high market share. Revenue grew 26% year-on-year to about $2.3 billion. Strong growth in emerging markets and Consumer business contributed to the strong growth in the region. We achieved #1 position in 12 countries, including Germany and Russia, from just 3 countries last year. Our mobile Internet business, especially tablet business in Europe has also recorded encouraging feedback. But we are in the early phase of development and need further investment in the business, and as a result, our operating margin was down 0.01 point to 1.5% year-on-year. 
Americas. We continue to achieve strong growth in the region, with record high double-digit share. Unit shipments grew 39% against the market decline by above 4%. This represent a premium growth of over 40% in Americas and we reached double digit market share in the U.S. for the first time, driven by the strong growth in the U.S. commercial and consumer business. 
We also performed well in Brazil. Our integration of CCE has been on track, helping us achieve a record high market share in Brazil with the improving profitability. However, due to a change in product mix, especially from selling more entry-level mobile Internet product in the rest of Latin America, coupled with the competition of PC business in the region, has resulted in lower operating margin year-on-year.  Next chart, please. 
We also have a more balanced product portfolio helped by expansion in Consumer PC and mobile Internet business. We had a record high market share in notebooks at around 19%. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up about 3% and 8% year-on-year respectively. Unit shipments in our Desktop business went up 1%, and sales down 3% year-on-year. Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased to around 17%. Our MIDH business shows strong growth performance, up 1.06x year-on-year in sales led by the smartphone and tablet business, which fueled the strong growth of the group. We will continue to invest in innovation and broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitiveness and service to our customers. 
Before I end my presentation, I would want to give you some color of the market outlook. Our PC Plus strategy has been working well to drive good growth in sales and profit with margin expansion in the past several quarters. Strong growth momentum in our mobile Internet device business has been the driver of the group's solid growth. Despite the PC market has been volatile over the past several quarters, the combined PC and tablet markets has continued to see growth, and we are confident that this trend will continue. We expect our core PC business will benefit from the improving worldwide PC market in the second half of the year from corporate refreshment and the gradual recovery in China PC market. There are still enormous opportunity for growth in the traditional PC areas. 
Given that our smartphone business has reached certain critical scale in China, we will focus in improving the margin, while we are expanding our smartphone business aggressively to markets outside China. We'll continue to invest in growth areas in consumer PC and smartphone and tablets to maintain a healthy top line growth. We'll stay focused on our efficiency improvement initiatives and growth opportunities. We'll continue to invest in core competence building and product innovation. We have taken resource action in our PC business and deployed resources to invest in the high-growth areas to drive sustainable future growth. We have a healthy balance sheet and strong cash position will provide the flexibility of our, for our M&A strategy to capture opportunities in high-growth areas that can help to accelerate our growth and improvement in profitability.

Thank you, Kirk, for the question. So our consumer business was growing much faster than our commercial PC. So the consumer PC margin is lower than our commercial PC. But definitely, so we are making effort to improve the pretax income as well. So that means the consumer PC business -- business model is actually different from Commercial PC. So if commercial PC can grow around at 14%, 15% margin, 9%, 10% expense, then we have 4%, 5% PTI, probably consumer PC should be around at 11%, 12% margin but a 9% expense, but we still want to have a 3% -- like a 3% PTI. So these are different business models. So given our consumer PC business is growing faster than the commercial PC business, so this is a natural result. So our GP margin could be a little bit lower, but it will not impact our overall operational margin -- operating margin. So that's the answer to your question. So Wai Ming, you...",166

I think that Yuanqing basically gave up the total point. But one other thing that's very, very important that if I -- I mean, although we don't announce or disclose separately, I think, difference business model, we obviously see that. I think the margin is not declining, it's really the mix of the overall business that really drives. And therefore, one really should look at Lenovo by looking at how we actually be able to expand our business when the margin expands. When you look at the PC device business, meaning, the PC Plus tablet, I think, it's still growing, but obviously, the growth of the tablet is much faster, I think, than the PC business. Now you know that we have a very strong commercial business, which is obviously trading at a much higher gross margin, but on the other hand, I think we are -- we are making money I think, in the entry-level which, obviously, is expanding very, very quickly, I think, in the, I think, the smartphone, as well as the tablet business. As the result of that, I think, it's really a mix. And I think, the key to verify what, I think, Yuanqing and I just said is right is when you look at our operating margin, it's actually improved, I think, quarter-by-quarter as well as year-to-year.",229

As a follow-up, can I please ask you about your smartphone strategy, obviously, you are now #4 globally, #2 in China. So can you maybe give us some color on the strategy between high-end smartphones versus low-end smartphones, and between China and the non-China strategy, please?",50

So in China, definitely we want to strengthen our #2 position in short term. From long-term point of view, definitely we will make effort to become the leader of the market. But definitely, we understand that if we want to become the leader in the market, so we must strengthen our high-end smartphones. So that's why we launched 
the 10900 earlier this year. So just last month, we launched 2 new models, Vibe X and Vibe Z. Actually, we created these new sub-brands to just the folks on the high-end. So that's our strategy. So but definitely the high-end products, it's not just for China. It's for other emerging markets as well. So outside China, we launched our smartphone in first of all emerging countries like Russia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam. We have seen very positive results in those markets. So our market share in those markets has kept growing. Like Indonesia, now we have already reached 13% on market share. So and also, the profitability in that market is pretty good, it's pretty good, even better than in China. So we are very encouraged by this kind of result. So we definitely will double up this market. So the second wave -- we have studied at the launching the second wave of emerging countries. So hopefully over next couple of quarters, we will expand to 20 more countries, so that’s our current plan. Then probably -- so finally, so we will launch that in the mature markets. So that's our strategy for smartphones.",257

In preparation for your Wuhan facility, which I believe you said was coming online in the December quarter.

I think the answer is not in a significant way. I think the probably more visible impact is on the cash flow because we obviously need to I think build up the inventory and so on and so forth without seeing these sort of revenue coming in which is in this in Q3. So generally, I would say that no, it does not have any significant impact on our Q2 results because of the impending, I think, starting of operations of the Wuhan plant.",86

That was very clear. Just a quick follow-up, if I may. Just on the tablet business, very strong growth year-on-year. I believe in the presentation, 80% of your -- or about 80% of your tablets are being sold outside of China. Can you just elaborate maybe, which markets are you guys doing particularly well in, and maybe just what's driving the strength, product portfolio, what specific designs and features that is allowing you to deliver this type of growth?",80

So EMEA, Asia Pacific and American, so all are growing very fast. So, yes. I think now, we have very attractive product, particularly after we launch the Yoga Tablet. So we think we have strong product portfolio compared to our competition. So we are very confident, so we are keeping the higher growth over the second half of the year. So we are right on track to give you 10 million tablets by this fiscal year. So this is the first the priority we gave to our geographies. So they should protect our PC profit pool. But meanwhile, they should be more aggressive to attack the tablet market. So actually in my view now, our tablet has been part of the PC. So it's shifting from the premier price spend to the mainstream and the low end. So it's actually replacing the previous notebook market. But definitely because of the user experience and applications are much better than the previous notebook. So more and more consumers and users would like to accept that this kind of a product, so it will keep growing. But it's part of the PC. So from a development point of view, from the channel point of view, so we definitely can share a lot of common knowledge of channel network. So we are very comfortable we can be more successful in the tablet market across the planet.",244

Basically, it's summarizing that while everybody will see that, we actually have a very, I think, a strong capability in the sort of PC traditional PC business. As Yuanqing said that the tablet is really, I think considered part of the portfolio under the PC device. And therefore, you can sure that the scaling benefit of that is going to be enormous, because we're obviously now being number 1 in the world.

My first question is about the smartphone business. I understand that you just mentioned that you've achieved a critical mass in the smartphone business in China and you will be focusing on margin improvements and I'm wondering whether you can give us a margin target for the smartphone business, operating margin target, I mean. And also, I remember that you mentioned there are ways to improve margins for your smartphone business in China, including the channel mix and also the product mix low end, mid-to-high end. And can you give an update about your channel mix right now and also product mix low end versus mid-to-high. Thank you.",121

I think, as you know, that we do not actually want to disclose openly about our sort of margin target for -- I think one of the probably the most attractive margin in the world. But we definitely can tell you that from a directional point of view, that China now we do have the critical mass. I think there are 2 directions. I think, overall, will derive better profitability. I think one thing we definitely will go aggressive is really developing our capability moving our portfolio I think from an entry more to a sort of high end or main market. So that, that is definitely 1 way of improving the sort of gross margin. The other area as you mentioned that is really the mix that we sell through open market versus selling through the telecom operators. While I don't have the numbers, I think in front of me compared with quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year but very, very high level obviously. I think the year-to-year basis obviously is more because we started the business by I think focusing initially, I think the operator do have the volume but I don't have the exact numbers but I can get my colleagues to get back to you some sort of the mix change I think over the period.",222

The way to do it is as you said, improving the mix of our portfolio, as well as our channel mix. And what Yuanqing said is, I think, the Wave 2 result of our success in China, I think we're going to move in the emerging market. That obviously is a very, very encouraging results, as Yuanqing just said that. I think some markets was obviously is much faster in turning to profitability in the process of us, I think, growing the market share. And so far, I think, in some of the high-growth market, we achieve reasonable or a very I think, respectable market share within a very strong period of time.",189

We grow year-to-year about 38%, 39%. No doubt, I think our strong hold in commercial I think, we could make contribution of that. So we're definitely seeing evidences that I think there are growing demand, I think in I would say, mature markets, in particular North America. And in China, again, I think, if you -- I think, set aside the PC business, you relook at the economy, I think the rate, I think the economy, probably, is a lot more optimistic than say, 1 quarter or 2 ago. And again, you based on the industry projection, although China is doing the negative territory, probably so in Q3, our Q3. But the rate of decline is actually slowing down. We definitely are confident that I think, with the sort of government meetings later in the month, I think setting out a new direction, give clarity about how the economy is going to grow, that definitely is a very good news for the overall Chinese economy. And therefore, we definitely will be the one that benefit most I think, from a demand for I think, PC or/and PC device.",235

First is, we resell our EMC storage, the second one is, we sell to and we sell through EMCs for our servers. So but they definitely, that would happen to strengthen our server portfolio. The third part is, we have mentioned, of course, Iomega to focus on the SMB and the consumer customers. So the first part, I think, the progress has been very good. So we are building our capability to sell the storage products, in particular higher storage actually, larger enterprise customers. The second one, I think in the projects part, so we -- before we started to do, to shift to EMC -- and we shift through EMC we need to strengthen our product portfolio. So this year we have invested a lot strengthening our server product portfolios. So I hope since next year we can see the positive results.  Regarding the joint venture of the Iomega. So this company was focusing on their consumer customers before. So now, we are trying to shift the focus to the SMB customers. So I think we are in the right direction on the project.",193

I think that we, obviously as Yuanqing said, reposition the portfolio I think, to satisfy the SMB demand or satisfy SMB customers. I think, we definitely see quarter in quarter out improvement in profitability, but still today, it's not a significant business. But we believe that with the transition of the portfolio, I think leveraging on the Lenovo sales infrastructure. I think that it is going to be, in the near term, going to bring us much better results than what we saw in the first few quarters after we closed the transaction.",111

How much was, or was Brazil, the CCE acquisition a factor in that? Was that profitability lower than the overall America's profitability?",38
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2013",2013-11-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3474.0,548471.0,25111723.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,34,"Yes, definitely. So our Brazilian business is getting better and better. So leveraging our acquisition of CCE so not only on the growth side but also on the profitability side. And so regarding the growth, actually, right after we apply the CCE, so our combine the market share so probably was just 7%, 8%, so we will still rank that #3. But this fiscal year, so the first 2 quarters, so we have made a lot of progress. So actually, last quarter we gained 18% share in the Brazilian market in the PC area. So that's a very encouraging result. Actually, beyond the PC, so we have, we are making a lot of progress on our PC Plus strategy. So we sold many smartphones, tablets and TVs in the Brazilian market. So that's very encouraging us, but definitely -- even more important thing is, that we significantly improved our profit level so, in Brazil. So that's a very important contribution to our improvement in the American growth.",167

Let me maybe give you a little color. I definitely do not share the view that the America probability is not exciting. I think the way look at it is, I think if you really look at, as I explained you earlier, I think the profitability is driven by pretty much, the mix of your business. And as you can see that when we grow the business, the market is actually decline. If you relook at North America, the market declined negative for AG, American Group. The market dropped negative 4, we actually grow 39. So growing at such a premium, you will go with out a that it is a lot of, well some of those, if not all of those, coming out from consumer, which obviously, has a lower margin, I think, at least on a gross margin basis compared to our sort of pure commercial. But if you really see this significant amount of growth in North America, while we actually be holding the margin from a quarter in, quarter out basis. Because Q2 last year and Q2 this year, I think there is significant change or significant improvement in the business. And in fact, Q2 this year, I think is the first time we actually hit double market share in North America. So I actually would say that the America is one of the key contributors I think, for Lenovo to have a much more balanced business, I think comparing the past, that we obviously been a leader in China. And when China actually slow down has a much bigger impact. But today, I think, we actually I think, be able to deal with that problem. Because I think the 2 biggest contributors, one of which is America, actually is doing very well. So in some sense, I disagree with the observation that our America is not good. It's actually very, very exciting because holding margins as well as I think growing of this premium to the market, as well as the first time to hit, I think, double-digit in terms of market share, is that very, very exciting. And on top of that, although from an absolute point of view that Brazil is still -- compared with North America is more, but we definitely see significant improvement I think, in profitability, as well as I think, subject to I think, the final IDC number I think we are probably reaching the pole position in Brazil.",415

Just 1 follow-up on that. So could you talk about what is your consumer market share in the U.S. I just wanted to understand whether there has been a lot of spending on the operating expenses and you're just catching up in terms of the consumer scale.,48

Yes, I think maybe, I know that there is a sort of one-on-one, I think we will do it in more details so maybe we can actually do with your question, I think generally, I think there's a lot of opportunity, I think, we do -- I think, from the product innovation, the Yoga that we've been doing very, very well, and we believe that the Yoga tablet we just launched again will do equally well. I think this is a result of our continuing effort in spending in the innovative product in product development. But I can actually sort of go through a lot more detail with you, I think during the one-on-one call later this evening.",119

For example, [indiscernible] has the P100 that's launching to the USD 350 range. So we are just wondering, like what's the pricing environment last year, is it all there in terms of the PC hybrid device, in terms of the pricing pressure, are we going to see accelerated labor next year?",77

So I think, definitely some competitors will launch some new products with a more aggressive pricing. But we go outperform the competition. We were definitely not scared of the competition. So, and also, I believe, we have the best product, not just for the commercial customer, but also for the consumer customers. So like the Yoga, Helix, these kinds of products. So but not just the innovation, actually -- I believe Lenovo is the most efficient PC company in the world. So we have the best, the balance between innovation and the efficiency. So we -- I believe -- so we work not just to keep our number 1 position, but also we will further grow our market share and improve our profitability in the PC space. PC is definitely our home base, our stronghold, so we will make this business as our profit pool to fund our growth in those new areas of smartphone and the tablets enterprise business.",173

That actually demonstrates we have the ability and we've demonstrated our ability to be able to win in market not in 1 segment, but also, in a premium segment, as well as in an entry-price segment. As Yuanqing said, we can't stop our competitors I think really coming out with a low price. And I think, our business model, as I explained earlier, I think the consumer and the commercial or the high-end or the main market I think, they are slightly different business models, in the sense that we can actually have a product selling at a higher margin, then we obviously will spend more money in marketing I think, in getting the business. But at the same time, if it is an entry product where the price is low, I think our efficiency actually coming into play, and at the end of the day, I think, we actually been accretive to our PTI. So I think, the last 16 quarters has already demonstrated that we have the ability to do so, and there is no reason why we worry that, I think certain player coming out to cover 1 product, I think, will give us significant problem.",229
