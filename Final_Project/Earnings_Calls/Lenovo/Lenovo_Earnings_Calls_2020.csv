Welcome to Lenovo's earnings webcast. Thanks to everyone for joining us. This is Jenny Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Before we start, let me introduce our management team joining the call today. We have Lenovo's Chairman Mr. Yang Yuanqing; Corporate President and COO, Mr. Gianfranco Lanci; Group CFO, Mr. Wong Wai Ming; President of Data Center Group, Mr. Kirk Skaugen; and President of Motorola, Mr. Sergio Buniac.
We will begin with a presentation shortly. And after that, we will open the call for questions. Without further ado, let me turn the call over to Yuanqing. Yuanqing, please.",103
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833320.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we start, I want to share my heartfelt sympathy to those affected by the novel coronavirus. I also would like to express my deepest appreciation to all medical professionals for their dedication in fighting the diseases. Lenovo also responded immediately to the outbreak. We have donated and installed all IT equipment necessary to construct the 2 new hospitals in Wuhan. Donation from Lenovo employees and the Lenovo Foundation has arrived at places they need. We have also given away 100 activation keys of our remote office and the online meeting solutions to hospitals and small- and the medium-sized businesses, which are heavily impacted by the epidemic.
Although the outbreak happened around the Chinese New Year, Lenovo reacted right away and worked day and night throughout the holiday to implement a series of measures to protect the safety and well-being of our employees. Thanks to our global manufacturing footprint, while our factories in China are some of the first ones to resume production in the industry. Our factories outside of China continued to operate. While the demand in China is impacted temporarily, the demand from the rest of the world remains strong, which will help accelerate the recovery of our capacity in China. We have also been working closely with our supply chain partners to ensure normal operation. 
Now let me turn to our quarterly earnings. Last quarter, despite the geopolitical uncertainties and the industry-wide supply shortages, we demonstrated our world-class operation and the strategy execution capability in delivering a record setting performance. Both global revenue and the pretax income reached all-time highs. Our Group revenue was USD 14.1 billion. Pretax income grew by double digits year-on-year and reached USD 390 million. Net income also improved by double digits year-on-year to USD 258 million. These results will not be possible without our operational excellence, which allowed us to overcome the severe industry-wide CPU shortage. 
We have quickly adjusted our product portfolio, converted every available supply to our product that meets our customers' requirement. And greatly reduced our finished goods inventory. So these efforts enabled our PC and Smart Devices business to deliver all-time records in revenue, in pretax income and in profit margin. 
In PC, we not only extended our clear #1 position with record high shipments, but also outperformed the market year-on-year. Our strategy to focus on a high-growth under premium segments continues to deliver results. The volume in Gaming, Thin & Light, Visuals, Workstations and Chromebooks continued to grow at higher double digits and significantly outgrew the market year-on-year. 
Innovation provides us another important growth driver. At the recent consumer electronics show, we demonstrated our leading technology in 5G and foldable with innovative products such as world's first 5G PC. Under the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold, which was named one of Time's 2019 best inventions. 
The ThinkBook Plus notebook PC with e-ink display on top also received a very positive feedback. 
Looking forward, while micro challenges may continue with a proven operational excellence and breakthrough innovation, we are confident that we will continue to drive premium-to-market growth in our PC business and the industry-leading profitability. 
Our Mobile business delivered its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. In our stronghold, Latin America, our volume outgrew the market by 19 points, while improving profitability. 
Going forward, our Mobile business will continue to strengthen profitability while driving growth in new markets. Our new Motorola razr foldable has received greater responses from investors, media and tech opinion leaders. We will build on this excitement to re-enter the premium segment.
In Data Center, our server volume grow by 18% year-on-year, though Data Center revenue remained flat year-on-year as a sharp component price reduction resulted in erosion of average sales price. 
Profitability continued to improve year-on-year. Our non-hyperscale business had its highest revenue in 4 years and grew nearly 16%. Especially in China, it was up almost 46% year-on-year. We continue to see strong -- over 40% year-on-year revenue growth in Software Defined Infrastructure and Storage. 
Looking forward, we will resume revenue growth in DCG. In our Hyperscale business, we will expand our business with the existing customers and continue to acquire new customers. 
In our non-hyperscale business, we will continue to drive premium-to-market growth in servers, Software Defined Infrastructure, High Performance Computing, storage, software and services with the increasing customer diversity and a broader indirect channels. 
Our Intelligent Transformation continued to show strong momentum. In Smart IoT, revenue almost quadrupled year-on-year, driven by strong growth in AR/VR, Smart Home and Smart Office. Smart Infrastructure also grew more than 50% year-on-year, driven by Software Defined and Network Function Virtualization. Smart Vertical revenue doubled, thanks to triple-digital revenue growth in Data Intelligence Business Group, Smart health care and Smart education solutions. 
We have noticed accelerated demand in China for our remote office, online education, online health care and other online services solution due to impact of the ongoing epidemic. 
Last but not least, as we mentioned in the last quarter, our software and services revenue continued its hypergrowth and reached USD 1 billion in a quarter for the first time, up 41% year-on-year. 
Looking forward, things there are still much uncertainty around the novel coronavirus. We will actively manage this evolving situation through our geographical balance, operational excellence and a solid strategic execution. We are confident in overcoming this challenge and quickly resume to the normal. 
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming, please.",911

I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q3 fiscal year 2020. 
Next chart, please. Let me share with you the financial highlights. We are pleased to announce another record quarter for the group. Our third quarter revenue was $14.1 billion, a new record and up 0.5% year-on-year or nearly 2% in constant currency. Our business groups delivered exceptional execution against a backdrop of the severe supply constraint. 
Gross profit increased 10% year-on-year, and gross profit margin expanded 1.5 percentage points to 16.1%, thanks to favorable sales mix. Our team efforts in driving continued sales mix improvement paid off. 
The improvement of Data Center Business was again in a positive profit [ catalyst ]. Our transformation actions had led to accelerated growth in high-margin software and services business, and in turn, improved overall profitability. 
Operating expenses rose 10% to $1.8 billion, and the E/R ratio was 12.6%, up 1.1 percentage points year-on-year, driven by our continued investment in sales, marketing, research and development. 
The group PTI increased 11% year-on-year. And PTI dollar is at an all-time high. Among all business group, our PCSD business is the largest in the world, with the highest ever PTI margin, while MBG and DCG continue to improve their profitability. Our ability to set a new milestone in PTI demonstrated our ability to deliver strong margins and robust growth on earnings per share despite the supply constraint.
 
Net profit attributable to equity holders was $258 million, up 11% year-on-year. Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0216 from USD 0.0196 last year. 
Next chart, please. In Q3, our cash generated in operation was $538 million compared to $1.2 billion cash-generating in the first half of the fiscal year. We made less cash from operations compared to the corresponding period last year due to the 2 initiatives we took in the quarter. We have built some strategic position on critical parts, leading to a $206 million increase in total inventory year-on-year during the quarter, and our accounts receivable factoring volume dropped year-to-year. 
Next chart, please. Our Intelligent Device Business Group, consisting of PC and Smart Device business group and Mobile business group, achieved a record quarterly revenue, thanks to the strong growth in premium segments within PCSD and the strength in the software and services business, with the all-time high pretax margin in PCSD and proper expansion in MBG, our IDG delivered a PTI of $687 million, up 17% year-on-year and its PTI margin increased 0.8 percentage point year-on-year to 5.5%. 
Next chart, please. In Q3, despite being hit by key component shortage, the PCSD business group revenue grew 3% year-on-year to a record of $11.1 billion. Our team continued to execute a strategy to capitalize on the high-growth and premium segments growth potential. The revenue from premium products across Workstation, Thin & Light, Visual and Gaming PC grew double digits year-on-year and now contribute more than half of PCSD's revenue. 
We are making important progress in our Intelligent Transformation by focusing on our Software & Services business, with its revenue up by a strong double-digit year-on-year and carried the highest margin profile among all products. 
Leveraging this strategic shift in the sales mix, the PCSD business group set a record PTI margin of 6.2% in quarter 3 and reinforce its leadership position, not only in the PC shipments, but also profitability. 
Next chart, please. MBG also suffered from a supply constraint, resulting in a year-on-year revenue decline of 17%. Its focused strategy to invest and develop the business in regions where it has competitive advantages remain effective, helping MBG deliver positive PTI for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Latin America remains a stronghold, and MBG's margin further expanded in this region. 
The MBG business is accelerating its innovation by launching attractive new products, including the recently announced foldable smartphone, the razr. This product has earned positive customer reviews, and will start contributing to the business revenue as well as providing an opportunity to upsell and re-enter the premium segment. 
Next chart, please. In Data Center Group, the business momentum is improving. Our server shipments grew 18% year-on-year, although revenue growth was again constrained by low average selling prices, a lingering problem caused by the significant correction in commodity prices. 
Our DCG revenue was $1.6 billion, largely flat year-on-year. 
Our non-hyperscale business reported its highest quarterly revenue in 4 years, representing double-digit year-on-year growth. We delivered strong growth in Data Center Infrastructure, Software Defined Infrastructure, Storage and Software & Services. 
Our DCG operation in China sees the opportunity to broaden its sales operation product portfolio. 
The storage revenue grew at a strong double-digit rate, thanks to the NetApp joint venture, a new product growth in entry and mid-range flash arrays. Our software defined infrastructure product performance have win market share and achieved strong double-digit revenue growth. 
For Hyperscale business, the annual revenue comparison was most difficult for the period under review. And therefore, its revenue was still down year-on-year. However, the price erosion will come to an anniversary after this quarter, implying easier base of comparison going forward. Our DCG strategy is to balance between future investment and profitability. In Q3, the business further narrowed its losses by USD 8 million year-on-year to USD 47 million. 
Next chart, please. Looking forward, macro risk factors, especially novel coronavirus outbreak could bring short-term volatility. The unfortunate health crisis could lead to meaningful disruption in Chinese demand and supply chain. For us, the delay in employees returning to work has had the biggest impact on our business. The majority of our factories in China have reopened and are now operational, albeit on a limited basis due to transportation and travel limitations. Our suppliers and logistic service across the country also affected. 
Given the situation remains extremely dynamic, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimation of the full financial impact. Nevertheless, we believe this is a one-off event, and our priority is to work with our supply chain to regain 100% capacity as soon as possible. We have continuous decline in place, and we'll leverage our global manufacturing capabilities and strategic supply partnership. 
We expect a rebound of demand in China after stabilization of the health crisis, where the demand from the rest of the world remains strong, will help accelerate the recovery of our business in China. 
Further, our demand drivers could also emerge to bode well for our businesses. For example, our PCSD and DCG businesses are well poised to benefit from the trend of remote education, remote work, home entertainment and remote health consulting. We are confident of driving long-term profitable growth when we aim to deliver a premium-to-market growth on the group top slide. 
For PCSD, our goal is to continuously deliver industry-leading profitability and increase of sales in high-growth and premium segments as well as accelerating our software and services expansion to sustain premium-to-market revenue growth. 
For Mobile, we'll continue to deliver innovative new products. Together with the launch of our 5G services, we look for potential growth opportunities by building more profitable core markets. 
For Data Center business, our journey to improvement has just begun. The trend of data growth is expected to accelerate following the development of more products and applications, featuring new technologies, including 5G. Lenovo will tap into this opportunity to drive growth in multiple segments, including enterprise server, Software Defined Infrastructure, Storage and Software & Services. 
For Hyperscale business, the group will leverage its differentiated in-house design and in manufacturing capability to broaden its customer base. We are going to increase our pocket share within existing customers by expanding product coverage from service to storage. We expect an improvement of hyperscale business and better profitability, when the new share wins are fully operational. 
Thank you. And now we can take your questions.",1300

First of all, just to get some more clarity on the near-term challenges. Could you talk a little bit more specific on both the demand outlook, given the virus outbreak as well as in the supply side, when do we expect to get back to a reasonable level of supply for various product groups over the next couple of months? That's my first question. 
Second question is on the server side, Data Center Group, it looks like Hyperscale seems to be the only area which is not yet ramping up in terms of growth. Non-Hyperscale growth seems to be ramping up both outside China as well as in China. Could we talk a little bit about what kind of growth are we expecting either for fiscal '21 or calendar '20? And when do we expect Hyperscale to come back to strong double-digit growth after being relatively weak in the last several quarters?",161
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833325.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,6,"Thank you, Gokul. I will answer your first question. So probably Gianfranco can help to add something. Then Kirk Skaugen will answer your second question. So definitely coronavirus outbreak impacted our demand in China and our production capacity in China as well. Mainly because of 3 reasons. 
First, so -- we have delayed our factory reopen time. Second, so let workers come back to the factory. So supply is also impacted, particularly the cost components that are produced by the smaller suppliers. So they are also facing the issue to reopen the factory. But for Lenovo, we are more optimistic on our supply, although it will be impacted in this quarter as well. So regarding of the factory, we open, so now -- by now, most of our factories in China have already been reopened again, except for Wuhan and Chengdu factories. So we see a multiple problem in this cost guided by those 2 cities. 
Regarding of workers. So we are providing the support and incentives to encourage more workers to come back to work. So 2 factories are more important for our PC supply. Volume at Shenzhen another issue reported. So our current estimation is by the end of this month, we can resume 100% production to start in Shenzhen by the end of this month. And we can resume 7 as I said, [indiscernible] by the end of this month. So definitely, for Wuhan factory, so it's mainly for smartphone. So we are waiting for government guidance, to be [indiscernible] on the Chengdu is mainly for sales comp. And also -- Lenovo has a very diversified manufacturing footprint. So we actually have the global footprint. So that will help us -- help ourselves as well. 
So we have smartphone manufacturing factory in Brazil, in India. So that will have our Smartphone business, particularly in Latin America and then in North America. And also we have a factory in Japan, in Mexico, in U.S. for our PC and the server as well. So that will help our PC and server business in the rest of the world. From demand point of view, so definitely China current quarter will be impacted. So the good news is cycle of work, our demand for all our products, including PC, smartphone and data center are still very strong. So as I said, no wonder we can leverage our rest of work manufacturing facility to fulfill this demand, but also that can help our China manufacturing -- factory to ramp up. So that's regarding your first question. 
So I don't know whether Gianfranco, you want to add something to that. By the way, so regarding of the supply. So I talked about the third important message is supply. So right after the outbreak of the virus, so we realize the issue. So we immediately are pulling some supply to our warehouse. So yes, so I think for a shorter period, we have enough of component to resume the operation, resume the factory production. And also we are helping most of the suppliers, smaller suppliers to resume work, to resume the operations so that from longer point of view. So we still can have enough component in supply. So that's my answer. So Gianfranco, you want to add something here?",546
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833326.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,7,"Yes, I think a couple of things. One, we will be ready to ask, when will be back to full capacity, I think, that within Q1 by the end of March, we should be able, at least in Israel and some other factories it'll be back at 100% capacity. The other thing is that we see production does go down in China. On the other side, we still see very strong demand on PC in the rest of the world, U.S., EMEA, and Japan, Asia Pacific. So I think in terms of demand in the rest of the world, we could see a very good demand. The only problem is really in China. That's even though transition to -- the China transition to [ Windows 10 ] clearly, it's not over yet, because even in Japan that the forecast or the projection from major market analyst, it was very negative. We could see a very good demand.",157
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833327.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,8,"Yes. So by the way, this quarter, it's not Lenovo's peak quarter. So our peak quarter requested last quarter, Q2 I think [indiscernible]. So when I talk about the capacity, it's definitely about the peak capacity. So that means the impact to our shipments in this quarter will be less than last quarter, even refer to the same situation. So that's what I want to -- want you to understand. Okay. So Kirk, I mean -- would you, please answer your second question?",83
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833328.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,9,"Yes, this is Kirk speaking. So with regards to the Hyperscale business, I think we have very strong confidence as we go into our next fiscal year, that demand is definitely recovering. At the existing accounts we have, we've been holding or growing share, relatively, consistently. A few of those customers were still working through excess capacity but there's a few things that I think should give us confidence. Number one, we're winning business now in storage, not just in the server space. And we're winning business in the hundreds of millions of dollar range in storage, which is the first for us. 
The second is, we have confidence because in the past, we have been a system integrator and perhaps not the motherboard supplier to some of these large accounts, but with our ODM+ strategy, we know 18 months in advance that we have gotten design wins for motherboards, and that will improve our profitability as well as our ability to manage our supply chain more effectively than if we were acquiring boards from an OEM. 
The third thing is we're seeing components like SSD and memory, that had seen the largest drops in a decade. Now beginning to grow again, which will improve the revenue outlook year-on-year. So I would say, as we've said before, we're in 6 of the top 10 hyperscalers in the world. And we expect in the next fiscal year to be growing significantly across almost all of those. 
In addition, we just added a sales force to cover the next wave of hyperscalers globally, and we have acquired now dozens of new customers that will be coming online in the next fiscal year. We are waiting week-by-week to look at where we do rely on ODMs for motherboards, how their factories are coming back. But for the stuff we had internally, we have plants in Hungary, plants in Monterrey and plants in Whitsett that are all up and operationally supplying the demand this quarter.",331

I'm grateful for results. Firstly, I would like to have an update on all the U.S. sector like, your PC, I think the memory price hike is possibly for data centers, but we worry about the memory price hike, will impact our your PC margin. Also on smartphone -- yes, I can understand like a near-term demand could be kept due to the coronavirus in China. But how do you feel like the 4G smartphone inventory in China? I feel like the 4G smartphone inventory is pretty high. And lastly, about data center. Can I have more update about like qualitative driver.

We need to see with the coronavirus and with -- in the current environment what is going to happen in the next couple of quarters because we have seen already during the last couple of weeks that rather than increase, they started to decrease again, as we start to see memory going down again. 
But I think in terms of impact on the margin, I don't see any major issue in terms of impact on the margin. For a couple of reasons, we have built up a very good inventory in terms of memory. So we have enough component for at least for this quarter and also next quarter. And on the other side, the price are now slowing down again. And we will manage also in terms of configuration and pricing in order to avoid any impact on the margin. So frankly speaking, I don't see any major issue on memory.",170

So I mean we see the opposite. I think our inventory levels are slightly below target as we ended Q3 over the globe, including China. Our activations in Q3 were much higher than our selling by almost 0.5 million globally, what's not normal for this period. And in this current quarter, we are still seeing very strong activations, even if some measures we take to contain the expenses. So we're expecting the inventory by the end of this quarter, as we are not seeing any drop in activations to be extremely health both in 4G and, of course, we are just launching 5G phones in the next few weeks. So we -- I feel actually the opposite right now. We have a very health inventory position, much, much better than a year ago and much better than 1 quarter ago, what's not normal for this at the time of the year.",152

So I agree with Buniac. So actually rest of the world. So last quarter, we -- our volume and volume readiness are dropped, as mainly because the supply issue -- supply shortage. So actually, we sold more product than we -- we sold out more products in the retail part, than we sale into the future business and the retailers. So we don't have the inventory issue in the rest of the world. So I think, probably the majority inventory, you talked about is in China. Fortunately, in China, we -- our business is another one, the big part. So actually, we don't have right now inventory issue and [indiscernible]. So probably, it will give us more opportunity to grow our business with new products. Okay. So regarding of the PC, Kirk, could you please answer the last question.",140
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3557.0,1928894.0,75833338.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,19,"Yes. I think the simplest answer is we're seeing strong premium-to-market across all geographies and in all segments. So hyperscale demand is recovering and strong. It should get stronger each quarter as we go through the next fiscal year. Again, because I mentioned earlier, not just in servers, but also in storage. And with improved profitability as higher end workloads like SAP HANA, move to the cloud, we're supplying not just 2-socket, but 4-socket and even 8-socket capabilities to some of the large cloud providers to meet that demand. And obviously, those margins are better than some of the entry products. Our non-Hyperscale revenue, as you heard, was the highest in 4 years, and we're seeing premium-to-market growth, and we should continue to see that across software defined infrastructure. 
We're seeing strong growth across our hyper-converged infrastructure from Microsoft, from Nutanix, from VMware as well as from smaller players like the Pivot3. On storage, especially in all-flash arrays and hybrid flash arrays, we've seen more than 40% growth across our aggregate storage business, both with the NetApp joint venture in China, but also with the expanded entry and mid-range portfolio we have in the rest of the world. 
On services, we're making very good progress. Our attach rate on services penetration is up another 7% year-on-year. So we have our highest-ever deferred revenue on the balance sheet now, which should continue, again, consistently improving every quarter. And then in supercomputing, we've continued to use our Neptune warm-water cooling to deliver on the top 500 list. Now 1 and 3 of the top 500 computers in the world run Lenovo, and we have coverage now in 50% of the countries that are even on the list. So that's 14 countries in the world, where we're #1 in total core, #1 in aggregate performance with 35% share. So the simplest answer to your question is we're seeing strong premium-to-market growth and want to continue that on the top line. And this is our 10th consecutive quarter of PTI improvement. We want to continue that, while still driving premium-to-market revenue growth.",348

So could you elaborate more or like what's our edges, advantages here? And who we are winning over the market share? And what's our target market? Is it China or outside of China? 
And my second question is on smartphones. So I would like to know like how much of the production is coming from the Wuhan factory? And can our other factories cover the supply? And will this affects our mobile business profitability?",105

So I think what we are seeing is in -- whether you're talking about the larger players like Nutanix, Microsoft and VMware, in many cases, what we're hearing from our partners is that we may not be their largest partner, but we're definitely their fastest-growing partner. So we're seeing a good balance and good consistent growth across Nutanix, VMware and Microsoft on Azure HCI and others. There is also some smaller players like Scale Computing, Pivot3 where we're doing some really good work around smart city in terms of protecting citizens, like we've said publicly before for cities like Bogota and others. So certainly, in China, we're also seeing strong growth there, but it's been a consistent strong premium-to-market quarter after quarter for many quarters now, and we think that will continue. Our differentiation is we've built our ThinkAgile brand to make it the most simple, highest performance, highest reliable solution in the market. Thank you.",157

So let me say, so first half of our volume is produced -- manufactured in China and around 60% to 70% of that's in Wuhan. So the factories we're opening tomorrow, and I think we expect some short-term volatility, and you manage through that. Now that said, the Brazil factory, the India factory, they can -- we can increase capacity, if we need in the near future. So we are managing carefully. Let's see how it goes around half in China from what, 70% in Wuhan.",87

So I have 2 questions. The first one is, in the very beginning, you guys talked about how there are some components from smaller suppliers that could be in constraint. Could you just give us a little bit more details on what kind of components these are? And whether how much inventory we have right now and how we are thinking about that if there are any kind of logistics constraints where we could see some component shortages? 
And my second question is, throughout this coronavirus outbreak situation, we're hearing across the supply chain that there are increased labor costs, logistics costs and just all kinds of different costs, how will that impact our profitability this quarter and perhaps the next quarter? Or maybe are we able to pass it on to our end customers?",139

So to produce a product, even lack of a small piece of component, you cannot finish that. So I have heard some of our competitors, just because they are lack of the package, so they cannot resume the operations. But fortunately, for Lenovo because we realized the issue earlier, so we prepared earlier. So as I just said -- talk to you -- so even before the Chinese New Year, we realized the issue. We've started deploying all the components as early as possible as many as possible. So by now, I think we have enough components to ensure a couple of weeks production. I would note that we think, we have not inventory to issue a couple of months, but a couple of weeks. So we are okay. So like we said for our parts. 
But for sure -- if you want to reinsure, so we will not have any issue here. So we need to -- issue of the smaller suppliers can resume the work -- can resume the operations as early as possible. So we are trying to help them to get the approval from the government as early as possible. So that -- regarding of the labor costs. So actually, the labor cost accounts for small portion of our total CapEx. So I'm not rather worried about the significant impact. So it will impact a little bit, but not a significant.

I think there are two different, I would say, when you look about the shortage, I think there are 2 different kind of shortage. One is, for sure, the impact coming from the coronavirus. And the other is that we did see some shortage on the CPU. The situation is improving, but it's not yet mobilized. And much frankly speaking on both, as you see from Q3 results, I don't see any negative impact on the margin, maybe we can get some positive impact from the margin, simply because the entire market will be short of product, there is no reason to rather down -- lower down price or to take action or to clean inventory. So all these things are our job.
And in terms of margin, we have been able to -- if I look at Q3 and if you look at the results, I mean we have been able even to improve margin in a difficult situation in terms of supply -- in terms of component supply. So I really don't see any margin impact on -- negative margin impact. I may see an impact in terms of some positive margin impact due to the shortage, but simply because -- as I said, demand worldwide on PC is still very, very good. And probably in Q1, the entire market, the entire industry will not have enough supply.",231

So I want to echo Gianfranco's point. So actually, operational excellence is Lenovo's core competence. So not only we know how to manage the margins during the supply shortage. So as Gianfranco said, there is actually the supply shortage probably will help us to improve the gross profit. But also -- so even in the supply shortage situation, we still can manage our business well. So last quarter it was actually a very good example. So actually, we planned to sell more Intel-based chips to the beginning of the quarter. But we were informed, so we couldn't cater the supply that are committed at the beginning of the quarter -- in the middle of the quarter, so like November. But we quickly shifted our product portfolio and the supply to other CPU lender, SMB and media -- with Media Tech. 
So it doesn't help us to deliver this historical high shipment and the revenue. And also the fantastic performance in our PCSD. So actually the PCSD delivered historical high shipment, historical high revenue and the profits, that's because of our excellent operational capability. So we had a very short period to adjust, but we did that. So actually, last quarter, we sold almost [indiscernible] PCs. And also we sold more media chat with that the Chromebook as well -- so in Lenovo's history. So that's the kind of our capability. We did in the west that even 1 unit of the supply. So at the end of the quarter, so we converted those supply into the finished goods and into the -- and to meet the customer requirements. So that's for sure, Lenovo's unique core competence. We believe that we'll have it in current quarter as well.",288

Thank you for joining us today. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical uncertainty, Lenovo delivered outstanding results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020/2021. In this challenging environment, our group revenue and profit both delivered strong growth. Revenue reached USD 13.3 billion, growing almost 7% year-on-year and achieved a double-digit growth without the currency exchange impact. Profit showed even stronger growth as pretax income was up 38% year-on-year, reaching USD 332 million. And the net income grew 31% year-on-year, reaching USD 213 million. 
In our Intelligent Devices Group, PC and Smart Devices delivered another fantastic quarter. Revenue grew by double digits year-on-year to USD 10.6 billion. Pretax income reached USD 670 million, also up almost 28% year-on-year. We improved the industry-leading profitability by almost 1 point to a new record of 6.3%. 
As I predicted last quarter, the PC market grew by double digits due to increased demand driven by work-from-home and e-learning, much more than the previous industry forecast of a market decline. Although supply shortage in Chromebook temporarily impacted our volume, we remained the leading company in PC and tablets. Particularly in the Consumer PC segment, our revenue saw strong growth of over 45% year-on-year. Volume also grew almost 32% year-on-year. Likewise, quickly adapting to consumers' new purchasing habits in laptop, our worldwide e-commerce revenue also delivered a strong growth of over 50% year-on-year. Driven by these successes, our PC and Smart Devices revenue in EMEA and China grew 30% and 18%, respectively. Our focus on high-growth and premium segments continues to drive results. We maintained a strong double-digit volume growth in Chromebook, Visuals, Thin & Light and Gaming. 
Looking forward, we expect this strong PC tablet and the display demand will be a long-term trend. We will develop more innovative products to adapt to the new requirements of work-from-home and e-learning and further strengthen our global supply chain to meet the faster-growing demand. Meanwhile, we will continue to develop our e-commerce platform and the focus on high-growth segments to drive premium-to-market growth with leading profitability. 
Although mobile business is still hit hard by COVID-19 and the foreign exchange rates, our revenue declined 27% year-on-year. The momentum has greatly improved. The quarter-to-quarter revenue increased 33%. Volume outgrew the market year-on-year in key markets like Latin America, North America and Europe. Particularly, we achieved a historical high market share in Latin America and North America. 
Looking forward in mobile, we will continue to leverage our strong product portfolio, innovative technology, particularly in 5G, and expand the carrier range to resume profitable growth. 
Our Data Center business revenue resumed hyper growth of almost 20%, and the profitability also improved year-on-year. Our Cloud Service Provider segment, what we have called the hyperscale in the past, grew more than 30% year-on-year, setting a new revenue record by capturing growing digital consumption due to the lockdown. Our customer base is also growing, thanks to our enhanced in-house design and manufacturing capabilities. Our Enterprise and SMB segment, formerly called non-hyperscale, delivered a year-on-year revenue growth of more than 9% led by double-digit revenue growth in high-growth segments such as Software-Defined Infrastructure, Service as well as High-Performance Computing. 
Looking forward, we will drive long-term growth in our Cloud Service Provider segment as we add new customers and expand the share with existing customers by leveraging our unique strength in supply chain and the global footprint. For Enterprise and SMB, we will grow high-margin storage, service and software attach rates. We will also leverage our existing strength in public and private cloud to expand our edge computing business. While we further drive premium-to-market growth of this business, we will continue to focus on expense and cost management to improve profitability. 
And our service-led Intelligent Transformation continued to show strong progress, thanks to our determined execution of the 3S strategy. Our smart IoT revenue grew 39% year-on-year, Smart Infrastructure was up 16% and the Smart Verticals delivered a strong growth of 65% year-on-year driven by Smart City solutions in China and the Smart Healthcare solutions in North America. In terms of services, our Attached Service; Managed Service, including fast-growing Device as a Service; and the Solutions, all realized a strong year-on-year growth of 30% or more, driving our overall Software & Services revenue to over USD 1 billion, growing 38% year-on-year, now accounting for around 7.6% of our total group revenue. 
Our solid performance last quarter proves that Lenovo has quickly regained momentum from the impact of pandemic and captured the digitalization opportunities, accelerated by the new normal of remote working, e-learning and more. 
In one aspect, this is thanks to our core competencies of operational excellence and global sourcing, local delivery approach. In another aspect, this is the result of our persistent execution of transformation strategy, guided by precise understanding of the technology and the industry trend. Through driving the service-led Intelligent Transformation, we will build the service and solution into our next core competence and extend our growth well into the future. Thank you. 
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please?",848
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3631.0,2116683.0,83268615.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2021. 
Next chart, please. For fiscal quarter 1, the group set a number of new performance records. Our profit attributable to equity holders increased by 31.2% to $213 million. Our group generated $13.3 billion revenue, up 7% year-on-year and 10% in constant currency. As we navigated the ongoing pandemic, our PCSD and DCG were able to capture the benefits from demand tailwinds. Both PCSD and DCG reported double-digit revenue growth. DCG's Cloud Service Provider, or hyperscale business, deliver its highest revenue in history. PCSD also reported a record-breaking pretax profit margin of 6.3%. On top of this bread-and-butter device business is high-margin Software & Services business grew by more than 4x of the group's average and emerged to be a key driver of our higher PTI margin. 
The group pretax profit grew by 38% year-on-year to $332 million due partly to disciplined expense control. Our E to R ratio was reduced by 1.6 points to 12% in the quarter. Our basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.018, up 31% versus the prior year. 
Next chart, please. In Q1, our cash flow generated from operations improved by $459 million year-on-year to $317 million. Our net debt level was reduced by $837 million year-on-year. The group successfully issued a 5-year note worth USD 1 billion in May 2020 to refinance our RMB 4 billion debt and repay short-term borrowings. Inventory days increased by 11 days year-on-year due to our strategic buy-ahead actions to secure critical costs, including CPUs. However, the strong order momentum has started to drive the days of inventory lower by 8 days quarter-on-quarter. We are comfortable with our inventory level in preparation for continued strength in our order pipeline. 
Our account receivable was further reduced by $1.4 billion year-on-year to $7 billion. The receivable improved by 6 days year-on-year, thanks to a better efficiency in our factoring program. 
Next chart, please. Our Intelligent Device Business Group consisting of PCSD and MBG, delivered yet another strong quarter with pretax profit, increasing 17% year-on-year to reach $620 million. Its revenue up a healthy 5% to USD 11.7 billion, driven by the strength in PCSD. 
Next chart, please. In Q1, PCSD revenue grew by 10% year-on-year to USD 10.6 billion. Pretax margin expanded by 0.9 percentage points to an all-time high of 6.3%, while pretax profit increased by 28% year-on-year to $670 million. We saw better-than-expected demand and strong profitability throughout the quarter. We attribute such increase to the group's strong execution and multiple structural growth trends. For example, work-from-home demand has been a clear catalyst for Thin & Light notebook PC sales, while consumers are buying more gaming pieces to meet their play-from-home requirements. 
E-learning has emerged as a consistent driver for education sales across all regions. The e-commerce evolution is accelerating, pushing a growing number of transactions through Lenovo's online franchise. The group was able to capture these growth opportunities to achieve record high market share in the consumer PC segment for the quarter. Our team continued to execute its long-term focus on optimizing segment profitability and expanding sales in premium products. 
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the group has seen a surge in market interest in this service capability and continued to build a strong pipeline for new contracts for DaaS, which is a soft form for device-as-a-service, particularly from global leaders in the industry, including financial services, food delivery, airline and technology. The Software & Services business under the PCSD group has grown its revenue 4x faster than the PCSD average and carries the highest margin among all products. 
Next chart, please. Thanks to new product launches and broader ranging with carriers, the MBG business groups delivered strong share gains and premium-to-market growth in both North America and Europe. In Latin America, in spite of MBG share gain of 1.8 points, this was not sufficient to completely mitigate the sharp decline of the region's smartphone market. As a consequence, MBG's revenue experienced a year-on-year drop of 27% to $1.1 billion. The losses before taxation dropped $55 million year-on-year to $50 million. However, the company took swift actions to control expenses, which helped to narrow its losses before taxation by $10 million quarter-on-quarter. The business has identified a strategy in place to further improve profitability, including an active 5G model launch schedule through the development of a 5G for all market strategy. Following our recently launched motorola edge+, the fastest 5G phone in the market, we will continue our innovations and product launches, including the Moto G 5G Plus model for the Motorola G franchise, which will soon be available in the market targeting the mainstream segment. 
Next chart, please. In Q1, the DCG business was able to ride on strong cloud demand and grew its revenue by 19% year-on-year to $1.6 billion. DCG successfully capitalized on the surge of cloud demand and continue its segment expansion to set a new sales record in our Cloud Service Provider business, which provide hyperscale products to public cloud service providers. [Meanwhile] we're building on our continued investment to grow in-house design and manufacturing capability but we are also expanding DCG designs to include new platforms and higher-end solutions. We are excited about the growth outlook for this business segment. The Enterprise & SMB segment under DCG also experienced robust growth across multiple product categories, including software and services, hybrid cloud and high-performance computing. Revenue of the Enterprise & SMB segment increased by 9% year-on-year. Losses from DCG business extended by $7 million year-on-year but narrowed by $17 million quarter-on-quarter to $58 million. The annual comparison was negatively impacted by the lingering impact of COVID-19 and investment to further improve the group's long-term growth prospects in regional markets, including China. 
Next chart, please. Looking forward, the dynamic shift in consumer behavior has created demand tailwinds for e-learning, work-from-home, play-from-home, cloud infrastructure and 5G. We are optimistic that these long-term structural trends could enlarge the addressable market for PCSD and cloud infrastructure as well as accelerate the development of 5G services. The group will continue to exercise prudent control on expenses to optimize its liquidity and financial health. Our PCSD business will continue to drive its premium-to-market revenue growth through investment in the high-growth and premium segments. We will continue to build capabilities to drive sales growth in the Software & Services business and expand e-commerce based on its well-established infrastructure. 
For MBG business, the group will invest in product innovation, including offering new and differentiated 5G smartphones. It will seek to strengthen its competitiveness in target markets to grow at a premium to the market and improve long-term profitability. 
In DCG business, the group aims to deliver premium-to-market growth and improve profitability. For its Cloud Service Provider business, the group will attract new customers and expand its wallet share with existing accounts by leveraging its unique strength in the global supply chain and worldwide reach while expanding its portfolio with new product solutions and platforms. 
Lastly, in the Enterprise & SMB segment, the group will grow its high-margin service attach rate, upsell premier service and expand its hybrid cloud solutions. Thank you. And now we can take your questions.",1208

First one is I'd like to ask about the server business. So first of all, I want to understand your -- the hyperscaler data center progress on the design win. I think the company talked about some potential wins with the U.S. side. So how is that progressing so far? And also, I wonder your potential market share gain in China, particularly considering some of your competitors or peers in China facing some sanction risk from the U.S. side. So that's the first part of the question. 
Second part -- second question I want to ask about, the device-as-a-service. So I wonder how's the implication here to the company's account receivable and factoring policy going forward. Would this change the AR working capital structurally if more business models change to DaaS?",134

Well, let me answer the first question. So relative to hyperscale demand, we're seeing growth worldwide. And that's both in the top 10 hyperscalers as well as in the next wave of hyperscalers. So let me cover both. Today, we're shipping to about 7 of the top 10 hyperscalers, and our demand is increasing across the board there. There's a few reasons why. First, we've gone into production on not just Intel-based solutions, but also AMD-based solutions, which has expanded our total available market opportunity. The second is we had design wins in the 4-socket and 8-socket space to, for example, run more enterprise workloads that are moved to the public cloud, for example, SAP HANA. And we've had a strong design win momentum and are now in production, which is helping the gross profit levels and profitability of that as well. 
And then the third is that we're moving more of our -- both our design and our manufacturing in-house, which we've called ODM+. So we're able to support these hyperscalers in 180 markets in the world, but we're now doing our own design, both for -- in China, for China, but also outside China for outside of China requirements. And we have the ability now to manufacture worldwide, obviously, both in China but also in Mexico, Hungary and a number of our global factories. 
So for all those reasons, we think that this 31% growth was significant, and we're expecting strong double-digit revenue growth on a yearly basis going forward with improving profitability both in the U.S. and, to answer your question, with China as well. Lastly, I would say, we did add a new sales force to cover the next wave, of more than 200 other next wave hyperscale customers, and that is also growing significantly for us as we do some custom designs for them as well. Thank you for the question. For DaaS...",319

So in our understanding, so all other Chinese players in the server and the data center space are not impacted by this kind of China-U.S. tensions. So they still can buy chips from Intel, from AMD and other vendors. So the competition is a sales competition. But we definitely are growing faster in China as well. We are significantly strengthening our resources in China because the market is growing fast. Regarding of the. DaaS, so I think probably Wai Ming should answer the question. So then if Gianfranco want to add some on that space.",100

So let me answer the, I think, the accounting issue. I think DaaS, in fact, actually, we offer our device together with a much higher service element and then sell it to the customers. Now I think the AR, we will not actually book the revenue on a higher contract value. I think we will only actually send the invoice for monthly or quarterly payments. And once we actually send the invoice, it will become an AR, and then we will do the factoring program wherever we have, I think, to actually get the cash. So that is the technical work. The question you asked about was the implication to DaaS as to AR versus our cash. I don't know whether that answers your question or not. It's not -- what I really want to say is it's not the entire contract value, we will book as revenue. I think the entire contract value represents the device together plus a higher service element, that is the entire contract value, that's spread through, say, 2 or 3 years, and then we build them every year. And the rest of the contract, in fact, actually go to -- in our balance sheet as deferred revenue. And the AR only represents, I think, the services that we deliver during the year or during the quarter or whatever.",225

Then I think we also use some external financing institution in order to secure the receivable, right? So I don't think we see any impact in terms of either receivable or -- accounts receivable or the factoring because it's just back-to-back with the financing institution.",70

And congrats on the good results. My first question is on the PC side. It appears you have stated that you're looking at the second quarter growing. And then to have a slowdown in December quarter, if demand was prudent. I was wondering what's the view now on the PC market over the next 6 months. That's the first part. 
The second part is about your service revenue. I was wondering if you can roughly tell us what the service profit contribution is for you now since the service revenue has been growing. And for DaaS, from your commercial side of the business on the PC front, wonder if you can roughly tell us how many of your customers are choosing DaaS versus buying actual PCs. What's the portion now? 
And my second question is on the financial side. I was wondering, the OpEx reduction, cost savings this quarter. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where it came from. And also whether that is sustainable as your revenue scale perhaps continue to grow, whether we can maintain an EBITDA ratio of about 12%. What's the outlook there? And then second part is on the cash flow, any changes in how you position your cash and spend your cash as now the operating cash flow seems to be continuously improving.",227

And we already see even the following quarter or in Q4 calendar year or Q3, same trend. And I would expect that even Q1. Frankly speaking, I think that until the first half of next year, I don't really see the PC going down. And this is due to that learning-from-home, working-from-home, playing-from-home. And it's really, I think, a change in terms of rather than 1 or 2 PC per home or per house, it's 1 PC per person. And this is becoming -- so it's also the TAM, the overall TAM is growing worldwide, which means that also the replacement will continue to top. Not only we also see a lot of people that year of their PC is maybe 3, 4 years old. They were used to work with PC maybe 1 hour per day, 2 hours per day. Now the number of hours per day, even in talking with Microsoft, is becoming much bigger. And they start to realize that the PC they have is not good enough. So it's not only people buying new PC, but it's also people replacing PC. 
And then there are big education deal, big education deal in U.S., big education deal in Japan, a bigger education deal in Europe that we didn't supply yet. So this is why when I look at the trend, I think we should continue to see between single to double-digit growth for the next -- at least over the next 3 quarters. 
On DaaS, what was the question?",299

410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2020",2020-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3631.0,2116683.0,83268632.0,Answer,Gianfranco Lanci,,Executives,19,"Let's say, when we talk about that DaaS, I think it's mainly Fortune 500 companies, or big companies. We have been closing a very, very large deal last quarter with one of the largest IT company in the world, frankly, [ in India ]. We also did, I don't know, we have -- the quarter before, it was with major airlines. 
So we really see a larger corporation, I would say, mainly Fortune 500 -- 1000, that are moving from CapEx to OpEx in terms of DaaS. And then as I said before, we offer not only the ARPU, hardware plus service plus software campaign. So the total value is usually in the range of 25%, 30% bigger than just the ARPU figure And as I said, it doesn't have any implication in terms of receivables and in terms of inventory because we use our external financing institution to cover it. 
We are also building up -- it's already running in a few countries, DaaS for SMB, I would say, not real, yet, not medium business because we start to realize that the demand is also coming from that. But for the same reason, with COVID and with the virus, people they need to [ data to ] expand their installed base or give PC to their employees. 
And I think it's a little bit like cars. I mean, today, most of the people are not buying car anymore. They buy car with a rent fee, and so between the medium business and a very large business, this is also what's happening in PC. And the pipeline as we said, the pipeline we see today, it's really, really big.",280

So I want to echo Gianfranco's comment on PC market outlook. So definitely, we are more optimistic than before now. So I think COVID-19 impact to PC industry is definitely positive. So as Gianfranco said, so that will drive PC from 1 per family to 1 per person -- so 1 unit per person. So that way, we'll significantly enlarge the PC TAM from today around 260 million, 270 million, to more than 300 million. So that's our strong belief. So if you look at the recent situation, you can believe that. So actually, the growth is not driven by the emerging markets recently. It's driven by mature markets. So U.S., Europe, Japan, so the growth is higher in those markets even with 70%, 80% PC penetration rate. So there's still a need for more PC. 
So I think this is just the first wave. So definitely, this trend will shift to emerging markets over time because it will prove the PC is an essential product for those people who need it to work from home and for kids who need it to study from home or take e-learning program. So that's our strong belief. Okay. So Wai Ming, could you please answer the remaining question, service profitability, OpEx reduction, cash flow?",215

So thanks, YY. So I think in terms of the service profit contribution to the group, I think it's roughly around, I think, the group profit of account for around 15%. I just want to make sure that you do not misunderstood that 15% because this is really the service element that account for around 30% of group profit. But in terms of profit margin, it is about, I would say, double, I think -- the gross profit margin of services is at least double or probably a little bit more than double than our hardware...",97

So in terms of operating expenses, I think, clearly, we've been actively taking actions. I think some of those are structural. For example, reducing head count, moving head count from high-cost jurisdiction to lower-cost jurisdiction. I think definitely those are sustainable. Some of those expenses are actually reduced as a result of, I think, the strengthening of the market, for example, in MBG, where our 2 main markets today in Q1, still at least, subject to lockdown. And therefore, I think we actually, I think, optimized or reduced our advertising spending. Those expenses, as and when business returns, obviously, go up. But there is a high proportion of our expenses really taking out from our structure, and those will be sustainable. 
On the cash flow, I think where the improvement? I think the improvement, I think, is coming out from, I think, 2 or 3 areas. I think the fundamental one is really the operational profit of the group actually improved significantly, I think, over the last year. That actually account for, I think, one source of the improvement in cash. I think the second one is the better utilization, I think, of the factoring program. I think if you actually participated in our earnings call over the last few quarters, I think last year, in the beginning of last year, I think we actually changed the service provider. I think in the first quarter last year, I think, there is some sort of transition. And I think over the last few quarters, we continue to see improvement. And therefore, you actually see a steady improvement, I think, of our cash position and, hence, [ our company sits ] well. We actually see that there will be more opportunities for us, I think, to further improve our cash flow position. I think that really come out from managing -- better managing of our inventory, better managing of our account payable as well as receivables. Okay. I think back to you, Yuanqing.",356

So 2 questions. My first question is still on the PC side. Regarding Y-o-Y your statement about how the PC market will expand from 260 to 270 million units to upwards of 300 million plus, how long will that take, do you think, across how many years or quarters? And the additional PCs above the 260 million to 270 million today, do you have a rough sense of what you think will be from e-learning or from work-from-home or from -- what that breakdown might look like? So that's my first question. 
Second question is on the data center side, just for a more near-term outlook going into the second half, any view or color on trajectory into Q3 and Q4, particularly the breakdown between cloud and enterprise?",132

And I think -- only last quarter, if I'm not wrong, market compared to the year before has been growing in the range of 6 million to 7 million, right? So fourth quarter at 7 million, it's already 30 million. And we see this quarter and next quarter, it's probably growing even faster. So I think 30 million, for sure, within the first half of next year should be achievable. On the street, I would say, probably 20%, 25% is going to be Chromebook and the rest is between consumer. Consumer, I mean, traditional consumer, including gaming. So average good AUR, not only entry and for bigger [ bids ] and some commercial. But I would say 70% is traditional PC, 30% can be Chromebook or WinBook. So really, solution for education. In the 70% traditional PC, I would say, a big portion is consumer, including gaming, and there is probably another 20%, 30% portion of the 70% that is going to be SMB or commercial.",216

So again, I think we set a new revenue record this quarter with a 31% growth. I think interesting to note, this is the first quarter in Lenovo, and probably IBM, prior to that history where our hyperscaler Cloud Service Provider business is larger than our Enterprise & SMB business, I think that will continue. You know it's a very kind of cyclical but lumpy market. So we think it will maintain strong double-digit revenue growth for the year, but it probably will reset to a more sustainable level in the second half. That's our prediction. But our goal is to continue to grow at a premium-to-market. If we look at Enterprise & SMB, per IDC, we've now had 3 consecutive quarters of premium-to-market, and I expect that to happen this quarter as well, which would make it our fourth consecutive quarter. So regardless of what the market does, we believe we're well positioned because we're attaching more premium services and more professional services. With our joint venture with NetApp, we're attaching more storage. We have a number of new enterprise software contracts with some of the largest software companies in the world. So we're improving our software attach. 
And our HPC business continues to grow. As you saw, we expanded our #1 position in global supercomputers as well and are continuing to win some large supercomputing deals around the world as people look for vaccine, research in COVID and this kind of thing. So I would say that Cloud Service Provider business will grow faster than Enterprise & SMB. We're probably less susceptible than our competitors to a softening SMB market just based on the history of our account base. And our goal is to continue to grow at a significant premium-to-market in both Cloud Service Provider and the Enterprise & SMB segment while improving profitability. Thank you.",310

I would like to know from Lenovo's perspective, which area are you facing more constraint? And how is this impacting the past quarter and also the next few quarters of your PC shipment? 
The second question is on the channel inventory side. Can you give us some color about the channel inventory on the PC? Are we seeing more restocking demand? Or is the channel inventory still lean and then consumers are still quite eager to buy PC during the COVID outbreak?",111

Let me start from there, from the shortage. I think when we look at shortage and mainly coming from, I would say, 2 major -- 2 components. One is display. I would say, any kind of display. And the other one is IC. In the form that we have been able to manage quite relatively well some CPU shortage, some other things. But main shortage is LCD and IC. IC for LCD, IC for motherboard. Is there a major impact on our shipment? I would say, not really in the sense that it is slowing down a little bit, the lead time of the product but not really a big impact in terms of shipments or in terms of order loading. I think we will see some good improvement on the IC in the next couple of quarters. Display, I think we also want to see some improvement, but it probably is going to take a little bit longer because they need to move production. They need to change production from the TV to notebook display or even to monitor display. 
Channel inventory, frankly speaking, is probably even lower than what we did simply because I see the order loading is soft since the lead time, in certain cases, it's getting a little bit longer. As I said, we normally closed the quarter with 1 million, 1.5 million of orders, not shipped. Last quarter, we were in the range of 4 million to 5 million, and we will continue to have 4 million to 5 million despite the very good growth. So channel inventory is a problem and it's not enough. And they should talk with the channel. They are even complaining a little bit because it is not enough. We really don't see any channel inventory issue anywhere in the world. I speak from our side, but also relatively speaking also from competition because competition is more or less in the same situation in terms of shipment.",329

So we have a very strong demand of order load. We -- a big portion of that, we cannot ship last quarter. So we think the current quarter is a similar situation. So we are trying to drive more supply, particularly on the display, on the IC. So that's -- we don't have a big channel inventory issue. That's the answer.",62

The revenue actually grew 20% year-on-year last quarter. But if we look at the bottom line, actually, it did not improve.

So I think a few things. Number one, we're continuing to invest as a -- for a premium growth to market. So we did make some significant investments, particularly in China. As we look to grow our professional services business, we announced, for example, a major smart city initiative with [ Meishan ] this quarter. But we are making investments that we believe will result in long-term growth at a premium to market in a very critical market for us, China. The profit comparison year-on-year, I think, partly is due to a mix shift between SMB moving to some hyperscale business, particularly in this COVID situation. So that mix shift, I think, did impact margins somewhat. Having said that, we've been driving a number of expense initiatives and recently announced, for example, some moves, as Wai Ming said, from high-cost geography to low-cost geography as well as some reduction in force in other parts of the world. So those major expense actions were really -- we're not seeing this quarter, and will start take into effect dramatically next quarter, which will, again, help improve the profitability. 
So our goal, to be very clear, is in hyperscale. We think our profitability will continue to improve. If you just look at that segment because we're shipping storage, not just server; we're shipping AMD, not just Intel; and now we're ramping not just commodity 2-socket systems but actually 4-second and 8-socket class systems across a number of players; as well as growing our next wave business, not just the Tier 1 business, which tends to be a bit more profitable. And then those expense actions will kick in beginning this next quarter -- the quarter we're in right now, rather.",288

So the market is quickly shifting from a traditional enterprise and SMB market to a cloud service provider market. So we have to adapt to this change quickly. So definitely, one important fact to address this change is we need to strengthen our in-house design and manufacturing capability. So only with that capability, we can better address the cloud service provider market, so with better profitability. Now we have invested significantly in this space. So if we can address this market better than our competition, better than before, so we think we can have -- we can also have the better profitability in traditional enterprise and SMB market as well. So that will be Lenovo's strategy. 
From [ wide gap ] where-- I think Lenovo has been a very unique company in the data center market. So as you can see, so we have a very balanced business in both Enterprise & SMB and Cloud Service Provider. But meanwhile, we are trying to build the different core competence in each of these 2 markets to compete.",177

If you compare already April to June, our activation grew almost by 100%. So through the quarter, we saw recovery. We expect the recovery to continue this quarter and extending into the next -- second half of our fiscal year. In July and August, quarter-to-date, our activation sellout is almost flat, like it's 0.5% year-over-year, that shows the market is recovering, and I believe we are recovering a little faster than the market. So I believe the market is going to see a good recovery, and we expect to still recover premium-to-market in the next 2, 3 quarters at least. And also there are more 5G launch upcoming. The mix is like 5% lower, but in the next 2 to 3 months, as 5G starts deploying, we also see an improvement in the mix, especially for the last quarter of the calendar year.",153

So I want to echo to Buniac's point. So although last quarter, our MBG business declined, but we see the momentum is getting stronger. So in our key markets, Latin America and North America, we both outgrew the market. And as I said, a record market share -- delivered a record market share. So even in Europe, so we see the very strong year-on-year growth in premium-to-market. So -- and also based on our activation -- the smartphone activation rate, so we see a growth recovery of the market. So in Latin America and North America, almost back to the normal. So if you consider year-on-year, so we are confident. So we will quickly recover this business in current quarter and the future. So we want to drive profitable growth in this business.",135

Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to talk about our record-setting second quarter performance and our vision for further growth in today's fast-changing world.  
Despite the challenging environment, last quarter, we delivered a record quarter performance in both revenue and profit. Revenue reached a new high of USD 14.5 billion, growing over 7% year-on-year as all of our core businesses delivered a year-on-year growth for the first time in 6 quarters. Profit showed even stronger growth with pretax income and net income both up over 50% year-on-year. Pretax income reached USD 470 million, and the net income reached USD 310 million. In addition, the top 3 credit rating agencies granted Lenovo strong investment-grade rating, further strengthening our ability to finance our growth.  
In our Intelligent Device Group, PC and Smart Devices delivered another historic quarter. Revenue up 8%, while pretax income improved 18% year-on-year, both set new records. Although market is shifting to consumer segment, we still maintained our industry-leading and record profitability of 6.3% through excellent and high-efficient operations. And we returned to #1 in PC with almost 24% market share. Our focus in high-growth and premium segments continued to drive strong growth.  
Despite the currency volatility in Latin America, our Mobile Business revenue grew 39% quarter-to-quarter and returned to year-on-year growth as we continued our strong recovery from the impact of COVID-19. Besides further solidifying presence in our stronghold market like Latin America and North America, we have accelerated our development in Europe and Asia Pacific and saw clear results. In addition to our strong product portfolio, we launched the razr 5G foldable smartphone and the Lenovo Legion Gaming phone. And both have been well received by market.  
In Data Center, we again saw double-digit revenue growth with improved profitability year-on-year. Our Cloud Service Provider segment continued to grow over 30% year-on-year, with a strong growth across all geographies. Particularly thanks to years of investment in in-house design manufacturing, we displaced the major ODMs to become the motherboard and system design partner to a top cloud service provider. We have also expanded the capacity of our factory in Monterrey, Mexico to serve data center customers across the Americas.  
In Enterprise and SMB segment, our revenue stayed close to flat year-on-year, but we did outperform the market. Our focus continued to drive double-digit growth year-on-year across Software Defined Infrastructure, Storage, Software and Services segments. Even more, we recently announced the exciting partnership with SAP. Our TruScale Infrastructure-as-a-Service combined with SAP's HANA Enterprise Cloud enables customers to keep their sensitive data on-premises and secure while enjoying the flexibility of pay-as-you-go consumption model. We already see strong customer response to this offering. 
Our service-led Intelligent Transformation continued to make solid progress with Smart IoT, Smart Infrastructure and Smart Verticals revenue, each growing by strong double digit year-on-year. In terms of service, our Attached Service, Managed Service and Solutions Service also continued faster growth. Particularly, DaaS, Device as a Service, tripled its total contract value year-on-year. Overall, Software and Services revenue grew to a new record of over USD 1.2 billion, up 39% year-on-year and now accounts for 8.5% of our total group revenue even as total revenue increases. Our E-commerce revenue also grew by over 40% year-on-year.  
I have talked about the long-term growth of the total technology market in the new normal for 2 quarters. PCs and tablets are now one device per person. And the cloud infrastructure demand are growing rapidly because of the work, learn and the play-from-home economy. We believe the total PC market will grow by around 25 million units and reach very close to 300 million units in just the current calendar year. And both device and cloud infrastructure market growth will continue for the long term to meet the increasing demand of our valued customers. We are committed to further improving our supply going forward.
As the pandemic changes customer behavior, Lenovo continues to innovate and lead in this period of rapid change. Last week, we demonstrated our results and vision in innovation at our annual flagship event, Lenovo Tech World. At the client device level, we are expanding the idea of a computer to our computing everywhere with new form factors. In edge, we offer both hardware and our own AI-enabled edge computing platform. In cloud, we can design, install and maintain public and private cloud as well as provide multi-cloud management solutions. And we are extending our Infrastructure as a Service to attach Platform as a Service and Software as a Service. In network, we now can file more than 1,000 5G essential patent applications and implement 5G networks and applications with network cloud convergence, virtualization and network slicing technologies. 
Finally, with all these technologies, combined with intelligence like machine learning and artificial intelligence, we generate insights and provide solutions to customers of various industries and drive intelligent transformation.  
I believe that technology has never been so essential to humanity as it is today. Customers have new requirements to meet in this new normal. And our success in meeting these needs is demonstrated not only by our strong results this quarter but also by how our service-led transformation propels our growth well into the future. 
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",882
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3648.0,2126738.0,83718323.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Yuanqing. I will now take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in the second quarter fiscal year 2021.  
Next chart, please. The group continued its record performance in the second fiscal quarter. We set a number of performance records whilst still navigating the ongoing pandemic. Our revenue increased 7% year-on-year to reach all-time high of $14.5 billion. And all 3 business groups recorded positive year-to-year revenue growth. Resilient and strong growth was achieved as a result of structural changes in demand of computing device, which include e-learning, work from home, play at home and cloud. This also resulted in a gain in market share during the quarter.  
The group's gross margin improved 0.2 points quarter-on-quarter, thanks to high-growth and premium segments. The Software and Services and E-commerce grew their revenue strongly by 39% and 42%, respectively, year-on-year. Their high margin rates continue to support our strong profit trajectory. The segment profitability has improved, including margin rate expansion in consumer, Chromebook, E-commerce and Gaming segments. However, a higher COVID-19-led logistic cost caused a moderate year-on-year decline on gross margin.  
Our E to R ratio was reduced by 1.2 percentage point to 11.6% in the quarter, a result of our disciplined expense control and operational efficiency.  
Next chart, please. Our business group total pretax profit grew 15% year-on-year to reach a new record of $654 million. During the quarter, we recognized a fair value gain of $104 million on strategic investments netted by $53 million provision for intellectual properties in our unallocated headquarter and corporate expenses. Our profit performance has reached a new milestone. Profit attributable to equity holders increased by 53% to all-time high of $310 million with consistent improvement across all 3 of our business groups.  
The basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0259, up 53% from the previous year. The Board of Directors declared today an interim dividend of HKD 0.066, representing an approximately 5% increase on the interim dividend paid in the last fiscal year.  
Next chart, please. We lowered our net debt by $390 million, thanks to the strong cash flow generated from our operations. And our finance costs reduced further by $45 million or 33% year-on-year. 
In October, we received strong inaugural investment-grade ratings from 3 leading credit rating agencies and successfully completed the first 144A issuance of $1 billion 10-year senior notes. We will use the process to retire a portion of the perpetual securities and unsecured notes in an effort to improve the efficiency of the group's liability management while further reducing our financing costs and extending our debt tenure.  
Inventory days improved sequentially by 2 days, thanks to strong demand. This year-on-year increase of 11 days was due to our strategic buy-ahead actions to secure critical parts.  
Next slide, please. PCSD revenue grew by 7.6% year-on-year to $11.5 billion in the quarter. Pretax margin expanded by 0.6 percentage points to a record of 6.3%. Pretax profit increased by 18% year-on-year to $723 million. These record-breaking achievements in the second fiscal quarter are encouraging as peak of seasonality normally occurs in our third quarter.  
I would like to take this opportunity to discuss our pretax margin for PCSD as the process of managing margins is dynamic. We have enjoyed strong scaling benefits, and we have the most competitive profile in each of the segments we are servicing. Even the consumer and Chromebook sales, which traditionally carry lower margins, we have focused on higher-margin projects to optimize and improve their segment profitability. For high-margin products such as Software, Services, E-commerce and high-growth segments including Thin & Light and Gaming, we have doubled down on our investment to boost the contribution of these segments and, hence, gain market share. We are confident in maintaining the PTI margin of about 6% on a sustainable basis.  
Next chart, please. Thanks to rebound in market demand, the team's continued efforts in expanding portfolio and carrier ranging, MBG average selling prices improved, and the business group delivered strong revenue recovery, resulting in a 39% sequential growth, returning to a revenue scale of $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year. 
The sales recovery helped to narrow MBG losses before taxation by $28 million quarter-on-quarter to $22 million, and the business was now cash flow positive. The business was impacted by higher freight cost, which showed a decline in profitability by $30 million year-on-year. We expect the business will continue to grow and resume its profit growth track going forward. 
The business will continue to execute its portfolio expansion to increase global market share. Its 5G-for-all market strategy is starting to bear fruit. With our flagship razr 5G phone launches, our 5G products now span across all price segments, which helps to drive ASP expansion. The revenue contribution from 5G models more than double quarter-on-quarter. The business will continue to execute its strategy while preparing for more aggressive carrier penetration.  
Next chart, please. Our DCG continued to capitalize on cloud demand and achieve premium to market growth during the second quarter. With strong momentum and continued client diversification, Cloud Service Provider, or CSP, revenue growth accelerated to 34% year-on-year. The prospect for CSP has been promising, thanks to its richer mix of solutions and design wins supported by our in-house design and manufacturing.  
Enterprise and SMB, or ESMB, segment continued to outperform the market. Our revenue posted a small year-on-year decline of 1.7%, a solid performance compared to the sluggish sector. We achieved this superior performance based on the double-digit growth in Software Defined Infrastructure, Storage and Software and Services.  
DCG business continued to improve its operational result by $11 million quarter-on-quarter and $4 million year-on-year to a pretax loss of $47 million. The group efforts in product allocation and development of alternative platforms, the availability of high-end system as well as storage solutions have started to pay off. With our continued work in more margin wins for profitable projects and advanced configurations, DCG is on track to drive long-term growth and profitability over time.  
Next chart, please. The invoiced revenue of Software and Services surpassed $1.2 billion in the second quarter with a 39% year-on-year growth, whilst deferred revenue grew 26% to nearly $2 billion. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there is a surge of interest in our service capability, as clearly reflected in the strong new contract pipeline we have built across Attached Services, Managed Services and Complex Solutions. Among all, DaaS and Infrastructure as a Service are gaining significant momentum. The recent DCG partnership with SAP was an important landmark deal highlighting the potential for Infrastructure as a Service.  
Next chart, please. Looking forward, the dynamic shift in PC demand will continue to create tailwinds for e-learning, work from home, play from home, cloud infrastructure and 5G. We are optimistic that these long-term structural trends could enlarge the addressable market for PCSD and cloud infrastructure as well as accelerate the development of 5G services.  
Our PCSD business will continue to drive premium to market revenue growth through investment in the high-growth and premium segments. We are confident to increase supply to meet the strong demand. We'll continue to build capabilities to drive sales growth in the Software and Services business and expand E-commerce based on this well-established infrastructure.  
For the MBG business, the group will invest in product innovation including offering new and differentiated 5G smartphones. MBG will seek to strengthen its competitiveness in tighter markets to grow at a premium to the market and improve long-term profitability.  
For the DCG business, the group aims to deliver premium to market growth and improve profitability. For its Cloud Service Provider business, the group's new design wins will expand its wallet share with existing accounts by leveraging its unique strength in the global supply chain and worldwide reach while expanding its portfolio with new product solutions and platforms.  
Lastly, in the Enterprise and SMB segment, the group will grow its high-margin service attach rate, upsell premium services and expand its hybrid cloud solutions to drive profit improvements.

And it's coming from more or less minus 5 million in Q1 and then plus 10 million for the following 3 quarters. And the market will be probably between 295 million and 300 million.  
If I look at 2021, in my -- in our opinion, we see additional 15 million to 20 million TAM growth coming from, for sure, a big growth in Q1 because last year -- this year, Q1 was the starting of the pandemic in most of the world, right? And then I think it's going to sustain for Q2, Q3 until Q4.  
Assuming something in the range of 300 million this year, I think 6% to 7% growth in 2021. Coming from -- we will continue to see a very strong demand on education and not only -- let's say, not only U.S., not only Japan, but in most of the countries.
Gaming, I think, will continue to grow because its consumer, again, I think we will continue to see similar growth that we have seen in 2020 in 2021 on this segment.  
The only -- I think the only segment that is probably going to show a very moderate growth is Enterprise. At least I'm not particularly optimistic in beginning of the year, Q1, Q2. And then probably, we will see Enterprise starting to invest again in Q3, Q4 next year. So overall, probably a very small growth or maybe more or less no growth. But education, gaming and consumer, I think we will continue to see something similar to this year. And this is why, in our opinion, 15 million, 20 million additional units in terms of TAM is what we predict for 2021.",306

So my follow-up is on your remarks, regarding the strong growth that you guys expect in the educational space. So there are a lot of PC brands, not only Lenovo, but basically, everyone is expanding their Chromebook product portfolio. Just in regards to competition, how do you guys see competition for Chromebooks going into 2021, whether that will drive some kind of ASP erosion on a year-on-year basis?",69

Yes. But frankly, speaking, when you look at -- okay, the number of player on Chromebook is more or less always the same. And I really don't see a lot of new player coming. There are 4 to 5 players in the Chromebook space, and I don't see additional players coming. Not only, but if I look at the evolution of Chromebook during the last 3 quarters, it's -- the ASP is going up mainly for 2 reasons: because there is a part that is related to education; but there is also very good growth, talking about Chromebook on consumer. And the average selling price of consumer is very different. But even on education, we have seen $10 to $20 improvement in terms of average selling price.  
On top, we will see probably mid of next year or later next year 5G Chromebook coming. And so with a good 5G connectivity or 4G connectivity because people, they need to be connected, always connected, so I'm not afraid of any deterioration of the average selling price of Chromebook.",183
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3648.0,2126738.0,83718336.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,15,"Yes. So Gianfranco, so although -- so we -- our Chromebook increase is significant last quarter, but we still shipped much less than our competition, so key competitors. So if you can see our -- if you see our AUR, so actually, it's much better than our competitors. So we are less impacted by the Chromebook and the low-end product. So that's one thing I hope you can mention -- you can pay attention to. 
So actually, we are more focusing on the -- so we know the market is shifting from enterprise to consumer. But Lenovo, we are more focusing on the high-end products in the consumer like Thin & Light, like Gaming PC. So with much higher AUR, definitely margin is high. So that's the first part that I want to mention. 
And the second point is, when market is shifting to the consumer, so Lenovo, we are more focusing on improving our expense to revenue. So we know to sell consumer product is different from to sell enterprise product. So if you don't have the efficient expense to revenue, you will not have the good margin in the consumer. But if you can see our E to R ratio, we've improved significantly last quarter. So that even in the low-end product, Chromebook, tablet, we still can deliver a very decent profit. So probably you cannot imagine. So our tablet profit, let's say, pretax income ratio, it's even higher than our PC segment -- our entire PC segment. So that's just $100, $200 product category. So we still can make very decent margin.  
The third point is, in the past, we sell only hardware parts. But now we are -- we more emphasize the service. We sell more hardware with attached services. You know the service definitely, so the margin and the profit is much higher than hardware. 
So with these 3 focus on shift, so we are driving the better margin and the PTI, so particularly PTI. So if you look at the last quarter, right, so we -- our PTI in the PCSD was historical high, so 6.3%. So we believe, so Gianfranco, at this level, we can maintain this PTI ratio, right?",367

One, as YY already said, when you look at Chromebook, our mix of Chromebook compared to the rest of the market is relatively small. I can give you a very simple example because it's part -- you can find them from market researchers. I'm not disclosing anything. I think we shipped 1.7 million last quarter Chromebook. 
One of our larger -- largest -- our largest competitor, they ship 3.7 million or something like that. So you can imagine -- and we shipped more than 19 million. So the weight of Chromebook, 1.7 million out of 19 million, it's less than 10%, right? And we've been able to improve ASP because we look at it deal by deal, and we pay attention on what is the marginality of the different deal. 
So the mix coming from -- the impact there coming from Chromebook is almost irrelevant. And probably compared to the past, we have seen a good improvement on both margin and AUR on Chromebook. 
Consumer, same story. Now we are running consumer at profitability that is very close to the average profitability of PCSD, very close to the 6.3%. Why? Because, again, our mix of consumer, we are not focused on low end at all. It's mainly coming from Gaming, Thin & Light or what we call, let's say, prosumer. But that is still part of consumer because it's mainly coming from consumer in terms of addressing this new segment. That is the segment of people working from home. 
So in terms of margin, I think we have been able to -- and I think when I look at the margin compared to last quarter, compared to last year, there is no deterioration at all. And when I look at this quarter, so Q4 calendar year or Q3 financial year, the trend is exactly the same as Q2, last quarter. 
The only small impact but we have been able to absorb the impact coming from a better margin on the product is logistics. Logistics continue to be more expensive than before. But this is already from, let's say, Q1 and just after the February, March. And we need to move things sometimes by air due to the supply shortage. So logistics is still more expensive than 1 year before. But when you look, we have been able to compensate with better margin on the product because you don't see the deterioration of the margin coming from logistics.",434

Yes, so thank you for the question. I think we're excited about the growing customer design wins we have in North America as well as in the Cloud Service Provider space. And while some of our competitors had significant issues supplying through the -- through this COVID pandemic into North America, we just had our Tech World, and you heard customer like DreamWorks, who we just signed a 5-year relationship with, say that they were able to deploy a supercomputer flawlessly through the pandemic. 
And so the Monterrey, Mexico facility expansion is going to be a dedicated expansion of our factory. We're moving into a second building. It's up and operational. And we've started shipping our first racks into some of the Tier 1 cloud service providers. So I think this is a good sign, I think, for the market that we're confident in the growth both in North America for Enterprise/SMB as well as in the cloud service providers. And they've asked us to increase the capacity based on future orders that we've had. 
Over time, we will not just do the system development but also do motherboard development in multiple geographies. So again, I think with North America being the largest data center market, it's also our strongest growing market right now. So we're excited that, that plant is now fully up and operational. So it's a significant capacity expansion.",233

No, DaaS, I think, what is the reason, I would say a couple of -- one is, for sure, we are probably one of the few company today able to offer a worldwide coverage in terms of DaaS. So for large enterprise, I would say Fortune 100 but not only Fortune 500, with the operation all around the world, there are very few people today able to offer a DaaS solution that is able to cover the entire world. 
And of course, the other big reason is that people, they start to realize, like in other businesses, if you take car or other things, it's very similar. The opportunity to change after 2 to 3 years your installed base, just paying a monthly fee and without any asset cost, it's a very good solution. Because you have a new installed base every 3 years, so you have the service covering for the 3 years whatever you need.  
And the last thing is that we started to address DaaS also for the small, medium business partially through the -- mainly through the channel. But -- so today, we have a solution on DaaS that is going from very large enterprise down to, let's say, medium business. 
In terms of prospective, in my opinion, we have seen that it's growing 40%, 50%, 60% the entire service revenue, right? Our revenue -- service revenue is growing more or less in the range of 40%, now very consistent during the last probably 4 to 5 or 6 quarters, more than 1 year, almost 2 years. And we reached $1.2 billion as a company this quarter. And I think that very soon, it will represent 10% of our total revenue and, in my opinion, between 3 to 5 years, can represent probably 20% of the total revenue.",304

So we're extremely excited, as we announced just recently at Tech World with the CEO of SAP, that their new HANA Enterprise Cloud customer addition will be available now using Lenovo TruScale. So TruScale is our as-a-service brand that does on-demand, pay as you consume metering and enables you to get cloud-like economics but be able to have that hardware located on your premise either for security or for your own data requirements. So this was a significant commitment by SAP to both TruScale and as a service, where they'll be enabling that to their customers to support the new on-premise HANA Enterprise Cloud. 
Previously, we had won many of the Tier 1 cloud providers as SAP moved to the public cloud. So we're seeing TruScale as a great example there, and SAP is just another example of the momentum we have there. Thank you.",147

So we -- I think the top on-prem data center or Infrastructure as a Service will be Lenovo's focus there for a long time. So that will help us to drive this service-led transformation.

And I think the confidence we have in our top line growth is driven by a few things. 
Number one is we're very well balanced now between our geographies. If you look at China versus rest of Asia versus Europe and the Americas, we have a pretty decent split of almost 1/4 of our business in each. 
Secondly, we're expanding pretty rapidly into the storage market after we had our announcement and our joint venture with NetApp, so significant premium relative to what, I think, you're hearing from the analysts reporting the overall storage market when we're growing the numbers that we've been talking about of 15% in storage and 22% in hyper-converged. So that's feeling quite good. 
But we're really trying to balance this double-digit growth at a premium to market versus just continuing to improve our pretax each and every quarter. So that's really our -- what we're trying to drive as commitment to the market is how do we grow double-digit premium to market and how do we continue to improve pretax each and every quarter. 
So the reason we're exposing you to the 4Ss, SDI, Software, Storage and Services, is that's where we're really getting decent attach on profit. And as you said, as we now win some of these motherboard designs for designs all the way out there now that are going to be in 2022 and beyond with next-generation Intel and AMD silicon, that's also helping us improve our margin because we're -- we started out as a system integrator, putting together other people's systems into racks, that we did what they call copy exact motherboards, where we would take the motherboard from someone else and manufacture it. And now we're actually becoming the design partner, where other people will be paying us a royalty on the boards to become a second or third source to the Tier 1s. 
So this is something that, hopefully, you've been tracking over the last several years has been a consistent improvement, both where we're gaining share, we're getting the number of customers, and we're gaining their confidence to do more and more of their products. 
And lastly, I think in Cloud Service Provider, we've said this consistently over the last several quarters, but we're doing Intel now and AMD. We're doing server now and adding storage. We're not just doing motherboards and systems, but now we're doing motherboard design and systems. And then our services attached across the board is increasing double digits from a penetration rate for all our premium services as well. So I'm confident we can continue improving PTI. Relative to exactly when, I think we're just going to continue to drive double-digit premium to market and improve PTI ideally every quarter as we go forward.",506

So in short term, I think the most important thing for us is building the foundation -- building the competitiveness, definitely. So we understand the market is shifting from enterprise/SMB to the cloud. So if we cannot address the CSP, we cannot make money from the CSP segment. So we will not be competitive in that market. So that's why we are building the in-house design and manufacturing capability for motherboard all the way to the system integration. So I believe we are in a better position than our traditional competitors like HP and Dell. They're just focused on the enterprise and the SMB. 
So I said a couple of times, so this mix is similar to the consumer PC and the commercial PC mix. Consumer PC has less margin. But if you don't play in other segments, you will not have the scale. If you don't have scale, you will not have the cost competitiveness or efficiency. So consumers give you the scale. Commercial give you the profitability. 
So it's similar in the Data Center business. If you don't have the [ CFD ], so you will not have the scale. Now if you -- but definitely, we can make a better margin from the enterprise with stronger in-house design and manufacturing capability. So that's why I think we are in a better position than our traditional competitors in that space. 
Secondary, so the data center as a service, so particularly on-prem data center as a service, so you could say that's on-prem private cloud or on-demand private cloud. 
So if you believe that the public account would have the bright future, you should think this on-prem, on-demand private cloud should have the bright future as well. We should make better margin in the future as well because most enterprise customers, they would not shift all their infrastructure to the public cloud because of the data security and application security-ish. 
So the hybrid cloud will be the dominant business model over time. But definitely, enterprise customers also want to enjoy this kind of pay-as-you-go business model. And also, we believe if more customers start to use this model, we can make more money from this kind of business.",392

I have one question for server and one question for mobile. This year, local players in China, such as Inspur and others seems taking enterprise server share from U.S. OEM such as HP and Dell. So Lenovo is a Chinese company with a global footprint, I think you have a good opportunity in China market. So can you update your China business situation and plan? And also, when do you expect the global enterprise server demand to recover? 
And then second question for smartphone. Now I feel like Lenovo try to refocus on scale, not only profitability in Mobile Business. In the past, you focused more on profitability then market share, like focusing on more mid-range and low-end segment and targeted market. And are you changing your strategy to move to a more premium segment and additional region like Europe? So any update on your Mobile Business and strategy would be great.",158

So I mean to be very clear, our main focus is still profitability. And so now that said, we are seeing -- we are entering in the previous phase, we launched the razr. And now with 5G also coming, we are seeing an improvement in our AURs. We grew 5% year-over-year, 10% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this fiscal year the AURs will keep growing. 
We are also expanding ranging of our products across many carriers, what is driving growth in additional markets like Europe, Asia and even India. I think as we get more competitive, we are proving to be able to play globally. What is also going to help is when we recover in main -- in core markets like Latin America, North America. So main focus were stability. We are improving our mix, not significantly, around 10%, 15%. That means we are a little more into the premium side of the market without deviating from our strategy. And we are seeing growth from other regions, including Europe, but not -- also to include like Asia and all other markets, giving a better execution, increased ranging and growth of 5G. Our 5G doubled quarter-over-quarter on our mix and expect over the next 6 months to double again from where we are today.",213

So our Mobile Business strategy is very, very clear. So as a first step, we need to turn around this business to make it a healthy business. So we achieved that actually a couple of quarters ago. But unfortunately, because of the pandemic, our business was impacted significantly. So we lost a little bit of money. But fortunately, last quarter, we significantly reduced the loan. And we are very optimistic in the current quarter. So we will try to go back to norm. 
But after we achieve the first step, so for the second step, we will drive the profitable growth. To drive the profitable growth, so while we will continue to maintain our position in Latin America and North America, we will pursue the growth opportunity in Europe and the Asia-Pacific market. So that's about our Mobile Business strategy. 
And also, so we will drive the product, the portfolio from mid-end to the high-end side. So with the razr and the Gaming phone launch, so we are more confident on that. 
So Kirk, please.",176

I think -- well, first of all, if you look at the overall TAM over the next several years, we think it will be roughly 6% or greater TAM as we go into the next fiscal year out through the middle of the 2020s. So I think that the demand, as we all know, for data is out there. And the movement to the edge and where data get computed will drive a nice 6% or higher data center TAM growth. 
In China specifically, we saw high single-digit growth. And so I think we're definitely growing. We're taking smart share. I think some of the deals in the Tier 1s are just really negative profit, and we're not necessarily engaging in those today. We're taking smart share, we can improve profitability while growing with the market, and then -- or greater than market. 
And then in storage, with our NetApp JV, we're growing at a significant premium to market as well. So I guess it's the balance of both server and storage growth as we look at China and the balance of smart share growth but growth with profitability, not just for growth for top line revenue's sake.",199
