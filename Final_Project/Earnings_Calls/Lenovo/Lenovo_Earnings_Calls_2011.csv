410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., 2011 Earnings Call, May 26, 2011",2011-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3774.0,134560.0,8806208.0,Presenter Speech,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,1,"Good evening, everybody. So thank you for joining us. This has been a fantastic year for Lenovo. So let's get started. So we had a very strong fourth quarter to close outstanding fiscal year. Lenovo was the fastest growing major PC company for the 6th straight quarter. We also had a strong improvement in our gross profit margin of almost 2 points year-on-year. 
For the year, Lenovo grew 4x the market read, and our market share reached a all-time high of 10.2%. For the first time, we have surpassed USD $20 billion revenue, reached $21 billion. And our PTI doubled to USD $358 million. We also achieved a historic low E/R [Expenses-to-Revenue] ratio, just over 9%, even after substantial investments in branding and in innovation.
If you look deeper, the story is even better. For the year, Lenovo was #1 in global emerging markets, including China. We are #2 in global commercial Netbooks and in the all-in-one desktop category. We have been #1 in worldwide relationship notebook sales for 2 straight quarters. So that's where we are fruitful, our results. 
So why did we have such a record-setting year? Two key reasons. We had the right strategy of protect and attack, and a strong execution worldwide. First, our strategy. So in both China and the mature relationship, we want to protect our leadership position and our profit pool. In China, we achieved this by increasing profitability by more than 14%. We did this while growing faster than the market in all 4 quarters and reaching a record market share of almost 38%. In addition, our Lenovo Mobile business unit volume grew more than twice faster as the market. And we launched the -- we also launched the new smartphone and tablet products in China and it got -- and so far, we have got very positive feedback.
So in mature markets, we increased segment operating profit by USD $143 million year-on-year. Thanks mainly to our relationship business and, also, SMB sales.
While protecting our profit pool, we also achieved our all-time high market share of 5.5% for the year, making our protect base more like attack. So we outgrew the market every quarter in relationship and in SMB sales. Our transactional business actually grew 31 points more than the market for the year.
So in emerging markets, our strategy is to grow market share, our revenue. In fact, in emerging markets, we are now #1 in worldwide market share, including China. We grew nearly 3x faster than the market, and increased our market share to more than 60% outside of China. In fact, we gained share across all emerging markets. Like in India, we gained 2.2 points year-on-year. And in Russia, 3.5 points year-on-year.
Our Protect and Attack strategy has guided us to strong growth and balanced the performance across the world. So this year, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is protecting China and the mature relationship, and attacking the emerging markets and the mature transaction. 
At the same time, we will also focus on other, some other key areas in our strategy. So in China, we want to expand further into servers and workstations. In mature relationship, we will leverage the ongoing cooperate replacement cycle and capitalize synergies with NEC to drive more growth and profit. Emerging markets, we were improved profitability in countries where we have already reached double-digit market share. And in mature transaction, we are committed to profitable growth. Our positive investment in SMB are now paying off as we grow profitably. We are also interested in the consumer space. But this is certainly a fiercely competitive market, and it will be even more challenging for newcomer. So we have to think in a different way to enter this space.
In addition to our traditional PC business, we also -- we are focused on the mobile Internet space. We have formed a new group, Mobile Internet and the Digital Home business unit to lead the effort. To attack this space, we will fully leverage our expense. Therefore, China and the global commercial markets are our initial focus for the areas. In China, we have already launched the LePhone and the LePad. For this summer, we will launch both the consumer and the commercial tablet products in America and other selected countries. 
To continue our strong growth, we will make strategic investments in building our foundation and the core competitiveness. First, we will continue to invest in innovation. We will center on customer experience and go deeper in research and core component technology. We also -- we'll continue building our own device class service end-to-end platform and ecosystem, particularly in China. Second, so we will continue building a global brand. Our brand must become our strength, and we will improve profitability over time.
Third, we will continue to refine our business model. We will continue to develop our in-house  background building. We will continue to develop our in-house service capabilities and enhance our strategic IT deployment more importantly. So we will further strengthen our transactional capability, which includes identifying opportunity, precise planning and a timely adjustment. So this will help develop even higher efficiency from end to end. So this investment will enhance our core competitiveness for future growth.
So our strategy and execution worked very well last year. But we will not rest. In the year ahead, we remain optimistic about the PC market, as well as the mobile Internet space. We are confident that we have the right strategy and with strong execution, we will continue to achieve sustainable growth. 
So thank you. I'll now turn to Wai Ming, our CFO.",939
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., 2011 Earnings Call, May 26, 2011",2011-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3774.0,134560.0,8806209.0,Presenter Speech,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,2,"Good evening. Thank you, Yuanqing. I will take you through very briefly Lenovo financials and the operational performance for quarter 4 and our full fiscal year 2011. 
Next charts, please. Yuanqing had just started to share with you that our fiscal year 2011 performance, which has been a very fantastic -- which is very fantastic for us. Quarter 4 is another solid quarter for us. We continue to outperform the worldwide PC market across the board by geography, by product and customer segments. Our PC shipments growth in quarter 4 was up 16% against the worldwide PC market drop of 1.1% year-to-year. This helped drive our market share for quarter 4 up 1.5 points to 9.9 percentage, and making our market share for the fiscal year increase 1.7 percentage points to 10.2%. 
China continued to regain its growth momentum, and we continued to extend our leadership in China to record high market share ever achieved in quarter 4. With corporate in refreshment cycle continuing its momentum, we continue to lever this cycle to expand our growth in the mature market and this helped to improve our margin as well. 
We grew 7% in mature market against the market decline of 12%. Indeed, we achieved an all-time high market share of 5.7% in the mature markets with improved margins. Meanwhile, our share growth strategy in emerging markets was also working well. We grew at over 2x the market growth, and we'll continue to gain share in the region to 5% -- 5.7% with reduced losses. Our strong product portfolio and services help us to grow faster than the market in both the customer as well as product segments. As a result, our share in commercial market grew by 1.6 points to 13.8%. And in the case of consumer market, we grew at 1.1 point to 6.7%. 
Next charts, please. In quarter 4, we grew 13% year-to-year in revenue to approximately $4.9 billion. PC sales were up 11% year-to-year to $4.7 billion, revenue from the Mobile business at about $187 million, up 43% year-to-year. Gross profit was about $600 million up 34% year-to-year and gross profit margin expanded to 12.3%. The strong margin was due to effective margin management, increased Think product mix and favorable key component prices. The strong margin improvement allowed us to continue our investment in product innovation, branding and marketing for new PC, as well as MIDH products to drive our future growth. 
As a result, operating expenses, including our investments, increased to $531 million. And the E/R ratio was up 10.9%. While our quarter 4 is a typical slow season with less scaling benefit, this is also one of the reasons that our E/R ratio was up quarter by quarter. Nevertheless, we expect the ratio is going to trend down in the next few markets -- in the next few quarters, as we enjoy better scaling benefit from the increased volume in the next few quarters.
Operating profit in quarter 4 was $69 million, up 46% year-to-year. We recorded a non-operating expense of $10 million that relates to net financing cost. Pretax income, $60 million, 3x against $20 million pretax income we recorded last year. We reported a one-off item and restructuring cost of $20 million quarter 4 last year, which related to redundancy costs incurred primarily in mature market. Profit attributable to equity holders is $42 million, up 2.2x year-to-year. 
For the full year, we finished the year with strong sales revenue growth. Revenue was up 30% to $21.6 billion, gross profit up 32% to approximately $2.4 billion, and gross margin expanded slightly to 10.9% from 10.8% last year. We expanded our profit and successfully managed our expenses while we're also invested to drive our long-term competitiveness. 
E/R ratio hit a recent record low level at 9.2%. Pretax income was $358 million, up 103% compared to last year. Please note that we recorded a $68 million one-off item in restructuring cost last year. That one-off item largely is the warranty provision of certain components and parts not reimbursable by supplies. At the same time last year, we also recorded a one-off $83 million gain related to disposal of some listed investments.  Total pretax in this fiscal year -- in fiscal year 2010, was $176 million.
Profit attributable to equity holders for the full year is $273 million, up 111% year-to-year. Basic EPS is USD $0.43 in quarter 4, and USD $2.84 for the year -- for the full year. A final dividend of HKD $0.05 per share is recommended by the board this morning. Together with the interim dividend paid of HKD $0.026 per share, dividends for the fiscal year were amount to a total of HKD $0.076 per share.
Next charts, please. Looking at the balance sheet. Our strong operating performance has also helped our balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet as of March 31 remains very strong. Non-current asset was about $2.8 billion, similar to that of last year. Current asset approximately $8 billion, and the increase compared to last year was due to higher bank deposits and cash flow -- and the improved cash flow. Increase in trade not in other receivable was in line with our increase in business. Current liabilities was at around $8 billion, largely due to increase in account payable, again, which is in line with our increase of our business. 
Overall, the balance sheet remains very strong. Despite quarter 4 is our -- typically is our slow season. We had net current liabilities of around $96 million as of March 31, 2011. The non-current liability were around $838 million.
Next charts, please. Working Capital. Our cash flow continued to be very healthy, and cash conversion cycle further improving in quarter 4. Net cash reserve increased to $2.7 billion against $1.9 billion last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue. While our business model operates on a negative cash conversion cycle, this means in this quarter 4 , we need to settle the account payable in quarter 3 which is much relatively higher, and then we receive the revenue in quarter 4 which is smaller. And that's the reason why we are showing Q-to-Q drop in cash.
We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Our cash conversion cycle in quarter 4 continues to improve to negative 33 days, a further improvement of 5 days compared to the same period last year. Inventory days remained the same at 18 days in quarter 4, while days receivable increased by 2 days to 32 days despite increase in channel sales in overseas markets, especially in emerging market and increase in ocean shipment. Days payable improved by 7 days to 83 days, largely due to increase in our outsourcing to ODMs. The cash conversion cycle for the full year was negative 28 days compared to the negative 30 days last year. Reason for the changes is inventory days, accounts receivable and payables is similar to that, as I explained in quarter 4.
Now let me turn to quarter 4 geographic performance. This chart summarizes the performance by geography for quarter 4. We have excluded restructuring charges and one-off items from the operating profit and margins so that you can better evaluate our performance. China. China market has regained its momentum in quarter 4, driven primarily by growth in the emerging cities in the country. We continue to perform well in China, with unit shipment growth approximately 16% year-to-year, more than 2x the market growth. This resulted in our further increase of our share in the market. According to the preliminary industry estimate, our share for the fiscal year hit a record high of 29.5%. 
PC sales increased 7.7% year-to-year to approximately $2 billion. Strong growth in emerging cities and desktop PC are the main driver for the strong growth in China, but it also resulted a lower ASP, which is average selling price. Nevertheless, our gross margin remains stable. The PC operating margins stayed at about 5%, dropped slightly year-to-year due to increased R&D expenses, as well as selling expenses. We are very confident that the PC margin will remain relatively stable. 
The Mobile business in China continue to be on track. Unit shipment growth was strong at 27.3% year-to-year, and I will cover this in more detail a little bit later. Our 3G smartphone, which is the LePhone business, is progressing well. We are still making investment in product development, marketing and new product promotion to drive future growth. We're also making investment in the launch of our first tablet product, LePad, in March this year. As a result, our overall operating margin in China dropped to 4%. And we expect our investments in the Mobile Internet business will help to drive growth in China over time. 
Looking at emerging markets. Our expansion in emerging markets continue to show good momentum in quarter 4 across all geographies, products and customer segments. New distributors were up 31.5% year-to-year, market share further expanded to 5.7% and up 0.8 points year-to-year. Sales were up 14.2% year-to-year to $850 million, and operating loss narrowed to $10 million both quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we further improve our operating efficiency. 
We are particularly pleased to see that share gains in countries like India, up 2.8 points to 10%; Russias, which is primarily Russia, up 3.5% to 8.9%; ASEAN, up 1.3 points to 6.9%. They are either profitable or breakeven with objective to achieving a stronger and much more prominent market position with sustainable profitability. We continue to invest in branding to drive our volume growth and extend our market share to reach 10% in more key countries.
Looking at the mature market. We continue to record good growth in the mature markets. Unit shipments up 7% year-to-year against the market drop of 12%, boosted by the strong momentum in the commercial business as corporate continued to refresh their machines. 
Market share as a result was up 1 point to 5.7%, and this is the record high market share we ever achieved. In addition, we also maintain our position as the #2 commercial notebook manufacturer and have become the #1 relationship notebook player in the world. North America remained a key market in the region. Unit shipment is up 25.4% and also achieved a record high market share of 5.8%. We're profitable in all countries in the mature region, except for Western Europe. Performance in Western Europe was, however, affected by the weakened consumer sentiment and our relatively small presence in some distribution channels. We endeavor to take actions to improve our consumer business with an objective to improve the overall performance and profitability in Western Europe. 
Sales were up 13.3% to approximately $1.8 billion. Operating profit improved to $36 million from a loss of $6 million a year ago, and operating margin also improved to 1.9% for the quarter. With the continuing improvement of our commercial business in the region, we expect that profitability in this region will continue to improve.
Next charts, please. Looking at by product. From the product perspective, the Desktop business continue to perform well. Unit shipments and sales in our Desktop were up 17%, and 13% year-to-year, respectively. Our market share in worldwide desktop market increased 1.8 points to 10.2%. Our all-in-one products and SMB targeted desktop continue to see good growth momentum, and we were #2 all-in-one producer worldwide in the fiscal year. The all-in-one category has doubled in shipments and it account to approximately 39% of our worldwide consumer desktop product sales in quarter 4. 
Notebook continue to demonstrate good growth momentum through our winning product portfolio. Unit shipments in sales were up 15% and 12% year-to-year respectively. Strong performance in the commercial business helped offset pressure on the consumer business, and the increase Think branded product mix resulted in the high increase in sales. 
Our worldwide market share increased 1.2 points to 9.7 points and have become the #1 relationship notebook player in the world. During quarter 4, we introduce a new wave of ThinkPad Edge products for SMB and the next generation of ultraportable business laptops, further enhancing our Notebook portfolio. 
Finally, Mobile products also showed very strong growth in quarter 4. Unit shipments were up 27% year-to-year. Our feature phone business continued to show strong shipment growth at 24% year-to-year and will remain the largest domestic mobile handset brand in China, with market share up by around 1.5 point year-to-year. Our 3G smartphone, which is LePhone unit shipment, was below 100,000 units in quarter 4, largely due to a slower seasonality. We continue to work closely with the telco operators in China to broaden our distribution coverage in China and enrich our app store platform, which we call LeGarden, to enhance user experience. Yuanqing just shared with you our newly formed organization MIDH group, which will coordinate the overall mobile Internet initiative to drive future growth. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Looking ahead, we are optimistic of the PC market and the mobile Internet space. China and PC market growth will likely to continue to regain momentum in coming quarters on improving market sentiment. The corporate PC refresh cycle will continue its momentum and will continue to leverage this cycle to grow profitably and gain share for the group. 
Similarly, the strong growth momentum in emerging markets that we saw last year will likely to continue. We will continue our solid execution of our Protect and Attack strategy, which will give us a balanced performance to further consistently expand the business scale and improving our margins. We will stay focused on the cost initiative and growth opportunity. We'll continue to invest in our core competence building, product innovation and branding, especially the new MIDH group to drive our future growth. The new MIDH group will coordinate our initiative to drive growth in the mobile Internet business and will continue to launch new products in the smartphone and tablet. 
Even with this investment, we expect our E/R ratio to improve in the next few quarters due to better scaling benefit arising from our increase in volume. We have a very healthy balance sheet, and we'll continue to be prudent in managing our cash to create shareholders value. As well as we will also look for M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth. In the meantime, we will focus on the smooth integration of our joint venture with NEC after we close the transaction at the end of June.
We are very confident that with our well-defined strategy and action plan in place, Lenovo will continue to improve its performance and profitability in the next few quarters. 
Now let me turn to Chairman Liu.",2450
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., 2011 Earnings Call, May 26, 2011",2011-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3774.0,134560.0,8806210.0,Presenter Speech,Chuanzhi Liu,,Executives,3,"[Chinese] Dear friends, good evening. By this quarter, it has been more than 2 years since the company adjusted the top leadership. 
During the first year following the change, we turned around the business. In the second year, our profit grew substantially against the previous year. Now, we are enjoying a very strong momentum. For 6 consecutive quarters, Lenovo has been the fastest growing one among all of the major PC makers of the world. Our North America and European markets have become very profitable, and our emerging markets have grown market share substantially while staying profitable. 
Our business is very balanced in all geographies, all business units and all product lines. What's most encouraging is that our Think branded product line has become the key driver of our profit, and this result exactly fulfills our original intention of acquiring IBM's PC business. But all of this results I have mentioned are not enough to prove that our acquisition of IBM's PCD is a success. The most effective proof point is the top leadership team who are very united and are working with very good rapport. The team is very determined about goals and works as a good example for the whole staff. 
In addition, across the company, a positive culture has been built. For Chinese employees, as well as employees across the world, their confidence and aspirational spirit are getting stronger and stronger. Given this foundation, the strategies developed by the management will certainly be executed well and with determination. 
In virtually every board meeting, the directors were delighted by the fact that the management overachieved or sometimes well surpassed what they committed. It has been 6 years since Lenovo's acquisition of IBM PCD. We have undergone various hardships, testing and quite a long period of adaptation and integration. Now, we can say proudly and surely that this large-scale M&A has been a success. 
Currently, Lenovo is facing new significant challenges. That is the new demands by our customers for products and services with the emergence of the mobile Internet. Facing such challenges, the board and management of Lenovo are calm, realistic and focused in addressing them. On the other hand, we are taking the challenge as an opportunity with an enterprising and upbeat spirit. Over the years, since establishment especially through the M&A of IBM PCD, Lenovo has accumulated certain R&D capabilities and capital. The board has approved the management's initiative of allocating quite a large proportion of profits of each quarter and each year to invest significantly in brand building and R&D.
Given this foundation, the management will analyze the industry landscape and trends. They would start from a conceptual and a macro perspective, and then move to micro and detailed level. Their analysis and exploration enable them to craft a strategy with phases to achieve technology innovation and the business model innovation. We just established the MIDH business unit, led by an executive with proven track record. 
Starting from this year, we will take China as an arena to make breakthroughs by rolling out a whole new series of products, including smartphones, tablets, smart TV and et cetera. In this new field, we will learn and adjust continuously.
Our strong historical track record and consistent style of doing what we say will give our shareholders, customers, confidence in us. Over time, we will prove to them that we can deliver. Lenovo's vision is to be an endearing, trusted technology business that is well-respected across the world. We are marching towards our preset goals step by step with perseverance and determination. I firmly believe that Lenovo's future will be very bright. Thank you.",606

Two questions. First is that in this previous quarter, the March quarter, the Western Europe seem to have a little bit loss. So I wonder how much of that was because of your competitors has stopped the channels and caused your abnormal performance, or is that really a market demand slowdown? And what's your assessment of your, the market demand right now? That's the first question.",72

We've been winning in the commercial segment, as well as in China across our key segments. In Western Europe, what we saw is some macro economic issues around the Eurozone. Our business performed very well in that space, and in front of that, it actually took share. But because of competitions, long position in inventory, this put pressure in the marketplace. And there was a disproportional amount of inventory in the PC segment across Western Europe. We believe this market will continue to slowly improve as its macroeconomic environment improves. But our business has continued to perform reasonably well in the front of those kinds of pressure. And actually, as we've seen, our commercial business is now #1 in large enterprise and public sector. And we've seen very strong performance across that. And that's why we're investing today to expand a global campaign around for those who do a marketing campaign to lift our brand presence, to create a deeper awareness and consideration for all our product segments in Western Europe and across the emerging market. So in West Europe, I think that the inventory position from our competition was a factor, as well as the macroeconomic environment. But again, we took share, we outpaced the market, and if you reflect on Yuanqing's comment about mature markets, in mature markets, we hit our all-time high for market share and had some of our best profit driven by our Think business, our Think business in both SMB, Small and Medium Business, as well as commercial. This Think business is where our business is strong, and we're seeing strong market performance.",286

If that circulation is correct, I think in the past 2 quarters, you spent around like $19 million, like $22 million each quarter for this related investment. So should we look at this number as normalized run rate into the future, or will you also start to spend this kind of marketing related dollar in R&D in the other regions, as you rollout your mobile Internet products into other regions?",79

And you may have noticed that we've seen a step-by-step, quarter-by-quarter improvement in our operations, margins, and our execution across the planet. I didn't mention it earlier, but we saw almost 0.5 million unit improvement in our inventory position over the last quarter, where many of our competitors have seen their inventory position erode. So we're well-positioned for velocity and momentum going forward. I think that's a key factor in terms of the business. Did you want to make any additional comments? The investment of that MIDH. He was talking about $19 million investment. Well, from a standpoint of investment, as our margins improve quarter on quarter, as they've gotten better and better, as Yuanqing and Chairman Liu commented in the presentation, we are taking investments around that global market campaign to build our global brand, as well as to invest in those key business area where the market is growing. The mobile Internet is a key segment. We must lead and gain market share to a leadership position in China. We've leveraged the ecosystem. We begun to build with the LePhone launch last year. And now with LePad in March, we'd continue to expand on that. You'll see us continue to funnel off a portion of investment each quarter to fuel that growth in this key segment.",243

So in terms of marketing investment, so why we need to invest so much money? Because now, although Lenovo has very strong brand in China, but our brand is in PC side. So we need to build stronger branding in the phone area, in the Mobile Internet area. So we should build the leadership position in resale in terms of the brand. So that's one. Certainly, we need to invest more on R&D area. But now, I think we have the constraint on the R&D. It's the product development, because we don't have enough results to develop multiple product lines. So we will further invest in this area to ensure we will have more attractive, more competitive products in the market.",140

I think the way that you try to read the numbers, probably the difference between the segment profit between China and China PC, that is definitely not the right logic of business investment we invest in our MIDH business. I think it's more substantial business, part of our key growth in the future. We actually invest a lot more than that. And the way that you look at the numbers, I think the logic is not correct because in the non-PC business, there are mobile handsets business which is very profitable.",98

I'm from Macquarie. Two questions. First of all, I would like to ask you, previously, there was this earthquake in Japan. How does that affect the supply situation of components? And from now on, in the coming months, what would be the impact on the price of components? That's the first question.",58

The March '11's earthquake was a tragic event in Japan. Fortunately, in the quarter that we just completed, all of the parts were already in the supply chain structure. So no impact in terms of supply chain activities. Over the last 2 or 3 weeks of March, we saw some impacts in terms of -- not the core main component, but in the second tier components like disk controllers, smaller chip controller component. And we saw some potential gap within the next quarter's supply. But our product teams and our supply chain has worked very hard in the current quarter. They've closed the supply chain, supply plan, to support our objectives for the quarter. And we do not see any significant impact in terms of the supply chain and our supply plan to support our objectives for the quarter in Japan or anywhere around the world. In terms of pricing, what we did see was some tightness of product components in the first 6 weeks with the quarter. We saw that. And now those component pricing had some small increases. But this is marginal and not impacting our overall growth and objective. So we've seen a very healthy business in our Japan business. It's performed well. And our global supply chain is well-positioned and not feeling any material impact from the earthquake from March '11.",232

Lately, we're all talking about the economy slowing down. Are you worried about any hard landing? PMI hasn't been very positive. So can you talk about that? What do you see from your perspective? Is it going to slow down? Any significant signs?",54

Why is that? Right now, many commodities in China, well, they're already looking at the biggest market but for PC computers, we're only the second largest. U.S. is still the biggest market. But we believe in the coming 2 years, we are going to grow into the biggest market. Concerning PC infiltration rates compared to the United States, there is still a big gap, especially since China is part of the mature market, also part of the emerging market. For the mature market part, it is already saturated. But for medium- to small-sized cities, there is still great potential for growth. So we will pay close attention to this area. Concerning the macroeconomic situation, we're very confident. We believe they will be high-speed development and growth. Although there are some controlled measures on profitability sector, but the impact will be very mild. Chairman?",166

But for the longer term, there's plenty of room to sustain high-speed development of the Chinese economy. For example, the Chinese government has announced clearly that consumption has to be the polling factor for economic growth. Relevant measures have already been implemented. They have been chanting a slogan for quite some time, and we now feel that actual measures have been implemented. So China is going to become the fastest developing market. Chinese and international enterprises will enjoy great opportunities to enter the Chinese market. So if we do this well, the exchange rate of renminbi can be resolved so that the amount of export will not greatly exceed the amount of import. So many problems can be resolved from this angle. So why is there great room for development? We'll have more than 200 million population in the villages. Through urbanization, they will have great demand. In the past, the land and villages could not be transferred. And now there are new policies that land can be transferred. And that means a lot of labor will be released. And they will have great purchasing power. And I know the government has some concepts in mind. Last year, they were making preparation for the '12 5-year plan and some new leaders were coming on board. So from medium to -- maybe in 2 years' time, I think the situation will be very positive. For the shorter term, it's hard to say because there will be different fluctuations and factors.",264

So the PC market, as Yuanqing mentioned, is quite strong. And our performance came in at almost 16% versus a market of less than 8%, 2x faster.

I think this also include any technology or other adjacent areas. I think the key for us looking at M&A is not really, I think, just an M&A alone. I think we really have to look at, I think, what value do we want to bring in to acquire in order to add to our existing capabilities so that we could have a bigger win in the market. So I think we are very -- I think, if you look at our balance sheet which is relatively strong, carrying very little debt, I think we have a capability of doing many things, but we don't necessarily just zoom on one area. I think when there is an opportunity -- I think the other thing, the key thing is we obviously, if you look at our core business which is going very handsomely over the last couple of quarters, and we continue to see that trend growing. And what I really want to say is, we do not necessarily rely on M&A to fund our growth. As and when there are good opportunities with that, we can add value. I think in different aspect of our existing portfolio of businesses, I think we will consider. Our balance sheet can afford us to do that and we will -- no doubt, we'll do that.",255

That's really driving that. So we look at it around the Protect and Attack strategy to really add scale. The second part of the acquisition areas that we target are around the ideas of the Mobile Internet and expanding into those key strategic areas. Those that give us the balance and allow us to expand in that space. And remember, one of the key things to the success of the IBM transition is the fact that we've implemented a very consistent culture, what we call The Lenovo Way, a culture around ownership where each of us act as owners, putting the company first and around commitment. We do what we say, and we own what we do. And this culture binds us, all 27,000 Lenovo employees across the planet. This we see in terms of the joint venture with NEC where we see a strong culture around innovation and time to market. Our ability to leverage The Lenovo Way, to integrate companies and acquisitions and joint ventures is very powerful. It gives us a competitive advantage to continue to scan the landscape for those opportunities that present themselves, either strategically or around scale, both of those. The Lenovo Way and that culture has been a key differentiator in the acquisition which, I think, is a competitive advantage for Lenovo.",265

So as Rory said, so we will focus on 2 areas to have the acquisition, so scale and the strategy. And so but even for scale, we would not just to buy volume, we will buy the capability. We will buy the capability. So we need to understand where is our strength area, where is our weakness area. So if we buy some company that could help us to strengthen our weakness area, so to lift us to that next stage.",88

And I think one of the differentiating capabilities that we've introduced is the tailored ecosystem for China. That experience that's created on the Lenovo LePad is unique to the China consumer, to the customer here. Many of the other products that are being introduced in China have fundamental weaknesses in their capability to fulfill the interest in experience for the China consumer. And I think what we've done with the launch of LePhone last year, was to build that initial ecosystem. Now with LePad, we begin to build the convergence around smartphone, tablet, and then ultimately PCs, gives us a competitive advantage that sets that objective to go after 20% market share, which is, in our opinion, quite reasonable, given that we have 29.5% market share in the PC segment.",144

I learned to play this war game on LePad, which is very popular in China. But if I want to do the same on iPad, it's very difficult because many commands are in English. And it's hard for me to understand. If it's all in Chinese, it's very convenient. So I play until 1:00 a.m. every night. So LePad situation right now is very positive.

Since you are including the NEC operation in your financials in the upcoming quarter, can you give us some idea on how we should be looking at your operating expense, say, in the June quarter and the September quarter?

I mean, obviously, they are #1 market share, and we -- I think you need initial stage, I think as a guidance. I think that you really should look at, I think, we would probably be hitting a level which is commensurate with our current overall cost structure. I mean, obviously, that is the bottom line we'll expect that we will generate significant value out of that. But as you know, any business combinations, I think, will take time, and we are very sure that we will improve from there. But I think as a guideline, that will be sort of commensurate with our existing operating cost structure.",120

Last quarter, we improved our GP margin by 2 points year-on-year. So this is our management long-term commitment to our shareholders. So we will keep improving our GP margins. So, actually, I think we can improve GP margin, so, the following couple of areas. The first is good implementation of our strategy. So now you know we have the Protect and Attack strategy. So protect means we will protect our profitable. But attack means that we need to attack the market share, to grow, to focus on growth first. That means probably we will invest something in those markets, where we have to sacrifice the margin in those areas. But we have given the clear guidance to our team. Once certain markets so they can reach the double-digit market share, so they should shift their focus from the growth to profitability. We want to have the profitable growth in those markets, so I think with the better implementation of the strategy. So step by step, we can improve our GP margin. The second point is we should further invest in the innovation. So we strongly believe the better product, the better technology, the better innovation can help us to improve the GP margin. Actually, over the past couple of quarters, we improved our GP margin. Partially, it's because of our investment on R&D in the past. Like recently, we just launched our ThinkPad X1. I think it's a perfect product. So many multinational media give us very high -- how do you say, appreciation -- assessment review, so very positive review. So we will continue to do innovation in our product and the technology. Certainly, we are also -- we further refine our business model so to improve the end-to-end efficiency. So I believe that would help us to improve our margin as well. We have prepared to improve our warranty service cost, our E/R ratio. So I believe that could help us to improve the margin. So we will consider how to improve the manufacturing, logistics, efficiency. So I believe those actions will help us to improve margin as well.",361

One other area where we'll continue to invest in addition to innovation is in marketing, building our brand on a worldwide basis. As we drive for double-digit share in each country, we must continue to expand our brand awareness and more product consideration. This will lift margin. And as we've seen our results continuously improve quarter-on-quarter, we're using those dollars, some of those dollars to make investments in the product areas that you see the great products out there, but also in building the brand. We've launched a global campaign called For Those Who Do. And it's the idea that we create the technology and the solution for the doers on the planet, the people who make things happen, the people who are going to create the next rocket ship to space, or their next great literary novel. We are creating that technology. That will increase awareness and lift margin as we move step by step, quarter on quarter, over a sustained period of time. Thank you.",205

Thank you for joining us. Hope everyone is off to a great start in the new year. Now, I'm looking forward to discussing our third quarter earnings with you.
Next slide. Once again, we continue to achieve strong results across the world. For the fifth straight quarter, Lenovo is the fastest growing major PC company. We grew 21% year-to-year, more than 6x faster than the market already. Our worldwide market share is 10.2%, up 1.5 points year-to-year. Our balanced growth come from strong performance worldwide. For the first time since the global economic crisis, we have made more than USD $100 million net profit. Overall, our PDI is USD $121 million. 
Our gross margin improved to 11.2%, up almost 1 point quarter-to-quarter. At a glance, this was clearly due to our improved think product mix and the lower component of prices. But looking deeper at the fundamental reason was the right strategy, which I will discuss later. 
As we said last quarter, we increased our investment in marketing, product research and development. This investment will improve our long-term competitiveness. This will push our EBITDA slightly higher quarter-to-quarter. But thanks to efficient operations, we kept our EBITDA ratio near historic lower level at 9%. In terms of growth, PTI gross margin and EBITDA ratio, we achieved another strong performance this quarter. 
Next slide. These results show that our Protect and Attack strategy continues to deliver good results. Our strategy is driving balanced growth worldwide. In the second quarter, we reached double-digit market share in 10 countries. In last quarter, we increased that number to 15 countries. As you will see later, we outgrew the market in all regions, product types and customer segments.
Next slide. Our China business remains very strong, reaching a all-time high of 32% market share. Again, off 2.4 points year-to-year. As you can see from the chart, we grew in a fiercely competitive market, where our competitors were losing market share. Our success comes from strong growth in small cities and rural areas, Large Enterprise business and all-in-one Desktop PCs. 
We outgrew the market by 3x, increasing shipments by 13% year-to-year compared to the market rate of 4%. Our segment profit declined USD $3 million year-to-year. That was due to our large investments in Mobile Internet. Our board and our management team believe that, that is an area crucial to Lenovo's future. If we don't win in Mobile Internet, we will be sidelined even as we continue to grow in PC.
Next Slide. In the rest of the Emerging Markets, growth is the key of our strategy. We grew 43% year-on-year, well ahead of the market trend of 16%. Particularly in India, we reached double-digit market share for the first time. We also grew 3.3 points year-on-year in Russia and close to 1 point in Latin America.
Next slide. Let's talk about the Mature Market. In this market, our key focus is to protect our profit pool and we have seen good results, as the segment operating profit grew USD $29 million year-on-year. What's even more exciting is that our protect looks more like a tax [ph] sometimes. As we become more competitive, we not only make profit, but also continue to gain market share. Our shipments grew 23% year-on-year as the overall market lost 4 points. We gained over 1 point market share year-on-year. 
For the first time, Lenovo has become number 1 worldwide in notebook sales to global Large Enterprise customers, public customers, with 21% market share, and we are now number 2 worldwide player in commercial notebook segment. Particularly, in North America, we grew 29% year-on-year when the overall market lost 4%. In Japan, Lenovo was the fastest growing major PC company for the sixth straight quarter. Our share in Japan is now over 7%, up almost 2 points year-on-year. We expect to further strengthen our position in Japan through our new joint venture with NEC, which I will discuss next.
Next Slide. So this partnership with NEC plays very well with our global strategy. We are confident for several reasons. NEC's strength in commercial and consumer markets fits perfectly with our strategy in Japan. Both Lenovo and NEC are deeply committed to innovation. This partnership will also benefit greatly from our cost signatures. 
After our announcement, I received Japan's largest electronics retailer, Yamada Denki, where NEC products represent 28% of its offering mix. They told me that, as Japan's number 1 PC brand, NEC products are selling at 20% premium over Lenovo products. It is also selling at a higher price than most Japanese multinational brands. The retailers inside the U.S. are even more confident because when NEC products start to use the components at Lenovo's price, our profit will be very substantial. It is not only our stable business, but also can drive significant profit growth.
As you know, with the successful integration of our IBM PC business, we have experience bringing organizations together and creating a unified company. I believe we will benefit from this experience. With our combined share in Japan, Lenovo will now be the market leader in 2 of the world's 3 largest markets.
Next slide. We recognize more and more that Mobile Internet will be an important battlefield. It will have a major influence on the entire PC industry. Fortunately, we are ready for the challenge and we are ready with innovative products. 
To be more competitive, we created a new organization recently. Mobile Internet and the Digital Home. Our efforts have started to pay off. As you can see from last quarter's results, we doubled our sales of LePhone to 230,000 units. At the CES [Consumer Electronics Show], we introduced the LePad and the hybrid notebook U1, which received excellent reviews and media coverage. To further grow in this space, we will continue to invest in development and marketing.
Next slide. Looking forward, we are confident in our future growth based on our competitiveness through our products, business model and culture. Also, we are very confident in our 2 core markets, China and the worldwide Large Enterprise customer business. 
Although the short-term outlook may be moderate, we have full confidence in China's long-term economic growth. We believe that China will become the world's largest PC market soon and our business will grow with the market as well. At the same time, the global economy is recovering, corporate replacement cycle will continue. We like our position and are very optimistic about the future. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to our CFO, Wong Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",1096

I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance for our Quarter 3. Next chart please. Yuanqing just shared with you that we have another strong quarter, with balanced growth across geographies and customers and product segments through the solid execution of our strategy. Group sales in Quarter 3 were at $5.8 billion, up about 22% year-to-year. PC sales were up 17% year-to-year to $5.6 billion. Sales from the Mobile business in Quarter 3 were $218 million, up 87% year-to-year if we compare this to its own performance last year prior to acquisition. This is also the third quarter we recorded a full quarter contribution of our Mobile business. 
Gross profit was at $648 million and was up 22% year-to-year. Gross margin was 11.2% in Quarter 3. It was up slightly compared to 11.1% in Quarter 3 last fiscal year, but up by 9 points from 10.3% last quarter. Improvement in gross margin quarter-to-quarter was primarily due to our effective margin management, increase of the Think product mix and softening component prices. 
Operating expenses increased 21% year-to-year to $521 million. This figure included our mobile operation expense, which we did not have in the last year results. We mentioned in the last result webcast that we would increase our investment in product innovation and branding for long-term sustainable growth. In this quarter, we invested in love and [ph] promotion to drive future growth after we restored the supply shortage of display screen in Quarter 2. 
Although the sales volume increase in Quarter 3 helped to achieve better scaling expense, this investment led to an increase in our expense-to-revenue ratio to 9% for Quarter 3. We expect this investment in product innovation and branding will enable us to have a sustainable growth and gradually improve our gross margin over time. Meanwhile, we will continue our emphasis in expense control. 
Operating profit was up 28% year-to-year, with operating margin improved to 2.2% benefiting from better scaling in gross margin. Net financial cost was $4 million derived principally from the interest rate differential between deposit and interest rates and factoring cost. Pretax income was $123 million, up 31% year-to-year if excluding restructuring cost and our pretax income margin improved to 2.1%. We recorded $2 million restructuring costs in Quarter 3. Accordingly, our pretax income after restructuring was $121 million, up 29% year-to-year. 
You may recall that we recorded some one-off expenses of $42 million same time last year. They were provision for non-reimbursable warranty cost for replacing components and past and licensing fees. We also recorded a net gain of $43 million from the disposal of some of our investment during the quarter last year. The group taxation was $21 million and the effective tax rate was around 17%. The lower effective tax rate in Quarter 3 is primarily driven by strong performance in Quarter 3, while the effective rate is normally high in low season like Quarter 4, where the operating margin is expected to be lower. We expect the annual effective tax rate to stay within 25% to 30% in the short term before our operating margin shows a significant improvement.
We reported a net profit of $100 million for the quarter, up 25% year-to-year. This is the first time our net profit reached $100 million level since the financial crisis during financial year '09.
Basic EPS improved to USD $0.0103 from USD $0.0086 last year. Now let's have a look at the balance sheet in the next chart. 
Our balance sheet at the end of December remained strong. Noncurrent asset were around $2.7 billion, which was similar to [indiscernible] March 2010. Current asset was slightly over $8.5 billion against $6.2 billion at 31st March 2010. The increase was due to increase in bank deposit and cash and accounts receivable, which were in line with the increase of our sales. Current liabilities were close to $8.5 billion against $6.4 billion in 31 March 2010. The increase was largely due to the increase of our payable, resulting from an increase in sales and our outsourcing to ODMs.
As a result, we have net current assets of $83 million, as of 31st December against $184 million net current liabilities recorded as 31st of March 2010. Let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. 
Net cash reserve continue to improve to $3.2 billion against $2.4 billion of the same corresponding period last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue. We continue to do well in managing our working capital. Days of inventory increased 1 day year-to-year to 16 days. Days receivable increased 6 days to 30 days year-to-year. The increase is largely due to our continued expansion into emerging markets, particularly consumer products through our transaction model, which tend to have a longer credit period and lever inventory [ph] .  We have also increased ocean shipments to reduce costs, which contributed to a high inventory level. 
Meanwhile, we have included the mobile operation, which was not in last year's results. Mobile business typically has a longer receivable level compared to PC. Days payable also increased 6 days to 77 days year-to-year, largely due to increase in our outsourcings to ODMs. 
Next, the cash conversion cycle in Quarter 3 was negative 31 days, similar to negative 32 days last year or negative 26 days in the last quarter.
Next chart, please. This chart summarizes the performance by geography. We have excluded restructuring charges and one-off items from the operating profit and margin so that you can better assess our operating results. China accounts for approximately 46% of growth sales. Sales in China were $2.7 billion, up 18% year-to-year or 2% quarter-to-quarter. PC sales were $2.5 billion, up 8% year-to-year. We recorded $218 million sales from our Mobile business, which was not in last year's results. Lenovo feature phone business continued to do well and our smartphone LePhone also recaptured growth momentum after we resolved the display-screen supply shortage, which we had in the last quarter. 
Operating profit was down slightly year-to-year to $132 million. Operating margin was 4.9%, down from 5.9% year-to-year and down from 5.7% quarter-to-quarter. The drop in operating margin was primarily due to increase in marketing expenses incurred to dry [ph] lower phone business in Quarter 3. Operating margins for the PC business was 5.6%, down from 5.9% last year and 6.1% last quarter. This was due to the increase in selling and marketing expense.
Emerging markets, excluding China, account for approximately 19% of group sales. Lenovo continues to show strong unit shipment growth and share gain across the board in this region. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 34% year-to-year or up 4% quarter-to-quarter. Financial performance continue to improve and operating loss reduced by $4 million quarter-to-quarter but worsened $7 million year-to-year. As part of our attack strategy, we will continue to invest in this region to drive shipment growth and market share to close to 10% in key markets to establish optimal market position and sustainable profit in the future. 
In this quarter, we have 15 countries achieve more than 10% market share, an increase of 5 countries compared to Quarter 2.
Mature markets account for approximately 35% of group sales. We also recorded strong growth and share gain in all major markets in the region. Sales were $2 billion, up 22% year-to-year or down 2% quarter-to-quarter. The increase was helped by the strong growth in commercial business. This is the first quarter all markets in the region recorded operating profit since the financial crisis. With the continuing improvements of our commercial business in the region, our operating profit in Quarter 3 was $22 million and operating margin was 1.1%. Both operating profit and margin were up year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter.
Next chart, please. This chart summarizes the performance by product segments. Desktop performed well in Quarter 3. Unit shipments were up 23% and sales were up 18% year-to-year and it accounted for approximately 35% of our sales. Our market share in worldwide Desktop market increased by 1.9 points year-to-year to 11.1%. Our all-in-one products and SMB-targeted Desktop continue to see good growth momentum. Notebook also saw good growth momentum through our winning product portfolios. Unit shipments grew 19% and sales were up 15% year-to-year. It accounted for around 59% of our sales. Our market share in worldwide notebook market increased by 1.2 points year-to-year to 9.6%. Our newly launched ultra-portable ThinkPad Edge E10 and IdeaPad U260 notebooks, which targeted SMB and consumer client, respectively, further enhanced our notebook portfolio.
Finally, mobile products also showed strong growth during the quarter. If compared to its performance last year, unit shipments were up 52% while sales up 87% year-to-year. This was a result of a very strong growth in our feature phone business, as far as the increased sales from high unit pricing LePhone. Our feature phone business showed strong shipment growth at 39% year-to-year and remained the largest domestic mobile handset brand in China, with market share up by about 1 points year-to-year. 
Our 3G smartphone phone LePhone recaptured growth momentum and we continue to work closely with telco operators to broaden our distribution coverage in China. In order to enhance user experience of LePhone users, we launched LeGarden, which is our application platform during the quarter and will continue to enrich our FStar [ph] platform.
Before I end my presentation, I wanted to give you more color on the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic for the worldwide PC market outlook despite macro challenges in global economy and debt crisis in the mature markets. Despite China market showing moderate growth, we expect it to continue to grow faster than the rest of the world in the long term. In addition, the corporate replacement demand, especially in mature markets, will continue to pick up gradually. Growth momentum in the emerging markets would likely continue, as we continue to execute our share growth strategy. We continue to invest in R&D and branding with an objective to drive future sustainable growth and better gross margins. 
And now the area of investment is our Mobile Internet business. We plan to launch our first tablet product, LePad, in China later this quarter and globally in June. We will also be launching our CES award-winning hybrid notebook, which is IdeaPad E1 hybrid later this summer in China. These investments, however, will cost the expense-to-revenue ratio to increase in the short term, especially during Quarter 4, which is typically a low season. And the ratio will normally be higher sequentially compared to Quarter 3.
We announced our NEC transaction in January. NEC currently is the market leader in Japan, which is the third largest PC market in the world. We have started and we'll focus in the integration coverage and work to ensure the planned synergies will be realized. We expect the deal to close on 30th of June this year and we'll start the consolidation in the September end of quarter. In addition to our Protect and Attack strategy will enable us to grow faster in the market, we will continue to look for M&A opportunities within the PC industry to accelerate our growth. Now let me turn to Chairman Liu.",1862

For 5 consecutive quarters, Lenovo has continued to be the fastest growing one among all of the world's top PC vendors. Volume, revenue, costs and expenses and pretax income were all delivered, meeting the company's original commitments and targets. This is an excellent result. 
I can recall that since I resumed the chairmanship, each time when I updated investors in the media about the quarter's result, I always intended to explain what the result of that quarter meant. From Quarter 2 to 3, what Lenovo can demonstrate is the balanced development, balance in product mix, geographies and segments. In this quarter, the China market's growth moderated similar to the situation in the last calendar quarter in 2008. In that quarter, as the company's profit was heavily dependent on China, the softening of business in China led to our big financial losses, as well as downsizing and low morale. In this quarter, profits in mature markets are solid. Emerging markets achieved rapid gains of market share while staying profitable. In this way, the company turned in an excellent report card. It indicates that the strategy of Protect and Attack and balanced development formulated by the management has shown its effect.
In this quarter, the expense versus revenue ratio could have been further lowered. And the pretax income could have been 20% more. But the management allocated large amounts of the investments in brand-building and research and development, a move strongly backed up by the board. If the management has conducted rounds of thorough analysis about the industry trend and landscape in the future, we have got a clarified goal for the next and are clear about how to reach that goal with planned phases. I believe that each dollar invested today will bring handsome returns for our investors.
During the board meeting held for this quarter, Lenovo's management gave a report about how the corporate culture and core values of Lenovo, a global company, were formed and cascaded down. In this process, the most important factor is the role of leaders to lead by example. The top management of Lenovo is united, working with very good rapport. They are very capable in enterprising. The whole staff is full of confidence now versus their previous status of only starting to have confidence. Today's Lenovo has become a high-tech company, with a solid, healthy foundation. Due to innovations in technologies, the IT industry will see fierce competition in the next few years, with different players shining in different areas. Lenovo will not be complacent in the face of success, nor will it give up when confronted with failure. It will always work firmly and decisively toward this goal. Thank you.",465

So it was impacted by the spot market, by the host market, so that's true. But for long term, so we are still optimistic. So we believe with China's macroeconomy, we'll continue to grow at a higher level. So we are more confident on the PC market as well. So really in China, the PC market will grow double-digit level. So I believe this trend will continue if you are confident on the China economy, so you should be confident on the China PC market as well.",95

So if you compare China's penetration rate with the U.S. penetration rate, China is just 1/5 of the U.S. level. So that's our opportunity.

Nothing out of the normal trends. We usually see somewhere between a couple of points down in a quarter to flat or up a point. This is very consistent. What's positive, very positive about the result is very strong Think mix, you may have noticed in the results. Our Think performance was very good across the board. And that's reflective of a very strong commercial buying refreshment cycle. And that refreshment cycle, we see at about 30% of the way through. We expect that replacement cycle to continue for the next 12, 24 to 30 months, so that's really driving some very strong Think growth and we've seen very strong performance across the board. The reason we're seeing the strong margin performance on top of that is also because of the strong new products that we've been able to bring to market. Our focus on margin management, a very favorable component-priced environment and this Think mix that I've just talked about. That combined with a pretty healthy ASP is driving that nice margin improvement and the PTI improvement quarter-on-quarter. Thank you.",190

How many percentage point margin improvement has come from your component cost reductions that is mainly quite a few number of memory [indiscernible] prices that have been up and down.

We've seen improvement quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. These are the highest margin levels we've seen since before the economic crisis and I think that's reflective in some of the new strong products that we've been bringing to market in the Notebook space, as well as in the Desktop space. This is reflected in the demand and the interest in our products from our customer set. I also think our margin management are focused to really manage margin and continue to drive value into the portfolio. I mentioned Think and the corporate refresh as being a strong portion of that drive and Think is at a highest level in terms of mix in the past 4 to 5 quarters. The component prices have generally helped. There's no doubt. But we've also seen that moderate here recently. We'll expect that not to have any significant impact in the current quarter.",154

That 20 products have had very interesting uptick in the market.

For the fifth quarter in a row, Lenovo has been the fastest-growing major PC player on the planet. Our focus is to bring those high-quality innovative products to market. And we think this trend around tablet is the beginning of this next wave of innovation around convergence that moves data seamlessly across client devices. We're introducing and introduced our first tablet products and hybrid products at CES in January for China. Next, we'll bring it to the rest of the world, using the Android honeycomb product and really some exciting news is around our Think tablet strategy and work. We'll bring back this summer with an extension around the Android solution that gives us a very robust maintenance, security level that really fits well in the commercial segment. This tablet space is going to be important. But the real opportunity in front of us is this convergence across Windows, Android across devices. This is going to drive a wave of innovation. And as Yuanqing mentioned in his previous comment, this is why we are doubling down and to make investments around innovation. This will give us the lift across the long-term across margin. We won't get into specifics around our target for tablet, but we see over the next 2 years that Tablets could be 10% to 15% of the PC market. And we definitely are going to continue to participate and grow our fair share or more than our fair share in that segment.",255

We see this as a challenge within the quarter, but one we believe that we can manage through well and we can do it either 2 ways, by introducing additional Capella products into the market, as well as Intel is doing a very good job, in terms of bringing new Huron River technology processors to us very rapidly. This is a difficult transition, but one we can manage through in the quarter. We stand behind our products.

So outside China, actually Lenovo doesn't have a very strong brand, so that will have a negative impact on our Consumer business, as well as the future of Mobile Internet business. So we should significantly invest on branding, on marketing. So I think to keep our E/R ratio at an appropriate level, so it's rising [ph] for company. So with more R&D investment, with more marketing investment. So probably, we will keep to the similar level as we do today.",124

And those investments translate into time-to-market. Our investments are primarily around marketing and product innovation. It's our intent to continue to improve our time-to-market and our speed-to-market. One of the reasons that the joint venture with NEC is the right fit at the right time is because that gives us additional access to engineers and developers who have a strong track record of fast time-to-market, fast development. These combined with our research and innovation triangle across Raleigh, North Carolina; Tokyo, Japan; and Beijing, China, allows us to continually improve that time-to-market. That's our objective and one of the reasons we're making those investments in innovation. Next question?",147

So in emerging markets, the beginning so we think we should drive the growth first. We should drive the market share to the double-digit first. Then we could more focus on profitability. So actually this strategy has planned very well. So last quarter, we had 15 countries reach the double-digit market share, 5 more than the previous quarter, so we had a good example, which is India. So India reached the double-digit share last quarter. They can make a good profit so they contributed $3 million to the company. So I wish we could replicate this story to other countries.",114

One, the iPad is still quite a new product with 8 million units shipped last quarter and it's clearly leading the way. And we’re going to see a whole waft of competing products such as your own. Could you characterize where you see the demand? Is it going to be high end, mature market consumers? Clearly LePad is targeting Chinese consumers, but the tablet, as a product, there's a lot of debate on whether it's additional or substitutional as regards Notebooks, for example. My second question is on the cost savings that you hope to generate from the NEC joint venture, which you've targeted $100 million. Could you characterize those cost savings in their nature and also the timeline by which you expect to see those cost savings fall through to the bottom line?",136

And when we look at the pad as a physical device, what we need to think about, is it a media pad, or is it a PC functional pad? And we really need to start to look at those. Is it someone just doing e-books and streaming video or is it full-function PC activity? We currently see it as an additive, a third and fourth screen, and primarily focused on additional activities. We see the penetration of pad click-able across the planet and we see it in the 10% to 15% range over the next 2 years. Our products in this space are going to focus on products for those people who do. Those people who make things happen and get things done. For those that do, those are the people that are going to focus on the kinds of pads we're developing. Like our ThinkPad tablet. We'll use not only the innovation around Android, but combine it with the security and the manageability. That's differentiated. That's for people who do in the commercial environment. And then what we are doing is we're taking what we've learned in the ecosystem in China around LePad and launch a similar worldwide pad that leverages that capability. We see this as an important segment, but this is just the beginning of a key set of innovations that are going to converge information and data across Laptops, Desktops and smartphones and these Tablets. That's really the game at hand and that game is going to occur over the next 3 or 4 years.",284

You're characterizing $100 million cost savings as restructuring-related.

I think that obviously, the 10% volume will be -- well, there will be incremental benefit, But on top of that, there will be other supporting services that we obviously will benefit from.

We've been able to drive about 20% growth across the market and we've been able to be the fastest growing major PC player 5 quarters in a row outpacing the market for 7. This is because it's balanced growth. We're seeing across all segments, Consumer, SMB, Commercial.

Our all-in-one desktop solution has really taken off. Over the past 2 years, we were a relatively small player in this space and now moved to the number 2 position worldwide in that market, seeing very strong growth across all regions and segments. I think long term, the market is definitely going to continue to see stronger growth in Notebooks as an overall trend, but I think this reflects that there is a healthy Desktop environment, both driven by all-in-ones, as well as corporate refresh where we're seeing significant activities. And it's reflective in the quality and the strong products that we're bringing to market. These products are for people who do, make things happen and get things done.",150

Lenovo had another record-setting quarter. I'm very excited to share our good news with you. So let's get started. Next slide. This quarter, we achieved a record global market share of 12.2%. Record shipments of over 10 million units, and record revenue of USD $5.9 billion, and these 2 milestones brought us back to the top 3 in the global PC industry. For the seventh consecutive quarter, Lenovo is the fastest growing major PC company in the world. We grew at 23%, more than 8x the market rate. We achieved this by outgrowing the market in almost every region, customer segments and the product segments. While gaining market share, we also continued to improve our profitability with a PTI of USD $123 million, and that is a 64% increase year-on-year. 
As we have said before, we are continuing to invest in innovation and branding for our long-term competitiveness. These investments pushed our overall E/R ratio slightly higher to 10.4%. But they are necessary, and important to our long-term development. So why do we continue to have very strong quarter after another? The reasons are clear, we have the right strategy, and a strong execution worldwide. Next slide. 
Our Protect and Attack strategy continues to guide our strong execution. On the protect side, we continue to strengthen our leadership position in China and in global commercial business. On the attack side, we continued to gain share in emerging markets and in global transaction of business. We also introduced our family of tablets worldwide as we expand our business in the mobile Internet space. So now, let's look at our key areas more closely. 
Next slide. Based on the latest IDC data, China has overtaken the United States as the world's largest for PC market, for the first time. In China, while owning nearly 1/3 of the market share, we outgrew the market by over 9 points. We also increased our segment operating profit by 48% year-on-year. 
Next slide. In the rest of the emerging markets, we continue to outpace the market. We grew 47% year-on-year, more than 3x the market rate. Overall, Lenovo gain 1.5 points of the market share year-on-year. When including China, we strengthened our number one position in global emerging markets, and further distance to ourselves from other competitors. When you look deeper, the story is even better. We gained a share in all emerging market regions, particularly in India where we have gained 3.6 points. We will continue to invest in capturing growth in emerging markets, while focusing on improving profitability. 
Next slide. In mature markets, we continue to improve profitability, while segment operating profit growing USD $56 million year-on-year. At the same time, we continue to outperform the market by growing more than 8% despite the overall market drop. Overall, we reached our record-high market share of 6.6% in mature markets. Our growth was particularly strong in North America, where we grew almost 2 points year-on-year, and reached our record share of 7%. In addition, we have successfully launched our joint venture with NEC in Japan, and completed our acquisition of Medion in Western Europe. Both NEC and Medion will contribute to our business next quarter. More importantly, both will further enhance our competitiveness in these key markets. These are our highlights for different markets. Now, let's look at the Mobile Internet. Next slide. 
This business has made good progress. We sold over 80,000 LePad in China last quarter, and are still ramping up. Globally, we have launched our family of idea and think tablets, targeting different customer segments. Meanwhile, LePhone sales outgrew the market at 172% year-on-year. And last week, we launched our new smartphone, the LePhone A60 to address the one sold in RMB market in China. This is our excellent product at the price points. Next slide. 
In general, over the past 2 years, we have paid more attention to growth, and have invested a lot. This year, as we reached double-digits of market share in more and more countries, we will have a more balanced strategy. While continuing to grow, we will focus more on profitability. We will begin to implement a more country-specific strategy based on our market position. For countries still trying to reach double-digit of share, we will continue to invest in growth. For countries that have reached double-digit share, we will pursue profitable growth. We will reinvest those profits to drive more growth. For countries that already have reached the leading position, we will focus more on leveraging that advantage to increase profit. With that being said, we will continue to make strategic investments in innovation, in branding, in transactional business and the emerging markets, as well as Mobile Internet. Next slide. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic on our growth strength. Emerging markets, including China, continue to gain momentum, and outgrow the rest of the world. The global corporate PC refreshment cycle also continues its momentum. We are in excellent position to capitalize on both opportunities. Our Mobile Internet business will continue to make progress in both China and the global markets. 
So in summary, with the right strategy and a strong execution, we will continue to achieve sustainable growth and a long-term gain for shareholders. Thank you everybody. I'd now turn to Wong Wai Ming.",883

I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in quarter 1. Next chart, please. Yuangqing has just shared with you our strong quarter 1 performance. Growth has, across the board together, we continue improvement in margins even after our investment in innovation, branding, emerging markets and Mobile Internet business. In quarter 1, Lenovo grew 15% year-to-year in revenue to approximately $5.9 billion. This is the highest quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. PC sales were up 15% year-to-year to $5.7 billion. Revenue from the Mobile Internet business was $215 million, up 18% year-to-year. Gross profit was about $739 million, up 41% year-to-year and gross profit margin expanded to 12.5%. 
The strong margin improvement is largely due to better scaling, some fullment price benefits, and increased Think product mix, which allow us to continue our investment in innovation, branding, emerging markets and MIDH to drive future growth. Operating expenses increased to $616 million, which include $98 million in advertising and promotion during the quarter. The E/R ratio was up 10.4%. And we expect the ratio to trend down in the next few quarters, as we enjoy better scaling benefit from unit shipments increases. A continuing investment in branding will help us to improve our brand awareness around the world, which will enable us to further improve our margin. 
Operating profits in quarter 1 was $123 million, up 51% year-to-year. Pretax income was $123 million, up 64% year-on-year. The effective tax rate for quarter 1 was 12%. The lower tax rate was mainly due to better pretax income margin, and the reversal of a $9 million provisions previously made. Profit attributable to equity holders is $108 million, up 98% year-to-year. Now let's look at the balance sheet in the next chart. 
Our strong operating performance has also helped our balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet in quarter 1 remained strong. Noncurrent assets were about $2.8 billion, similar to the level at March 31, 2011. Changes in the current assets and current liabilities were due largely to increased activities during the quarter. We had net current assets of around $38 million at the end of June. The noncurrent liability were at around $875 million let's go through the cash and working capital in the next chart. 
Our cash flow continue to be very healthy and our cash conversion cycle further improved in quarter 1. The net cash reserve continue to improve to slightly above $3.6 billion against $2.2 billion of last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue. We continue to do well in managing our working capital, inventory days improve to 16 days in quarter 1, while days receivable increased by 1 day to 29 days driven by our growth in emerging markets outside China. Days payable improved by 2 days to 72 days, largely due to increase in our outsourcing to ODMs. 
As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 1 improved to negative 27 days against a negative 23 days last year. Next chart, please. 
In the past years, we have been using IBM's IT system in markets outside China, and such IT expenses had been allocated only to mature and the emerging markets. We have now migrated to our own integrated IT system for the entire group operations. Accordingly, starting with the current fiscal year, the IT expenses are allocated to each market segment on a flat-rate basis, with reference to their respective revenue contributions. We consider this basis more appropriate in the measurement of market segment results. The about change in allocation has no impact on the gross operating profit performance. We have, however, restated the historic figures for the like-for-like comparison. Details are set out in the Appendix. 
China. We continue to perform well in China and further expanded our market share. PC sales increased 13% year-to-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Strong growth in the emerging cities and desktop PCs helped drive the strong shipments in China, but also resulted in lower average selling price. Indeed, the PC operating margin improved to 6.4% due to better scaling, and stringent expense control. We are confident that the PC margin will remain relatively stable going forward. 
The Mobile Internet business in China is making progress. Our 3G smartphone, LePhone business is progressing well, but we are still making investment in product development, marketing, and new products promotion to drive future growth. Even with these investments, our overall operating margin in China expanded to 5.6% in quarter 1. 
Emerging markets, excluding China. Our expansion in emerging markets continue to show good momentum in quarter 1. Sales were up 26% year-to-year, to slightly above $1 billion, and operating loss remained relatively stable at $22 million. 
Mature markets. We continue to record good growth in the mature markets, helped by the strong commercial business. Sales were up 13% to slightly above $2 billion. Operating profits improved to $76 million, and operating margin also improved to 3.7% for the quarter. Next chart, please. 
From the product perspective, both notebook and desktop outperformed the markets. Unit shipments and sales in our desktop business were up 23%, and 18% year-to-year, respectively. Our market share in the worldwide desktop market increased by 2.4 points to 12.3%. Our all-in-one products and SMB-targeted desktops, as well as our sales in China, continue to see good growth momentum. 
Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 23%, and 14% year-to-year, respectively. The commercial business was especially strong. Our worldwide market share increased 1.7 points to 12.1%, and we maintain a leading position in the worldwide commercial notebook markets. 
Finally, sale for mobile Internet products were up 18% year-to-year. Total mobile achieved unit shipments growth at 34% year-to-year. Our future phone business continues to do well, and our 3G smartphone, LePhone, also shows strong growth as Yuangqing said earlier. 
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite the current volatility in the global financial markets, we may have an impact on the global economy, we remain confident on continuing our trend of outperforming the worldwide PC market. We are executing our ""Protect and Attack"" strategy well. As a result, our core business are performing well, and our strategic investment are laying the foundation for future growth. We will continue to benefit from growth in China, and in emerging markets, as well as to continue corporate refreshment cycle in the mature markets. 
We will stay focused on the cost initiatives and growth opportunities. We'll continue to invest in core competence building, product innovation, branding, emerging markets, expressly, the new MIDH group to drive our future growth. Even with these investments, we expect E/R ratio to improve in the next few quarters due to better scaling benefit arising from the unit shipments increase. 
We have a healthy balance sheet. We will continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholders' value, and look for M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth. Our strategy is to drive shipment growth, and at the same time, to improve profitability over time. We are confident that with our well-defined strategy and action plan in place, we continue to outperform the worldwide PC market, and our investment in branding, as well as our stringent expense control, we'll continue to improve our margin. 
Now, let me turn to Chairman Liu.",1220
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3714.0,161026.0,10167422.0,Presenter Speech,Chuanzhi Liu,,Executives,3,"The board is very satisfied with Lenovo's first quarter results. The highlights is the performance of our mature markets. In this quarter, the mature markets contributed USD $77 million of pretax income, becoming a major contributor to the company's profit. While in the same period of last year, mature markets had a loss of USD $9 million. This is a major improvement in just 1 year. Lenovo's pretax income for this quarter is USD $123 million, a 64% year-on-year increase, and this was achieved despite our average increasing investments in R&D and brand building. So mature markets has made significant contribution to this result. 
For 7 consecutive quarters, Lenovo has been the fastest growing one among the world's top 5 PC vendors. In this quarter, its growth rate is 8x of that of the worldwide market. During the past 7 quarters, the global economic environment, and the PC industry have undergone significant changes. The world economy experienced drastic ups and downs, and China's PC market also fluctuated, even though it has generally maintained an upward trend. 
The competition within this industry has been fierce. Profit margin has been getting thinner, and suppliers have not been stable. Any of these factors could be used as an excuse for failures or misses in our business performance, but we have not had any misses or failures. 
Since early February 2009 where we adjusted our leadership team, our business has turned around. In the initial 3 quarters right after the change, we made adjustments, and fixed some historical issues. Since then though, we have not experienced any sharp ups and downs. We have made consistent progress in shipment volume, revenue, market share and pretax income. Our business is climbing up and everything has been executed well according to original plans. 
Lenovo has an outstanding top leadership team, a correct approach of developing strategies, and strong execution capabilities. This quarter again proves this. It also proves that Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's PC business has become a success. In future quarters, you will see clearly that we will apply our learning from this acquisition into our joint venture with NEC in Japan, and our acquisition of Medion in Germany. 
In this quarter, there's one thing which investors have not paid enough attention to, while I deem it very important. In June, CEO Yang Yuanqing representing the management team, purchased 800 million shares of the company from Legend Holdings through personal financing. This made him the second largest shareholder of Lenovo. He represents not only Yuanqing's confidence in Lenovo, but it is a great example of one of our most important management concepts. We always advocate that top leaders, those who are ambitious and capable, should be the company's few owners. And we are very determined to put some financial arrangements in place to ensure that they will have that mentality, under Lenovo's parent Legend Holdings. 
In addition, to Lenovo, there are other subsidiaries: Digital China, focusing on software service and IT product input; Letting Capital, focusing on venture capital investment; Hony Capital, a PE investment firm; and Recom real estate. Today, all of them are the leading players in their respective industries in China. 
I think that one important reason for our repeated successes is that we select the right leader of a company, and build a platform for him with the foundation of true financial ownership. Yang Yuanqing is an enterprising leader with outstanding capability and bold aspirations. He took the risk of having to pay back loans to buy large amounts of Lenovo shares to become its second largest shareholder. This has fundamental implications, and meaning for Lenovo's development. 
There are 2 types of management teams. First, there are those who act only as hired hands. They make short-term decisions, and are not personally invested in the long-term future of a company. Companies led by this sort of manager, do not do well in the long-term. Then, there are those who are owners and have a personal stake and a long-term mentality about company strategy. This is the type of manager we have at Lenovo. They are owners and entrepreneurs. I can tell you that it is very easy to see immediately which kind of manager is running a company, simply by looking at how they approach business, and what attitude they have in their decision-making. This is why I think Yuangqing's personal investment is so important to Lenovo, now, and for the future. 
Legend holdings, the Lenovo Board, and the Lenovo Management Team represented by Yuangqing are grateful to each other for creating an environment where ownership and commitment are so supported and valued. This feeling will extend to be among our management and the staff over time as well. 
In China, people emphasize that a success is based on the combination of the right timing, right location, and right people. It is hard to control the timing and location factors, but for the people factor, Lenovo has got all of the advantages it deserves, and should have against its competitions. Thank you.",841

We've added 2 points of market share this quarter. And I think what's really impressive is the balance that we've seen across this 10 million units. We've strought, seen strong growth at every region, China, emerging market, and the mature market. And our market growth rate have outpaced the market in every region, and those regions have added significant shares, 2 points worldwide.

I think what we're seeing is real momentum across the board, and that's whether the market improves or moderates, it's not really important.

I think primarily due to the additional investments that we made in marketing, primarily in branding, that obviously will help us to maintain, if not improve the margin going forward. I think in E/R, we obviously -- we'll try to bring it down to a lower percentage, I think lower than 10%. I think primarily because of, I think the efforts that we made in controlling the overhead expenses, but at the same time, the E/R is also affected by the R, which is revenue. I think taking Rory's comment and Yuangqing's comment earlier, we will continue to grow our top line. So we obviously will continue to invest in branding, but the overall objective is try to bring the E/R to below 10%.",178

As Yuangqing suggests, we've enjoyed a very strong performance across the corporate refresh in all key regions. That's helped drive our mature business to its all-time share position adding over 1 point of share worldwide. And that commercial band continue to look strong. We think we're about halfway through this corporate refresh, and it could go on over the next 4 to 8 quarters is our expectation. Now may elongate because of some of the activities, but this corporate refresh is solid, and we are participating in a significant way. I think it's very important from a standpoint to also know that our notebook in the commercial space is now number 2 across the planet in all commercial, and number 1 in the relationship segment. So those are very good data points to show you the progress that we've been making, and in terms of relationship, we've not had a higher share position in commercial, large enterprise in the past several years. So we've continued to gain and acquire new customers. In MIDH, what was the question that you wanted me to hit on? Oh the roadmap for product? Okay, so from a standpoint of MIDH, I think we've made some very good progress in both our LePhone and LePad launches in China. We've seen very interesting uptake in terms of both of those and good feedback. But I also think it's very important to keep current, and to continue to drive with new product that give us fresh, current products that is very competitive, and meets the market's need. With that, we just announced 3 new pads in July where we saw both the consumer, a commercial tablet, and then later in the year, a Windows-based tablet. Those are interesting solutions that'll expand our footprint in the tablet space, past LePad, and introduce opportunity for further growth. And early, order there are quite good. In LePhone, we've seen very strong year-to-year growth, well over triple digits, and we're outgrowing the market. But what's really interesting is that we're working on a steady drumbeat through our investments in innovation to introduce new phones, and to do them faster and quicker, and reach additional price points in the crucial China market. We believe that will position us for increased and improved revenue growth and market share gains.",400

So right now actually, almost half of our emerging region have already been positive PTI. So we have total a 9 regions. Among that, 5 regions reported the positive PTI. So we have said -- right and a clear strategy for each of our regions and the countries. So for those regions and countries, that have below 10% market share.

For those countries and the regions that have about above 10% market share, so we want them to be profitable growth. And why we keep the positive PTI? We reinvest the profit of that mix to drive the further growth. Only for those countries and the regions that have the leading position, so at least the top 3 position in the market. So, we want them to focus on the profitability, to put profit as a top priority. So we have already handed a clear strategy on the regions and the countries. Now we have seen more and more regions and the countries moving from the lower growth to the higher growth. So that's why we are very confident that will help us improve our GP margin as well as the PTI.",235

Can you share some of your observations regarding the back-to-school demand in China so far? And how does that compare with the traditional back-to-school demand in the past couple of years? That's my first question.,43

So as you can see, although we had wins, sort of the market share, but last quarter we still had 9 points premium over the market, we gained 2.3 points of the share in the market. That demonstrates our strength in this country. So why we have such a strong momentum in China? Because we have the right strategy. Actually, we separate the China into mature territory and emerging territory. So now, we are focusing on the small cities and the towns to drive the growth. So the demand is still very strong. It's still very strong. The growth is still very high. So, we believe the policy, the Chinese government is striving to increase the domestic consumption. So we will continue to benefit from this policy. We believe China will continue to grow.",139

And we'd definitely seen some strength in terms of the China marketplace over the past 3 quarters at the market level. The China growth rates and the PC have improved from 4% to 8% to 14%. And at the same time, we've been able to maintain a significant premium to those growth rates. And as Yuangqing mentioned, we had a 2.3 points of market share in the most recent quarter, growing at 23% versus a market of 14%. And it's really that strategy, the clarity of that strategy around, really looking at the Tier 1 through 3 cities as a mature space. We compete very strongly there. And then in the Tier 4 through 6 cities and villages, those areas are the areas where we're seeing very strong growth, and where Lenovo had the reach, the distribution capability and the brand that's allowing us to gain significant momentum using this dual ""Protect and Attack"" emerging mature strategy. It's working and that's why we're seeing a 31.7% market share for China this quarter.",173

I just want -- make one more comment. This is Wai Ming Wong from the -- I think you really should know also, China become the largest market, I think in this quarter. This is the number one in the world, overpassing the U.S. As you may know that, as Rory said, China is growing 14% year-to-year, while the U.S. is exactly a negative 4%. So we will continue to see the strong growth in China, that when China will maintain bigger and bigger, and remain the number one spot position, and knowing that we are, I think, having the largest market share as Rory think, increasing market share with the right strategy.",114

In a China market in general, if we divide it into Tier 1 to Tier 3, and Tier 4 to Tier 6 and the villages tier sections, how is that for Lenovo, how much of your revenue in China is derived from the lower-tier city, Tier 4 to Tier 6 and villages?",58

And it's really, think about it, it's really because of the strength of our distribution structure, our channel partnerships, and just the sheer number of distribution points as well as our strong brand that allows us to open up those emerging cities and villages that gives us that lift and faster growth rate, significantly faster growth rate in the market.

So operating margin obviously, we will look at it. I think overall, I don't think there will be any significant change in the overall margin of our China business.

Medion has a very specific channel distribution, primarily distributing their products through a very large retailer by the name of Howdy[ph]. Apart from that, there are also some specialized distribution channel like, the like of Media Mack[ph] . We obviously would leverage on their ability to do the consumer business, and then we'll have Medion on one hand. I think the product continues to distribute in the Howdy[ph] distribution. Well, obviously the synergy that derived from our overall volume that will help them to improve further, I think their business.

And then, when you look about the worldwide launches, like the Think tablet in the commercial space, again, very specifically tailored to the customer feedback that we've been receiving around manageability, controllability, upgradability. These things are very relevant to the enterprise customer. I think that's the way we're looking at the innovation and the kind of tablet solutions that we're putting in place. Matching up to the specific customer, with the application functionality that differentiates the solution. Not just at the physical performance level, but in terms of usage patterns and the experience the customer has.

We wouldn't break out the specifics at the regional level. What I think the important is that, we know that China grew at 23% on a market of 14%, and the rest of the emerging markets grew at 46.5% on a market of 13%. That's an outstanding market premium. And at the same time, we've hit our all-time market share for the emerging markets outside of China, both in China and in the rest of the emerging markets. We've also seen, for example, on a key market like India, significant improvements where we've gone double-digit in market share, and our profitability has continued to increase, and margin levels have improved. And one key reason is because of the strategy that Yuangqing has put in place around ""Protect and Attack."" It's a balanced strategy. We're winning in the commercial space, in the SMB space, and the consumer space. And when we get that portfolio of product, and we get the scale, we're able to produce that. That's why it's so key that we're seeing that 46.5% growth rate for emerging markets versus the 13%, but we wouldn't break out the specifics at a regional level.",195

The separate question is about some new products that Intel mentioned recently Ultrabook. I think different OEMs seem to have different view on the potential and the timing.

There's no doubt that there's going to continue to be a movement in the mobility space for thinner and lighter. It's key. The ability for our longer battery life, and the ability for people to move and access data and information in a mobile environment with a lighter and thinner device just makes sense. Think about our flagship launch, of our X1 ThinkPad, some people have called it one of the best-engineered PCs they've seen. And I think that's a reflection, and that kind of hits the criteria of what an Ultrabook is. It's a very thin solution with a long battery life, it has the portability, and the mobility that makes it different to the customer. We believe that by moving in that direction, thinner and lighter, which has always been our heritage, Lenovo will invest in innovation to be a leader in that space, and we believe that will continue to drive demand, no doubt.",158

I think without a doubt, X1 is like a premium product that's well-respected, and I think it's well received. But I think it's selling like more than USD $3,000. So just wondering, is there any plan that you role out something at a much lower price point before the year end?",69

You'll see us introduce over the coming quarters, the ability to reach the mainstream price points with solutions that were only 18 months ago, in premium segments. That's just the natural evolution of the space. So I would expect that you'll see those thin and ultralight solution in the mainstream space in the coming quarters. I wouldn't say by the end of the year necessarily, but I think depending on the way you define Ultrabook, now, that's definitely going to happen. And we think thinner and lighter will continue to increase demand.",126

First half is for Wai Ming Wong. I want to know what's in the other expenses, and why is it negative this quarter around? And on -- in terms of the SG&A, I want to drill down a little bit further. Can you comment on the last quarter, marketing and promotional expenses. Is there any one-off expenses, and what would be the normalized level for this year -- for rest of this year? And also, in terms of R&D, it has first quarter -- level has been stable over last year, what should we expect for this year? And also the next one is for Yuangqing and Rory, on the corporate refresh visibility, given that g-test on macro fund, would you not expect PC demand to be affected? What's our leading indicators would you depend on?",138

Let me just sort of comment on the first one. I think the net other operating expenses, this is, I think there are some miscellaneous items, net of some payment of IT expenses, several of IT expenses. I think that is really sort of one-off item, I think appear in the current quarter. Now as far as marketing or branding expenses that we incurred this year, we obviously look at, I think, we really look at, I think 2 aspects. One obviously is, we will want to make sure that, I think the overall E/R is actually in line, I think with our target of below 10%. I think it will be better for me to comment on, I think the additional, I think the branding, marketing and branding investment is around $100 million this quarter. I think as compared with the year-to-year, we actually increased by nearly $35 million, and for this quarter about an increase of $30 million. And R&D, we actually spent about $80 million this quarter. So I think these are really the sort of all hard numbers, and then we will look at making the investment in marketing. Obviously, I think depending on, I think the overall E/R as well as our overall profitability, I think obviously, one aspect of this quarter is because we are improving our gross margin, and therefore allow us the ability to invest more, I think in branding, which  obviously will give us a much better foundation to improve or to hold gross margin going forward.",258

And we have, at the same time, seen our margins improve. We believe that there's been significant uptake in the corporate demand in terms of refreshing their PC fleet. And we continue to see interesting bid activity and our ability to acquire new customers. We look at the data on a longer-term range to look at the pipeline. Those opportunities where customers are going to RFP, those customers that are asking for information about corporate refresh activities. And we are seeing continued demand in that space. We do believe we're about a halfway through that corporate refresh, and we believe we will continue. Could it moderate slightly over the coming quarters? That's possible. But we look at it in terms of demand, acquisition rates and the pipeline, and all those suggest that we are about halfway through this corporate refresh and we expect it to continue through the balance of the year at a minimum.",186

Welcome to the webcast of Lenovo's Q2 in fiscal 2012 earnings announcement. This is Gary Ng, VP in Investor Relations at Lenovo. Before we start, let me introduce our management team with us today. First, Mr. Liu Chuanzhi, Chairman of Lenovo; our CEO, Mr. Yang Yuanqing; and our CFO, Mr. Wong Wai Ming.
We'll then first start with our management presentation. After that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn it over to Yuanqing.",78

I'm very excited about another record-breaking quarter. But today is also important for another reason. On behalf of Lenovo and on a personal level, I want to talk about Chairman Liu. Today, he announced that he will step down as Lenovo Chairman to focus on new opportunities and bold new goals at Legend Holdings. Clearly, he is the founder of our company and is the architect of our business and our culture. I'm honored that with his support, I have been asked to lead Lenovo as both the Chairman and the CEO. This will ensure consistency in our strategy, our culture and our execution.
As I take on this new role, I will follow the footsteps of a great business visionary. I will continue to learn from him and build on what he has created. We will continue to have the same management principle, the same culture of ownership and the same long-term aspiration for Lenovo. I know that Legend Holdings will now be his focus, but Lenovo will always be part of Chairman Liu and Chairman Liu will always be part of Lenovo. I want to thank Chairman Liu for all he has done for our company, and we look forward to making him even more proud of Lenovo for many years to come.
Now onto our great second quarter. We have been the fastest-growing major PC company for 8 quarters. This quarter, we grew by 36% year-on-year, 7x the market rate; achieved a record market share of 13.5%, record shipments of 12.5 million units and record revenue of USD $7.8 billion. We outgrew the market in almost every region, every customer segment and every product segment.
In the last 2 quarters, we have made 2 unbelievable steps forward: surpass both Acer and Dell and reached another important milestone, from #4 in PC market to #3, and now, #2 for the first time. While gaining market share, we continued to improve our profitability. Our net earnings increased by 88% year-on-year to reach more than USD $144 million. And as we have said before, we are continuing to build our long-term competitiveness by investing in innovation and branding. Even so, our E/R ratio dropped almost 0.5 points quarter-to-quarter.
Now let's look at each of our strategic areas more closely. In China, the world's largest PC market, we continue to extend our lead. We outgrew the market by more than 10 points while increased our segmented profit by 35% year-on-year.
As an already dominant player in China, this is truly an impressive performance. But we will not stop there, and we will continue to drive for more growth and better profitability in China.
In the rest of the Emerging Markets, we once again reached a new record-high market share of 8%. We grew 38% year-on-year, more than 3x the market rate. With this, we further strengthened our #1 position in global emerging markets. More impressively, we gained share in every region. Particularly in India, we gained 3.5 points year-on-year. And in Russia, we grew more than 2 points to reach double-digit market share for the first time.
Our focus in Emerging Markets is to continue investing share growth. Meanwhile, for the countries that have reached double-digit market share, we drive for profitable growth.
I'm especially proud of the performance of Mature Markets. We had a fantastic quarter. We delivered almost USD $100 million, more than double our segment profit year-on-year, and we are profitable in all regions. More impressively, for the first time, Mature Markets contributed more revenue than China did.
While we increased the profit and revenue, we also gained share in all mature markets to reach our record-high market share of over 9%, especially in North America where we have returned to the top 5 PC companies in United States.
In addition to strong organic growth, our acquisition activities have also contributed this excellent performance as well. Both of our integrations with NEC and Medion have been successful. Both of these additions are bold moves in line with our strategy.
In most M&A cases, business will drop after the merge. However, our business not only did not slow down, but actually grew faster than the respective market rates while making decent profit in the first quarter after closing. Now we are #1 in Japan and #3 in Germany.
These excellent results demonstrate that M&A has become a core competence of Lenovo. We know what kind of companies to acquire, and we have the knowledge and the experience to integrate them.
Outside of the traditional PC area, we also had very encouraging performance from our Mobile Internet business, which we view as the extended PC family. We continue to see strong LePad sales in China, more than doubled our sales volume quarter-to-quarter. We shipped 168,000 units last quarter. Now we are the #2 player in China market, with significant lead over all other Android-based competitors. Outside of China, we launched both Idea and Think tablets. Our enterprise-focused ThinkPad tablet has received very good feedback.
Meanwhile, our smartphone business again outgrew the market and gained 1.6 points of the market share in just one month. This growth was fueled by our newest smartphone, the Lenovo A60, which has increased its weekly run rate by 4x since launch. We expect our Mobile Internet business to continue its strong momentum in the upcoming holiday season.
Clearly, our Protect & Attack strategy is working very well. In addition, diverse talents, global culture, business model and innovation are also our success factors. I truly believe that Lenovo is one of the most diverse companies in the world. Our Lenovo Executive Committee, comprised of 9 members, comes from 6 countries. And because of our success, more global talents are joining us. Recently, Mr. Gianfranco Lanci, the former CEO of Acer, joined us as a consultant. And we also welcomed Idei-san, the former chairman of Sony, to join our Board.
Even with operations in over 160 countries, we are able to create a truly powerful and unified global culture, which is based on ownership spirit. Do what we say and own what we do.
Our do business model [ph], which caters toward the specific needs of a relationship and the transactional clients just got even more support from our vertical integration move. Last quarter, we announced a joint venture with Compal for our notebook production. This move will greatly enhance our vertical integration effort.
And a good strategy and a talented team still need equally attractive products to make it work. At Lenovo, we are very proud of our innovation capability and achievements. Our results speak for themselves. Most specifically, we have successfully passed HP to become the #1 player in worldwide commercial notebook space, and passed Dell to become the #2 in worldwide overall desktop segment, as well as #3 in global consumer sales. And we won't stop there, as we are managing towards our aspiration.
Looking ahead, we are deeply committed to continue building our core competitiveness and investing in branding and innovation. By doing so, we will further improve our GP margin and increase our PTI.
Overall, we are very optimistic about the future of the PC industry and are fully committed to the whole PC industry for the long run. Not only we want to become the leader in traditional PC market, but also we are confident that we will accomplish much more in those extended PC categories such as tablet and the smartphone.
Thank you, everybody. I now turn to Wai Ming.",1255

I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance for the fiscal second quarter. Next chart, please.
Yuanqing just shared with you that we have had another milestone quarter, with balanced growth across geographies, customer and product segments through the solid execution of our strategy.
Group sales in quarter 2 were at $7.8 billion, up about 35% year-to-year. PC sales were up about 32% year-to-year to $7.3 billion. We have consolidated a full quarter of revenue from NEC joint venture and 2 months revenue of Medion in the quarter 2 PC sales revenue. Excluding NEC and Medion, we had over 25% year-to-year shipment increase.
Revenue from the Mobile Internet business was $282 million, up 30% year-to-year. Gross profit was at $948 million, up about 60% year-to-year. Gross margin was 12.2% in quarter 2, up from 10.3% last year, but dipped slightly from 12.5% last quarter.
The slight quarter-to-quarter dip is largely due to increasing consumer business after including NEC joint venture and Medion. The year-to-year margin improvement is largely due to better scaling and increased Think product and geography mix, which allowed us to continue our investment to drive future growth.
Operating expenses increased to $782 million, which included $146 million in advertising and promotion during the quarter. We expect this investment in marketing will help us to improve our brand awareness around the world, which enable us to further improve our margin over time.
The E/R ratio was 10%, up from 8.4% last year, but was lower quarter-to-quarter. We expect the ratio to trend down in the next few quarters as we enjoy better scaling benefit from revenue increase, resulting from unit shipments' growth.
Operating profit in quarter 2 was $166 million, up 55% year-to-year. Pretax income was $165 million, up 62% year-to-year. The effective tax rate for quarter 2 was 12.3%. The lower tax rate was mainly due to better PTI margin and reverse of provision previously made.
Profit executable to equity holders was $144 million, up about 88% year-to-year. Basic EPS improved to USD $1.41 from USD $0.81 last year. The Board of Directors today meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.038 per share, representing an increase of approximately 46% compared to last year.
Next chart, please. Our strong operating performance has also helped our balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet in quarter 2 remain strong. Non-current assets were about $3.8 billion. The increase from that of 31st March 2011 was due to consolidation of NEC JV and Medion into our balance sheet this quarter.
Changes in current assets and current liabilities were due largely to increased activities during the quarter. We had net current assets of around $134 million at the end of September. The non-current liabilities were at around $1.6 billion.
Next chart, please. Our cash flow and cash conversion cycle continue to be very healthy in quarter 2. The net cash reserve continued to improve to about $4 billion, against $2.3 billion last year, largely due to increase in sales revenue. We continue to do well in managing our working capital.
Inventory days improved to 1 day in quarter 2, while days receivable increased by 5 days to 33 days, largely due to consolidation of NEC JV and Medion this quarter and our growing Emerging Markets outside China.
Days payable improved by 2 days to 71 days, largely due to increase in our outsourcing to ODMs. As a result, the cash conversion cycle in quarter 2 was at negative 20 days against negative 26 days last year.
Next chart, please. We are even more balanced in terms of geography after we consolidated NEC joint venture and Medion.
China. We continue to perform well in China and further expanded our net market share. PC sales increased 21% year-to-year to approximately $2.9 billion. Strong growth in emerging cities and desktop PCs helped drive the strong shipments in China, but also resulted in lower average selling price. Indeed, the PC operating margin improved year-to-year to 5.6% due to better scaling and stringent expense control. We are confident that the PC margin will remain relatively stable going forward.
The Mobile Internet business in China is making progress. Our 3G smartphone and tablet business is progressing well, but we are still making investment in product development, marketing and new product promotion to drive future growth.
Emerging Markets excluding China. Our expansion in Emerging Markets continue to show strong momentum in quarter 2. Sales were up 21% year-to-year to $1.3 billion, and operating loss remained relatively stable at $23 million. We continue to invest in growth, which resulted in a decline of margin of 0.7 points to negative 1.8%. However, we began to see progress made in the Emerging Markets. As reported by Yuanqing earlier, certain major regions have already exhibited 10% market share.
Mature Markets. We continue to record good growth in the mature markets helped by the strong commercial business. Sales were up 61% year-to-year to slightly above $3.3 billion. We have included a full quarter performance of NEC joint venture and 2 months performance of Medion in quarter 2. Both have performed better than their forecast and contributed profits to the region.
Operating profit improved to $95 million, and operating margin also improved to 2.9% for the quarter. The quarter-to-quarter dip in margin is largely due to the increasing consumer business, after including NEC joint venture and Medion.
Next chart, please. From the product perspective, both notebook and desktop outperformed the market. Notebook unit shipments and sales were up 35% and 30% year-to-year, respectively. The commercial business was especially strong. Our worldwide market share increased 2.8 points to 13.3% and became the largest worldwide commercial notebook player.
Unit shipments and sale in our desktop business were up 36% and 38% year-to-year, respectively. Our market share in worldwide desktop market increased by 3.5 points to 13.7%. Our all-in-one products and SMB-targeted desktops, as well as our sales in China, continued to see good growth momentum. We became the world's second largest desktop player.
Finally, sales of mobile internet products were up about 30% year-to-year. Our mobile phone business, including feature phones and 3G smartphone business, continued to do well. Our tablet products also show strong growth. As Yuanqing said earlier, we're #2 in the China tablet market, with around 8.4% market share.
Before I end my presentation, I want to give you some color on the market outlook. Despite the current volatility in global financial markets, which may have an impact on the global economy, we remain confident in continuing our trend of outperforming the worldwide PC markets. We believe the balanced nature of our growth that helped our strong performance in the past several quarters that is China, emerging market and corporate refreshment demand, will continue to enable Lenovo to outperform and outpace our peers.
Based on the initial assessment of our October performance, we continue our growth momentum in China, Emerging Markets and Mature Markets. Nevertheless, the recent flood in Thailand impacting global supply of hard disk drives would likely affect the PC supply in the short term. We have already taken actions to try to mitigate the potential impact. The abrupt distortion in the supply will however inevitably result in cost increase in hard disk in the short-term, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. We will prioritize our customers, but also monitor very closely the cost efficiency.
We will stay focused on the cost initiatives and growth opportunities. We will continue to make opportunistic investment, i.e., to use additional profits above our internal targets to fund investment in core competence building such as product innovation, branding and in Emerging Markets, especially in the new MIDH group to drive our future growth.
Notwithstanding this investment, we expect our E/R to improve in the next few quarters due to better scaling and benefits arising from the unit shipment increase. We have a healthy balance sheet. We will continue to be prudent in our cash management to create shareholder's value and look for M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth.
Now let me turn to Chairman Liu.",1348
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3891.0,204770.0,12108198.0,Presenter Speech,Chuanzhi Liu,,Executives,3,"[Next is the translation of Chairman Liu's remark.]
Ladies and gentlemen, Lenovo's performance in this quarter is outstanding despite significant investments for future growth. Its PTI increased and over achieved targets. The management developed strategies in a right away and built a solid corporate culture, and the morale of the whole staff is very high. The board is very satisfied.
When looking back on Lenovo's history, it was 1990 when the company started making computers bearing its own brand. Through our journey, we have experienced 3 critical challenges or 3 watershed moments.
The first challenge was in the early 1990s, when China opened its PC market by lowering import tariffs and canceling the quota system. So foreign PC giants started to occupy the China market. Domestic players were not able to compete and fight back. Lenovo was a very small company dwarfed by multinationals like IBM and Compaq in terms of technology, capital, management capability and talent.
In 1994, Lenovo reviewed itself and identified its own weaknesses and then implemented major reforms on organizational structure and business models. We selected the then 29-year-old Yang Yuanqing as the General Manager of the newly founded PC business unit. Since then, the results have been truly miraculous.
Lenovo started with no more than 2% market share in China and then managed to increase it to be 27% in 6 years and has been firmly holding the #1 position in China and even Asia-Pacific. Only people who are involved in this process know that the capabilities and wisdom Lenovo earned through this process were earned through sweat, tears and even blood. What Lenovo got at this point was not only just market share and profits, but also the capability of learning and understanding the insights and know-how of the industry.
We also developed the ability to continuously build the foundation of the company. At the same time, it got a motivated capable team, as well as leaders of divisions and business units headed by Yang Yuanqing.
The second challenge was in the mid-1990s when Dell started to enter and develop in China and Lenovo's shares started to drop. With its innovative business model, Dell conquered the U.S. and European markets. In the China market, Lenovo battled hat-to-hat against Dell for 3 hard years. I remember that the industry insiders and media all thought that Lenovo faced a killer enemy at this time.
After 2 rounds of failures, in the third year, that was 2004, Lenovo won the battle with its bold deployment of new business models and excellent execution. This battle and its win has very fundamental implication for Lenovo because it provided confidence for Lenovo's expansion into the global market, built the foundation for the duo business model and developed a group of capable leaders. Yang Yuanqing at this point became an experienced leader and CEO who knew how to learn from past experiences.
The third challenge was the acquisition of IBM's PC business in May 2005. When we decided to go for it, observers in the media thought it was a typical case of a snake swallowing an elephant, and our possibility for success was very slight.
Prior to the acquisition, Lenovo China's Board and management did thorough analysis and evaluation. Why would IBM sell this business? Why has IBM lost money in this business unit and we could turn it around? What did we want to get? The brand, technology and global resources? What are the major risks? The risk that customers will not buy in the ThinkPad brand under a new owner, the risk of losing employees and the risk of cultural collision. We had plans in place for all of this. In retrospect, it is very important to think things over and have a clear idea. Yang Yuanqing was already an outstanding CEO, but to manage an international company is different than managing a Chinese one. So in the beginning, we insisted on hiring an international executive to be our CEO and Yuanqing was the Chairman.
With the attitude of respecting and compromising, Yang Yuanqing observed and learned how to be a good CEO of an international company. However, culture integration and adaptation, which means how people from different backgrounds, companies and countries get along with each other and work together was crucial to our early development. This is a live issue in the real world, rather than something theoretical.
In the integration and adaptation, collisions were inevitable, and a nice person may not necessarily end up working happily with another person. In this special international company, we had to decide how the Chairman worked with the CEO and how the Board handles the conflicts between the 2. These are all of the issues in cultural integration and adaptation and a tough challenge we used to face.
The worldwide financial crisis in 2008 was the trigger factor of Lenovo's financial losses. We adjusted the Board and the top management team and embarked on a new journey. I'm sincerely thankful for the previous 2 CEOs who passed valuable experience in international business management to Yuanqing and developed a large group of international managers. I'm very grateful for our board members who are fair, candid, loyal and committed. On one hand, they stick to principles. On the other hand, they will take advices to make relevant changes.
Given this foundation, we got a new united board which prioritized the company first. Yang Yuanqing built a solid outstanding top leadership team, and we finally succeeded in handling the cultural integration and adaptation. In this year, our partnership with NEC PC and Germany's Medion have been very smooth, and the success was because of this foundation.
In summary, Lenovo had undergone extreme hardships and risks, but we successfully survived and passed the 3 milestone type of test. As you have heard by now, I'm announcing my retirement from the position of Chairman of the Board of Lenovo. The Board has accepted my proposal and has appointed Mr. Yang Yuanqing as the Chairman. And at the same time, he will continue his CEO role.
I would like to highlight several points of this announcement. First, during the past 7 years, after acquiring and integrating IBM's PC business, Yang Yuanqing has grown through various challenges and tasks and is now fully qualified for the role of Chairman of the global company. In addition, he's an outstanding CEO in our industry. Under his leadership, Lenovo will climb and reach higher and higher summits.
Secondly, several months ago, Yang Yuanqing purchased 8% of Lenovo's shares from its parent company, Legend Holdings, through personal financing. This shows that he is fully confident and motivated about the prospect of the company. He's one of the true owners of this company. As Lenovo's founder and representative of its major shareholder, I wouldn't retire from this position without full confidence, certainty and thoughtful arrangements.
Thirdly, in the future, Lenovo will face challenges in the mobile Internet area. However, Yang Yuanqing is heading a united, extremely capable global leadership team. He masters the right approach of developing strategies and executing them well and enjoys a strong corporate culture as the foundation.  Given this culture, employees love this company.
Based on the above-mentioned 3 points, I believe Lenovo will take challenges with calm and confidence and leverage all of the strengths it has accumulated over the years. It will divide its goal into different phases, tackle different regions in different priorities. And finally, we will be among the leading players in this industry.
Again, based on the above-mentioned 3 points, Lenovo will not be complacent in front of short-term success, nor will it be defeated by failures. Even though we are far from our goal, we will march forward with determination. Lenovo will become a great company and an enduring one with limitless future.
As the founder and Honorary Chairman, I will love this company in the same way I cherish my own life. As the Chairman and President of its parent company, we will be willing and ready to provide all necessary support to Lenovo at any time. I know Lenovo will continue to soar to new heights and achieve all of its dreams and aspirations.
Thank you.",1366

So we do have some inventory of hard drive. So in short-term, it will not impact our shipment hard [ph]. But we do have things, some concern on the supply of the hard drive. And also, the hard drive material cost has been increased significantly. But I believe we -- because we have strong growth momentum, so -- and also, for a long time, we have built a very strong relationship with those hard drive partners. So we believe -- so we -- oh, I should say we will try our best to get more supply of the hard drive. So actually, we have fine-tuned our strategy. So we will pursue to maximum our profit, rather than to pursue the volume growth because of this supply constraint. And also -- so we have some policy to give to those suppliers to ensure we can get the best benefit from those hard drive suppliers.",159

So in the tablet area, so we shift almost double the volume the previous quarter in China. Now we have 80% of the market share, and we're ahead of other Android-based players. So we are leading company in the Android-based seasoned player. So in the smartphone area, so we have changed our strategy. So in the past, we only used one model to compete with iPhone [ph] model. So it's very hard to beat them with this strategy. So we changed our strategy. We have developed multiple models to cover not just the high end, but also mainstream and the low end. So we believe, in the mainstream and the low end, there are even big markets, particularly in China, particularly in the small cities in China. So after we changed these strategy, so also, we have strengthened our relationship with those operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. Particularly, the cooperation with China Unicom has made a lot of progress. So with our A60, with our A60 model, so we believe we have very good opportunity to ship more than 0.5 million per month this quarter. So we do have seen some positive progress. So actually -- so in the tablet area, we used a similar strategy. So we developed -- we have developed multiple models, not just the 10-inch tablet, but also 7-inch, 5-inch tablet. So we believe we have a unique competitiveness in those areas. So that drives the growth in China market. So that's the answer to you.",275

While we definitely see a lot of momentum in our Mobile Internet products, I think it's growing at a very, very high rate. But nevertheless, I think Mobile Internet -- I think if you really look at our quarter 2 numbers, it accounts for about 3% to 4% of our revenue. I think while on one hand that the growth rate is very, very significant, very, very fast, but it probably will not be very, very significant over the 1 or 2 years compared with our overall growth business. Because if you recall, I think the PC business I think in this quarter, we have $7.5 billion turnover. So this is really providing the engine of our growth I think in the future.",132

So our smartphones last quarter recorded 335% year-on-year growth, gained 1.6 points of the market share in just 1 month, although it's still tiny in our overall portfolio. But we are very confident.

First question is directed for Wai Ming. Of the $100 million dollars in synergies from NEC consolidation, how much of it has been reflected in the quarter? And how much more can we expect going forward from here? And my second question is again on the hard disk drive. This is a follow-up. Can we try to quantify the impact of the shortage? For example, in terms of margin pressure, how much impact may be taken by your margin for the next 1 to 2 quarters?",90
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3891.0,204770.0,12108209.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,14,"So let me just comment on the NEC. Obviously, the $100 million is on an annual basis. I think that is our initial assessment of the total synergies that we can derive from the NEC acquisition -- the NEC joint venture. I think we're actually on track. So on that basis, you can actually work out on a pro rata basis the amount of synergies that is incorporated or that is reflected in the quarterly results that we had. We will continue to drive more synergy. I think apart from the, I think from the global supply chain, the material, the component side, we obviously will consolidate further, I think, how to improve the efficiency that there are obviously more synergies that can come out. So that, I think, answered your first question. 
The second question on hard disk drive, what is the -- whether I can quantify by way of reduction of margin, I think at this point in time, it's actually very, very difficult. As Yuanqing just mentioned, we obviously have a number of action in place I think, first of all, to secure the supply. But no doubt that there will be an increase in cost or pressure, increase in cost. So we obviously would want to balance -- I think, as Yuanqing also said, that we obviously take profitability in mind. We will make sure that, I think on one hand, that maybe hard disk actually have an increasing cost. We obviously will drive very, very hard to have a cost improvement in other areas. As a whole, our objective remain that we want to maintain the overall margin of the operation.",276

So I want to repeat Wai Ming's answer. So definitely, hard drive cost will be increased, but we will drive other component cost down to balance the overall material cost. Meanwhile, from that, in the sales and -- for our sales and marketing, we have given them the clear direction: don't drive the volume growth too much. So we are confident that we will keep the market share. So no problem on that. But try their best to maximize the profitability. So we are still committed to deliver the decent profits to our shareholders.",95

One thing I just really want to give by way of background information, as everybody would know, that I think component prices, or different component prices, did go up and down I think in different period of time. So this time around, I think we obviously see the very unfortunate natural disaster in Thailand that may actually push up the hard disk drive. But just to sort of think about, I think in the past, we actually have memory, we have LCD would obviously also go up as well. I think we obviously believe our execution excellency will be able to do -- take actions to mitigate that. Very, very briefly, I think hard disk generally -- I mean, because it all depends on different configurations, is really between 6%, 7% of the total, I think, cost of the machine. So I think it is cost up. But as Yuanqing said, that we actually take action to make cost out of other components, and this is not the first time that we see that happen in the PC industry.",180

The first question is about sales. Apparently, your September sales came in better than expected. Can you share with us which region that were performing better so that lead to the upside? And also, can you comment on the corporate refresh cycle?",46

So in China, although we have already had the 1/3 of the market share, we still kept 25% year-on-year growth, with 10 points of the premium of the market. In entire Emerging Markets, so we were 3x of the market average growth. So we grow at 37% year-on-year. And in Mature Markets, so if you consider the acquisition of NEC and Medion, so we actually grow at more than 25% [ph]. But if you use the pro forma, pro forma number, so we still grow by 25% of almost reflect market growth. So particularly in Mature Markets, not only we outgrew the market, but also we made money in each of the regions. So they made very decent money. So I want to highlight Japan. So we just finished, just closed the deal with NEC. So that was the first quarter, we combined NEC PC business into Lenovo's performance. So in most M&A, so the first quarter, their revenue and the profit would have dropped down. But this is not Lenovo-NEC's joint venture's case. So we -- not only -- so even if combine the business, we still grow at around 15%, 16% level compared to the 2% to 3%?",211

So we have more than 10% premium. So this is very unusual. This is very unusual. And also, in the past, NEC PC lost money. But in the first quarter, because we quickly realized the finished, so we successfully turned around the business. We recorded very decent profit in Japan market. So now, we are the solid #1. We are the solid #1 position in Japan as well. So our Japan team's morale is very high. So they try to catch up China's market share. So actually -- so we changed our incentive plan for our Japanese team as well. In the past, in Japan, there was almost no development. Very, very few bonus. But we change the incentive plan. So because they delivered the strong performance, they can get a good return as well. So we are very confident we will continue to deliver the strong performance, not just in Japan but also in Mature Markets.",164

I just really want sort of clarify I think Yuanqing's point on bonus. I think he's referring to the NEC before coming together with Lenovo. Lenovo has a culture of I think performance-driven culture. Obviously, our Japanese team has been growing and obviously, rewarded accordingly. But with the Lenovo culture, with the result that they achieved in the first quarter, that obviously reinforced the combined I think workforce that we have in Japan, meaning both Lenovo as well as the NEC joint venture.",84

So our model, A60, which is a model of -- we cooperated with China Unicom so has very good margin, GP margin. But certainly, some other models, so we don't have good margin now. So I believe, with the volume growth, with strong volume growth, so we can get the better material cost. So that will help us to improve the margin. So actually, a large part of the margin was not that good in our Mobile Internet business. Partially, it's because we had to write off some old inventory, particularly in the tablet area. So I believe, with the launch of the new models, so we will improve our GP margin. So Wai Ming, you want to...",119

I think, as Yuanqing said, that obviously, we continue to see the improvements in gross margin of our smartphone business. There's one thing I just really want to sort of flag out, is while that we see extremely encouraging progress I think in the mobile internet area, I think initially now in the smartphone, as far as we obviously also offer different products and different segments in the tablet market, but nevertheless, I think the Mobile Internet today is still account for 3%, 4% of our revenue. We will continue to see very significant growth. I think this is obviously -- we believe firmly this is a growth engine, but it will take a number of years before it become a significant part of our business.",127

So in Mobile -- so overall, in Mobile Internet area, so it's still the stage of investment. So I believe now is not time to talk about how much money we can make from this –- it’s still investment area.

As you mentioned, a lot of growth in China is actually coming from the low-tier cities. Can you talk to us about your strategy there and your market share? And also, what's the growth trend going forward for the next maybe 2 quarters?",54
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3891.0,204770.0,12108226.0,Answer,Yang Yuanqing,,Executives,31,"Yes, this is exactly our strategy in China. So we actually split the China market by Mature Markets at hand, and Emerging Markets as well. So Tier 1 to Tier 3 are the matured markets. And The Tier 4 to Tier 6 are the emerging cities. So we actually have the higher market share in the emerging cities. So because we have been always the pioneer to develop the lower-tier cities, so we benefited from that. So Wai Ming, do you have the effect on that one?",87
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,3891.0,204770.0,12108227.0,Answer,Wai Ming Wong,,Executives,32,"Yes, I have. I think that in the -- obviously, in the emerging -- China emerging is about 35%. China mature is 65%. We're roughly -- just a reminder, this is not talking about China market as a whole, because it's really talking about the consumer business in China, which I think for us is 35-65. And again, if you really look at the IDC number, the emerging city obviously has a much higher rate. And if I may quote the IDC number, I think in 2012, I think the IDC number is growing 20%. The mature city is growing about 14%. And really, going forward, it's about 30%, 26%, 25% 3, 4 years out. So our unique market share position or leading position in the emerging cities, which in our own terms called China Emerging Markets, is actually giving us a very strong engine for our growth. And bear in mind that I think this is really one of the drivers, that China in the first quarter of this calendar year, bypassed U.S. being the largest market and at the moment, is still showing a high growth. And one of the main driver of the high growth, apart from the general growth in the economy, is really the PC penetration that primarily come out from the China Emerging Market. And adding to your question, which obviously this -- I think that there is a sort of trade-off is on one hand, while we have a tremendous high growth in the Emerging Market, I think they tend to have a little bit more desktop rather than notebook. And the gross margin will be a little bit lower, but at the same time, our E/R serving those markets will also be a little bit lower as well. So all in all, I think that China provides the engine for growth, as well as provide a very solid stream of income I think to the growth.",324

My question is on the Emerging Markets side. We see that some of the markets like Russia and India have already moved up to around 10% market share or even higher. Do we have any kind of timelines in terms of when the Emerging Market business could approach breakeven levels, given that you're also approaching your target of 10% market share for the entire group of emerging market countries?",74

So we want to drive more market share. So we want to drive more countries to reach the double-digit market share. So we actually have grouped emerging countries into 3 categories. The first category is below a 10% market share. We will continue to invest to drive the growth. We can say that's the investment growth model. For the second category, so they have already reached double-digit market share for those countries. So we will drive the profitable growth. We will drive the profitable. For example, India is a good example. They have reached double-digit market share. So now they have recorded very, very good profit, very good profit as well. So for the third category, so if we have the leading position in the market, so top 2, top 3, so we call those countries as our profit engine. So we have very clear strategy for each of the emerging markets. So with this strategy, so I believe step-by-step, we will improve our profitability. We will improve our profitability. So actually, last quarter, we have seen very strong year-on-year growth in all emerging markets. Particularly, in India and Russia, we gained almost 3.5 point of the shares. India recorded a very positive profit, and also Emerging Markets as a whole. So we also improved the profit significantly, right?",233

Obviously, we are now #3 consumer worldwide, and that is consistent with Yuanqing's comment that once you achieve 10%, we obviously will try to drive profitable growth. But obviously, you should really look I think the emerging market breaking out into China, as far as non-China. China obviously is a driver of our profit and within the emerging market, there are countries where we have already reached 10%. We will obviously continue to drive profitable growth, but there are other big countries like Brazil that we obviously have not reached the 10%. We will continue to invest to basically execute our Protect & Attack strategy. So I think from an analyst's point of view, obviously, one really should not just look at general. We are #3 worldwide consumer and 10% because within that 10%, we obviously have market where we are -- we do very, very well like China, like Japan. We’re obviously over 20% or nearly 30% market share, but there are emerging countries or countries in Emerging Markets where we actually exceed 10%, we will drive profitable growth. There are also a lot of high growth countries in the Emerging Markets. We will continue to invest to drive this super growth for the group.",213
