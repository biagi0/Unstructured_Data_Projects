For several quarters, I have talked about our accelerating performance, driven by the strong execution of our Intelligent Transformation strategy. Today, I am pleased to say, despite the tough environment, we delivered exceptional results across all our businesses. Our strong performance starts at the top line. Group revenue grew year-on-year for the sixth consecutive quarter reaching USD 14 billion, the highest in 4 years. Our pretax income reached a all-time record of USD 350 million, up more than 130% year-on-year. As the profitability improved in all our businesses, our net income significantly improved from the loss of USD 289 million last year to USD 233 million profit this year. 
Since its formation last May, our Intelligent Device Group has improved both revenue and profitability every quarter. Our PC business delivered a record-high revenue and profit. Our revenue grew by 16%, outperformed the market by more than 17 points. Operating profit also improved by 1 point. We remained the undisputed #1 in both PC and the PCD with yet another record market share of 24.6% and a share of 17%. 
We focused on high-growth and the premium segments. Our Workstation, Thin and Light and Visuals revenue outgrew the market by over 30 points, gaming by 16 points and Chromebook by over 220 points.
While we maintained our revenue and profitability in China, we grew much faster and improved profitability outside of China. 
In our Intelligent Device Group, we will continue to invest in high-growth segments focused on customer-centricity and drive the convergence of computing, communication and intelligent technologies. We are confident this business will continue to outperform the market. 
The more exciting story is that our mobile business become profitable worldwide for the first time thanks to the Motorola acquisition. This result comes from strong execution of our strategy to reduce expense, simplify product portfolio and focus on key markets. 
Our Motorola brand is on track to keep expenses below USD 1 billion for the year. In Latin America, we maintained profitability and a #2 market position despite the currency volatility and the supply constraints. In North America, we had a breakthrough quarter with improved product portfolio. Volume outgrew the market by more than 40 points. Profit improved USD 90 million year-on-year and returned to profitability after 6 quarters. In China, we quadrupled our revenue year-on-year last quarter. 
Lenovo never stops innovating. Our moto z3 and 5G mod were announced as Verizon's first 5G mobile solution. We will continue to innovate and execute our strategy to resume profitable growth in our mobile business, particularly in our focus markets. 
Our Data Center business continues to grow. Revenue maintained a strong double-digit year-on-year hypergrowth, and profitability improved for the fifth consecutive quarter. This is the result of continued hypergrowth in Hyperscale and software defined. 
Our Hyperscale business grew triple digit year-on-year, driven by majority of new projects being designed and manufactured in-house now. And the software defined grew almost 70% year-on-year. We remained the #1 worldwide in the supercomputer rankings. 
We will continues to invest in technology leadership and building end-to-end product portfolio in our Data Center business. Our new joint venture with NetApp in China will further strengthen our portfolio and expand our business. We will also further develop our capabilities in software defined with the aim of becoming the segment leader. 
To become the leader and the enabler of Intelligent Transformation, we will continue to drive growth through smart IoT, smart infrastructure and smart vertical solutions. We demonstrated our execution of smart IoT strategy at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. We are making devices like PCs and the tablets smarter by adding voice and image engines to provide a more personalized service. For example, the smart tab we created with Amazon and Baidu.
We are also developing smart consumer devices for homes like Smart Clock, Smart Display and more. Our DCG will drive smarter infrastructure by capturing the opportunities in cloud and edge computing. Our big data and smart vertical solutions revenue showed great progress, growing almost 70% year-on-year. Our software and services revenue continued double-digit growth, reaching USD 638 million last quarter.
In closing, I want to share an analogy with you. I'd like to think of Lenovo as a mountain climber. Once we reach one peak, we immediately take aim at an even higher goal. Getting from one summit to another one sometimes means we have to go down first before we go up. It means we need to develop new tools, new skills and discover a new path to reach new heights. But once we set a goal, we never give up. 
Today, I'm happy that the new strategy we've put in place 4 years ago is showing strong results. New foundation of our company has been built. and Lenovo has returned to Fortune's list of most-admired companies. With our strong execution, I'm confident that we will continue to climb and reach even greater heights.
Now, let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",848

I will take you through Lenovo's financial and operational performance in Q3 fiscal year 2019. Next chart, please. 
Let me first share with you the financial highlights of our Q3 performance. Lenovo deliver a strong quarter with many parts of our business setting new records through our robust execution of the Intelligent Transformation. Our group revenue was EUR 14 billion, up 8% and 13% year-on-year if currency impact is excluded. The revenue in constant currency at EUR 14.6 billion was a record high to Lenovo, led by strong performance from both PCSD and DCG. 
Gross profit increased by 17% year-on-year, while gross profit margin expanded 1.1 percentage point to 14.6%, the highest in 10 quarters. The result was driven by solid margin expansion in PCSD and better profitability in MBG. 
We continue to drive operating efficiency, and our expense-to-revenue ratio was reduced by 0.4 percentage points to 11.5%. Group PTI was a record high at $350 million, up $200 million from a year ago. We saw PTI improvement across all business groups. 
Profit attributable to equity holders for Q3 was $233 million, significantly improved from a loss of $289 million a year ago. Basic earnings per share was USD 0.0196 compared to loss per share of USD 0.0253 same period last year. Next chart, please. 
Our operational cash flow continue to improve and show strong improvement both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter thanks to solid performance across all our businesses and strong execution in reducing our inventory in both finished goods and parts inventory. We expect this operating cash flow improvement to be sustainable, and we'll continue to use our cash reserves to invest in business growth. Next chart, please. 
Intelligent Device Group. Our intelligent business group, which includes PCSD and MBG, continued to demonstrate healthy revenue growth with profit improvement both year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter. Revenue growth remained solid at 6% year-on-year driven by our strong PC business. IDG's PTI improved by 2.1 points to 4.7% year-on-year and it's been the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement. PCSD improved its PDI margin to 5.4%. MBG reported its first pretax profit since the Motorola acquisition. Next chart, please. 
Our PCSD business has record-high revenue with 12% year-on-year growth. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we achieved double-digit growth. Our PC revenue grew 16%, outperforming the market by more than 17 points. Strong growth was recorded across the board in commercial business and the segments including Workstation, Thin and Light, Visual and Gaming products. All of them continue this double-digit revenue growth in Q3. 
We have showcased several new smart devices and smart home products recently at the CES. These are parts of our Intelligent Transformation strategy.
PCSD revenue in Q3 was $10.7 billion, setting a new record and driven by market share gain. Its pretax income was a also a record high at $584 million. We continue to drive market share in commercial and premium segments resulting in better sales mix. PCSD PTI margin improved 0.9 percentage point to 5.4%. Next chart, please. 
For the Mobile business, we achieved a pretax profit in Q3 for the first time since the Motorola acquisition. We executed well with our core market strategy and saw strong momentum in North America and solid business performance in Latin America. Coupled with our efforts in streamlining product portfolios and expense reduction, all this contributed to the profitability improvement. Reported PTI margin, thus, improved 6.1 percentage points year-on-year and 3.2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. 
Our revenue is starting to show signs of stabilization, in contrast to revenue decline in the past several quarters due to our strategy to focus on core markets. We believe the transition is largely completed. A solid foundation has been built, and we are now ready to drive sustainable future growth. Next chart, please. 
Our Data Center Group deliver another strong quarter with solid revenue growth and profitability improvements. Q3 revenue continued its double-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, while its PTI margin continued to improve year-on-year. 
Let me provide more detail on this segment performance. Hyperscale had another great quarter and maintained its strong triple-digit revenue growth with margin improvement driven by incremental contribution from in-house design and manufacturing and customer diversification to more profitable orders. Software Defined Infrastructure continued its hypergrowth for the seventh consecutive quarter thanks to fast-growing hyperconverge systems. Our Flash Arrays growth also grew at a triple-digit rate, which is more than double the market rate. Revenue from DCG was up 31% year-on-year to $1.6 billion in Q3. PTI margin improved significantly by 3.6 percentage points year-on-year. 
Moreover, it is worthwhile to highlight the progress we made in our Intelligent Transformation. The Device as a Service business continued rapid growth with its booking revenue more than double quarter-on-quarter, up 111% quarter-to-quarter. Our big data and AI-powered smart vertical solutions revenue also grew 68% year-on-year during the quarter. Next chart, please. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to build our strength as a global company with worldwide manufacturing capabilities, leading supply chain efficiency with our extensive experience in managing the ongoing volatility in the macro environment. We aim to drive premium to market revenue growth and deliver industry-leading profitability for PCSD business. We will continue to improve our user experience, expand our innovative products lineup and drive future growth. Our investment in capability building in the smart devices and smart IoT are gaining traction to become a future growth driver. 
For Mobile business, we will continue to execute our strategy to resume revenue growth, especially in focus markets, while maintaining profitability. We will continue our strategy in streamlining our product portfolio and driving a more competitive cost structure. We will also continue our investment in innovation, such as our 5G upgradable phone which soon be available in the U.S. markets. 
For the Data Center business, we are confident that we will deliver premium to market and sustainable healthy growth continuously. We have established solid capability in business model, product leadership and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We aim to continue to outgrow the market in every segment where we participate, from IoT, to Software Defined Infrastructure. Meanwhile, we will continue strengthen our leadership position in high-performance computing and AI, and we expect growth momentum in our Hyperscale business to continue thanks to our competitive advantages in design, manufacturing and global fulfillment. 
In storage and networking, the NetApp strategic partnership and joint venture will capture more business opportunity for us to drive incremental growth. We will accelerate our Intelligent Transformation in across all businesses. We will focus on converging different technologies and devices to address more market opportunities and drive our smart IoT business to the next level.

I think margins have now come back above 5%. Could you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics in the PC market? First of all, enterprise PC has been pretty strong last year. How much longer do we expect the upward-cycle-related strength to continue given some of the macro [ for PCs ]? Secondly, could you also address what has been the impact that you've seen in the December quarter from CPU shortage? And is that a tailwind from a supply perspective as we go into the next 1 or 2 quarters as that situation alleviates? That's my first question.",110

What is the -- PC market? What we have seen is still relatively strong on enterprise and, I would say, weak on the consumer, but this has been the entire 2018, the entire year. It's not that -- we didn't see any big change. I think, in consumer, we see Thin and Light and Gaming growing very, very fast. In commercial, I think it's mainly transition to Windows 10, right. And when we look at Windows 10 in enterprise, I think, for the entire 2019, situation will not change in the sense that big corporation, they already move. But when I look at medium-sized businesses, some still large enterprise and also a lot of government, they didn't move yet, and they need to move in 2019. So I think transition to Windows 10 is not finish. We will see a similar future about the entire -- this year. On CPU shortage, for sure, we have seen, a certain impact in the market. I think we have been very, very good to manage the shortage and even taking advantage probably due to our scale and our supply chain compared to some other competitors. It's still going on, I think, until Q2 calendar year. We will see probably better situation starting from July, August, mainly impacting, I would say, low- and mid-end CPU. On the high-end CPU, we didn't see any serious shortage, I would say. But the situation will continue this quarter and will continue also next quarter. Capacity, based on what we know, they will start to have a better capacity on the 14-nanometer only starting from July, August. And for sure, that's being impacted in both PC.",279

My second question is on the Data Center side. I think we've seen pretty strong year-on-year growth. But from an absolute run-rate basis we've been running at about $1.6 billion revenues for the last 3 quarters. I'm just curious, what do you expect the next leg of growth to be largely driven by, especially where there has been a fair bit of industry commentary about slowdown in data center spending from chip vendors as well as other players in the data center industry?",84

So if you look at our overall data center share, it's still high single digit, which means even in our market that's constraining, with our momentum, we can continue to gain share. So as you've seen and heard from Wai Ming and Y.Y., in the opening comments, we're consistently driving triple-digit growth in Hyperscale. We've said that we're in 6 of the top 10 hyperscalers, and some of those design wins have not yet reached production. And we're getting more profitable in that and that we're bringing it in-house with our own design, our own motherboard development and our own manufacturing, whereas a year ago we were using outside sources for all that. So much more customized. 
We'll talk about NetApp in a little bit, but I think, as we said, we are in triple-digit growth in Flash Array. And with collaboration with NetApp, I think you'll still continue to see us significantly grow there. And then in software defined, I think something like 7 consecutive quarters now, we've been growing twice the market. So we are not encumbered by some of the legacy that our competitors have, so we're aggressively embracing Software Defined Infrastructure whether that's on Nutanix or vSAN or Microsoft or other solutions in the marketplace. So I would say software defined, Hyperscale and flash storage are where we see the strongest growth in our business.",271

Obviously, the margin in Hyperscale is not where it's at in other parts of the market. However, we've been diversifying our Hyperscale customer base. I would say, 2 years ago, we were predominantly only in China. Now a growing and large portion of that is in the rest of world outside of China, and now we're moving aggressively with a new sales force into the second and third tier hyperscalers as well, which have traditionally been more profitable for the industry.",92

We will drive the scale, so our Hyperscale business. So definitely, we will ensure we can make money out from that business as well. So that we will drive the in-house design and the in-house manufacturing. So that will definitely give us the better margin and profitability. So for all the new projects, we have [indiscernible] so most of them are in-house design and in-house manufacturing. Second, we will become the technology leader, particularly in software defined and in water cooling technology. Third, so we will continue to drive the growth in the traditional Data Center business.

And we are going to keep like the way we are playing right now. So I would say, for the size we are, the market dynamics is not affecting. I mean, we have a very focused strategy, and I think, also, we're benefiting from the volatility, right.

So like In North Americas, so we will keep our current growth momentum. So last quarter we had, for the premium to the market, although market shrinked 10%, we grew by [ 13% ]. So I think in U.S. -- in North America and Western Europe, so the competition is not at fierce markets as in emerging markets. So we definitely can leverage our strength in that area to grow.",122

I mean, for our the market in the West Europe or Latin America and North America, it's probably even more driven by telco operators. But in emerging markets like India or even like in China, open market is so, so quite big. So what is your different approach or strategy, in particularly, for the emerging market?",62
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2019",2019-02-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,1194.0,1699314.0,66816089.0,Answer,Sergio Buniac,,Executives,29,"So the approach is going to be the same. We have very strong carrier partnerships in those markets. Our range in Europe is growing in each country with the new generation we just launched with the carriers. In North America that's a carrier-driven market, we are now playing with all carriers, and that's different than a year ago when we're like -- we'll be out of 30% of the carriers. And in markets like Latin America that are retail-oriented, they want to keep a strong foothold in retail while it's sustainable. So because we have this focus in strategy in the markets we play, we are playing it in equally well balanced between carriers and retail markets. So we don't see a major difference. The other fact is that we are just now first to 5G in North America. We announced the first 5G-ready phone, and in 2 weeks, you will see in the market the first mobile devices with Verizon. So we also see some growth coming from 5G as the year ago. Too early, but market should capitalize on that.",182

So the mature market and the emerging markets are different again. So in mature market, you must have the strong brands. You must be more focusing on the premium product. So innovation. So you must have the enough IP protection. So that's how you can win in the 2 markets. Emerging markets, efficiency here will be even more important. We definitely have a lot of experience in both markets. So like in Latin America, we're not the emerging market, so we have already had the success. So in U.S., North America, so we -- in the past couple of quarters, we have had hypergrowth. So we think that we can play both games in different markets.",118

And my second question will be your Hyperscale or server business, the revenues [ course ] is very strong, and we see the economies of scale for the better margin. Forward-looking, can we expect a continuous margin upside because you might have more design wins, and maybe for the board design, you can have like more [ definition ] for the component procurement. So that's my question.",82

So Transform 2.0, we launched Lenovo's largest storage portfolio in history where we announced 10 new platforms to the market in conjunction with our global partnership with NetApp. A year earlier than that, we launched our largest server portfolio in history with 14 new platforms in Transform 1.0. Relative to NetApp, we now can cover 92% of the global total available market for storage. Prior to the NetApp relationship, we could only cover 15%, and yet, we're the fastest-growing entry storage company in the world prior to NetApp. And you heard earlier that we're now growing twice the market in Flash Arrays. Relative to the joint venture, I'm happy to report that as of February 18, our China joint venture is fully operational. We've taken our first storage orders from some of the largest banks in China. And now, the financials of that JV are flowing through the Lenovo Data Center Group. So we expect this to be excellent for our margin profile as well as helping pull along the servers alongside our storage. I would also say that we announced in the last couple of weeks Intel -- Lenovo's True Scale services on Intel-based platforms. And what that is, is a truly metered dynamic solution where we can deliver as-a-service offerings in an OpEx model that's going to cover both our storage and our server platforms. So I think we are aggressively ramping the NetApp portfolio worldwide now in over 160 countries. And the JV is fully operational. On Hyperscale, I think, simply put, as Y.Y. said, more and more of our business is being designed in-house by Lenovo. We've put in significant motherboard capacity into our internal factories that are doing tens of millions of PC boards a year. So we have excellent cost structures there. And so we're getting the margins associated with the design, the board manufacturing and the system integration in addition to diversifying our portfolio not just in China but outside China in the Tier 2s and Tier 3s. So I do expect our margin profile to continue to increase over time in Hyperscale as these business models continue to evolve.",362

I understand that you guys are gaining market share pretty much in all the categories. But you had mentioned that maybe the market is softening, and I just kind of want to drill into that point. Again, it seems like, across the supply chain, it seems like Hyperscale CapEx seems to be coming off in 2019 and certainly in first half '19. Are you seeing that across your customer base when you think about new orders for the next 12, 16 months? Is there a slowdown in Hyperscale? And then maybe if you can also talk about the linearity of the deployment. Is this pushing out from first half? Is it really second half deployment? And maybe just within there, are you seeing a higher mix of AI-accelerated ASIC -- FPGA-based servers.",149
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2019",2019-02-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,1194.0,1699314.0,66816096.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,36,"Yes, so -- yes, we are seeing a increase in the diversity, I think, across the hyperscalers with the kinds of solutions they want, including GPU-based designs, non-x86 designs where we've partnered with Ampere Computing. FPGA, GPU, as you mentioned, as well as more enterprise workloads like SAP HANA moving to the cloud. We're also starting to see demand for 4-socket and 8-socket machines as well where some of the more mission-critical workloads are moving from on-prem to the public cloud. Relative to the softening, I think yes. I think it's pretty widely known in the industry that the hyperscale is softening, at least for the first half of the year. Having said that, we've been saying in this call now for several quarters that we've been getting new design wins that we've been piloting and then driving into production. So again, we'll probably benefit from new designs that we've never had entering and taking share from competitors or, indeed, using some of these nontraditional standard systems to get into the market for the first time. So from that perspective, we'll buck, I think, some of that trend and grow faster than market.",193

Understood. The second question I have is just maybe kind of broader China consumer. It seems like some of the data points is [ over there ] are softening. It could be a function of trade. But also, we're seeing some specific issue across PCs, tablets and smartphones and some sharp slow down even exiting December of last year. Could you guys just give a quick update as to what you're seeing from end demand across your products and businesses, and particularly, the China market through Q1 this year -- sorry, calendar first quarter?",95

At least, we do in the last couple of quarters seeing. The market in China has been negative for the entire 2018. Negative on [ CA ], roughly stable on revenue. What we have seen this quarter is more like the same trend as the previous 2 quarters. I would not expect that it's going to recover soon, so we will continue to see this trend in terms of softness for the next maybe 2 or 3 quarters. Then it depends on a lot of things. On data side, when I look at our performance in China, we are able -- we have been able to maintain market share both on [ CA ] and in revenue. We are even growing a little bit market share. So I think it's -- in a market that, for sure, is not brilliant, I think we have been able to manage very, very well, considering that we have almost something between 37% to 40% market share. So to keep the market share both on [ CA ] and revenue and, even more important, to keep a very good profitability.",195

So we are driving Gaming, we are driving Thin and Light, we are driving Workstation, vision in China so that we can have the premier to the market. So generally speaking, so China PC market, from a revenue point of view, is pretty stable. So we will drive the premier to the market. And also, so I think our rest of the world revenue is growing much faster, and our profitability has been improved significantly in rest of world. So that can offset the slowdown in China. So that's the situation.
[Audio Gap]
but from a mid-term to long-term point of view, so I am still a little bit optimistic even on China market, so even on the consumer segment part, because now you now have -- China has so many population. So almost in every vertical industry, so we have the largest market in the world. So we are
[Audio Gap]
from a mid-term to long-term point of view, so there is no reason we
[Audio Gap]
we cannot further grow in the PC space. Particularly, government want to
[Audio Gap]
the consumption. So I think this IT consumption, PC consumption, definitely should be the area we can stimulate the growth, stimulate the consumption. So I think we can try to upgrade consumer consumption from just a smartphone to PC. So that's why I'm a little bit more optimistic on China market from a mid-term to long-term point of view. So definitely in the enterprise space, so we have the chance as well to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. So that's the my assessment.",283

So looking at your presentation, actually, the net cash from the operating level reached a $1.6 billion level, and this is really a surprise to me. Can you share with us, is the strong cash flow sustainable? And how do you achieve that? We've just learned from Gianfranco that the sell-out, actually, bigger than sell-in. And then inventory down 4 million. And besides that, any operating metrics we can monitor in the future?",96

One obviously is our underlying profitability. I think if you actually see the year-to-year improvement in the profit, that actually is a driver. And the biggest driver is -- also come out from, I think, our diligent management of our working capital. I think, as Gianfranco said, I think from an inventory perspective, I think we actually have been able to consume more finished goods than what we planned for in order to meet the demand. Because the supply was obviously been influenced by shortage of supply of the chipset. And secondly, more important is, I think, we really focused on looking, I think, at the other 2 aspects of, I think, the working capital, namely the account receivable or account payable. I think we actually have done a lot of work, I think, in getting -- improving our accountable or supply, I think, in terms of payment and if you really look at the cash conversion cycle, I think we probably see significant improvement by a couple of days, I think, in account payable terms. So we definitely will continue that operating efficiency going forward, but as you know, I think, in terms of operating cash flow, that actually will closely -- correlated, I think, to the top line growth. So we definitely believe that, I think, the cash conversion cycle pattern will continue, and we will see that with the improvement of profitability going forward. We definitely are very confident that we will continue to improve, I think, the financial health and, in particular, the cash side of the operations.",274

Thank you for joining us today. Over the last 4 years, Lenovo has been on a journey to build a customer-centric, multi-business company that can thrive in the transforming world. We have built many new capabilities along the way. Now our multi-business operating system is in place, and the new foundation of the company has been built. I can proudly say that this is the most promising time in Lenovo's history. 
Let me start with our strong fourth quarter. As revenue and the profit improved across all businesses for the first time since x86 and the Motorola acquisitions, our revenue grew by double digits year-on-year and reached USD 11.7 billion. We also significantly improved profitability with a pretax income of $180 million, up almost 4x year-on-year. Net income was USD 118 million, up more than 260% year-on-year. 
This strong performance starts with our Intelligent Device Group, where PC plus smart devices revenue grew more than 10%. In PC, our volume grew 9% year-on-year, nearly 12-points premium to the market. And we were the fastest-growing PC company among the top 5. We returned to #1 in consumer. And our focus on premier segments led us to 34% year-on-year growth in commercial notebook above USD 800, further strengthening our #1 position. 
In our Mobile business, we were profitable for the second consecutive quarter, improving pretax income by USD 146 million year-on-year. Revenue returned to year-on-year growth for the first time in 5 quarters at over 15% year-on-year and outgrew the market by almost 27 points. Our focus on selected markets led to our revenue outgrowing the market year-on-year: in Latin America, by 17 points; in North America, by almost 60 points; and in Europe and in China, by more than 230 and 600 points, respectively. We also successfully launched the world's first 5G mobile product in store with Verizon. 
Our Data Center business revenue and profit continue to be improved year-on-year despite the tough market condition. The joint venture with NetApp in China is now operational. Our Software & Services revenue also improved by over 18% year-on-year, reaching nearly USD 620 million. 
This strong fourth quarter completed our record fiscal year. Our full year revenue exceeded USD 50 billion for the first time, reaching USD 51 billion, up almost to 13% year-on-year. Our pretax income was almost USD 860 million, up more than 4.5x; and net income was almost $600 million, up almost $800 million year-on-year.
Driven by our Smart IoT strategy, Intelligent Device Group revenue grew by almost double digits and significantly improved the pretax income by almost $1 billion, more than double year-on-year. Our PC and Smart Devices Group delivered a record revenue of nearly USD 39 billion and a pretax income of almost USD 2 billion. In PC, we returned to #1 with a record market share of over 23%. In addition, we are also the fastest-growing PC company out of the world's top 5 players. These strong results against the industry trend were driven by our focus on the innovation, in the high-growth and the premier segments as well our operational excellence.
In Mobile, thanks to our clear priority, focus on selected markets, competitive products in the portfolio and the expense control, we improved the pretax income by more than USD 460 million year-on-year and were profitable for the second half of the year. We saw rapid growth in our focus regions. Latin America reach a record share of almost 18%. North America volume outgrew the market by almost 60 points; and in China, by almost 190 points. And in the rest of the world, we cleared the inventory, improved the profit and are ready to return to growth. 
While driving our smart infrastructure strategy, Data Center business achieved the fastest year-on-year growth since the x86 acquisition, growing almost to 40% with a record revenue growth with profitability improvement. This was led by a strong growth of Hyperscale and the Software Defined Infrastructure, which had a revenue growth of 248% and almost 100% year-on-year, respectively. We remain #1 in the world in performance with 139 world records; #1 in x86 server reliability and customer satisfaction according ITIC, TBR and the various industry benchmarks; and the #1 provider of supercomputers in the TOP500 list. 
Our investment to grow LCIG also successfully exceeded 3 investments and contributed more than USD 100 million to the global PTI. For the full fiscal year, our Software & Services revenue reached USD 2.4 billion, up almost 19% year-on-year. 
This year's success was guided by clear strategic goals set at the beginning of the year followed by excellent execution. Our 4 primary objectives were: to return PC to #1, achieve Mobile business breakeven, drive faster growth in Data Center and to build our edge in AI. And we delivered. 
For the new fiscal year, we have clarified the 3S strategy. We will further drive Smart IoT, smart infrastructure, develop capabilities in big data and advance the algorithm. With these building blocks combined, we will build our smart vertical solutions and become the leader and the enabler of Intelligent Transformation. 
Our ambition remains as strong as ever. Besides the primary goal of continuing double-digit revenue growth, we have set specific objectives to drive transformation: quadruple smart devices revenue, double Software Defined Infrastructure revenue, double smart vertical solutions revenue and to grow the Software & Services revenue faster than the company's overall growth.
At Lenovo, we are like mountaineers in the past years. We conquered one height after another. In the new fiscal year, we are ready for even greater height. Thank you. 
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",943

Good evening. I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q4 and fiscal year 2019. 
Next slide, please. Let me just first share with you the financial highlight for our Q4 performance. Our Q4 results continue to show strong momentum. Revenue came in at $11.7 billion and grew by double-digit year-on-year driven by market share gains in PCSD and MBG. A notable improvement is the double-digit growth in MBG, which is a clear sign of our well-executed turnaround. 
Gross profit in Q4 increased by 23% year-on-year and gross profit margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 16.2%. Group PTI was $180 million, up $143 million from a year ago. We saw PTI improvement across all business group. Key highlights include our industry-leading probability in PCSD. MBG continued to record positive PTI even in the low season as far as improved bottom line of DCG.
For the full -- for fiscal -- well, for FY '19, the group revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, setting a new record at $51 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Gross profit increased 16% year-on-year, while gross margin expanded 0.6 percentage point to 14.4%, thanks to the margin expansion at PCSD and MBG. 
We remain disciplined in our expense control. That helped improve our operating efficiency. Operating expenses increased by 5% to $6.2 billion. And as a result, our E/R ratio improved by 0.9 percentage point to 12.1%. 
Group PTI was $856 million, representing a sharp improvement from $153 million last year, thanks to a record level of PCSD PTI, while losses in MBG and DCG was significantly reduced. 
Profit attributable to equity holders for the year was $597 million, reversing a loss of USD 189 million a year before. 
Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.501 compared to a loss per share of USD 0.167 last year. The Board of Directors decided in the meeting today to declare a final dividend of HKD 0.218 per share. Total dividend payout is up 5% year-on-year.
In Q4, our cash used in operations improved year-on-year to $478 million, which was lower than the $1.5 billion net cash generated from operation in Q3, mainly due to the seasonal factor. In Q4, we had a larger amount payable from previous quarters being settled, which resulted in a drop of net cash generated from operations. 
Our inventory days improved 4 days year-on-year, yet the receivable days worsened 5 days due to the timing difference in receivable collection. Overall cash position improved as reflected in our lower net debt. 
For fiscal year '19, improving operational performances of the 3 business unit groups along with better working capital management led to a $2.2 billion year-to-year improvement in operating cash flow. Operating cash flow improved at $1.5 billion at the end of the fiscal year. We'll continue to deploy our cash resources to invest in business growth opportunities.
Our Intelligent Devices business group, which include PC and Smart Devices business group and Mobile Business Group, recorded double-digit revenue growth of 11% to reach $10.5 billion in Q4, mainly driven by share gain and increase in the mix of premium and high-growth products in PC and Mobile business resuming growth. 
For fiscal year '19, IDG revenue increased almost by 10%, and PTI margin of IDG was enhanced significantly by 2.1 percentage points year-on-year to 4.1%, thanks to the improved profitability in both PCSD and MBG.
In Q4, we continued to show double-digit revenue growth of our PCSD business, and this is the fifth consecutive quarter that PC grew at a premium to the market thanks to the share gain in the commercial premium and high-growth segments. Our focus strategy has made us the top player in the $800-plus price segment in commercial notebook PCs for the third consecutive quarter. We also saw double-digit improvement in our workstations, thin and light and visual business. 
PCSD revenue in Q4 was $8.9 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Pretax income was at $458 million, and PTI margin expanded 0.4 percentage point to 5.2%.
This fiscal year turned out to be a record-setting year for our PCSD business. We achieved record revenue and PTI for the business group by leveraging our growth strategy to focus on high-growth and premium segments. We're the fastest-growing PC OEM among the global top 5 players, and our share gain span across all regional markets. In addition, our consumer-centric strategy has helped us to drive our share gain in the commercial segment. 
PCSD revenue in the year was $38.5 billion, up 14% year-on-year versus a 4-year CAGR of 4%. PTI increased 34% year-to-year to a record-breaking $2 billion, while PTI margin expanded to 5.2% boosted by favorable product mix and higher services attach rates.
In Q4, our Mobile business resumed in growth in revenue and shipment. Sales were up 15% year-on-year to $1.5 billion. Share gain in our core markets including North America and Latin America as well as strong revenue growth in China contributed to the growth in the Mobile business. 
In the meantime, we're expanding our carrier and open-channel sales and had several successful product launches during the quarter. Indeed, activation rate for our 7th Gen Moto G is higher than the 6th Gen in its first month of launch. Motorola One franchise has fared better than expected, and MBG contributed to record profit despite Q4 being a typical low season. Our PTI margin improved 10.9 percentage points year-on-year.
For the full year, MBG turned profitable in the second half of the year, thanks to the solid strategy execution to focus on selected markets, product portfolio enhancement and expense reduction. We managed to achieve an expense saving of $433 million for the whole year and bring down our annual operating expenses to around $1 billion without compromising investment in marketing, research and development, which are vital to our future competitiveness. Loss in MBG was narrowed by $464 million year-on-year to $139 million for the fiscal year. The efficient expense structure, coupled with reviving revenue growth has established an important milestone for MBG and it resumes profit for the long-term growth.
In Q4, margin of our Data Center Group continued to expand year-on-year. PTI profitability improved by 1 percentage point year-on-year. The industry has been hit by a short-term demand dip as the cautious customer await launch of the next Intel x86 platform. Inevitably, DCG revenue growth slowed to a single-digit rate in the quarter to $1.3 billion. Nevertheless, our Hyperscale business still achieved a very strong double-digit growth year-on-year, while our software-defined business outpaced the market with high double-digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.
For fiscal year '19, Data Center Group concluded the fiscal year with a record revenue of $6 billion. Revenue grew by 37% year-on-year, the highest rate in the last 3 years. We have strengthened our business model, product leadership, sales and marketing to drive share gain and product expansion. Our Hyperscale recorded triple-digit growth and Software Defined Infrastructure business almost doubled. Loss was narrowed by $194 million year-on-year thanks to the margin improvement across all DCG segments and geographies. 
Last but not the least, I want to highlight the progress we have made in our Intelligent Transformation. Our Software & Services revenue increased by nearly 20% year-on-year to $2.4 billion, representing almost 5% of our group revenue. The device and service business continue its rapid growth with booking revenue up by more than 20% during the year as our footprint stretches across the global markets. Our big data and AI-powered smart vertical solution business also tripled compared to last year.
Looking ahead, despite some geopolitical uncertainties ahead of us, we will leverage our extensive experience in managing a multitude of macro risks in order to drive growth and thrive as a business. Our goal is to lead in Intelligent Transformation era and drive service and software to become a key profit contributor in the long term. We aim to deliver premium to market growth on our top line and we target to set new profit record. 
On PCSD, we are confident to achieving this with leading profitability and premium to market revenue growth. We'll continue to improve user experience, expand innovative product lineup and grow our service and software business. 
For Mobile business, we will establish a profitable business model and we'll expand this framework to our existing focus market and other high-growth potential markets where we have synergies to leverage from other Lenovo franchise. We will hold onto our strategy in enhancing our product portfolio and investment in innovation. 
For our Data Center business, despite near-term demand softness as customer await for the next Intel platform, we will continue to invest for the future. We'll improve our profitability and grow our premium to the market, and we expect demand to recover strongly in the second half of the year. We'll further strengthen our core capacity -- our core capability, including in-house manufacturing, in order to expand in the high-growth segments, including Software Defined Infrastructure and Hyperscale, and further enhance our product portfolio and optimize our end-to-end solutions tailor-made for the local markets. We will accelerate our market share gain in high-growth segments such as in Hyperscale, Software Defined Infrastructure, high-performance computing and AI and IoT solution. 
We will accelerate our Intelligent Transformation by bringing smarter technology to all in the connected world. In Smart IoT, to accelerate transformation, we will focus on building intelligence in our PC and smart devices. We will further improve our profitability through higher average user selling price. In smart infrastructure, we will continue to strengthen our capabilities and solutions and grow our services attach rates. In the smart vertical business, we'll continue to optimize our business capabilities to accelerate our growth across software, services and solutions.

Maybe I'll start off with the most topical question, I think. A lot of geopolitical challenges in the last couple of weeks. Could we share what Lenovo is thinking, preparing for, especially in terms of like additional tariffs, et cetera? I think you've been preparing for some supply chain realignment already over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you talk about the preparedness of Lenovo if we see further tariffs? And how do you compare yourself with some of your competitors as well? Because it's going to be -- it looks like an industry-wide issue because of pretty much everybody ships a lot of their products from China. That's my first question.",120

So I know that they say the question must be asked. So we are pure global company. So we have very balanced business across the geographies and a very sophisticated supply chain across the geography as well. 
And the difference from other players, actually, we do a lot of in-house manufacture -- our in-house manufacturing facilities across the world as well. We have a factory not just in China, but in India, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Hungary. So -- Hungary is not in-house. It's third-party. So compared with our competition, so we have more flexibility to adjust the supply chain so that we can better meet the competition. 
So definitely today, PC and the smartphones haven't been tariffed yet. So manufacturing in China still give us a certain advantage if the situation won't be changed. So definitely, I think that we are in a better position than our competition to make the supply chain adjustment.
So another point is so we actually have less exposure in U.S. than our competitors -- key competitors, so particularly in the PC areas. So my conclusion is we're in a better position than our competition. And we'll try our best to mitigate the impact to our performance.",209

I think my question is -- because I feel right now that probably the profit is beyond only tax because of probably, the reason -- because in the past few days, you probably heard press release of Huawei. I mean they start to ban there, I mean, talking about component and even operating system. 
And then next, I think, the day before I spoke about Hikvision. And I think right now there is a lot of the other company coming out. Basically pretty much all the leading company in China has been named as offenders. I mean, of course, I think Lenovo is one of the leading company. I mean, right now, it's globally. But of course, they have lot of facility and a lot of technology from -- especially the impressive China spread. And the people is experiencing -- and some of the area, I feel, is probably more sensitive, especially on server -- especially you guys involved in so many supercomputing project. And you also have a lot of exposure to U.S. hyperscale data centers. 
And also another one is in mobile side. Because in mobile, actually, you guys do very good in -- a lot of market share picking up in North America. So I don't know if the supply chains disruption become the issue. How do you guys would [ react ] here with this kind of situation?",242

So Lenovo has always been a global company originated from China. We have always been a trusted player across the world. So we have never had the problem on security, on the compliance. So actually, we always comply with the law and regulations everywhere we do business. So -- and also Lenovo, we are a very transparent company with a very high level of standard -- high-standard governance. So if you consider our Board and our executives, we are probably the most diversified company in those multinational companies. So I don't think that we have a reason to be targeted.",106

So we actually see ourselves now as globally diversifying in supercomputing as well. And on Hyperscale, we've been public that we're in 6 of the top 10. But I can tell you, our design win rate is growing. So we're getting more customers. We're expanding into the next set of customers beyond the top 10, which represents about 40% of the worldwide hyperscale market.

First, on the gross margins. I think this is probably a 3-year high in terms of gross margins at 16-plus percent. Could we have a little bit more detail in terms of why we saw such a big jump in gross margins typically during a weaker than -- a weaker quarter in terms of seasonality for the China business as well? And could we have some view on how we should think about gross margins over the next fiscal also?
Second question I had is to Gianfranco. If you could talk a little bit about how we should think about PC business, where we are in the enterprise refresh cycle, what do we think about China PC market as well as you highlighted coming back to #1 in consumer. What do you feel about the overall consumer PC market as well?",145

So -- well, [indiscernible] those. I think if I look at the group on a floor, I think we actually saw improvement in margin in the 2 business unit or the 3 parts of growth: in PCSD, MBG and DCG. Clearly, I think from a percentage perspective, I think PCSD actually is the largest. So I think in terms of answer why we actually will be to actually achieve that results, and I think that will answer the question. But again, I think, from a result perspective, the improvement is across the board. It's not just 1 business group or 1 geography. So I -- maybe I'll pass it on to...",112

Actually storage now, we successfully executed the joint venture with NetApp in China. So remember, in the past, we were the fastest-growing storage company in the world but only covering the entry space, 15%. Now we can cover 92% of the storage space. So for year-on-year, we actually grew 5x the market. And in Flash Arrays, which is obviously, one of the fastest-growing parts of the market, as flash pricing goes down, we're growing twice the market, more than triple digits. So the storage is definitely now more than 80% of our generalist sellers are selling storage, not just server. So we're transforming from a server company to a server storage company. And obviously, we can compete with the large companies when we do that. 
The second milestone we hit this quarter is actually our deferred revenue on services. It's the highest it's been since the System x acquisition. So we've been aggressively attaching more professional services and more services to our servers and storage. And as a result now, we have confidence in the future profitability because our deferred revenue is now higher than it's ever been on our balance sheet.",202

No, when we -- if we deliver margin, I think it's coming from, I would say, 3 major things. One is the mix. We have been very careful during the last couple of years to move our mix from low end to mid-end, high end, and this is the reason why today we are #1 on more than $800 price point, right? We are even bigger than Apple. So -- and this, of course, is running with different margin than entry. We've also been very careful on also considering the shortage and some other things, but today commercial is probably 65% of our revenue against the consumer. It doesn't mean that we don't look at consumer. We are back to #1. But commercial is still our strong -- and there we continue to grow share. The gap with #2 is getting bigger. 
And also answering to the first -- the previous question, when I look at Fortune 500 customers, probably 70% to 80% of Fortune 500 customer in the world, they are running with our PC. And even the big government administration in U.S., they're running with our PC, talking about a trusted company. 
The other reason is the service. We have seen the service on PC growing by more than 20% year-on-year. So we are over $1.5 billion, which is not a small number in PC. 
And the last thing is component costs. Component costs for sure is also helping because they have been going down during the last 6 months. My projection is that they will continue to go down at least until the end of the year. There is no sign that components, they should come back to increase the costs. So I would say mix, service, commercial/consumer and some help from component costs. 
When we go to PC, how do we see PC? I think when you look at PC, PC, in terms of units probably will continue to go down just slightly, maybe 1%, 2%. And this is in line with IDC. The IDC released a forecast -- a new forecast today. It's a little bit better in terms of revenue. So revenue is almost flat or slightly down. But when I look at revenue, and this is much better indicator than quantity, the market is probably going to be flat. 
It's coming from still Windows 10 refresh because it's not finished. It will be probably complete by the end of the year. But it's still big in most of -- I would say, except probably U.S. and a little bit EMEA, it's still big in all the other geo, including Asia Pacific, including Japan and including all the emerging market, even EMEA in some cases. So I think Windows 10, the refresh, will continue to drive commercial at least until the end of the year. There is even some possibility that some big customer, they will not move and they will wait next year. And when I talk about big customer, I'm mainly talking about government customer, that they are not ready to move. And I'm not talking about emerging market now. I'm talking about mature market. So PC is, as I said, a refresh. 
Then what we see, of course, is consumer. They will continue to go down. It's still negative. And commercial is -- probably continue to grow. 
If we look at geo by geo, I think the only geo that today is showing some weakness in terms of demand is China. But it's not only on PC. It's showing weakness on PC and phone also. There are some weaknesses in China. The other geo are more or less at the same level. So it's not exciting here, but also it's not -- it's more or less flat in U.S. and more or less flat in EMEA, more or less flat in Asia Pacific. 
And we continue to gain share for, in my opinion, for a couple of reason. Because in terms of product, we are in the position to offer better product to our customer in terms of innovation and in terms of...",683

I have 2 questions. The first question is regarding the Data Center because I've been surprised with the market, that some unlisted company say some facial recognition company are under the spotlight today in front news. And I guess those facial recognition company also installed a lot of servers as they communicated that they sell those servers to their customers as well. Nearly 50% of those facial recognition company, their revenue comes from the hardware sales, including server and storage. So I'm not sure whether -- is this part -- it's also a potential growth for your -- for Lenovo's Data Center business? If that is one of the part of the growth driver, will it affect the coming data center prospects as well? So this question meaning for the camera -- the surveillance camera, they're connecting to server and storage. 
The second question is regarding the -- because we are seeing more company are doing vertical integration, designing some in-house -- not only production but also semiconductor line going upstream to those chips. Say that each company also spend enough time and R&D expenses in those semiconductor development so that they have a [ fabulous ] design methodology to pace order to secure their design in IP. So I'm not sure whether Lenovo has also such kind of plan. 
And also regarding the software side, which is the -- controlled by -- dominated by the M company, right? So not sure in the PC or in the smartphone side whether will you consider to develop in-house operating system to -- for long-term development. That's my second question regarding the strategic reason, not necessary for the tariff or not necessarily -- or you already planned this kind of project before. Yes. Those are my 2 questions.",306

Relative to video and video analytics, I think I saw some data, almost 75% of data created today is video. So as we expand to the edge, we see the compute going to where the data is. The data will not go to where the compute is. So if you go outside this hall, you'll see our new SE350 edge server. We had over 650,000 YouTube views just in 4 days at MWC when we showcased that technology. 
We've already been public, for example, that we are helping with city -- safe city for smart city. For example, we did City of Bogotá, Columbia. We worked on the hyperconverged infrastructure so they can detect license plate and the color of -- and the type of car. So someone tries to change the license plate to a different colored car, they can immediately detect it's a problem for the city safety. So this was one example where we used Pivot3, which is a hyperconverged infrastructure company. But there are hundreds if not thousands of camera companies out there. That will not be a deterrent to the growth. 
The second case study we did was in smart retail at the edge. Ahold Delhaize has 33,000 grocery stores in Europe. It's the largest retailer in Europe. And we run scale computing, which is their hyperconverged infrastructure at the edge. And there they do point of sale terminals, they do customer loyalty systems, they do video analytics for store safety and theft, this kind of thing. So we have many case studies. It's a very fast-growing part of our market. But I don't see -- I haven't heard of any issues with this deterring our growth with any of the things you mentioned.",290

So my question is concerning the 5G development of the Lenovo. So as I know, the Mobile business softened or it's just turned around a profit. And my question is about 5G development of Lenovo. So as I know, you already launched 2 kinds of mobile phone. So my question is how is the market share of the 5G phones in the future? And second question is about how is the strategy of the supporting device of the 5G-related device of the Lenovo?",94

As we announced, we -- the first commercial 5G call globally was made from a Lenovo phone in the U.S. We are keeping that in 5G. We will be launching new models to the end of the year, and we'll see that as people start replacing their phones. What we are not going to do is accelerate, I think, as the carriers deploy their networks. And we'll be very cautious, right? It's still early stage, but we have a small time to market in terms of what we did in terms of learning antennas, streamer. And we're going to continue to deliver on that. So we see 5G probably becoming stronger at the beginning of next calendar year, but you'll see some announcements coming to the second half of the year.",132

When we -- if we're talking about devices, I think, for sure the trend is going there. A lot of devices in the world will have will have 5G connectivities and it's simply because they need to be always connected. And it's easy to I think that probably in 3 to 5 years from now even Wi-Fi will be replaced by 5G because it is faster and easy to use, right? And people, they don't need to switch from one to the other. We just announced a show foldable 2 weeks ago, the foldable PC, right? This is a typical example. It's going to be 5G-connected because it doesn't make any sense to have foldable, ultra-portable small device without connectivity. We are working with -- we have another -- part of our product line, still small today, is based on Windows on ARM.

So it actually has 6 antennas on it. So as you start putting these in your factory, you connect not just with wired but with Wi-Fi, with 4G and with 5G.

Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, despite the global geopolitical uncertainties, we kicked off a new year with a strong performance. We continue to drive both top line and the bottom line growth. Our group revenue grew year-on-year for 8 consecutive quarters and reached USD 12.5 billion. Our pretax income was USD 240 million, and the net income was USD 162 million, both more than doubled year-on-year.
This quarter's solid result started with our Intelligent Devices Group. Our PC and Smart Devices business delivered an exceptional quarter, continuing double-digit revenue growth while achieving the highest fiscal first quarter profit and further improved our industry-leading profitability. With Americas and Asia Pacific achieving 20% and 40% year-on-year growth in revenue, respectively, all 4 geographies delivered over $2 billion revenue, demonstrating the geographical balance and sustainability of our business.
In PCs, our volume outgrew our already recovering market by over 13 points to reach our all-time record share of 24.9%, a clear #1 position. This means 1 out of every 4 PCs built in the world is a Lenovo product. Also, PC revenue grew over 14% year-on-year. PC unit grew 18% year-on-year. These strong results are driven by innovation, our customer-centric product portfolio and continuing focus on operational excellence. This strategy enables us to significantly outgrow the market across the high-growth and the premium categories, including Workstation, Thin and Light, Visuals, Gaming PCs and the Chromebook.
Looking forward, we are confident that we will continue to drive premium-to-market growth and industry-leading profitability. We will achieve this by not only focusing on high-growth and the premium categories, but also continue to drive innovation in the Smart IoT area, smartifying PC like the world's first portable PC and 5G PC we announced last quarter, developing new smart devices for homes and offices and capturing the greater opportunity in commercial IoT.
Our Mobile business delivered another profitable quarter and improved pretax income year-on-year by USD 100 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. In North America, our volume outgrew the market by more than 37 points, and the pretax income margin improved over 14 points year-on-year.  In our stronghold, Latin America, our volume has grown with or above the market for 11 quarters. 
Going forward, our Mobile business will continue to maintain profitability and seek opportunities to drive profitable growth in new markets with new innovative products.
Our Data Center Group continued to improve profit year-on-year, and we gained share in worldwide server volume. Meanwhile, our revenue declined because a few larger cloud-computing customers reduced their purchase due to excessive capacity built in the past quarters, and declining commodity component price drives lower server average unit revenue. While the server business slowed, storage networking continued to show clear growth. In the first quarter, our storage revenue grew more than 80% year-on-year, and the software-defined infrastructure continued to grow at a double-digit rate year-on-year. This shows our strategy to extend the full-stack data center portfolio breadth is correct, and our previous investment has started to drive tangible results.
Meanwhile, in high-performance computing, we extended our #1 position in Top 500 Supercomputer list to 173 systems across 20 markets and continue to support the scientific research and the applications around the world. For example, over the past the year, 15 countries, including Canada, Korea, Malaysia, already use our solution in weather forecasting and climate research. 
Moving forward, we will continue executing our strategy to drive software-defined infrastructure, storage, networking, service and solution-led sales and strengthen in-house design and manufacturing capability for hyperscale. We will also further improve route-to-market and operational excellence to achieve premium-to-market growth while improving profitability.
In driving Intelligent Transformation, we established a clear dashboard to monitor the progress and are on track to achieve the goals we have set at the beginning of the year. Driven by the newly established Data Intelligence Business Group, or DIBG, Smart Vertical revenue quadrupled year-on-year last quarter. Our Software & Services revenue also grew 23% year-on-year, which is almost 5x as fast as our overall revenue growth, reaching USD 732 million. We believe that anything, once pursued, takes time. But our strong first quarter performance driven by the right strategy and the persistent execution shows that we are moving beyond the last 3 years' success and we're well on our way to reaching even greater heights. Thank you.
Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",736

I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q1 fiscal year 2020.
Next chart, please. Let me first share with you the financial highlights. Our Q1 results again demonstrated that we have built a resilient growth engine that is firing on multiple cylinders. We've delivered profitable improvements across all businesses, strong margins, stellar earnings per share growth and continued market share gain.
Group revenue was $12.5 billion, up 5% year-on-year. PCSD has another great quarter with double-digit revenue growth and set a new record in global PC market share. Our transformation actions continue to show accelerated results. During the first quarter, the Software & Services revenue grew double-digit year-on-year, making up almost 6% of group revenue at an exciting margin profile. Our big data and AI-powered Smart Vertical solution business also quadrupled compared to the same quarter in last year.
Gross profit in Q1 increased by 26% year-on-year, and gross profit margin expanded 2.7 percentage points to 16.4%, thanks to sales mix improvement. Operating expenses increased by 18% to $1.7 billion and the E/R ratio was 13.6%, up 1.4 percentage point year-on-year due to more aggressive product promotion and the new model launches as well as employee bonus in rewarding performance improvements. Group PTI was $240 million, more than double year-on-year. The PTI improvement was consistent across all business group. PCSD further expanded its industry-leading profitability, while MBG and DCG also improved their bottom line.
Net profit attributable to equity holders was $162 million, improved from $77 million in the same quarter of last year. Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0137, up from USD 0.00065 (sic) [ USD 0.0065 ] last year.
Next chart, please. In Q1, our cash used in operation improved quarter-to-quarter but decreased year-on-year to an outflow of $142 million, which was lower than $336 million in net cash generated from operation a year ago, mainly due to the temporary impact from the transition program of AR factoring. With the completion of our transition program, AR will be back to normal and improving next quarter. Our inventory days improved 6 days year-to-year, thanks to better inventory management in reducing the component inventory across all business groups.
Next chart, please. Our Intelligent Device business group, which include PC and Smart Device business group and Mobile Business Group, had another great quarter with revenue up 8% to $11.2 billion. The stellar performance of PCSD was supported by the continued commercial refresh demand and our strength in the high-growth and premium segments. PTI margin of IDG expanded significantly by 1.6 percentage points year-on-year to 4.7%. There was also a notable year-on-year profit improvement over $200 million being delivered by IDG.
Next chart, please. In Q1, our PCSD business group has executed extremely well with strong market share gain across nearly all geographical areas. Its revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year, driven by the solid commercial orders and strong momentum across the premium and high-growth segments. We continue our double-digit revenue improvement in Workstation, Thin and Light, Gaming and Visual business. Furthermore, PCSD set a new record on its global market share. And again, its revenue grew at premium to market. The premium growth to the market reached 13 percentage point in the quarter, representing its highest level in more than 5 years. The business group pretax income was $524 million and PTI margin expanded 0.5 percentage points to 5.4% on mix improvement and higher services attach rate.
Next chart, please. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Mobile Business Group has delivered more than $100 million year-on-year improvement in its PTI. We are pleased to report robust market share gain in core markets. In North America, MBG premium-to-market growth reached 37 percentage points in the fiscal quarter, benefiting from the successful expansion of its distribution network and success in new products. Latin America remained the business stronghold with continued profit expansion. MBG revenue was $1.5 billion, down 9% year-on-year due to our prioritization of core markets. Despite the weaker top line, the focus on profitable market, cost efficiency and improved portfolio contributed to a significant year-on-year PTI margin expansion by 6.3 percentage points.
Next chart, please. The broader data center sector was widely reported to be suffering from excessive inventory on hyperscale and the commodity price decline. Our Data Center business in Q1 wasn't able to be immune from the sector slowdown, and its revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-on-year. However, our strategic direction and continued investment to grow the business with higher margin and position as a full stack industry leader remain intact. Sales from storage, services deferred revenue and SDI all increased high double digit year-on-year in this fiscal quarter. 
As a result, DCG has further narrowed down its pretax loss by $11 million year-on-year, and it was its eighth consecutive quarter of PTI improvement despite the industry-wide challenge on revenue growth.
Next chart, please. Looking ahead, macro risk remains a key challenge for global technology sector. Volatility has intensified to one of its highest level in recent history due to continued trade negotiation and geopolitical power tensions. We will leverage our extensive experience in managing a multitude of macro risk to drive growth and thrive as a business. Our goal is to lead in Intelligent Transformation era and drive services and software to become a key profit contributor in the long term.
On the group level, we aim to deliver premium to the market growth on top line, and we remain confident to deliver profitable growth for the long term. On PCSD, we target to secure our industry-leading profitability and premium-to-market revenue growth. We will continue to improve user experience, expand innovative product lineup and grow our service and software business.
For Mobile business, we will soon to launch more new models with new innovations and will continue to strengthen its competitiveness in its target market. We will hold on to our strategy in sustaining financial health as a priority for the business while looking for a potential growth opportunity.
For the Data Center business, despite a market pullback, we believe the secular trend of data growth will accelerate the data center demand and that the launch of new technology and services, including 5G and edge computing. DCG will continue to build its capabilities and position as a full stack industry leader while continuing to drive its growth in SDIs, storage and networking, services and solution-led sales. In hyperscale, the group will further strengthen its in-house design and manufacturing capabilities and build a profitable business model.
We aim to further improve our profitability and grow our premium to the market as we expect demand to recover in the second half of the fiscal year. The group continued to invest across the Smart Infrastructure, Smart IoT and Smart Verticals to accelerate our transformation and to sharpen the group's core competence. These investments should strengthen Lenovo capability as a competitive end-to-end solution provider in the era of Intelligent Transformation. Thank you.

I have 2 questions. First of all, on the new 10% tariffs that have been proposed by President Trump. Could we remind investors and ask about the preparedness of the 3 major business groups, PC, DCG and Mobile business group, in terms of how prepared Lenovo is in terms of moving supply chains to other locations other than China, specifically for the U.S. market? And when do we expect most of that supply chain relocation to be completed? That's part one.
Second question I had is on Data Center business group. I think because of the industry weakness, we have seen growth slip to negative territory for the last couple of quarters. When do we expect growth to come back to positive territory for DCG? And specifically for hyperscale, what does the outlook look like? Do we expect to break into any more of the big 4 hyperscale customers in addition to the one customer that we have in the next -- into CPU design cycle?",171

So I'll answer the first question, and our President of DCG will answer the second question. Our view, I would say, our last quarter performance today, there has been negligible material impact on our business and our results. Our last quarter result has showed we continue to fighting these headwinds. And also, we have built up efficiencies to offset the U.S. -- the tariff increase. So that means [ we're paying tariff year-to-year ], so we have less impact in our business. Meanwhile, I wish you know, Lenovo has a globally diverse manufacturing footprint. We reside in multiple locations around the world, which give us a lot of flexibility compared with our key competitors in current atmosphere.
Meanwhile, we remain committed to China as part of that strategy. So in fact, we recently decided to invest more than USD 300 million in new smart manufacturing facility in Shenzhen part of Guangdong, China. So that we are not -- that will not be changed. So that's the answer to your first question.
So the second question, please. Kirk, please.",181

So first, we should look at the business in terms of the hyperscale customers and the nonhyperscale customers. In nonhyperscale, I want to note that we did grow in units year-on-year this quarter as Lenovo. And we expect in the existing quarter, we'll grow even faster in units year-on-year. So we expect from a unit perspective, we are growing our position by probably 1 or 2 relative to our competition year-on-year given that unit growth. 
In nonhyperscale, what we mentioned is a few of our hyperscale customers grew extensively in the last part of last year. We expect those customers to be coming back in the fourth quarter calendar of this year. But more exciting for us is the diversification we have as we're growing into the next wave of customers. So we expect 3 new hyperscale customers to be in Lenovo's top 10 customer list very shortly, in addition to seeing the recovery in the fourth quarter calendar of this quarter.",165

But when we look at commercial and we split between large business and SMB, we are by far #1 on very large business or enterprise. We are not yet #1 in SMB.

This is Kirk. With respect to hyperscale, previously, we've stated that we have design wins and business in 6 of the top 10 hyperscalers. Roughly speaking, that represents about 60% of the total available market of the public cloud providers, which I think we're excited that, again, as I said earlier, 3 of those 6 customers will enter our top 10 customer list as we grow new design wins in the marketplace. And a couple of our existing customers that built extensively, we expect to recover by the end of this calendar year and start growing again significantly. We're seeing those early signs.
In addition, we've added this year a new extended sales force to cover the next wave of hyperscalers. And we won several new designs within that next wave, again, which represents about 40% of the total market. That was an area that we previously were not focused on because we were working on earning the business of the top 10. So we expect significant growth in the next wave over the next several quarters.

So the first question I had was the follow-on on Data Center business. You mentioned that you're expecting demand to recover in the fourth quarter of the calendar year this year from hyperscale customers. And regarding your new business and this demand recovery, is this mostly driven by existing Data Center business or new data center builds from your perspective? 
And a follow-up on that is you are expecting design wins and projects going forward with medium hyperscale entering your top 10 customer list. Do you think that's more of a function of share gain or just overall demand increasing in the coming quarters?",108
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2019",2019-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2828.0,1810729.0,70893725.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,19,"So for the hyperscale, again, I think we are building capacity internally to build our own motherboards as well as do system and rack-level integration, and we're doing that globally in factories around the world. That new business model is helping us deliver better economics to both us and our customers, which is resulting in those design wins. So we're clearly, with our strategy of ODM plus, earning business that previously had gone to the ODMs that's moving now to Lenovo.
And in the nonhyperscale space, we continue to see hybrid cloud proliferating, and we're supporting all the major hybrid cloud providers. We made an announcement with Google this quarter for the first time on Google Anthos. We've got support for Nutanix, for Azure HCI and for VMware. So all of those, we continue to see growth on as customers choose to do private cloud or hybrid cloud installation on-prem. As a result, we had again ninth consecutive quarter of software-defined double-digit growth rates, and we think that will continue in the future. We view ourselves as legacy free. So we can move very closely with our partners to software-defined infrastructure for that hybrid cloud. Thank you.",197

Right. So as I said, I don't know when you lost me. But let me talk about we are #1 globally. We have almost 25% market share. But when we look at it from a geographical point of view, we are #1 in some geo, but not yet in other geo. So we still see good opportunity in terms of geographical growth in some geo.
And also one other good example, consumer and commercial, we are #1 in consumer. We are #1 in commercial. But when you look at the commercial and you split it between large enterprise or very large enterprise and SMB, we are by far #1 in large enterprise or very large enterprise. We are not #1 in SMB yet. And we also continue to see a very good momentum when we look at the upgrade to Windows 10, the Windows 10 transition. I think that we will continue to see Windows 10 transition until the end of the year and probably next year, next calendar year.
And last but not least, when you look at our growth in terms of premium segment, Workstation, Gaming, Thin and Light, Visual, we have seen more opportunities last quarter, the growth is around between 30% to 40%. And we still see very good opportunity in terms of growth there. So growth, for sure, we will continue to see in the next coming quarters despite the very high market share already achieved.",244

Look, maybe it's not about the business itself but more from the industry trend. The first question I'd like to get your insight in -- so how do you see the software-defined infrastructure? The more adoption for container, does multicloud serverless computing will impact Lenovo Data Center business, particularly in your compute and storage? And what's Lenovo product position on this trend? This is my first question.",77

So this is Kirk. On software-defined infrastructure, again, we had 9 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We think we're growing significant market share. If you look at an analysis by IDC, they initially showed Lenovo was the fastest-growing OEM in hybrid cloud, if you look at both public and on-prem cloud. Again, we think we have a very diverse set of partnerships with Nutanix, with Google, with VMware and with Microsoft that are enabling us to be customer-centric and deliver the best solution based on the customer needs. So I think we will continue. Our goal is to continue to grow at double the market, at 100% premium to market in software defined. But I think it will continue to be a strong growth area for us.
Obviously, if you look at software-defined storage and things like that, we publicly said now we're growing at 80%. So depending on which genre you look at, that could be a very, very significant premium to market. With the relationship we have now with NetApp, we're covering over 92% of the storage market, where a year ago, we were only covering 15%. So I think you're going to see us now not only as the third-largest storage company in China but one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest-growing, storage company in the world taking share in that area as well. You had a second question?",234

They are dealing with the IT infrastructures and also trying to optimize the computing and storage capacity utilization rate. So that seems to me a potential negative because the utilization rate of the hardware infrastructure will likely to be -- was not optimized but going to get more optimized. But I know that Lenovo has good products here to grow this business. But how do you see the balance here? Is it net positive to the industry and to Lenovo still?,105
410120.0,"Lenovo Group Limited, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2019",2019-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Lenovo Group Limited,2828.0,1810729.0,70893733.0,Answer,Kirk Skaugen,,Executives,27,"Yes. I think -- I was at a previous company, Intel, for 24 years. I remember people telling me that when virtualization first became popular that you're going to have 5 or 10 or 20 virtual machines, and therefore, hardware growth would be low. I think if you look at the last decade, as you move to virtualization, it was only an accelerator even with higher utilization of servers. And I think, certainly, private cloud is enabling better utilization. But I think it's also slowing a bit of the adoption going to public cloud because you now have some better economics with the security of keeping your data in the country or on-prem.
So I think it's going to be good for the industry. I think containers will be good for the industry, just like virtualization drove an upgrade cycle. I was just with a customer tonight, 11-year-old infrastructure. It's an aging infrastructure out there. They're going to move to modern technology, and Lenovo's the best person to support that modern technology.",172

I know that AMD already announced Lenovo had launched several solution for AMD. I just want to consult, Kirk, what do you think about for EPYC 2 in data center? And from your side, are you seeing any of the progress for AMD? What do you think about AMD at this moment? So that's my first question.",67

So I think we were strong supporters at the AMD launch. It's our Chief Operating Officer on stage. We're seeing AMD demand. We've built 2 new premium 1-socket servers. We launched 18 new world records. So on Intel architecture, we have roughly doubled the number of world record workloads as any other company in the world. We intend to keep that leadership position on AMD. Specifically, we think it's workload-driven.
So we're seeing demand, for example, on, public safety for city surveillance and then things that need excellent I/O. One difference of Lenovo's products is we did deliver purpose-built servers for this new architecture. So we're not just doing a drop-in to the old I/O architecture. So we fully support all the new frequencies, all the new wattages and PCIe Gen 4 where some of our competitors have to support older technology, which is the drop-in. So we think we have the world's best AMD solutions. And yes, we're seeing demand.",162

So do you think that, I'm not sure, for the next 2 or 3 years, both the 2 changes for AMD in the server, this is very important especially profit growth? So do you think that Intel-dominated server association will be broken or something? That is my -- interesting in the future. So what do you think about this one?",61

And based on workload, it will be a more competitive market than it was in the past. So having said that, we also had Yuanqing and the CEO of Intel and also the new global HPC Alliance, Brian, to be able to lead with exascale cloud computing not just for a few large supercomputers but also, we call it, exascale is everywhere, so that even smaller customers can benefit from our high-growth technology. So I think we have strong collaborations with not just Intel, not just AMD. But we're also supporting Ampere on ARM, and we're also a great supporter of GPUs with NVIDIA. And we're seeing demand now in our heterogeneous computing environment across all of those architectures.",128

My last question is for Gianfranco Lanci. I think U.S. created some kind of delay on tariffs until December. But I think this is just temporary. So as I'm wondering on the next year, probably the smartphone and PC demand will be sluggish because everything that are imported to America will be up to 10%, 20%. So what do you think [ are initiatives ] for Lenovo, especially Lenovo, mostly, the market in China. And I think the U.S. market is also very important for you. But I think this type of delay  issues is for, let's say, keeping the demand for customers. But after that, I believe they will increase the import tax. So I'm not sure Lenovo right now have any sort of estimated results for next year. So that's my last question.",136

So as I said, so the trade war, so it's not good for [ the entire society ]. It's not good for the entire management of the company. So we wish China and the U.S. can resolve this and reach an agreement as soon as quarter 4. But even with the worst scenario, I think the Lenovo businesses are in a better positioned than our competition because we actually have a globally diverse manufacturing footprint with multiple manufacturing facilities around the world, so -- which should give us a lot of flexibility compared with our key competitors. Actually, most of our key competitors do their in-house manufacturing by themselves. But we think that, that will give us much more flexibility.
We definitely remain committed to China. So we will further invest, buying small manufacturing facility in China. So in raising the tariff, where it impacts [average] payers equally. So actually, we are even manufacturing in other locations. So the possible impact is that it'll increase the total cost. So that means we are impacted the consumption. So that's why we think it will be better for us if we have that agreement.",195

I think memory price, we have been improving this exercise many times, also in the past. Memory price is always relatively unstable. We see memory going up and going down depending on demand. And I think we have been able to show that we can manage the memory pricing both ways. When you look at our results in the last 6 or 8 quarters, on PC, we've always been able to show in that profitability in the range of 5% or even better than 5% when memory was going up or when memory was going down.
And so I think we will continue to manage our profitability independently, I would say, from the memory trend. And for the time being, frankly speaking, we see quite a stability in terms of memory. Memory are relatively stable in terms of price, not really going up but also not going down anymore. But as I said, 1 year ago or 18 months ago, it was exactly the opposite, the trend. And when you look at our financial results, you don't see -- or you cannot see any major impact there from the memory. It's really a matter of execution and operational excellence and how you drive your AUR based on component cost trend.",212

Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, we delivered another quarter of solid performance despite the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. We significantly improved the profit with a pretax income up 45% year-on-year to USD 310 million and a net income up 20% year-on-year to USD 202 million while maintaining a stable revenue of USD 13.5 billion.
  
Our Intelligent Device Group achieved 5% profit margin for the first time, thanks to solid profit contribution from both PC and smart devices and mobile business. PC and Smart Devices, in particular, delivered a strong profit margin of 5.7% with more than 4% revenue growth in spite of the supply shortages under the macroeconomic situation. Software & Services revenue grew 31% year-on-year.
In PCs, we maintained our clear #1 position by delivering record high shipments with over 7% growth year-on-year. We outperformed our growing market by 4 points.
Volume in high-growth and premium categories such as Workstation, Thin and Light, Visuals and Gaming PCs continues to outgrow the market by double digits.
Looking forward. While the macro challenges may continue, we are confident that we will continue to drive premium-to-market growth and industry-leading profitability. We will achieve this through innovation, operational excellence and strong execution in high-growth and the premium categories. We will also continue to transform our business model and grow in Software & Services.
Our Mobile Business delivered its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. Pretax income grew USD 57 million year-on-year, reaching the highest since the Motorola acquisition. In our stronghold, Latin America, activation grow almost 7% year-on-year. Revenue, profit and market share all grow year-on-year.
In North America, activation was up nearly 5% year-on-year. Revenue, again, outgrew the market and profit margin improved almost 7 points year-on-year.
Going forward, our Mobile Business will continue to strengthen profitability and seek opportunities to drive growth in new markets. We will continue to invest in innovation and technology leadership.
Our Data Center Group profit continued to improve for the ninth quarter while overall revenue declined due to lower prices for key components, and the softness in demand from a couple of large Hyperscale customers. Meanwhile, the revenue for all other parts of the business was up 13%, and particularly, revenue excluding Hyperscale in China was up nearly 47% year-on-year. This double-digit growth is driven by high double-digit growth in High Performance Computing, software defined infrastructure and even stronger momentum in storage.
Looking forward, we will drive revenue growth while improving profitability. We will continue our growth in non-Hyperscale, particularly in fast-growing segments like Software Defined Infrastructure and Storage while expanding our Hyperscale customer base to return Hyperscale to growth in the second half of this fiscal year. At the same time, we will continue to invest in Edge, telco and AI infrastructure to capture new opportunities.
Our Intelligent Transformation showed strong momentum. Smart IoT revenue grew 4x year-on-year, driven by strong growth in consumer Smart IoT and AR/VR. Smart Vertical revenue tripled, thanks to 76% growth in Data Intelligence Business Group revenue and breakthrough in smart education.
Commercial IoT business unit was established to develop new commercial IoTs, Edge and solutions to drive transformation. 
Our Software & Services revenue grew 35% year-on-year, reaching almost USD 900 million, particularly Device as a Service more than tripled. Premier support service and managed service both grew high double-digit year-on-year.
We expect this business to generate $1 billion per quarter soon. Over 30 out of 105 Lenovo Capital and Incubator Group portfolio companies are now collaborating with Lenovo to support various areas of our 3S strategy.
Also, in our flagship event, Lenovo Tech, over the next week, we look forward to sharing our latest innovation and progresses in Intelligent Transformation. As I mentioned before, Lenovo is like a mountaineer. We are committed to driving transformation to reach new heights and bring smarter technology for all.
Thank you. Now let me turn it over to our CFO, Wai Ming. Wai Ming, please.",654

I will take you through Lenovo financial and operational performance in Q2 fiscal year 2020.
Next chart, please. Let me first share with you the financial highlights. The group reported yet another strong quarter of year-on-year profit expansion across all businesses. Our Q2 results demonstrated our ability to deliver strong margins and robust growth in earnings per share despite the component supply constraint and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. The inevitable impact from the supply constraint and economy volatility has impacted different parts of our business and our operation, and our group revenue was up 1% year-on-year to $13.5 billion in the quarter.
Our efforts in driving continued sales mix improvement such as expanding our market share in high-growth and premium PC segments have paid off. In addition, our transformation actions continue to accelerate. One key element in the Intelligent Transformation actions is that our Software & Service revenue grew at a strong double-digit rate year-on-year and now makes up over 6% of group revenue at a higher margin.
Gross profit in Q2 increased by 22% year-on-year and gross profit margin expanded 2.7 percentage points to 16.1%, thanks to the sales mix improvement.
Operating expenses rose 16% to $1.7 billion and the E/R ratio was 12.9%, up 1.7 percentage points year-on-year due to spending on sales, marketing and promotion as well as employee bonuses tied to rewarding performance improvements. 
Our Q2 PTI increased 45% year-on-year and was the highest PTI in fiscal Q2 since acquisition of x86 and Motorola businesses. The PTI improvement was consistent across all business groups and the most notable improvement came from PCSD and MBG reporting their highest PTI margin in history.
Net profit attributable to equity holders was $202 million, up from $168 million in the same quarter of last year. 
Basic earnings per share came in at USD 0.0169, up from USD 0.0141 last year. 
The Board of Directors in today's meeting declared an interim dividend of HKD 0.063, representing a 5% increase to the interim dividend paid last fiscal year.
Next chart, please. In Q2, our cash used in operation improved both quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year to an inflow of $1.4 billion. The net debt position improved by $722 million year-on-year mainly due to better profit improvement and working capital management. Our inventory days improved 4 days year-on-year, thanks to disciplined inventory management.
Next chart, please. Our Intelligent Device Business group, which includes PC and Smart Device business group and Mobile Business Group had another strong quarter with PTI margin up significantly by 1.2 percentage points year-on-year to 5.1%, a new record for IDG. PTI was $620 million, up 33% year-on-year, and also a new record for IDG.
Next chart, please. In Q2, the component supply constraint capped the revenue growth of PCSD business group to a 4% year-on-year growth to $10.7 billion. Despite the external challenges, we are able to continue our growth and deliver record quarterly shipments. We continue to hold strong market share in PC. In addition, our PC business is becoming more balanced, maintaining our stronghold in the commercial segment while also gaining share in the consumer segment where we set a new market share record.
Our strength in the high-growth and the premium segments also led to a favorable shift in sales mix. The revenue from premium products across Workstations, Thin and Light, Visual and Gaming PC grew by double digits year-on-year and contributed more than 50% of total PCSD revenue. Together, the increasing contribution from high-margin Software and Services business, the PCSD business group set a record PTI margin of 5.7% in Q2.
Next chart, please. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Mobile Business Group achieved positive PTI and expansion in its PTI margin and both set a new height since our acquisition of the Motorola business. MBG revenue was $1.5 billion, down 5% year-on-year due to our continued prioritization of core markets. This strategy focused on profitable or core markets, together with an improved portfolio, contributed to a year-on-year improvement of $57 million on MBG pretax profit. 
The business group delivered a 3.6 percentage margin expansion versus the same quarter last year, thanks to improved profitability in our LA and NA markets. We are refining this focused market strategy to select markets in Europe in an effort to accelerate the growth trajectory through new carriers' relationship and improved product pipeline and leveraging the strength of our PCSD business.
Next chart, please. Our Data Center business in Q2 continued to be impacted by sluggish Hyperscale orders and component price corrections. DCG revenue was $1.3 billion, down 14% year-on-year in Q2. 
[ Bright boss ] included our Storage revenue and Software Defined Infrastructure, both up by strong double digits year-on-year, and our expanded Storage portfolio and strong ThinkAgile offerings are gaining recognition in the market. HPC revenue also grew by double digits, thanks to new projects wins. In China, our business also grew at a double-digit rate, thanks to our expansion in sales coverage and product portfolio offerings. DCG further narrowed its PTI loss by $9 million year-on-year, it's ninth consecutive quarter of year-to-year PTI improvements.
Next chart, please. Looking forward, the complexity of macro environment and supply constraints remain our primary challenges. We are working to resolve the supply challenges and aim to minimize the revenue impact in the quarter.

First question I had was on DCG and servers. I think YY mentioned we are looking to get back to growth in the second half of this fiscal. Could we talk about when do we get back to -- which quarter do we expect to get back to positive year-on-year growth? And could we give a little bit more quantitative numbers around what kind of growth are we expecting for calendar '20? And especially on Hyperscale, could we talk a little bit about the broadening out of the customer set from the one key customer that we have right now? And I had a follow-up question as well.",113

Let me take this in 2 parts. Let's take a look at, first, Hyperscale and what we stated is we'll continue to expand our relationships and engagement with a broader number of Tier 1, we call them, or the large Hyperscale customers, and we are doing that. We have deep engagements with many of these Hyperscale customers and we expect to see that broaden our portfolio and give us a better long-term view of how we're going to grow in Hyperscale. 
I'm seeing the second half of this year coming in better than the first half. That's as granular as I'm willing to get. One of the challenges we have in Hyperscale is it's a very lumpy process and so it's very hard to measure it as systematically like you can in a traditional enterprise. But the view and projections going forward are we're optimistic that we're going to see growth in the second half compared to the first half of the year at Hyperscale. And as we continue to expand not only within the Hyperscale customers we're already participating with, but as we pick up new projects with other customers. 
We're also participating with what we would call the next wave and we're seeing positive results starting to happen. Although they're smaller customers, we're still seeing positive result in the next wave.
On the enterprise side, we've done some very good things with our sales force. We've really driven efficiency and focus on our sales force for both customer acquisition as well as our channel. We have a very strong channel-first strategy and it's playing out quite well for us. We're seeing positive results as YY and Wai Ming described, in our traditional enterprise server, I expect to see that continue next quarter.",297

I would like to ask on the Storage side, what kind of progress you're having in Storage and how the China JV is going? 
Also, given that you're ramping up new customers in Hyperscale and also expanding the business in HPC and SDI, can you talk about how is the near-term profitability going to be for DCG? And can we expect some kind of timing -- some kind of time line for -- to get to break-even point?",85

I'm not in any position to tell you exact timing for our profitability. I'll let Wai Ming decide if he wants to tell you that. 
On the Hyperscale, we continually see our efforts in Hyperscale pay off very well our growth is double digits this year -- I'm sorry, HPC. We hold 173 of the top 500 world records. We service 19 markets. We continue to really really grow that area and see positive results. We saw the agreement that YY signed with Bob Swan at Intel where we're going to continue to invest together and drive innovation as we focus, really as a corporation, on helping solve humanity's greatest challenges. We really stand for that and we're putting investments in that space and it's coming to fruition very well for us. 
I'm sorry. Was your other question was around -- should have written it down. Storage, yes?  Storage, yes. Yes, we're very, very positive of our storage effort. We went from addressing around 15% of the market with our Storage portfolio prior to the investment engagement with NetApp and now we're seeing us address well over 90% of the market in storage, and that is actually going very, very well. We saw high double-digit growth in Storage this quarter and so expecting to see that trend continue as we bring on and train our sales force and we have aligned our sales force behind Storage. It's actually showing tremendous growth and we're very positive and optimistic about that. That's one of our shining areas of growth for the Data Center Group.",270

So I think we actually take the DCG business very strategically important by really getting back to scale as well as improving profitability so that you can actually sort of see that going forward.",94

So in the past couple quarters, we put profitability first for our MBG business. But for DCG, definitely, we believe from a long-term point of view, it will be -- it should be Lenovo's growth engine. So we're putting it in our transformation, so definitely the major goal is to -- we should drive the growth. So at the start, just to say, we have the opportunity, not just driving the growth in Hyperscale customers, but we now have the scale in traditional enterprise business. 
So we want to drive even higher growth in that space, definitely driven by Software Defined Infrastructure driven by Storage, driven by the Service. So that will be our target. And also, we have a specific China strategy to drive the growth in China. But definite meanwhile, we will not ignore the profit improvement.",155

So my question is maybe for Doug, continuing on the server side. So can you talk about the kind of momentum you're seeing for Hyperscale for the December quarter? Because I remember 3 months ago, you guys talked about seeing significant improvement in terms of demand for Hyperscale from your key existing Hyperscale customer. Can you just kind of talk about how that momentum has changed over the past 3 months? And yes, so how do we expect December quarter to look like? So that's my first question. 
My second question is maybe for Gianfranco on the PC side. So if I'm looking at the numbers correctly, your PTI margin for PCSD is the highest it's ever been at 5.7% PTI margin. Obviously, this is a combination of several factors, but what do you think is driving this higher elevated margin? Is it mostly product mix? Or is it mostly a reflection of lower component pricing? I mean how sustainable do you think this new elevated PTI margin will be going forward?",176

We believe we'll see better results in the second half in Hyperscale. We've seen some pushout, as we talked about last time, whereas they consume the capacity they have and bring on more. We're not seeing a change in what they're demanding, it's just the timing. So we're very engaged and very positive about the long-term results with the Hyperscale partners we have. 
And so we see the growth continuing in that space and that's why, as YY said, it's our scale engine and we're going to continue to invest there. It really provides tremendous advantage for us as we have one of the world's best supply chain organizations. We're utilizing that capability in our in-house design to be a major, major player in Hyperscale and we'll continue to do that. And so yes, I see the second half being an obviously improvement over first.",161

I think when you look at our results, for sure, the major components is coming from product mix in the event that when you look at our growth on the Workstation, Gaming, Thin and Light, we are talking about, let's say, worst case, around 30%; in some cases, even better than 30%. So we are strictly focused on the growth area and also where the margin usually is better.  
It is also true that we get some benefit from component costs going down, but frankly speaking, if I look at last quarter, component costs have started to stabilize. They are still slowly going down, but it's much more stable than 6 or 9 months ago. And we expect that this is going to be the same probably in the next couple of quarters moving forward. 
So I would say, for sure, the mix. And if you look at commercial, I think it's already 70% of our mix. But, we are still #1 on both commercial and consumer. And even consumer, we reached historical high market share.
The other good thing here is that when we look at our geo, we have today all the geo without any exception running more or less with the similar performance in terms of profitability, and I think it's probably the first quarter or the second quarter in our history where we have all the geo running the same or similar performance in terms of profitability. 
So I would say product mix, good balance between the geo, some help from component costs.",258

Could you talk a little bit about what are the plans for 5G as well as, I think, Yuanqing mentioned that we are also entering Europe selectively into some markets.

And one small follow-up question is for Wai Ming. Wai Ming, could you talk a little bit about the increase in the factoring expenses? Is it a temporary thing?

So first, I think our commitment was like 5 to 6 quarters of profitability, so we keep delivering on that. Moving forward, there are a few things that are going to help boost profitable growth. We are making good progress lapping synergies we see in the enterprise side. We have -- just starting but it is getting very promising. 
In 5G, of course, we were first to market with the 5G launch with Verizon a few months ago. We are going to see a few products coming in the near future. We're not announcing the future date. But we see that helping us grow our average selling price in markets like North America and Europe. And also, we are seeing very good reception on our future portfolio among European carriers. So that will also help foster growth in the near future. 
In terms of profitability, I mean we're not giving commitment, but our commitment is like on profitable growth. So we're not taking any routes that will affect profitability. We're being very cautious. We have also an important announcement coming next week, we cannot comment today, that also will deliver stronger in the premium space. 
So as we move forward, we are coming back to the premium space, the experience we have with 5G launch in terms of [ like campaign in areas of ] performance, I believe is going to help us grow in that space also.",239

So if you only consider these 2 geos separately, so [indiscernible] right. So actually, both -- in both markets, we made more than 5% PTI.

But at the end, when I look, we really rationalized the product road map -- the lineup. We shortened the product design -- product development by almost 30%. We cut the costs in terms of we look at our cost base and then we cut any kind of cost that was not bringing in any return. And this is why probably you see now that for more than 4 quarters, we are profitable. But I think we build a very good, solid foundation. 
Now I think we are also looking at area where we can grow, but as Sergio said, being very careful that we don't get into any risk in terms of profitability. 
But area, so we are making some [ fast turn ] in some countries in Europe, for example. We will do similar things in Asia because we see growth opportunity both in Europe and Asia. But still managing profitability very, very carefully. There is no reason to jeopardize what we did during the last 18 months.",210

I think, in fact, you should actually look at it both 2 ways. One obviously is the rate of the interest rate, the other is really the usage. I think this is a full quarter in which we, I think, moved the [ IGF ] financing, I think, to sort of in-house during the quarter. I think we are actually making progress. We will continue to see improvement of the interest rates. But at the same time, because taking it in-house, we'll actually be able to utilize that in more efficient way, meaning that we probably will be able to do generally a little bit more cash from the receivables that we have. 
So I don't see -- while we're definitely, from a trend perspective, seeing improving interest rate, but at the same time we'll see the absolute dollar probably will come down a little bit but not significant because we really would want to take the in-house to drive more cash from the operation.",171

Just want to ask you -- consult with you for 2020, you think that, for PC, the market still can keep the component price stable? Is my first question. 
Second question, I was very excited for your [indiscernible] the app, but as I know that some of PC deploying earlier before December, especially in June and December less the American trade war with China. So I guess this is natural demand. I'm not sure what your view for 2020, especially the commercial replacement probably slowed down. So this is my second question for PC. So this is my PC question.",131

Then it depends on a lot of things, demand on Hyperscale, demand on PC and so on. But when I look at the overall picture, capacity is still bigger than demand and memory, frankly speaking, when we look at -- in the open markets, both flash and DRAM, they are still going down. 
So it's a -- I would not expect to see any major change over the next 6 months. If I was so good to predict also the following 6 months, I would have a good crystal ball and probably we are going to do something different. But no, I do follow -- so we are quite confident that for a certain period of time, we will see a certain stability in terms of component. 
On your question on December shipment, frankly speaking, we have seen some movement in the past. We are not seeing -- and you are mainly talking about U.S. We are talking about U.S., I think. We are not seeing a big movement in terms of shipment for December in order to prevent the tariff or these things, at least not from our side, but frankly speaking, also from competition. We are not seeing the -- we saw it last quarter, last quarter in the sense that between August and September, yes, at least for [indiscernible] for cost [ certainty ]. But this quarter, we really don't see this kind of movement. 
One good thing when I look at PC and I look at commercial, I think the transition to Windows 10 is not finished yet in the sense that we are not alone, but together with Microsoft, with other people, we know that there are still probably almost 100 million PCs installed base that are running with Windows 7 or even before Windows 7 and they will move probably in the next 6 to 9 months. So this transition has been done for large customer, large enterprise and in some areas of the world. But there are small customer or medium customer in the area of the world where transition is not finished yet. So also there, I would expect that for the next 6 months to continue to see the upgrade to Windows 10 moving forward then.",418

My second question is probably for Mr. Doug Fisher. I think this is for data center and this is for server. I just want to consult with you for outlook for 2020. The reason because we know that Intel's service CPU probably will launch in the third quarter or the first quarter for [indiscernible]. That's why some of supply chain or even industrial were thinking that the first half year of 2020 will be mute. What do you think about it? 
And how do you look at the global server demand for 2020? And in the risk of the Intel delay because we know right now their competitor, AMD, is gaining market share, is very aggressive and it is [ passed ] by TSMC. So how much is no doubt from your side, from you Data Center, especially the [ cloud IP ] already contributed 40% of total worldwide server. And did you think AMD will be lose market share in server? So this is total my question for server side.",172

If you take a look at the server side, we made an announcement on the AMD front -- we made our announcement in August with AMD. We launched our first AMD platform in an enterprise space. We obviously work with AMD in the cloud space. And so we've been working with AMD for years, and why we have an enterprise platform. We're very proud of that. It really drove a lot of top performance benchmarks, which we're well known for. We're #1 in performance in the industry and we'll continue to do that.
The timing for -- my view, the timing for Intel platform is not going to impact what we do. We're going to continue to drive the platform road map that we have today. We're seeing us grow within the market. If you take a look at really the market that -- was declined, we actually did much, much better than the market. That's our commitment: we're going to continue to do better than the market is doing. And so we've done that quarter-to-quarter. We're going to continue to do that. So we pay less attention to what they're doing overall, and our objective is to grow within the market that we have. 
When it comes to the new platform, we've had a tradition, which we're going to continue is the fastest transition. So we're already gearing up, and when the platform is available, we'll transition to that as quickly as we have done in the past. We have a very, very good record of transitioning with the newest technology and leading the industry on that, which gives us -- that's why we always have the top performance marks in the industry by far. And these are not ours. 
These are independent performance marks that you can find on sites like from Intel will showcase [indiscernible]. So we're going to continue that and I'm very, very excited about [indiscernible]. I'm like Gianfranco, I'd love to have a crystal ball, but I'm going to stick with my day job and shift performance that are -- the top performance and #1 in reliability and customer satisfaction and we're going to go win our own fair share.",367

So all the questions are related to our 3 core businesses. So actually, if you ask me, what are we satisfied with the last quarter's performance, so I would say that will be our transformation benchmark. So actually, our Service & Software revenue grew by 36%. So it's not easy. And also our Smart IoT quadrupled. Our Smart Vertical revenue tripled. So those are definitely good signals of how our transformation strategy really works and our execution is very determined. So I just want you to see those results as well.
