21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2024",2024-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3736.0,3004228.0,109854018.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,2,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the culmination of a year of tremendous progress towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. We consistently executed on our plan to reestablish process leadership, further build out our capacity and foundry plans, greatly improved product execution and began to execute on our mission to bring AI everywhere across our product segments. We delivered solid Q4 results exceeding expectations for the fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was at the higher end of our guidance, and we had strong EPS upside as a result of our ongoing relentless focus on driving operating leverage and expense management, including comfortably meeting our $3 billion cost savings commitment for fiscal year '23.  
2023 was definitely a year when we did what we said we would do and more. We intend to make 2024 another such year. And when we look out over the next 12 months, we are confident that we can continue to drive considerable progress on our IDM 2.0 journey. As we look into Q1, our core business, including client server and edge products continues to perform well and is tracking to the lower end of seasonal. However, discrete headwinds, including Mobileye, PSG and business exits, among others, are impacting overall revenue, leading to a lower Q1 guide. Importantly, we see this as temporary, and we expect sequential and year-on-year growth in both revenue and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year '24.  
Momentum and excitement around new products and businesses remain strong as we head into the year and will grow stronger as the year progresses. We could not be prouder of the execution across our process technology road map in 2023. We became the world's first high-volume manufacturer of logic devices using EUV, both the U.S. and Europe as we aggressively ramp Core Ultra on Intel 4 in both Oregon and Ireland. Intel 3 achieved manufacturing readiness in Q4 as committed with solid performance in year progression. Our 2 lead vehicles in Intel 3 are on track, and we look forward to launching Sierra Forest in first half '24 followed shortly thereafter by Granite Rapids.  
Sierra Forest has final samples at customers and the production stepping of Granite Rapids is running ahead of schedule well into power own validation and very healthy. We are even more excited about breaking into the angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, the latter and expected 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. 
Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half '24, completing our 5 nodes and 4-year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into fab shortly.  
As we complete our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years, we are not satisfied nor are we finished. We have begun installation of the industry's first High-NA EUV tool in our most advanced technology development site in Oregon, aimed at addressing challenges beyond 18A. We remain focused on being good stewards of Moore's Law and ensuring a continuous node migration path over the next decade and beyond.  
Third-party engagements with IFS continue to validate our progress on this technology. We launched IFS with a long-term view of delivering the world's first system foundry that brings together a secure and sustainable supply chain with the best of Intel and our ecosystem. While our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year '23 towards our goal of becoming the second largest external foundry by 2030. 
The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP is now one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market.  
We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA design services, IP, cloud and U.S. military aerospace and government. Critical agreements with ARM and Synopsys continue to gain momentum. We delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States government and Department of Defense.  
We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile, communication infrastructure and networking. This expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site.  
Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed the Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. 
In addition to the 3 intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and U.S. capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on 4 inclusive of a meaningful prepay and our momentum continues to grow. 
Our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another important advantage for IFS, a faster on-ramp to broader foundry relationships. During the quarter, we captured 3 additional advanced packaging design wins, bringing the total to 5 in 2023, with the majority of revenue starting in 2025.  
To support our growing demand, just yesterday, we opened Fab 9 in New Mexico, marking a milestone for high-volume 3D advanced packaging manufacturing. The momentum in advanced packaging is very strong and is another facet of our foundry strategy, which is clearly benefiting from the surge of interest in AI. With leadership technology and available capacity, our opportunity set continues to grow. In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, our lifetime deal value for IFS is now over $10 billion, more than doubling from the $4 billion we provided in our last update.  
Supporting our growing momentum in IFS is our global manufacturing footprint. We are the only semiconductor company with that scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world providing ourselves and our foundry customers resilient access to the right capacity in the right regions at the right time. All of our expansion projects in the U.S., EU and Asia are progressing on schedule, and our chips applications in the U.S. and EU are progressing well.  
Finally, we are thrilled to be hosting our first Foundry Day, IFS Direct Connect on February 21st in San Jose, where we will have the opportunity to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem as well as begin to talk about our process road map beyond Intel 18A, next-generation packaging and our full foundries. We hope to see many of you there.  
Intel continues its mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. And given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI silicon logic. We have already discussed how our 50-year heritage and high-performance computing transistors and our advanced packaging positions IFS to benefit from the accelerating move to AI. Within our product portfolio, we are the only company with the products, IP and ecosystem reach to empower customers to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications from the cloud through the network, into the enterprise client and edge.  
For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Goudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks and leadership TCO. 
As AI proliferates and the world moves towards more AI integrated application, there's a market shift toward local inferencing and smaller, more nimble models. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inferencing cost and round trip latency. With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra ushering in the AIPC era and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of clients and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than requiring it in the cloud. 
Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments.
In Q4, our server business experienced solid sequential growth, consistent with market share, which we believe was flat with Q3 levels. Since launching 4th Gen Xeon in early 2023, we have shipped more than 2.5 million units with approximately 1/3 of all 4th Gen demand driven by AI. With our 5th Gen Xeon launch, we enable up to 42% higher AI inference performance, compared to the industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. 5th Gen Xeon has reached general availability at Alibaba is entering public and private previews with several CSPs and is on track to ship with OEMs next month.  
More importantly, our improved execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon ramping well, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids coming soon and Clearwater Forest already going into the fab. Momentum is building and positioning us well to win back share in the data center.  
Our Gaudi2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs. And a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing. We're building on this momentum with Gaudi3, which is on track to launch this year and is expected to deliver performance leadership with 4x the processing power and double the networking bandwidth for greater scale outperformance. Gaudi3 is now in the lab, powered on and showing great health and performance and Falcon Shores is also well underway.  
Our accelerated pipeline for 2024 grew double digits sequentially in Q4 and is now well above $2 billion and growing. We recently increased our supply for both Gaudi2 and Gaudi3 to support the growing customer demand and we expect meaningful revenue acceleration throughout the year. As we announced last quarter, we are now operating PSG as a stand-alone business beginning on January 1. Our intent is to bring in private capital this year to create an eventual path to an IPO over the coming years.  
As we outlined on our Q3 call, PSG is in the midst of an industry-wide cyclical correction for FPGAs, which we expect to last through the first half of '24. Despite the financial correction, operational momentum is strong and PSG executed its most ambitious FPGA road map, delivering 21 new product releases in 2023 and executing supply assurance agreements valued by our customers.  
Finally, even as we congratulate Sandra Rivera, the new CEO of PSG, I am extremely pleased to welcome Justin Hotard as Executive Vice President and General Manager of DCAI. Justin joined us from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he was Executive Vice President and General Manager of High-Performance Computing, AI and Labs. He will play a key role in helping customers accelerate their businesses with our Xeon processor family, delivering on our commitments to customers and partners by increasing our GPU and accelerate our footprint and supporting our mission to bring AI everywhere.  
Moving to client. CCG performed very well in Q4, posting the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. Demand reflected a normalized inventory environment with sustained strength in gaming and commercial with our highest end SKUs exceeding Q3 records by 20%. The 2023 consumption TAM was roughly 270 million units consistent with our views entering the year, and we expect the PC TAM up low single digits year-on-year in 2024, in line with third-party estimates. Our share position is strong, and our product portfolio for 2024 and beyond and ecosystem work will continue to drive industry-leading performance and experiences.  
In Q4, we ushered in the age of the AIPC with the launch of Intel Core Ultra, representing our largest architectural shift in decades -- the core Ultra is the most AI-capable and power-efficient client processor with dedicated acceleration capabilities across the CPU, GPU and Neural Processing Unit or NPU. Ultra is the centerpiece of the AIPC systems that are capable of natively running popular 10 billion parameter models, and drive superior performance on key AI-enhanced applications like Zoom, Adobe and Microsoft. We expect to ship approximately 40 million AIPCs in 2024 alone with more than 230 designs from ultrathin PCs to handheld gaming devices to be delivered this year from OEM partners, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, MSI, Samsung Electronics and others.  
The Core Ultra platform delivers leadership AI performance today with our next-generation platforms launching later this year, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake tripling our AI performance. In 2025 with Panther Lake, we will grow AI performance up to an additional 2x. NEX is well positioned to benefit from the proliferation of AI workloads on the edge where our market-leading hardware and software assets provides improved latency, reliability and cost.  
OpenVINO adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4 and today is a core software layer for AI inferencing on the edge, on the PC and in the data center. NEX is also driving the shift of AI networking in the cloud from proprietary technologies to open Ethernet-based approaches in partnership with a broader industry ecosystem. NEX Q4 results beat our internal forecast and the division is poised for solid growth in 2024 across edge network and ethnic products more skewed to the second half.  
Yet another growing market opportunity for us is automotive. While Mobileye is experiencing a sharp inventory correction in Q1, we are encouraged by their improving forecast throughout 2024 and more importantly, the recent announcement at CES that they were awarded a series of production design wins by a major Western automaker across the company's 3 key platforms: SuperVision, Chauffeur and Drive. In addition to Mobileye's strengths in AV, at CES, we announced the launch of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle, SoCs with Geely Zeekr brand as our first OEM partner and our agreement to acquire Silicon Mobility, a fabless silicon and software company specializing in power management SoCs focused on EVs.  
These announcements build on shared IP across clients and data center and our existing Intel SoC footprint of more than 50 million vehicles worldwide. Our strategy will continue to broaden our exposure to the growing auto market on both the product and the foundry sides of our business.  
Finally, underpinning our across-the-board progress in 2023 is our operational and financial discipline. As our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency, accountability and focus on cost begins to take root, we expect to unlock further cost savings and efficiencies in 2024 and beyond. We have officially transitioned to this new operating model on January 1, and we'll report the new segmentation format as part of our Q1 earnings. We see incremental efficiencies as we drive to our long-term model of 60% gross and 40% operating margins.  
As I reflect on our progress in 2023, I am incredibly proud of our employees, whose commitment and perseverance were instrumental to the execution of our ambitious strategy. Together, we exited the year accomplishing exactly what we set out to do. We improved our execution engine consistently being on track or ahead on our process and product road map. 
And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are confident in our performance and financial trajectory for the year ahead. We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate. We will maintain our relentless focus on our mission and commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders.  
With that, let me turn things over to David.",2798
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2024",2024-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3736.0,3004228.0,109854019.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter on top of continued execution of our products and process road map commitments. We again beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. We've taken proactive steps to prioritize our investments, aggressively manage near-term expenses and made meaningful progress on reducing our structural cost gaps.  We exit 2023 a healthier and leaner company, but there is much more work to do in 2024 and beyond to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and the potential of IDM 2.0. 
Fourth quarter revenue was $15.4 billion, up 9% sequentially, 10% year-over-year and $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance with solid execution across reported segments. Gross margin was 48.8%, 230 basis points better than our guidance, driven by favorable product mix and ASPs, improved due to costs, higher revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.54, beating guidance by $0.10 on improved gross margins, stronger revenue and disciplined OpEx management. 
Q4 operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Net inventory was down more than $300 million and 9 days in the quarter, and DSO remains under 20. Net CapEx was $5.9 billion resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter.  
Moving to the fourth quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, up 12% sequentially, 33% year-over-year and ahead of internal expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. We saw sustained strength in gaming and commercial segments, along with record performance of notebook shipments in the quarter. Customer inventory levels have normalized and 2023 PC consumption was in line with our 270 million unit forecast. Operating profit was $2.9 billion, up more than $800 million sequentially and nearly $2.4 billion year-over-year on improved TAM and market share and sell-through of reserved inventory.  
DCAI revenue was $4 billion, up 4% sequentially. The server business delivered double-digit growth sequentially, partially offset by the FPGA inventory correction. Revenue was driven by improved unit TAM, stable share and rising average core density contributing to record Xeon ASPs. Operating profit was $78 million, roughly flat sequentially as advanced node development costs continue to weigh on profitability.  
NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% sequentially and ahead of internal expectations on strength from network and Ethernet segments. The business saw an operating loss of $12 million, down modestly quarter-over-quarter. 
Intel Foundry Services contributed revenue of $291 million, down modestly on a sequential basis and up 63% year-over-year on increased traditional packaging revenue. IFS operating loss was $113 million, driven by continued investment to develop and grow world-class systems foundry.  
Mobileye delivered record revenue of $637 million, up 20% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, along with record operating profit of $242 million, up 42% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Recently disclosed design wins are expected to contribute more than $7 billion of future revenue or more than 3.5x Mobileye's record FY '23 revenue.  
As Pat summarized, the company made significant progress towards our IDM 2.0 strategy including strong execution against our 2023 financial commitments despite macro headwinds throughout the year. As committed at our Q1 '23 earnings call, we delivered revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS growth each quarter. Despite significant investments in future growth and continued progression through 5 nodes in 4 years, we achieved our 2023 commitment of $3 billion of spending reductions.  
Through a strong focus on cash and cost controls, we achieved excellent DSO and DPO in the second half of 2023, and delivered net inventory reductions of nearly $2 billion and 35 days from our peak in Q1 '23. Working capital initiatives yielded roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023, helping us to meet our commitment for roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow in the second half of the year. 
We remain committed to our smart capital framework. With growing contributions from our SCIP agreement with Brookfield and progress toward government incentives in the U.S., Europe and Israel. In Q4, we also recognized $845 million of advanced manufacturing investment credits or AMIC, as defined in the CHIPS Act. While our continued IDM 2.0 capital investments will result in increased gross CapEx in '24 as compared to '23, we're on track to our aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of net CapEx spending in the mid-30s as a percent of revenue, with offsets towards the high end of the 20% to 30% range.  
Now turning to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion. At the Q1 revenue midpoint of $12.7 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 44.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.13. 
While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG. Additionally, we expect a significant drop in IFS revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment buying in the first half of the year, impacting the IMS business. 
When combined with businesses we exited in 2023, we expect a roughly $1 billion sequential revenue impact from businesses outside of our core products. With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024, consistent with third-party views. Our recent results show the PC remains essential, and we remain confident in our longer-term TAM forecast as the age of the AIPC further enhances the value of device refresh.  
We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio with well over $2 billion in pipeline to gain traction as we move through 2024.  
Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network, ethnic and edge products. These signals give us confidence that consolidated revenue will grow beyond typical seasonality after a soft Q1. And that we can deliver sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and EPS each quarter of 2024. 
We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion. We expect depreciation to grow by approximately $2 billion in 2024, in addition to a significant increase in variable factory start-up costs. 60% gross margin flow-through as a percent of revenue growth remains a rule of thumb in aggregate in the intermediate term, though we may see volatility in our quarterly gross margin results.  
We're excited to mark the first month fully operating under our new internal foundry reporting structure with improved accountability, transparency around cost and value drivers and increased focus on driving higher rates of return for our owner's capital. We intend to provide you with the recast historical financials this quarter in the form of an 8-K. We will unpack the details at that time, but you will see not only the first view of our manufacturing P&L, but a view of our products group more in line with external peers.  
While come as no surprise, our manufacturing P&L is under significant pressure as we get back to process leadership and build the infrastructure to meet both internal and external demand, we see abundant opportunity to drive improvement. Finally, standing up a separate legal entity for manufacturing, technology development and IFS is important to our foundry customers. We expect to have that structure in place in the second half of 2024. 
As we look back at 2023, we have a lot to be proud of. We entered the year with a challenging macro backdrop. I'm pleased with our team's efforts, controlling spending, ramping new products, managing share, executing product and process road maps and delivering for our customers. We continue to focus our portfolio by exiting 5 businesses in 2023 for a total of 10 since past return. While also identifying profitable adjacent markets, we can serve with our existing IP as we have done with Intel Auto. We executed within our Smart Capital framework and are beginning to see meaningful capital offsets. We unlock value for our shareholders through Mobileye and IMS and announced our intention to pursue external investments in PSG.  
I'd like to thank the entire Intel team for the hard work and execution, which drove our improved 2023 results. While we aren't yet where we want to be from a financial perspective, we're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM, our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market. And with the strong foundation of financial discipline we set in 2023, we're confident and committed to our long-term financial objectives.  
With that, let me turn the call back over to John.",1516

So the near term one is on the demand picture. Dave, you were helpful in breaking up the kind of the noncore impacts in the first quarter versus the core, but the low end of seasonality is a little bit of a surprise, given that cyclical pressures seem to have been abating and some of the market share trends should have been in your favor, at least also not worsening. So can you just talk a little bit about why you're at the low end of seasonality in the first quarter for your core businesses? And what gives you confidence in super seasonality thereafter?",120

Thanks, Ross. I'll start and ask Dave to follow up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1, there's a wide range of perspective, anywhere from 3% to 20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built the forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which, as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast. But the core business we see is healthy for it. We see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger. 
So I'd say it really reflects as we view the market. But we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, right? Improving our revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year, and we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. And obviously, as the year improves, new product lines emerging tailwinds in areas like AIPC, Gaudi ramping for accelerators. Overall, a lot of things that just keep improving as we go through the year, combined with good cost discipline, we feel quite comfortable that we're starting strong. And we're going to have an improving year as the year progresses.",248

I'll do that and then ask Dave pile on both of those a little bit. But with respect to the manufacturing, I'd just say, hey, when you look at this every single day, and we're scrutinizing carefully our progress on 18A. And obviously, the great news that we just described has Clearwater Forest taping out. That gives us a lot of confidence that 18A is healthy. That's a major product for us, Panther Lake following that shortly. .
We've also had our fourth customer this quarter. Some of the IP providers are giving us very strong affirmation on the competitiveness of the process technology. And particularly, we're just way ahead on backside power. And that's not even -- everybody in the industry is recognizing that. And many of the customers, who are looking at it are seeing substantial gains, not just in power performance but in area savings as well. 
So overall, we feel very confident that our road map is strong on the process technology side. We do use external foundries. And obviously, that grew as we were dealing with some of our own challenges for process competitiveness. And as we create more and more focus in the business, more wafers will come internal to the Intel factory network. But long term, we're going to continue to use external foundries to complement, manage our capital requirements and to make sure that our teams always are building the best products in the industry and using the best technologies to accomplish that. 
So overall, we feel super good with our strategy. You see more use of our own factory network even as we leverage external foundries where appropriate.",280

It was obviously much, much better in December and the March guidance is actually pretty good. So does this include the sale of any previously written down inventory and maybe help us get a clean margin number? Is this March number pretty clean that we can carry that incremental forward through the year?",61

I mean, what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall-through is probably the best rule of thumb. That said, as you know, quarter-to-quarter, things can move that number up and down. In Q4, we saw better fall-through. Largely, it was related to a better sell-through of previously reserved product. We also actually did better on the factory side in terms of spending and yield, and so that also benefited us to some extent. .
And then in Q1, I think we're going to do a little worse. We're going to see the fall-through be a little harder on us. And largely, some of that stuff going away a little bit. But I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's kind of '23 to '24, '24 to '25. We largely expect it to be the 60% fall-through. We're going to have these quarter-to-quarter movements that kind of violate that because of just one-off things. But I think, in general, you'll see 60% fall-through be the right measure.
Longer term, we're also going to want to see that number go up, because it's going to drive us to the 60% gross margins, we ultimately want to attain. But in the near term, we're kind of dealing with a lot of the costs associated with 5 nodes in 4 years. It's just a lot of start-up costs back. We'll probably hit our peak start-up cost in 2024. So that's a huge headwind we'll have to deal with. So that's going to, I think, kind of keep us in the 60% fall-through range for the next couple of years.",279

Dave, yes, just on the -- how you get to that 60%. So -- it seems like there could be persistent headwinds in terms of capacity utilization. I mean I think a lot of us see that there's this plan to cut over to internal, starting with Panther Lake, but that doesn't really ramp into high volume until probably 2026. So are you managing to some sort of like utilization rate for your internal capacity to sort of get to that 60%?",86
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2024",2024-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3736.0,3004228.0,109854033.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,17,"Yes. Well, let me step back a little bit on the 60%. I mean, it will be driven by a number of factors, one of which is just revenue. Revenue growing on a largely fixed cost business is going to help gross margins. Obviously, we have optimism around how we can drive the growth of the business. The second, as you point out, is loadings, and we are managing our capital spend and our investment with an eye on loadings to make sure that we keep those in a good place. Obviously, last year, we were -- we had some underloading to deal with. But as we kind of break out of that and start to move into the next year, I think we'll start to see some improvements there. .
Third, as we get, as Pat was talking about, to leadership in terms of nodes and products, ultimately across the entire product portfolio, that's going to help out on margins. It's going to help out from a cost structure perspective, but also better performing products are just going to yield better pricing and so forth, better profitability. 
And then lastly, we've got this internal foundry model that Pat mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we think is going to deliver tons of savings for the company. I think every week that Pat and I spend on this, somebody brings up another big rock that they found of savings they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times and how many -- what sort of like hot lots they do and how much sample activity they use. 
The factories now, as you point out, very, very hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment associated with the loadings. We're way more focused in terms of stepping and so forth. So I think we'll get, like I said in a call a couple of quarters ago, $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately. And so that's another big step function that I think gets us to the 60% gross margins.",375

If we're taking older factories. And Tim, as you might have heard me say in the past, right, a bug in the Intel business model, right? Just when a factory got very good and depreciated, right, we move to the next node. Well, now we're starting to fill that with long-term foundry business as well. So all of these are improving the discipline of running the business as well as how we utilize our factory networks long term, and we really do think that the 60-40 is what Dave and I are driving the business to and we're going to get there.",114

How much of that is a function of the weakness in FPGA that you've talked to already? And then just any sense of what the cloud and server environment is like in the first quarter?,48

So overall, when you act -- obviously, we've spoken separately about the FPGA business, so let's just move that to the side. Overall, I'll say it's fairly seasonal quarter-to-quarter and what we expect. That said, we're seeing strength from our server customers. For instance, more of the OEM response is strong with regard to the momentum they're seeing in the enterprise server business. And obviously, our product line is improving there. .
We do expect year-on-year growth here. We see our market share stabilizing. Obviously, as we're ramping Gen 4, Gen 5, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, the momentum is building for us overall. And as we indicated, hey, we think more of the AI surge is going to result in AI inferencing on-prem, which we're well positioned to be a beneficiary. I would just cite that here we are in year 20 of the public cloud, and you have 60% plus of compute in the cloud, but 80-plus percent of data remains on-prem, right? Customers want to realize the value of that on-prem data with AI, and that's an enterprise strength for Intel. 
So we do see all of these trends giving us a very favorable outlook for the year. And there's nothing surprising about the Q1 guide here, and we're going to be very focused on beating those numbers, and building on the momentum of improving product line.",230

And I would love to talk for hours about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. I'm super excited about those products, both of them on Intel 3. And if I build on the last question from Tim about factory loadings, hey, we are driving hard to accelerate those products into the marketplace and they're really the drivers of Intel 3 capacity. The mix between them. Obviously, this is our first, I'll say, volume, mainstream offering for a high core count, I sort of view this as the cloud guys just run VMs at scale or just one containers at scale. That's what Sierra Forest is about is sort of that bulk workload. And it doesn't have some of the performance capabilities, peak capabilities, feature capabilities that Granite Rapids has. 
I expect the bulk of the market to stay on Granite Rapids type products, the P-core products, certainly in '24 and '25, but we do see a pretty steady rise in the use of Sierra Forest. And then as we move to Clearwater Forest in '25, a very compelling product that we do see a pretty healthy split between those for the cloud and data center customers. I think most of the enterprise customers will stay with the P-core products that they will have. And it really is Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest and successors being sort of that bulk mainstream cloud offering that's very focused on TCO. 
So with that, we feel super good about our product portfolio, P-cores, E-cores, really allowing us to stretch the offering for the highest performance with high core count and to the best TCO. And with that, this is a portfolio that will allow us to regain share in the core data center market.",291

But Dave, starting at 44.5% in the first quarter, how do you -- are you still looking for the overall reported non-GAAP number to be up year-over-year from the 43.6%, and you've mentioned some volatility there? I just want to clarify on the call how the gross margin trajectory is going to look year-over-year and understanding there's volatility there?",82

To be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on the 60% fall-through. So you should take the full year gross margins that we had in '23, which were roughly 43.5% and think about the 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year. .
The only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it. So there could be quarters in which we get less ship through of previously reserved products, sometimes it's more. And so kind of avoiding, trying to pinpoint every quarter because of the difficulty around pinpointing that, but we feel very confident around the 60% fall-through.",146

Could you talk about a bit more about the client market? There was -- you mentioned that corporate, you said some strength. And Dell had said there was some weakness.

So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year, it was [ 270 ]. This year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution on market share through last year, and the product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. 
Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is -- I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AIPC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect and customers are starting to look at their post-COVID refreshes. So a lot of those benefits materialize as you go through the year, but our position in gaming, commercial, very strong for us overall. 
And I'll tell you, we're just seeing a lot of excitement for the AIPC. I described this the Centrino moment, the most exciting category defining moment since WiFi was introduced 2-plus decades ago. So we do think that is going to bring a multiyear cycle of growth. Great ISVs, great new use cases, and a product line that is clearly leading the industry established in this category.",273

Because when we look at the revenue growth across your GPU competitors, they seem to be capturing nearly all of the incremental CapEx and in some cases, even more than, right, just the CapEx as the public cloud company. So -- does that really leave much room for your CPU business to grow, right, beyond just the seasonal variations? So just how are you looking at the AI market overall? And what part of that is Intel really able to capture when we just look at how much is being or needing to be dedicated to your GPU competitors?",130

And let's just maybe 3 different aspects to it. The first one is clearly the high-end cloud guys and what they're doing for maxizing training environments. Clearly, that's been an accelerator market so far. But that even is giving, I'll say, a bit of a tailwind in the sense there are lots of head nodes associated with that. We do think, as we said that the market moves much more from high-end training to inferencing, of where our product line is more substantive for it. But the enterprise market, as we see it for data centers is very much going to be an on-premise play, taking advantage of inferencing in that data pools that they already have. And that's an area of good strength for Intel. And we're starting to see that in some of the conversations with our OEM customers. 
And as I finished probably 50 meetings between World Economic Forum in Davos and CES with customers, I'll say we have absolute unanimous response that they're going to be deploying a lot of their AI on-premise in their data centers and Xeons and our on-premise offerings are simply the preferred way for them to be taking advantage of those capabilities inside of their data centers, inside of the TCO envelopes, power, networking management that they have in place. 
Obviously, we need to be participating more in the accelerator piece of that. And we're seeing the growing pipeline of our opportunities. We saw a nice uptick in revenue in Q4 from a small number, but a lot of momentum as we come into the year. And Gaudi3 is getting a lot of excitement. Clearly, leaving in TCO. So we're going to be competing much more for that high-end accelerator footprint. But I think the message of 2024 is going to be inferencing AI everywhere. That's going to be at the edge. That's going to be the AIPC and it's going to be in the enterprise data center, all areas that Intel has a much stronger footprint.",339

So on the foundry side, I think you mentioned IFS, some declines in Q1 after the strong Q4 that you had. So I was hoping if you could just help us size what is IFS in Q1? And then longer term, you mentioned now you have 4 18A wins, but how do we quantify what they mean for '24 or '25 or '26? And I think on the call, you had mentioned somewhere about in lifetime win. I'm hoping that's what you meant for 18A. But when I look at that $10 billion over multiple years, that is not really that big relative to, I think, the $130 billion plus annual foundry market. So could you just help us size what does Intel's external foundry business mean for 2024 or 2025 perspective?",133

And the 2 things in the Q4 to Q1 numbers on IFS. One is the -- I'll say, the natural ending of our traditional packaging volume. So that affects Q4 as we go into Q1. And obviously, our focus there is in doing, I'll say, traditional packaging, that's best supplied by OSAT vendors, but we were in a unique position to help our customers as we went through the COVID cycle. All of our packaging focus going forward is advanced packaging, where our technology is differentiated, the margins are good. And as you saw, we just announced the New Mexico facility, the first major advanced manufacturing facility on U.S. soil. A lot of excitement from that from customers across the world. 
Also, we had our foundry equipment business, which was another factor Q4 to Q1, very consistent with the profile that you might have heard from people like ASML, right? As they saw the quarter-to-quarter implications on the equipment business. 
So I'll say Q4 to Q1, all explainable in those context. The business we're winning, 18A foundry customers, Intel 3 packaging takes quarters for that to materialize and for wafer customers years. That's why we said lifetime deal value is probably the best metric that we can give you to help you understand the nature of that business as it's growing. As I said, we saw a big uptick from our prior update to this one. Obviously, we need to, as your question suggest, get to a much bigger number, and that's exactly what we're going to do. We are now well underway. We're seeing healthy growth in lifetime deal value. We'll be giving you periodic updates on it as a good metric of seeing how rapidly that business is growing for us. And I'd emphasize that number is just external foundry, right? 
Our internal business is what's going to be driving the factory build-out. And that really gives us the scale to then start adding these additional external customers to it. Those deals, as we say, they could be a year or 2 or they could be multiple years in length, there'll be a varying contract length associated with them. And we just want to give some visibility, transparency to the business and a rapidly growing lifetime deal value is a good way for us to give you some characterization of that business outlook. 
Finally, I want to see you on February 21. We're going to hold a big industry ecosystem event, our IFS Direct Connect, and meeting with the ecosystem our customers, but we're inviting analysts to listen into the great conversations we're going to have and the disclosures that we'll be giving there.",447

So let me characterize it a little bit more carefully because we've been trying to carefully manage the risk that we're taking on. So first was the move into EUV. We began that with Intel 4 and Intel 3. And those, as we said, are high-volume manufacturing underway done. So we sort of took the risk of EUV off the table there. Backside power, right? We ran an internal note, something we didn't disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many, many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to go derisk backside power before you put it into Intel 20A and Intel 18A. So we had a major to derisk backside power and then, of course, gate all around the transistor. 
So 18A brings those 2 together, backside power and the gate all around transistor. But I'll tell you, as we've been going through the development process, backside power on 18A has been elegant, beautiful, high yield, very clean in its introduction into the process. And really, the focus has been on the new transistor structure with gate all around. 
As customers are taking advantage of that now is they're starting to look at that, they're really seeing great benefits from backside power. In some cases, almost as much performance benefit and significant area benefit from that and gate all around transistors making good progress or 0.9 PDK that we delivered in Q4, and we'll be having the 1.0 PDK in Q2 on track. And as I said, Clearwater Forest is the first product, and it's now in fab on 18A, a huge milestone for us, both on the product side as well as on the process side. 
High NA, the next generation of EUV is not part of 18A, right? That will be part of the next major node. We'll talk more about that at the Intel Foundry Day, as we said, on February 21, but we're not introducing that as a risk factor into 18A. It's the EUV tools that are in production today that we've already derisked as part of the Intel 4 and Intel 3. So we think we've done a very careful management of risk and we look at this all the time as we're rebuilding our momentum. 
And as I said, overall, we are confident 5 nodes in 4 years. This was audacious. It's been superbly executed and we are on track to deliver it and get back to process technology leadership for both our products as well as to establish a major foundry opportunity for the industry rebuilding Western supply chains, the momentum we're seeing in our whole factory network, this is really incredible to progress, and I couldn't be proud of our team for getting it done. 
So with that, let me say thank you for joining us on the call. As always, we appreciate the opportunity that we have to update you on a strong Q4, beating on top and bottom line, finishing an incredible year in 2023. And we're just excited about the momentum we see across the business for both our products, our business and financial execution, the manufacturing technology, foundry design wins really across the board. Our say-do ratio has been extremely high, and we appreciate the interest. 
And as I said, we look forward to the opportunity to give you some more updates as part of Foundry Direct Connect February 21 in San Jose. And I hope to see many of you there as we lay out an exciting update to the industry and it will be a great day for us. Thank you so much for joining us.",606

We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints. We continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by: one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs; two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings; and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye and Altera. 
We had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness and perhaps, most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer. We also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our road map with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. 
Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the National Semiconductor Champion along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives and loans. During the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro and Roche, among many others who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions. 
Vision went straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the open platform for enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate gen AI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or REG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. 
Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors. We are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year-to-date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company 3 years ago. Job #1 was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. 
The heart of Phase 1 was 5 nodes in 4 years. The rallying cry was toured. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our Grovian culture and execution engine and are on track to completing our 5 nodes 4-year goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception. In so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter. Furthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of the Intel 18A in these products in the first half of '25 for product release in the middle of next year. 
Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a founder relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost. This quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company. Separating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. 
This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners, we knew that the day 1 P&L for Intel foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve. I'm going to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. And you can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets. If we can move faster and do better, we will, and our new operating model is already catalyzing change in driving efficiencies across the organization. 
Let me highlight 3 important aspects of our business and our strategy that is underscored by the new model. First, with Intel products, we have exposed a solid fabless franchise with established, powerful and hard to displace installed base and ecosystem across enterprise, consumer and edge that provide meaningful benefits to our customers and partners. Intel products is a solidly profitable business today despite just recently emerging from a semiconductor downturn and still competing with legacy process technology. That is changing rapidly as we ramp Intel 3 in 2024 and Intel 18A in 2025. 
We then claim, we are defining and leading the AI PC category. IDC indicates the overall PC market is now expanding. And as stated earlier, as standards emerge and applications begin to take advantage of new AI embedded capabilities, we see demand signals improving, especially in second half of the year, helped by a likely corporate refresh. 
Our Core Ultra ramp, led by Meteor Lake, continues to accelerate beyond our original expectation, with units expected to double sequentially in Q2, limited only by our supply of wafer-level assembly. Improving second half Meteor Lake supply, and the addition of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake later this year, will allow us to ship in excess of our original 40 million AI PC CPU target in 2024. Next year, with Panther Lake, we will extend our lead with Intel 18A and further product enhancements. Our share position is strong and continues to strengthen as we execute on our product road map. Within DC AI, as committed, we have achieved product release on our first Intel 3 server product, the first-generation E-Core Xeon 6, codename Sierra Forest. 
The next-generation P-Core Xeon 6 product, Granite Rapids, will be released in Q3. At Vision, we demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Xeon 6 with good performance. We continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in 2025. While budgets are still being prioritized to generative AI build-out, where we have a strong position in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving signs for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second half. Our first Intel 18A product, Clearwater Forest, is slated to launch next year and will allow us to accelerate share gains. Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in accelerated computing for the data center and cloud. 
We now expect over $500 million in accelerated revenue in second half of 2024, with increasing momentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO as well as our own expanding supply. In addition, we are finding good traction with the Intel Developer Cloud with customers onboarding with this platform, including Dell and Zeekr, our largest IDC win to date. We are encouraged by our progress but far from satisfied. Lastly, within NEX, the business has stabilized and beat our Q1 targets with channel inventories approaching normal levels and business acceleration expected through the year as a result. We also recently announced our plans for scale up and scale out Ethernet-based AI networking delivered as a discrete NIC and chiplets for AI foundry customers with numerous key providers in the industry and market standardization through the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. 
So that is Intel products, good momentum and a lot for us to build on. Let me turn to Intel Foundry. We are executing on our strategy to drive meaningful improvement in profitability over time. We are obviously not there yet, given the large upfront investment we needed to build out this business. But we always said this was going to be a multiyear plan, and we are right on track with where we expect it to be right now. As we discussed during our webinar at the beginning of the month, the transition from pre-EUV wafers to post-EUV wafers is a powerful tailwind for us. We expect our blended average wafer pricing to grow 3x faster than cost over the decade, driving significant margin expansion. 
In addition, more competitive wafers will allow us to bring home many of the tiles that today are being manufactured at external foundries. Both dynamics are in our control and not dependent on revenue growth and are key elements to drive the business to breakeven, more than doubling our current earnings power at the Intel consolidated level. Of course, more competitive wafers combined with our position as the only company manufacturing with leading-edge wafers outside of Asia, is drawing strong interest from potential external customers. It is important to note that our leadership in advanced packaging creates more value in our wafer technologies and wafer-level assembly, and base die opportunities further fill our factories and extend the useful life of our tools for increased financial returns. 
I am pleased to announce that this quarter, we signed another meaningful customer on Intel 18A, bringing our total to 6. A leader in the aerospace and defense industry, this customer chose Intel Foundry based not only on the process technology benefits of Intel 18A, but also because of their desire to have a secure U.S.-only supply base. Just this week, we were very pleased to announce that the DoD awarded Intel Foundry Phase III of the RAMP-C program, which we are confident will lead to additional federal aerospace and defense customers. 
More broadly, we are seeing growing interest in Intel 18A and we continue to have a strong pipeline of nearly 50 test chips. The near-term interest in Intel Foundry continues to be strongest with advanced packaging, which now includes engagements with nearly every foundry customer in the industry, including 5 design awards. While we are highly focused on improving the near-term profitability of Intel Foundry, it is also important that we keep sight of the long-term opportunity here. 
The foundry market is expected to grow from $110 billion today to $240 billion by 2030, with almost 90% of the growth coming from EUV nodes and advanced packaging. Given this backdrop, we have clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030, building on our EUV High-NA process technology leadership in advanced packaging, manufacturing capacity, our systems expertise and the surge in AI demand. Put it another way, our $15 billion of external revenue embedded in our Intel Foundry target model would represent less than 15% of the leading edge foundry market. It is not a question of if but when Intel Foundry achieves escape velocity. And every day, we are proving to the market that Intel Foundry is a resilient, sustainable and trusted alternative to serve a semi market on a path to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade. 
Let me wrap up by speaking to our All Other category, where our #1 priority is to unlock shareholder value. This quarter, we formally rebranded our Programmable Solutions Group, Altera, an Intel company. We look forward to bringing in a private equity partner this year to help prepare the company for an IPO in the coming years. This puts Altera on a similar path as Mobileye. We are excited about the future of both companies. By providing them with separation and autonomy, we believe we enhance their ability to capitalize on their growth opportunities in their respective market and accelerate their path to create value. Combined with IMS, our mask writing equipment business, we believe these 3 assets represent more than 1/4 of our overall market value today. Along with a solid Intel products franchise and an Intel Foundry business rapidly approaching $100 billion in net tangible assets, we see the opportunity to unlock significant value for our shareholders as we meet our financial commitments, stand up Intel Foundry and drive it to profitability and further leverage our opportunity in AI. So overall, I'll say that there's a lot for us to build on coming out of Q1. We are systematically executing to our strategy, and we are making steady progress. We are maniacally focused on executional excellence and fiscal discipline and we are relentless in our drive to regain process leadership and bring next-generation solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. 
All of this gives me confidence in where we are headed. Yes, we have a lot of hard work in front of us, but we know what we need to do and the payoff will be significant in the end. Semiconductors are the currency that will drive the global economy for decades to come. We are one of 2, maybe 3 companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies and the only one that has Western capacity and R&D, and we will participate in the entire AI market. Quarter-by-quarter, we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. 
With that, let me turn things over to Dave.",2406
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011358.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. 
We delivered solid results in the quarter with revenue finishing in line and gross margin and EPS, again beating guidance. Forward-looking demand signals in our core markets improved at a measured pace through the first quarter, and we expect to deliver full year revenue and EPS growth in 2024, with the pace of revenue growth accelerating in the second half. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year and just above the midpoint of our guidance, with product segments performing in line with expectations. Intel Products delivered 17% year-over-year growth, offset by inventory headwinds impacting Mobileye, Altera and our 5G customers as well as the sunsetting of several noncore lines of business including the traditional packaging business within Intel Foundry. 
These noncore revenue headwinds drove a sequential decline of just over $1 billion, in line with our Q1 guidance. Gross margin was 45.1%, 60 basis points above guidance, and EPS of $0.18 beat guidance by $0.05 on operating spending discipline and strong sell-through of previously reserved inventory. 
Q1 operating cash flow was negative $1.2 billion. Net CapEx was $5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.2 billion and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. We expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted free cash flow, driven by seasonal factors, including timing of annual bonus payments, along with upsides from larger capital offsets expected in the second half. 
As Pat mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting in the new operating segments. The revised structure creates a foundry relationship between manufacturing and our products groups with Intel Products purchasing wafers and services from Intel Foundry at fair market prices. This quarter represents another important step in our transformation, with increased transparency and accountability across all layers of the organization, which is already having a positive impact on decision-making efficiencies and financial discipline. 
As I talk about our results, I'll categorize them between Intel Products, Intel Foundry and All Other, with the All Other category, including the results of Mobileye and Altera. Additional detail can be found in our earnings release and SEC filings. Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The client business grew by more than 30% year-over-year with a strong product portfolio and share position and significantly improved customer inventory levels. The data center and AI business contributed 5% year-over-year growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. 
NEX revenue declined 8% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant declines in the 5G market, partially offset by approximately 10% year-over-year growth in our network and edge markets, which we expect to continue to recover through the year. Intel Products' operating profit expanded by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, better sell-through of reserved inventory and operating spending discipline, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 28% in the quarter. 
Intel foundry revenue was $4.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year on lower back-end services and sample revenue, along with lower IMS tool sales. In addition, wafer volume was modestly higher in the quarter, with ASPs modestly down, driven by pricing for mature nodes. Operating profit declined by approximately $100 million year-over-year, with lower revenue being partially offset by improved factory utilization. 
Op margin declined significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher start-up costs and the conclusion of the traditional packaging business impacting revenue. The foundry P&L will remain challenged through the year, and we expect operating margins to trough in 2024 as start-up costs associated with 5 nodes in 4 years peak and the P&L absorbs an expected increase of roughly $2 billion in depreciation. Beyond 2024, as volume begins to shift toward leadership manufacturing nodes with a competitive cost structure scale improves, including the return of compute tiles to internal process nodes and our efficiency actions begin to flow through the P&L, we expect to see rapid profitability improvement. 
Mobileye revenue of $239 million and an operating loss of $68 million were both down meaningfully year-over-year due to a well-publicized drawdown of iQ customer inventory. Mobileye reiterated full year guidance on their earnings call this morning. With the inventory digestion process on track, financial results are expected to recover quickly. Altera revenue was $342 million, down significantly year-over-year, with results impacted by the industry-wide inventory digestion following supply constraints in 2022 and '23. Altera's $39 million operating loss is a result of lower revenue and spending associated with standing up Altera as a stand-alone company. 
We continue to expect Altera to exit 2024 at a $2 billion revenue run rate as inventory positions normalize. I want to acknowledge the hard work and focused execution across the company to transition our systems and processes to our new reporting structure. We're already seeing the results of the increased transparency catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the company. 
Now turning to our Q2 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the second quarter, with the midpoint aligned to typical seasonal growth. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 43.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.10, all on a non-GAAP basis. We see the client and data center business roughly flat to Q1 results at the low end of seasonal. Q2 client revenue is constrained by wafer-level assembly supply, which is impacting our ability to meet demand for our Core Ultra-based AI PCs. We do expect sequential growth from Mobileye, NEX and foundry services. 
As we look beyond Q2 guidance, we expect growth across all segments in the second half of the year, led by improved demand for general purpose servers from both cloud and enterprise customers and increased core ultra assembly capacity to support a growing PC TAM, driven by enterprise refresh and the AI PC. We should also see accelerating growth from our network and edge businesses, a return to growth for Altera and a meaningful Gaudi ramp in the second half. 
Despite 2024 representing the peak for 5 node and 4-year driven factory start-up costs, we expect roughly 200 basis points of FY '24 gross margin improvement compared to FY '23. Our net capital intensity forecast of mid-30s as a percent of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate remains unchanged. With significant capital offsets expected to land in the second half of the year, we continue to expect approximately neutral 2024 adjusted free cash flow. While first half demand signals have been a bit weaker, Q1 played out largely in line with our expectations. We achieved several important milestones towards our IDM 2.0 vision, and we're participating in a large and growing TAM with encouraging market signals for the second half of the year and into 2025. By capturing margin at both the foundry level and the fabless product level, we have margin stacking advantage unique in the industry. We are 3 years into our transformation, and 2024 represents the steepest part of the climb, with 5 node and 4-year start-up cost peaking and the majority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics. However, as we crest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong wins at our back and a clear path to achieving the mid- and long-term financial targets we laid out earlier this month. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to John.",1231

What was weaker in the near term than you had expected? And much more importantly, it seems like the back half you're going to have double-digit sequential growth in largely both quarters, so that's significantly above seasonal. I know you went through some of the reasons at a high level, but can you dive a little bit deeper into what gives you that level of confidence in the second half ramp?",88

Starting out, so Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just say the market was weaker. You've seen that in a number of others that have commented as well. So I'll say somewhat across the board a bit. We've seen that, cloud customers, enterprise, across geos. So I'll just say a bit weaker demand, right, we'll just say at the low end of seasonality Q1 to Q2 that we saw. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're engaging deeply with our customers today, our OEM partners, and we just see strength across the board, right? 
Part of that is driven by our unique product position, some of it driven by the market characteristics and client, AI PC and a second half Windows upgrade cycle, we believe, underway and Core Ultra is hot. And as we said, even in Q2, we're racing -- we're meeting all of our commitments, but not all of the upside requests that we're seeing from customers. So we see a very strong AI PC outlook in the data center. As we bring in our new products, we're seeing ASPs increase very healthy on our data center products and with products like CR4 that we just went to production with this week on Intel 3, we're seeing improved product position as well for competitiveness. 
We have the $0.5 billion of Gaudi, right? And most of that is second half loaded. And the All Other businesses coming out of inventory positions in Altera and Mobileye and NEX, all of those improved first half to second half as well. And then incremental, I'll just say, Intel Foundry, every quarter from here until the decade and we're seeing improvement in the Intel Foundry. And one by one, we're seeing all of those business improvements both on revenue and margin improvements over time. So we feel very comfortable that the second half outlook is quite strong for the business, a first half a bit weaker, but we think it's very understandable, very explainable, and a second half outlook that will be very comfortable for every business across Intel growing and a lot of momentum as we go into '25.",363

Maybe for Dave, on the gross margin side, nice upside in the first quarter, but the drop in the second quarter is a little bit puzzling with revenues going up. So could you just talk a little bit about that second quarter drop and then the confidence in the rebound in the second half? Is that just revenue driven in the second half? Or what's the key metrics there, please?",72

Thanks, Ross. Maybe start with Q1 because it somewhat explains Q2. We had better sell-through of product. I hadn't even mentioned Meteor Lake strength. That better sell-through was on previously reserved material. And so we just saw some upside in gross margins because of that. We had a little bit more of a flattish plan between Q1 and Q2 in terms of how that would flow through. And so it kind of pulled some of the benefit of gross margin improvement we would have seen in Q2 and kind of pulled it into Q1. So that was part of it. 
The second part is, as we talked about, this year was going to be a heavy year for start-up cost for us. And it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4, that will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins, helping us like, for example, Mobileye, we get good gross margin for Mobileye and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. 
As we look into '25, I think we'll have better gross margins than '25 than we had in '24. So this should be an ongoing story for us on the gross margin front. And as you know, we're driving to get to kind of mid-50s gross margins by the midpoint between now and 2030 and ultimately getting to 60%. Of course, revenue will be part of that. But a lot of that is within our control. It's things like 18A wafer pricing growing at 3x the cost of 18A that will help drive margins. The pull-in of tiles, as Pat mentioned, internally is going to drive better gross margins for us over time. All of what we're doing in terms of resegmenting new businesses to drive better decision-making, that better decision-making will translate into significant cost improvements for us, which should also be a meaningful driver for gross margins over time as well. And of course, as Pat mentioned, we're happy to get the CHIPS announcement out. And of course, that, coupled with what we expect from the EU and the investment tax credit will also be major tailwinds on gross margins over a long-term basis.",432

Pat, can you talk a little bit more about servers in the data center? There was talk of a bottom there in previous discussions. How do you see that kind of going throughout the year in light of your 2Q guidance? And what's the catalyst for the pickup there?",57

Thank you, Ben. And obviously, as we look at our position in the data center, I'll just say we're stabilizing. And with that, we're improving our competitiveness. We also see, as I mentioned in the comments, that the ASPs are going up comfortably as well. So socket fairly stable through the year, but the ASP per socket with increased core count improves our position. And then new products like Sierra Forest or Xeon Gen 6 product, definitely gives us power performance capabilities. So overall, we're seeing a very healthy growth rate, mid-20s as we go through the year. We're also seeing increasing interest in the AI capabilities of Xeon. And we're winning head node positions, and we're seeing pretty extraordinary performance at Vision. 
We talked about the ability to now run 70 billion parameter models directly on Xeon. And these type of capabilities, say, for a lot of enterprise use cases, Xeon is a very strong product. And as we laid out at Vision, the ability for Xeon plus Gaudi to start positioning this open platform for enterprise AI is a very strong position for us. So overall, we feel like we're on a solid trajectory into a market that even though it's been dominated by the gen AI theme as enterprises, our OEMs and ODMs are communicating, there's growth here in servers. And we now have a much better product position, improving ASPs and a better overall positioning in AI for a lot of these use cases where it's Xeon CPU plus GPU and accelerator.",257

Can we just double-click also on Gaudi, $500 million in the back half of the year? I think you previously talked about a couple of billion in the pipeline.

Thanks, Ben. And obviously, pipeline converting into revenue, revenue is much more meaningful and as we said, greater than $500 million for the year, and that's obviously quarter-on-quarter accelerating rapidly, which also gives a great indication for the business in '25 as well. At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their embrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. And I was super pleased to see the breadth of those customers. It was CSPs like Naver and Ola and IBM Cloud. It was ISVs like Zeekr, right, coming on board, but maybe most importantly, enterprise customers. 
And ultimately, gen AI training, okay, creating models, but enterprises are going to use models, and that's where our TCO benefits. The ability for us to action customers' data in their enterprise environment is so powerful and customers like Bosch were coming forward and Roche to be able to demonstrate the true benefits of Gaudi and Xeon plus Gaudi. The road map is in good shape. The Gaudi 3 Falcon Shores in '25. We're also seeing that the industry wants to open alternatives. And we announced our AI networking initiative, Ultra Ethernet Consortium standardizing on scale up and scale out to Ethernet, increasing work for abstract levels of AI development with PyTorch and the embrace of the open platform for enterprise AI that we rolled out. All of those taken together, the industry is looking for open enterprise alternatives for regenerative AI deployment and Intel are quite well positioned, and we're starting to really see that uptake in our Accelerator and Xeon pipeline now.",264

It sounds like you're confirming the time frame for both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. Can you talk about -- is there demand for the Sierra Forest product as well? Do you expect that to be bifurcated where you see demand for both? And then how quickly will you see those products come to volume?,66
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011374.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,19,"Yes. So Sierra Forest, our first Xeon 6 product on Intel 3, and I'm super proud, right? Now we have a leadership process technology back on American soil for the first time in a decade. This is really exciting. And Sierra Forest, high core count, 144, 288 core product, very focused on power, performance, efficiency, and we do see a good pipeline of customers and a good pipeline of, I'll say, socket win backs because the area of power performance has been an area that we've been carrying a deficit, being on an older node. And now that we're on leadership nodes, we definitely see share gains for that. 
Of course, Granite Rapids, which will come in Q3, the Xeon 6 P-Core part is much more the bread and butter of the Xeon family. So we do see that being a stronger element to the portfolio this year as we haven't been participating in the power performance sockets as aggressively lately, and Sierra Forest gives us that tool. So it really is a one-two punch, as we've described. With Granite coming in Q3 and a volume ramp on Intel 3 with that, we feel we have a very good product line. 
Next year is Clearwater Forest, the second generation of the E-core part, the leadership position on 18A in the server market, a very strong product for us, unquestioned leadership and power performance, so I believe that's a great opportunity for us to gain share again in the data center. So the road map is healthy. The execution is strong, and we're rebuilding customer trust. They're looking at us now and saying, ""Oh, Intel is back."" And we're quite excited by that. And then beyond that, building the volume, building the confidence and the momentum for traditional use cases as well as the AI use cases, as I just referred on Ben's question as well.",315

Thank you. On the foundry webinar, you had sort of talked about Intel 3 volume being kind of more of an inflection next year. Does that mean it was in server that these Intel 3 products are sort of get to volume crossover kind of some point next year? Or could we see -- obviously, the leadership you just talked about is important. What's kind of keeping you from getting those products ramping in the second half?",80

And servers always just take a while to ramp. Customers bring them in, they qualify them, they test them because they're generally putting these things at scale. So there's just an adoption cycle for server products. And the numbers that I'm holding my team accountable for are some of the most aggressive volume ramps that we've ever achieved on server products. So we're driving them very hard. That said, in terms of the total wafer volume this year, right, it's dominated by Intel 7. And the Intel 4 and 3 wafer volumes become much more prominent next year, and that's what I was communicating on the webinar. 
But as we go through the year, you're going to start to see the wafer ASPs pick up as a result of Intel 4, 3 ramping at much better ASP points, better margins associated with those, and they will become much more prominent in the foundry P&L next year. But these are production ramps that are already underway on Intel 3. The Intel 4 ramp already underway. We began that second half of last year. So these wafer ramps are underway with volume productions, volume products that we're bringing to the marketplace, very confident in our ability. And then, of course, 18A as we deliver the PDK for that in Q2, the 1.0 PDK and we'll begin the volume ramps on Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake in the first half of next year for those products coming out. So we feel very comfortable with that overall picture that we've laid out. So thank you, Joe.",266

Same as -- it just takes some time for customers to get comfortable, qualify, and bring those products to marketplace. But Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, these are much more competitive power performance products on Intel 3. So we see them stabilizing and then giving us opportunity to regain share. And as we go into next year, we expect that we're regaining share as we end this year and go into next year. These are great products and we're going to be ramping them very aggressively with our customers.",118

And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter, extremely well received. And as I mentioned already, 20-plus customers for Gaudi 2, 3, so we're seeing that build. Obviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture, and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich -- a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PCIe card to it. This use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. Falcon Shores will just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.
We also described customers coming on the Intel Developer Cloud, where we're getting these products very early in their life available for developers and enterprise customers. And customers like Zeekr, now our biggest Intel Developer Cloud win to date, are seeing the benefits. But the bigger story is how do we unleash the data assets of our enterprise customers, and that's things like the open platform for enterprise AI that we launched at Open Summit. So overall, a lot of good things happening to unleash the gen AI cycle for Intel. And of course, right, as we're doing this, AI is a hot market. We're participating across all of our segments, whether that's client, edge, enterprise or our foundry opportunities as well, delivering AI everywhere.",279

You did say it's going to be better next year, but it is really whipping around a lot. And it looks like you sort of have to exit this year at 48 or maybe a little higher, which is already well above the 45.5 that you'll be at this year because you're guiding it up to 100 basis points. So I know you don't want to guide next year, but if you can even qualitatively help us, can you sustain those margins at that level? And I asked because last year, you sort of exited at 49% and then things crashed here during the first half of the year. So can you help us just think about what some of the puts and takes will be next year off of that high base if you're going to exit this year at?",150

So there will be additional start-up costs next year. We do think it on a percent of revenue basis, it will be lower. So that should help lift the margins. Of course, the expectation would be we see growth in revenue. That also should help. On top of that, we already are seeing good decision-making and changing decision-making around how we operate now under this new different business structure that we have at this point. A lot of that stuff doesn't actually show up in the P&L. We have all these decisions get made this year, but a lot of the decisions made -- sorry, a lot of the benefits to those decisions don't show up until next year and the year after. So we should see some benefit from that as well. 
The other thing that kind of has whipped this -- our margins around a bit over the last few years has been this notion where we reserve material all the way up until the PRQ Pat just mentioned that Sierra Forest just PRQ-ed. So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it will be more a function of revenue growth spending profile in the fabs, start-up costs that we have and the mix.",246

So I want to ask about server CPU share. March -- I think the assumption for March was that service share was going to be pretty flat. So the question is, was that the case? And it sounds -- you sound maybe a little bit less optimistic, if I'm sort of reading between the lines, on share into the back half of the year, just given how long it takes these things to sort of impact your share. So your bullish outlook in the second half of the year, it sounds like it's more market-driven versus share driven. Can you just clarify that?",108

That said, products are good, right? We came into the year improving our market share position in the first quarter of the year. It does take time to ramp these new products. But better products, rebuilding trust with our customers that we're delivering on these and now hitting the, what we would call the early end of the cycles on these new products is giving us a lot of interest with the market and the customer. New use cases also demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Granite Rapids at our Vision event, all of these just make us more and more confident in our business execution. 
We're also seeing that we don't need SoC account to increase. The ASPs are going up with the core counts on our new leadership products as well. So all of those in a fairly optimistic view that we're getting from our OEMs and our channel partners for their view of upgrade cycles, building momentum from customers across the industry. 
We feel very comfortable that we're stabilizing our position. We have been improving our road map, and we do expect to see share gains as we end the year and go into '25.",229

I think, Pat, you mentioned something about supply constraints impacting your 2Q outlook. If you could provide some color as to what's causing those supply constraints and when do you expect those to ease as we, I guess, go into the second half. And then in terms of your AI PCs, I think you've been talking about $40 million or so potentially shipping this year. Could you maybe put that into some context as to how it actually helps Intel? Is it just higher ASPs? Is it higher margin? I would think that these products also come with higher costs. I just want to understand how we should think about the benefit to Intel as these AI PCs ramp?",126

And overall, as we've seen, this is a hot product. The AI PC category, and we declared this as we finished last year, and we've just been incrementing up our AI PC or the Core Ultra product volumes throughout. We're meeting our customer commitments that we've had, but they've come back and asked for upside on multiple occasions across different submarkets. And we are racing to catch up to those upside request, and the constraint has been on the back end. Wafer-level assembly, one of the new capabilities that are part of Meteor Lake and our subsequent client products. So with that, we're working to catch up and build more wafer-level assembly capacity to meet those. 
How does it help us? Hey, it's a new category. And that new category of products will generally be at higher ASPs as your question suggests. But we also think it's new use cases, and new use cases over time create a larger TAM. It creates an upgrade cycle that we're seeing. It creates new applications, and we're seeing essentially every ISV AI-ing their app, whether it's the communications capabilities of Zoom and team for translation and contextualization, whether it's new security capabilities with CrowdStrike and others finding new ways to do security on the client or it's way other creators and gamers taking advantage of this. 
So we see that every PC is going to become an AI PC over time. And when you have that kind of cycle underway, Srini, everybody starts to say, ""Oh, how do I upgrade my platform?"" And we even demonstrated how we're using AI PC in the Intel factories now to improve yields and performance inside of our own factories. And as I've described it, it's like a Centrino moment, right, where Centrino ushered in WiFi at scale. We see the AI PC ushering in these new use cases at scale, and that's going to be great for the industry. But as the unquestioned market leader, right, the leader in the category creation, we think we're going to differentially benefit from the emergence of the AI PC.",353

And also in NEX, the AI networking products are strong, our IPU products, we're seeing strength in that area. So it's inventory as well as products. Even though, as your question suggests, the communication sector and the service providers, that is weaker through the year, but pretty much every aspect of their business in edge AI, as Dave said, is seeing strength as we go into the second half of the year and into '25.",76

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011400.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,45,"Pat, just a conceptual question. In a gen AI server with accelerators, how important is the role of a specific CPU? Or is it easily interchangeable between yours or AMD's or ARM's? I guess the question is that if most of the workload is being done on the accelerator, does it really matter which CPU I use? And can that move towards gen AI servers, essentially shrink the TAM for x86 server CPUs, because a number of your cloud customers have announced ARM-based server alternatives. So I'm just curious, how do you think about that conversion over to gen AI and what that means for x86 server CPU TAM going forward?",111
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011401.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,46,"Yes. Thanks, Vivek. And we spoke at our Vision event about use cases like RAG, retrievable augmented generation, where the LLMs might run on an accelerator, but all of the real-time data, all of the databases, all of the embedding is running on the CPU. So you're seeing all of these data environments, which are already running on Xeon and x86 being augmented with AI capabilities to feed an LLM. And I believe this whole area of RAG becomes one of the primary use cases for enterprise AI. And if you think about it, an LLM might be trained with 1-, 2-year old data, right? But many of the business processes and environment are real time, right? 
You're not going to be retraining constantly. And that's where this area of the front-end database becomes very prominent. All of those databases run on x86 today. All of them are being enhanced for use cases like RAG. And that's why we see this unlock occurring because the data sits on-prem, the data sits in the x86 database environments that are all being enhanced against these use cases. And as we've shown, we don't need accelerators in some cases. We can run a 70 billion parameter model natively on Xeon with extraordinary TCO value for customers. And furthermore, all of the IT environments that enterprises run today, they have the security, they have the networking, they have the management technologies in place. 
They don't need to upgrade or change those from any of those use cases. So we see a lot of opportunity here to build on the enterprise asset that we have with the Xeon franchise, but we're also going to be aggressively augmenting that. And we're commonly the head node, even when it's other accelerators are being used or other GPU is being used. And as we've described, Xeon plus Gaudi, we think is going to be a very powerful opportunity for enterprises. 
So in many of those cases, we see this as a market lift, new applications, new use cases, new energy coming to the enterprise AI. Here we are in year 23 of the cloud, and while 60% of the workload has moved to the cloud, over 80% of the data remains on-prem under the control of the enterprise, much of that underutilized in businesses today. That's what gen AI is going to unlock. And a lot of that is going to happen through the x86 CPU and we see a powerful cycle emerging. And I would just point you back to what we described at Vision. This was a great event and many customers are seeing that value today.",441

Maybe one for Dave on the potential operating loss, kind of how do we model that for the foundry business. So let's say, if I exclude the $2 billion in depreciation headwind, which I'm assuming is almost all going to your foundry business. What is the right way, Dave, to think about foundry operating income or loss this year? And how much of external foundry revenue are you expecting this year?",74

The operating losses will pick up. We roughly were at like 2-, 4-ish in the first quarter. It will pick up in the second quarter, given the start-up costs are increasing and I would say, be roughly in that range for the remainder of the year. And then what I said before is we see that improving then going into '25. And Pat's given me the order, he wants to see every quarter some improvement in the operating loss ultimately to get to breakeven midway through the point between now and 2030. And I think that is very achievable. Sorry, Vivek, what was the second question?",109

Pat, one question I've been getting from some folks, and I totally understand the lead times of starting some of these programs to put increased tile volume at external foundry, but you guys have made the progress on the 5 nodes in 4 years, as you highlighted multiple times. Is there any flex at all to bring back some of that external volume earlier? And I think it matters to some folks because it's a demonstration of you guys being able to ramp your own product to volume and to yield and to economics on 18A, which might give some indication to some external customers that are looking at your foundry business. So just any flex at all to pull that timeline in of sort of reshoring some of the external tiles?",133
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011410.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,55,"Yes. Thanks, Matt. And largely, those decisions are made when the product decisions are made. So there's limited flexibility to move them around. And if you pick a process node for a certain tile, generally, that's the process node that it's on. So there's limited flexibility there. And many of those decisions, as we've highlighted before, Matt were literally made years ago, right? And those choices were made. 
That said, we see the peak of our external tiles being this year and next year. And then the road map and the movement of those coming back begins to quite accelerate, even starting late next year. So the plan is clearly laid out. As we said, we see a couple of fabs' worth of capacity coming back into the Intel factory network as we move into '26 and beyond. So this becomes a significant driver. 
We've also driven significant road map decisions against that improving profile of our products. And I'll say that begins in a very powerful way next year with Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Unquestioned, the best products in clients, the best products in server are now being built on Intel 18A. And as the question suggests, we see customers seeing that. Every foundry customer that we speak to, right, understanding where we are in our product and process cycle and the ability for them to essentially benefit from Intel as customer 0 in the foundry network. 
So overall, this is feeling very good. We're on track to go accomplish that and the business model that we've laid out and Dave and I presented as we go through the decade shows a very healthy improvement in wafer ASP, wafer volume, foundry and these decisions are made, right? We're on track to both have the wafer foundry capabilities, have the process technology and the products to fill those factories. And that's why Dave and I have such confidence in the business model that we've laid out and the improvements that it will deliver as we go over the next several years together.",343

Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the AI accelerator road map. So you guys have Gaudi 3 that you talked about and Falcon Shores coming next year. And the hardware looks quite good. I wanted to ask a question about the software that goes on top of that for both -- well, really for inference but also for training. How do you feel about the software road map that you guys have in the AI space going forward? And how much compatibility, or uniqueness rather, is there to the software that runs on Gaudi 3 versus what will come on Falcon Shores and the forward road map?",112
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3905.0,3098069.0,112011413.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,58,"Yes. Maybe 3 different points there. The first one is for inferencing, you need a whole lot less software compatibility, right? And as the market is more focused on inferencing going forward, if you can run the models, right, in the context of the databases and the other, so that portends and that's why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing right now, Matt, in these use cases. And clearly, some of the software compatibility issues of a GPU have led to the training environments that have been challenging for us. But now as customers get much more focused on enterprise use cases, inferencing TCO, we're finding a lot of strength in the offerings that we have. And as we've matured a number of customers now, we've worked through many of those use cases and getting quite a lot of acceptance of the software stack that we have with Gaudi 2 and 3. 
We will have a very smooth and seamless upgrade from Gaudi 3 into Falcon Shores. But the powerful thing that will come with Falcon Shores is the full programmability that you'll see with the complete instruction set capabilities of Falcon Shores. And at that point, we will have no deficits for any of the use cases and much greater compatibility for the full range of AI capabilities. 
The other thing that I emphasize is Xeon is a powerful capability with incredible programmable capabilities and we're finding these use cases like I described with the open platform for enterprise AI, RAG use cases is clearly beneficial there for us. So overall, we're feeling like the software story is coming together very nicely. And the entire industry is moving to higher level software abstraction such as Python and Triton. So they're moving away from any of these dependencies to an open software or platform. So the industry trends are in the right direction. Our maturity is in the right direction, and our software stack has gotten much more mature, and we'll have a very smooth upgrade to Falcon Shores. 
So let me just close our time together and say thank you for the questions. Thanks for joining our call. We appreciate the update to give you on a very solid Q1. And we got a lot done in Q1 that gives us a great foundation for the future. We continue to drive our process and products and AI innovations and delivering on our process technology and leadership road map. If any of you were at COMPUTEX in a few months, I look forward to seeing you there. We have a number of products and offerings that we'll be announcing there as we continue our AI momentum and competitiveness. And as always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process road maps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. 
For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations, due in part by our decision to more quickly ran Core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments. 
We previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AIPC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AIPC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate and extend our leadership and drive significant benefits in the years to come. 
Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in second half '25. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performance and cost competitive process, which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in-house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. 
Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost reduction plan we announced today. This plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model, which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. 
Having separate financial reporting for Intel products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company. It also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. 
As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and head count beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a head count reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025 with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family. These are hard but necessary decisions. 
Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx target at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates. We expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy. 
Our new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 billion and $27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. 
Combined with strong execution of our Smart Capital strategy, including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion to $14 billion. Increased capital efficiency as a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly $1 billion of savings and nonvariable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. 
We designed our Smart Capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trend line growth while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost effectively capture upside when it comes. 
We are taking the avid step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. We reiterate our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improved to sustainably higher levels. 
Reductions across OpEx, CapEx and cost of sales totaled well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long-term strategy. 
We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. 
While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digesting in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. 
As we look at the Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter-on-quarter. With improved client inventory levels exiting Q3, we see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range. 
Let me now provide more details by our key business units, starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive Five Nodes In 4 Years march, and the finish line is officially within sight we are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3 and Intel 28A is being ready for production next quarter. 
And Intel 18A, we released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year with production wafer start volumes in the first half of '25. [indiscernible] for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use  RibbonFET, PowerVia and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. 
Clearwater Forest for server, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities is booted and likewise, looking very healthy. These are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market. Importantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in 4 years completing an historic pace of design and process innovation and returning Intel to process leadership. 
Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started. And once we do, we will unlock further growth and value creation across our foundry and product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading-edge capacity continues to weigh on near-term profitability. But long term, they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024 and then driving the breakeven. 
To help accelerate our Foundry services business, Kevin has led large Foundry and established businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running by spending considerable time with current and future Foundry customers as we ramp our process packaging and chipset capabilities for the AI era. 
We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our Foundry manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. 
Overall, our Foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners. In Q2, Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge advanced packaging technology. EMIB makes it possible to cost effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. 
These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A sites, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well on our way on Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation in our process road map, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D and capital spending requirements. 
Let's now turn to Intel products. and our largest and most profitable business, CCG, we continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our road map. The AIPC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience and Intel is at the forefront of this category creating moment. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. 
We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AIPC since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AIPCs by year-end and over 100 million accumulative by the end of 2025. 
Lunar Lake, our next-generation AIPC, which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh. Lunar Lake delivered superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3x more tasks gen-on-gen with our enhanced NPU that will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. 
Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot Plus PCs across more than 20 OEMs, which we'll begin to ship this quarter. Lunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong road map over the next 18 months. 
Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation on which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeon's powering data centers around the world today. And our road map is designed to build upon this fast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible and scalable and reduce total cost of ownership for customers. 
We took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-cores processors formerly code-named Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high-density scale-out workloads, that drives performance power down and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-cores, code-named Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and we'll begin shipping this quarter. 
Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product feature our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power on and is on track to launch in 2025. 
As we reestablished Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in the AI servers. We are also focused on improving our accelerator road map. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility and value that is very compelling to customers. particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable, cost-effective GenAI solutions. 
Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks and reference designs, combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or open platform for enterprise AI, are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerated performance to the next level, at just 2/3 of the cost of competitive offerings. 
To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2x performance per dollar in both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support, including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, Gigabyte and Vantec, Quanta Cloud Technology and Wistron. 
Turning to NEX. We continue to see stability in Q2 while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI-optimized scale-out ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI network interface card and foundry chiplets, which we'll launch next year. 
Our recent IPO adapter for the enterprise, supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat, broadens access to the solution codeveloped with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low-latency communication for scale-up AI systems, communication and data centers. Combined with the growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. 
Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year-end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate, focus and resources to realize their growth opportunities that execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders, similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye 2 years ago and IMS last year. 
Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying it has been a hard thought first half of the year. We have achieved several important milestones and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus on renewed intensity to up our game and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Dave.",2481
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3961.0,3209460.0,114276649.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1 point year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel products and Intel Foundry, both delivered 4% year-over-year growth, offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses. Profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations, with Q2 gross margin of 38.7% and EPS of $0.02.
Weaker-than-expected gross margin was due to 3 main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AIPC product. In addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 Core Ultra shipments, we made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and 3 gross margin long term as we scale up the Ireland fab.
Margins were also impacted by higher than typical period charges related to noncore businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected.
Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital. Gross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion. Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year. The client business grew 9% year-over-year as the AIPC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs, partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter.
DCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down 3 points year-over-year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. Though excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market, NEX delivered 10% year-over-year growth in the first half.
Q2 operating profit for Intel products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue and up approximately $400 million year-over-year on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes Intel 4 and 3. Foundry Services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base, including the start of advanced packaging revenue.
Foundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3 with more than 85% of wafer volumes still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power performance and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and start-up cost to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability.
Mobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to nonrecurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion, and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many Western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half.
Altera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially, with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double-digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns.
Now turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3 with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets.
With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter. We expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially, with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes.
While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AIPC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the third quarter. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03 all on a non-GAAP basis.
As Pat discussed earlier, lower-than-anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response. These actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance.
Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently. Additionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 million to $27 billion, with a net capital spending of $11 billion to $13 billion, including our SCIP programs.
These adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges necessary to achieve our spending targets.
In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 billion to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage.
Before I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple of items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from Street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within nonvariable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion. While that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall-through for gross margin next year.
The AIPC is a big winner for the company, and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We, therefore, intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the product is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year.
The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on 18A and has a much improved cost structure. As the momentum of AIPC drives Panther Lake demand, together with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion in subsequent years.
Lastly, the noncontrolled income from Mobileye, Altera and IMS and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners show up on a line below net income called noncontrolling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years.
In closing, the market has not recovered as expected and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting '25 spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions, while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results, leveraging our new operating model.
We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model of 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade.
I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.",1525

I'm just wondering have the core issues been accurately diagnosed? Because when we look at your CPU competitor, they appear to be doing much better in the same environment. So I'm curious what is Plan B if just cost cuts don't do the job?",59
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3961.0,3209460.0,114276653.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,7,"Yes. Thank you, Vivek. To start out, I would say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration and rebuilding plan is now well underway with 18A, PDK 1.0, with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered on, our GEO footprint now starting to take shape, and we have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on Phase 2, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace. And we're just now getting to competitiveness.
But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long-term journey. I'd say just rebuilding that we're underway. This is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors 4 decades ago.
We firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building 2 world-class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise, as we could describe it, is building a world-class Intel Foundry and building a world-class Intel Products group. These efforts, we believe, have identified many opportunities for us to have financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today. And we believe that with the new products a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation that we see the long-term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders.",249

I think in the past, you had suggested about $15 billion in long-term value from external Foundry. Is there any impact on those growth targets because of the restructuring actions? Just what changes with these restructuring actions?",69
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3961.0,3209460.0,114276656.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally, we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The chips grants -- taking your questions sort of one by one. On the chip side, these are milestone-based investments we still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the chips model that we've put in place. We've worked closely with the CHIPS program office in the U.S. government. We're very comfortable on those plans.
Also, the Foundry, we're seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities. So the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to.
Obviously, with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving just like a road class foundry nodes to be much more efficient with our capital investments. and scrutinizing them more carefully. And now that we've paid the capital to catch up. In our view this catch-up capital, we had no spare capacity. We had no site ahead, shelf ahead. We had no capacity to catch up as those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well at the Foundry commitments that we have in place.
Finally, I'll just say again, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments up and down appropriately, and we've now established a model with our Smart Capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we set for our strategy on track, and we're now moving into Phase 2 of the execution of that strategy.",352

And Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro realities, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera. But it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, the long-term $100 billion target that -- you just saw weren't happening, and therefore, felt these cuts were necessary. So do any of the structural changes? Or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?",132

Let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis, concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world-class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world-class foundries, and that's what Intel Foundry is going to going to become. And that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively. And every aspect of that business is being analyzed. And -- how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots and everything like that. So a clean sheet analysis.
Similarly on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world-class fabless company look like? We've uncovered quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world-class fabless company. And these are significant structural steps.
We also realize that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency. We were built for leadership. And now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the 4 business areas: client, networking and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future. And similarly, the portfolio over Intel Foundry business. And that's the work that we've now been undertaking. And we're now accelerating based on the less-than-expected quarterly results, we're accelerating those impacts.
We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year.
In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. 
We believe the long-term guide that we've given you, the 60-40 getting to the Foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've set those are larger portions of our business. We believe those are long term still achievable in that regard, and we're on track for many of those things and the models that we're laying out and today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those.",442

Dave, you went through with good details the cost structure and what would change the puts and takes for next year? I wondered -- I know you're not going to guide to 2025 revenue. But the puts and takes from maybe a competitive positioning point of view, how you're feeling in CCG, DCAI primarily relative to the competition? Any sort of tailwind, headwind analysis or description for '25 would be helpful?",74

On the client side, obviously, we feel very good, given our AIPC position. We're leading that new product category. And I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake and the performance of that. So that looks like a phenomenally good product and position.
We're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center, and that's only going to grow as we go into next year. The big question is when does the kind of traditional CPU market recover? It has been tempered this year and of course, affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. That's obviously been a soft space, and so we'll have to see how that plays out.
And then NEX obviously, also outside of the telco space is starting to recover. And then we have these other businesses, Altera is starting to recover now. So we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them. And we have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately. 
I think on the margin front, I talked about our kind of tempered view of gross margins next year, given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which with memory and package and almost all of the material getting sourced outside and they're seeing -- we're seeing inflation in that space. That is impacting it. But that part is followed by Panther Lake. That comes back into the fab. 
And I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is, kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of that capacity that we had to move into the external sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of profitability. 
And then, of course, we've done a lot, as Pat talked about in terms of restructuring the business, and those will start to show up next year, but we'll be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out, both in the kind of medium term and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And we do get the growth, it puts us in an even better position.",399

I was hoping you could perhaps speak to how to think about gross margins beyond '25. It's obviously very hard to offer the leverage when you're investing in both foundry capacity and at the same time, outsourcing meaningful tiles to TSM. So encouraging that you're bringing Panther Lake back in-house, how should we think about incremental margins there? And any of the other kind of moving parts that you've been speaking about on this call, including the unfavorable product mix and the more competitive pricing? Is that just a near-term kind of phenomenon or something else we should be thinking about into '25, '26?",113
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3961.0,3209460.0,114276665.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,19,"Yes. Yes. So as I talked about to Ross, C.J., the good news for '26 for us is that, that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles. And so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term, become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of less of a headwind for us. So that will also be helpful.
And then like I said, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way, both from the actions we've taken today about the new operating model. And decisions will get made on a go-forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward. I think '26 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out.
I think from a mix perspective, it's probably not going to be a big headwind or a tailwind for us, just strict mix other than as we move towards more leading-edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will be one factor that will certainly help us. It also -- in that regard, that also helps us on the pricing side because, obviously, from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers.
And then ultimately, I think on pricing, it will really come down to when we have a competitive process, and we have competitive products running on a competitive process, and we're delivering what the customers want. That helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic. And we're getting to the place as Pat talked about, where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through the next few years.",353

With Panther Lake already powered on, right, is showing good health, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year, right? So we'll start to see some of those benefits. But obviously, the huge volume benefits of that really are in '26, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process with a more competitive product with Panther Lake, offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring tiles home with a more competitive product and a more competitive process. And that really is, I'll say, the story that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year.",132

And obviously, Sierra Forest, right, E-core product, very efficient but a new category for us. So we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback very positive. As we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it, but it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the P-core, I'll say the more traditional Xeon for us, and we'll start that ramp this quarter. But it will take anything in the server market, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer-term cycle for that.
But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI build-out, as you know. So in this environment, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint. So we're having to fight to win those socket back, but Granite Rapids looks very positive.
The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design, 18A, this level of health, this early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-core version of that on 18A is also showing a very good, not in fab yet, but showing a very good design progress. So we feel like the road map gets more competitive. And with it, we believe our market share position is fairly, I'll say, static, right?
Year-on-year, we do see that overall, the -- our market share is more modest in the second half this year, so the x86 share, and we're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe, as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged, and we're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, including ours. So a lot of things to unpack there, but we do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products and the road map only improves from here.",370

Just on the notion that AI is kind of slowing some of the focus from server, it seems like we would be looking at a ceiling in overall power budgets in a couple of years. That would mean we need to invest in traditional server ecosystems and maybe do a significant refresh. Do you see any indications of that? And given that -- I perceive you guys are sort of stronger in enterprise than cloud right now? Like how are you positioned to take advantage of that when it does come?",92

Thanks, Joe. And we do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us. And we do have some early indications of positive cycle there. But I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications, but we are starting to see, I'll say, better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. 
Similarly, for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place, the TCO benefits of a server refresh now as we start talking about 3x, 4x consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional, right, to cloud environments there, container delivery environments. These are quite substantial. 
So we do believe that as our products get to be more competitive, right, and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, that the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course, the story is CPU plus GPU, right? And that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously, as Gaudi 3 starts shipping, the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building towards.",223

So can you just explain again, I'm not sure I understand why that was such a big...",78

That was the biggest one. I'll just say that there were a couple of other things that we had to do some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower, that did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake, Intel 3 and even run production on Intel 4 -- or sorry, Intel 4 and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab.
We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice essentially. And it starts to mature the Intel 4 and 3 processes in Ireland more quickly.
The downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now. And so we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system and that puts pressure on the margins. That's going to carry into next quarter. I mean we will do better in next quarter, obviously, but we're going to do more volume and the margins will be below the corporate average because of because while we're improving the wafer cost, it's not -- still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. 
And so we'll weigh down on margins for the third quarter as well. After that, we started -- it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better and the situation on Meteor Lake will improve meaningfully.",276

I guess my question is how you sort of execute on the plan with this lower CapEx? I mean, kind of on one hand, we keep talking about bringing all these wafers back in-house to help gross margin in 2026. But I also hear about a lot more outsourcing to TSMC even in real time. So is the cut more that -- some of your family customers are maybe structurally deciding that they're not as committed. I'm just trying to understand how you can cut CapEx and still execute on the foundry strategy?",106

And at the highest level, the foundry strategy, unchanged. And we've built capacity corridor for Foundry customers. However, until we have admitted orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shelves and the sites that we have in place. .
And how much of that corridor we keep available, how much flexibility working with our equipment suppliers that we need for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. We also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecast.
So all of those, I'd say, are adjustments. The big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build-out, right? And as you think about what we had to catch up, we had no EUV capacity. We had no shell ahead, side ahead capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home as those come into place, we've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years.
And now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in '24, '25 and '26. So we're putting much more aggressive view of capital utilization, right, how much capital require ahead of working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars, just like a Foundry does. And for that, we'll point you back to, again, right? We're going to be a world-class fabless company, Intel Products. We're going to be a world-class foundry with Intel Foundry.
The last point I'd make here on this is, a lot of the early success that we're having with foundry customers is advanced packaging. And there, the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there customers and advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity, but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have as -- and we've described before, is the on-ramp for Intel Foundry, and that's continuing to look very good.
The final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, right, to the first order, the Intel product requirements. And clearly, as a lot of tiles externally in '25, we bring those home in '26. That's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, you'll see the benefits of the model that we've put in place tiles coming home, leadership process technology, leadership products, starts in '25, deliver big time in '26 and beyond.",427

So I think the best way to think about it is we were, I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin to take into account revenue was part of it. It was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-off rate related to legacy businesses and the mix and underutilization also affected it, and it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. 
And that will be the case in the third quarter, probably given the increase, I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter. Beyond that, it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's actually not going to be a headwind.",139

Lunar Lake has the memory in the package. So we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins. And additionally, it's got more the content sourced externally. 
And as you know, we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of the hint -- meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel Products margins, which is why we're tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel Foundry side. It's going to be tempered on the product side, and it's really going to be because of Lunar Lake.",161

As we move the Intel 43 capacity into Ireland. It also gives our TD team more focused on their capital on 18A as well as then 14A and 10A. We're taking, for instance, the second High-NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A.
So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AIPC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision in optimizing the use of our TD resources for the next-generation technologies, which are already well underway and showing good early indicators.",109

One is for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly, that's our operating objective that we have. But as we said, '26 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, the new process technologies. 
So I'd say that '27 time frame is still a good one. But you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability and the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus, right, will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel Foundry, $10 billion next year is a big number. And we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry forward in '26. Dave said an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive.

I think, Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double digits, or I think they mentioned above seasonal, however you quantify seasonal now. Maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of maybe noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market, I think that impact would be more modest relative to what you described. But if you could kind of give us puts and takes there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for in September?",112

I'll take that, Matt. And we feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AIPC. We have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell-in and sell-through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given some inventory sell-through in the third quarter above seasonal in Q4.
Overall, the TAM expansion is low single digit, even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AIPC and further TAM expansion as we go into '25 is expected now broadly. We'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our vPro assets, and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. 
We also saw, things like vPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike blue screen period and customers who -- our vPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on vPro, took weeks to recover from that. So a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem, the leadership that we have on AIPC. And as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So I think we're very comfortable and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes.",246

Thanks, John. I wanted to ask you, I think in some of the prepared script that maybe early in the Q&A, Pat, you kind of reiterated the $15 billion funnel for the foundry business. And I know in the medium term, a lot of that is packaging. But I wanted to ask about the customers that you've engaged with on 18A and maybe early on 14A, how have you seen the Gantt charts of the programs that they're planning to bring into your foundry progress in the last few quarters? 
Are people still committed to ramping those things? Are they taking PDKs and maybe doing tape-ins? Are things moving forward? Have you seen any acceleration. Have you seen hesitation or maybe wait and see from those customers? I'm just trying to figure out how that stuff is progressing on 18A?",143

Let me just clarify, the $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deals, right? So this isn't pipeline, this is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that, Matt, because I think your question suggests that the pipeline. There's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging, and we're seeing a significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. 
On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK, right? And now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future. But this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips coming based on the PDK that we've just released. So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area. And I'd say we do believe that we'll have further updates there.
But as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there, given the supply base and the traditional operation of the foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter, more updates to come.
Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap this up. Thank you for joining our call. We appreciate the time as always. And I'd say in a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up, where we'll have some further updates.
I want to reiterate in a quarter like this, that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved of this phase, but now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we rightsize, we rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success.
