21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026789.0,Presenter Speech,Paul Otellini,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. In 2012, Intel generated almost $1 billion of net income every month. This was in an environment of relatively soft PC demand and weak macroeconomic conditions. From a product perspective, 2012 was a year of significant transitions in our markets and a year of important milestones for Intel. I'd like to take a moment to recap a few of the most significant developments.
The Data Center Group saw a comprehensive refresh across its product line last year. Romley brought the Sandy Bridge architecture to servers for the first time, while the launches of Knights Corner and Centrogen in the fourth quarter expanded the range of DCG solutions from teraflops to a few watts. Knights Corner, or Xeon 5, brings 60 cores in the familiar Intel architecture programming model to supercomputing applications. 
At 6 watts, Centrogen is the industry's only low-power microserver SoC that delivers critical enterprise features like 64-bit, ECC and virtualization. Over the last 12 months, we also worked with our industry partners to bring Ultrabooks to the mainstream, ramping from roughly 20 designs to more than 140. At CES last week, I was struck by our industry's renewed inventiveness. PC manufacturers are embracing innovation as we are in the midst of a radical transformation of the computing experience with the blurring of form factors and the adoption of new user interfaces. It's no longer necessary to choose between a PC and a tablet. Convertibles and detachables, combined with Windows 8 and touch, provide a 2 for 1 no-compromise computing experience.
Ultrabooks have also served to accelerate the trend towards thinner and lighter notebooks. For example, the volume of systems less than 1 inch thin grew 18 fold last year in the U.S., and we expect to see the same trend continue around the world.
Last quarter, our customers also began shipping tablets based upon our Clover Trail SoC and Windows 8. These systems boast up to 10 hours of battery life, 3 weeks of Connected Standby and come in a range of sleek, ultralight form factors, all while bringing the benefits of software compatibility with the millions of Windows applications written for Intel architecture. There are now 10 Clover Trail tablets shipping today with several more launching in the coming months.
2012 was a milestone year for Intel architecture in smartphones with our customers now shipping 7 devices across 20 countries. These phones use our 32-nanometer Medfield SoC and are extremely competitive with the best ARM designs on performance and equal or better power and battery life. We saw the introduction of our 22-nanometer manufacturing process, and along with it, a revolutionary new tri-gate or 3-D transistor technology. 22-nanometer products represented more than 1/2 of our volume in the fourth quarter as the rest of industry works to ship its very first tri-gate designs.
In July, we announced an important strategic relationship with ASML which, combined with our process technology expertise, will accelerate deployment of EUV and 450-millimeter technologies, helping to ensure the future of Moore's Law and our growing manufacturing leadership.
Looking ahead to 2013, I'm excited about the strong pipeline of products we have coming to market. In the first half of this year, we will launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable breakthrough innovations in form factor, battery life and usability. It will deliver the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel's history, and is inspiring a new wave of ultra-sleek, convertible, touch-based designs across our customer base.
Later this year, we will ship 22-nanometer versions of our Xeon and Atom products for the Data Center, bringing the power, performance and efficiency benefits of 3-D transistor technology to our entire Data Center product line.
In 2013, we'll also begin to deliver the industry's first 22-nanometer tablet and smartphone SoCs to OEMs. We are now shipping our single-mode data LTE baseband to customers, and over the course of the year, we'll begin delivering multi-mode data and voice modems to customers, giving us a full complement of competitive technologies to grow our device business. Last, but not least, we will begin our transition to 14 nanometers as we begin the world's first 14-nanometer products towards the end of this year.
We see the industry in a period of transition and hyper innovation. We are well-positioned to take advantage of these trends across the spectrum of computing from the lowest power portable devices to the most powerful Data Center servers and everywhere in between. 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",770
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026790.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. The fourth quarter came in consistent with our expectations. For 2012, although our financial results were below our expectations entering the year, we launched leadership products in every major business segment, and we extended our manufacturing leadership. 
In 2012, revenue was $53.3 billion, gross margin was 62%, operating income was $14.6 billion, net income was $11 billion, and earnings per share was $2.13.
For the year, the business continued to generate significant cash, with almost $19 billion of cash from operations. We increased the dividend per share by 7%, resulting in over $4 billion in dividends paid and repurchased roughly $5 billion of stock. We continue to invest in our manufacturing leadership. We purchased $11 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories and made a $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML.
Lastly, we took advantage of record-low interest rates and borrowed $6 billion. Total cash investments ended the year at roughly $18 billion, up approximately $3 billion from a year ago. Revenue of $53.3 billion was down 1% from a year ago and below the expectations we had at the start of the year. Worldwide GDP growth was significantly less than we had thought entering the year, and the PC market segment was impacted by the growth of tablets. 
Our PC Client Group was down 3% from a year ago. The Data Center Group grew 6% year-over-year as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the Internet cloud segment of our business was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise server market.
Gross margin of 62% in 2012 was flat to 2011 and at the high-end of our historical range for the third year in a row. Our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continue to pay off through leadership products and a highly responsive factory network.
We invested over $10 billion in research and development in 2012, up almost $2 billion from a year ago. The increase was driven by investments in Ultrabooks, the Data Center, phones and tablets. In addition we made investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership. Spending as a percentage of revenue was 34%.
Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.5 billion, in line with our expectations. We believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in the fourth quarter as customers reduced inventory of older-generation PCs.
Gross margin of 58% was up 1 point from expectations and down 5 points from the third quarter. The drop from the third quarter was driven primarily by excess capacity charges as a result of the aggressive tactical actions we took to reduce inventory levels and to redirect space and equipment to 14-nanometer. Our inventories decreased almost $600 million from the third quarter as a result of these actions.
Separately, we started production on our next-generation micro architecture product, code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale this quarter. This production prior to qualification for sale resulted in an increase in inventory write-offs.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion with earnings per share of $0.48. As we look forward to the first quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.7 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be flat at 58% as the impact of higher factory start-up costs and lower volumes are offset by lower excess capacity charges and the qualification for sale of Haswell.
Turning to 2013, we are planning for revenue growth in the low-single digits and forecasting the mid-point of our gross margin range at 60%. Capital spending for our core business is expected to be roughly flat to 2012. Additionally, we will spend roughly $2 billion to start building our first 450-millimeter development facility. 
We are forecasting spending for the year at $18.9 billion, a $700 million increase from 2012. This is the full year impact of the increase to investments in R&D that occurred in 2012 and annual salary increases for 2013.
As a result of the significant progress we made in 2012 across all of our product lines, I enter 2013 optimistic about our long-term prospects. A year ago, we were just introducing the concept of Ultrabooks to the world. Today, the market has been redefined with thin, light, powerful Ultrabooks and convertibles. 
A year ago, Intel was not shipping products into the tablet market. Today, we have Clover Trail tablets shipping in the market delivering performance and power benefits versus what our competitors can do. And in 2013, we will ramp our next-generation tablet SoC, codenamed Bay Trail, in both the Windows and Android markets.
Intel is now inside 7 shipping smartphone designs. And here again, the third-party benchmarks show that we are not only capable of matching the competition in power efficiency, we are leading them. In 2012, we built on the strength of our Data Center offering, and we expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in 2013. 
And lastly, we built on our manufacturing lead and are well into the ramp of our 22-nanometer factories, and we'll start production on the 14-nanometer process this year. This puts us significantly ahead of the competition. The combination of new products and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will benefit our business in the quarters to come. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",927

I guess if I -- partner that together with where the stock is trading, valuation wise, it really looks like investors are dubious as to when any returns are going to come from those investments. So I guess the question after that is when do you see the investments come -- or the return on these investments coming? How long do you think this investment stage lasts and what are some of the mile markers we should look for to see those returns being generated?",118
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026794.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,7,"Well, there's 2 parts to the CapEx this year, I mean, 2 large parts to the CapEx this year, Ross. One is, you're starting to see our first significant investments in bricks and mortar and some equipment for the 450-millimeter transition, which happens the later part of this decade. We have to make those investments earlier. Those are -- now that we've solidified our relationship and contractual relationship with ASML, it gives us a line of sight to that conversion and, therefore, are now in a better position to predict the exact timing and deploy capital for that. So I would treat that as more of an extraordinary or -- extraordinary event that's not related to the day-to-day business in terms of volume in '14, '15, '16. The CapEx that we are projecting on a base level then, if you look -- $13 billion minus the $2 billion is $11 billion, which is about what we spent last year. And as I look forward into the business in '14 and '15, as we finish up the 14-nanometer factories and begin deployment of the construction of -- and equipping of the 10-nanometer factories, we need those factories, principally for our view of the computing market and in that, I would include tablets, and certainly the Data Center. So as we look at it, it gets used. Remember, the leading-edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis, the highest performance and the lowest power. So regardless of what you think the size of the market is, those leading edge fabs are the single greatest assets that we have.",271

And I guess the word computing could even include tablets and smartphones?",63
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026796.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,9,"Yes, when I'm talking about that, I was specifically including the enterprise business, the Data Center business, the PC business as we've known it and as it's evolving. And I would include tablets in that because as we look forward, it's very difficult to distinguish between a detachable clamshell notebook and a tablet. The form factors are going to blur here. The performance requirements are going to be the same spectrum of performance requirements that we think we've seen in the PC space over the last few years. I kept phones separately out of that discussion because I think the relative volume in phones in terms of this deployment of CapEx is still relatively small.",115

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026799.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,12,"Sure. C.J., this is Stacy. I'll take that. Let me break out that capacity-related CapEx in a couple of different ways. First, if you look at it by process, it's very much driven by building for the peak of 14-nanometer, and then it's the start of the investment in 10-nanometer. So just building on what Paul said, if you think about that, it's really building for units that we expect in 2014 and 2015 because that's where you start to see the peak of 14-nanometer and the start of the ramp of 10. In terms of the break out between what's for facilities versus what's for equipment, as I had showed at the investor meeting back in May, we're seeing that the facility-related spending is coming back and a higher proportion -- is coming down and a higher proportion of that CapEx is for equipment.",145

And I guess as my follow-up, in terms of the guidance for low single-digit top line growth in '13, can you walk through the underlying assumptions particularly as it relates to your outlook for PCs and the DCG group?",41
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026803.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,16,"Yes, we said on the -- I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the Data Center Group to return to double-digit revenue growth. And just diving into that, it's the cloud Data Center plus our participation in portions of the market like storage and some of the networking sections of the market. It's both unit and ASP based on the strength of our product line and sellout. And then for the kind of core PC market, the traditional PC market, we have pretty modest expectations around units, and we think where the growth comes from are these devices that sit in the middle, so the convertibles, that's kind of the best of the tablet and the PC. And then our beginning of participation across the tablet market.",128

And frankly, a lot of that was enabled by our investment in ASML allowed kind of the alignment around that time line. And so when we look at 2015 as the time where we can have equipment available, we want to start the production or the construction of a development facility. That's typically a couple of year cycle and so I'd expect there's some facility-related spending next year that's kind of in the range of what we're spending this year. And then we won't get into the capital-related spending for this until the back half of the decade -- the production-related capital spending into the back half of the second.",152

We are very interested in being a selective foundry manufacturer for certain customers. We don't see ourselves as a general-purpose foundry or competing with the general-purpose foundries. The kinds of things we would do would certainly not -- we would not take business that would enable a competitor. We would certainly consider a business that would enable and strengthen relationships with strategic partners. The kinds of things that we've announced so far have been in the programmable logic area, which is an area that Intel is not in today, so that makes perfect sense. And those kinds of companies need leading-edge technology. So that's the pattern for which we would do this. So, yes, we are in a position to be able to handle those kinds of customers. If it's -- we've been building up that capability for several years now, and we're now going into production. I described this, I think, in May as a crawl, walk, run strategy, and we're still in the crawl part of it.",193

And as my follow-up, we have recently started seeing an increased adoption of ARM's Cortex A-15 processors, and I believe earlier today, TSMC spoke about their optimism with the 20-nanometer process ramping up next year at a faster pace than they had ramped 28-nanometer. So my question is, do you see the competition catching up in terms of performance, or in general, how should we view the computing landscape?",71

I view as -- now that we've matched the power, performance, the power and battery life curves, and we're still on 32 nanometers as we move to 22 and 14, you'll see us accelerate. We've looked at the A15, we look at the A15 specs, and we know our own silicon in terms Bay Trail and Clover Trail+, and we're very comfortable that we can maintain a performance lead here.

So it's not per wafer. Most people are now pricing -- the foundries are pricing per die or per millimeter square, and that tends to be the model that we would use here, too, for the most part, depending on the level of technology we're talking about. And the pricing here is going to be value-based pricing. I mean, obviously, it has to be competitive, but the value that we bring in terms of the technology is, I think, pretty exceptional.",90

So how much, I guess, do you need to take in terms of share within tablets, or how much of that tablet market needs to be eaten up by your convertible PCs in order, I guess, to fill that big bet in 2014 that you seem to be making and then avoid underutilization that may otherwise happen from the CapEx that you're spending?",109

Data Center up in the -- back into the double digits. You still end up with client growth when you go through that, and I think the point that Paul is making earlier is a really important one, which is the lines between a traditional notebook, a convertible tablet, I think have blurred to the point that it's a market for computing, and we are expecting some units. Now Q1, we think, is kind of seasonally down, that's what we guided. But when we get into the back half and we have a combination of new products in the market and an improving macroeconomic environment, I think that's a fairly reasonable assumption on the year.
As we think out into the future, we're kind of thinking of it as just more or less normal growth, consistent with what we've historically seen from a unit standpoint. It's just growth across a much wider range of devices than what we've historically supported. I don't know if you have anything to add to that.",188

And I guess to follow-up on that, I mean, my math suggests that you're guiding depreciation this year at a $1.7 billion quarterly run rate, which is kind of flat, which suggests to me that the CapEx that you're -- the incremental CapEx you're spending this year doesn't actually start getting depreciated next year, which again tells me that you're looking for a fairly solid amount of growth in 2014 to cover that. At the same time, I know you talked about phones and Data Center and PCs and everything adding to that, but the Data Center business, you sell what, right now 16 million chips a year, something like that, which can fill a fab. You have phones, which Paul admitted, were probably still going to be small. Then you have tablets where the dies are a lot smaller. So unless you're driving tons and tons of volume, there's actually not a ton of wafer volume. So what sort of growth, I guess -- what sort of -- is it enough to -- is sort of your historical level of unit growth enough to fill the CapEx you're putting in? And what gives you confidence that you could even have that same kind of historical level of unit growth?",211

And we know the specs on those. The customers know the specs of those. I've seen the prototypes of the industrial design. They're really exciting products.
Our customers have not had this level of performance and this kind of form factor before. So we -- to some extent, we're branch predicting that, that level of product will generate sufficient excitement to keep the client growth going.

Yes, we think that there was an inventory drain in the worldwide supply chain for PCs in the fourth quarter. Our channel checks would suggest that a lot of older generation kind of Windows 7 PCs were burned off in the quarter. When we look overall at inventory levels across all the downstream inventory, we think it's a healthy level of inventory. It looks appropriate for how we see demand. And then in terms of our own inventory levels, obviously, we reduced them significantly in the fourth quarter.",92

So in the Data Center, as I said in my comments, the big driver was Romley with shipping which is the Sandy Bridge server part. That drove the mix up, and it drove the mix to MP up, and that helped drive the overall richness of the Data Center business. On PCs, what we saw was the strength in the core product line, principally going into Ultrabooks and laptops, and a little more weakness than we would have first thought in the bottom of the PC market in our Celeron and Pentium product lines.",95

Phones are getting bigger, and you saw the ""phablets"", which is a phone-tablet sort of form factor emerge, which were 6, even 7-inch phones, and then of course, the shift of tablets from 10 to 7 inches. And I think that's probably what you're going see. The market will bifurcate between sort of the 5- to 7-inch type of products and the 10-plus inch type of products. And the 10-plus inch type of products, particularly as you get to 12, 13 inches, are going to be more classic PC level of performance, and now enabled by these convertible, detachable form factors that only gets thinner as Haswell and Broadwell come on.",135

And we certainly have capacity if we ever wanted to. But I think it's instructive to just look at where we are. If you just take Q4, which we would say was a relatively tough quarter at the top line, macro economic weakness, the impact of tablets on our business, we generated $6 billion of cash flow from operations. We had $2.5 billion of CapEx. We paid a little over $1 billion in dividends. So we're generating plenty of cash to invest in our business and to pay the dividend and protect the dividends. So I'm not worried about it from that standpoint. And as I model out 2013, I get a similar model where I'm generating more cash than I need for those 2 things. In terms of the cash balance that I'm comfortable with, I'm comfortable with how much cash we have today. I could live with a little bit less also, and we make those decisions tactically as we go forward.",176

We believe we have a very competitive solution. The Infineon team is known for not necessarily being first to market, but being really good at engineering a very solid solution and being cost effective and cost competitive.

You get -- you drive like an investor of 10% to 12% unit growth, and you got mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then in '10 and '11, you crushed the revenue growth. Your prices went up, but your unit growth really did not. Now in '12, we have a down year. '13 is low-single-digit growth, and I'm wondering if you think there is elasticity in the market and if you expect to drive your ASPs down in order to drive that elasticity.",147

What we saw -- actually, if you wind the tape back earlier than your comments, what we saw was a similar kind of price elasticity in the desktop in the '80s and '90s. When PCs broke $1,000, volume went dramatically up. And then the desktop PC continued to drop down until it stabilized at sort of the price points where minimum margin was available for all the players. And the cheapest desktop was a $299 sort of model or something like that. Notebooks went the same way. First notebooks were $3,000. Now notebooks are $299 to $1299 in terms of the sweet spot. And I think people will buy based upon their need within those price points. But it's very difficult for me to see them going from $299 to $99. The bill of materials just doesn't support it. And what we're likely to see and what we saw in the fourth quarter, in fact, in the Windows 8 touch-enabled models, was that people were willing to spend a little bit more to get a more capable product. And that's certainly been true in the Apple model for many, many years, and I think that there is a model of getting paid for innovation. Intel's Core product line has always shown that. Now you're starting to see it, I think, in the system-level price points as well.",247

Over that same 10 years, the first correlation of our business is GDP growth. And then beyond that, it's the kinds of things that Paul has been talking about. You have Haswell coming into the marketplace, Windows 8 gaining traction, touch gaining traction.

In '12, it was kind of maybe a bigger headwind than people thought coming into the year. Kind of curious, when you look at the '13 guide, how are you thinking about emerging market? Was '12 all just about decelerating GDP, or do you think there was some interplay of some white box tablets starting to cannibalize within that region as well?",81

But I think the bigger issue was in China and in Brazil last year, which is the 2 largest emerging market countries, was their overall economic health. Remember, Brazil started seeing inflation that slowed down PC sales. China went -- the growth dropped, and they had a regime change. And we saw people stalling around what the policies would be post-regime change and so forth. And now as we look into '13, as Stacy said, China is still outgrowing any other large economy in the world, and I think will be a driver for PC sales. We've been pleasantly surprised by the Data Center growth in China. They're deploying fairly large amounts of servers for infrastructure build-out, and that's helped our overall revenue picture in that country.",173

And so if you look at '13, we expect employment to be pretty flat. So I think that the answer to your question, is, yes, we think we're investing at the right level. We do have an increase in OpEx as we go from '12 to '13, and that's just the full year impact of the R&D investments that we talked about in '12, and that's investments that are really being driven by Ultrabooks and tablets and phones and our SoC capability, as well as our process technology leadership. And it's interesting, I think that it's -- when you look at our performance in the business, we've got some great products in the market. I think 2013 will be a year where we're fighting and, hopefully, winning some big designs. I think you'll see many of those designs coming to the market in the tablet space as we've talked about and the phone space. The volume will grow over time, and we expect that the business grows into this investment level over time.",187

I was wondering if you could share with us -- you said your utilization rates would be below, I think, 50% in Q4. I was wondering if you could share with us where they landed and what you expect the trajectory to be in Q1 and maybe even beyond if you can?",70
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3049.0,403366.0,19026866.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,79,"Sure. Yes, we came in at a gross margin level a little bit better than expected in the fourth quarter. And it played out from a utilization standpoint pretty much as we expected. We brought the loadings down in the factories significantly. It was below 50%. We redirected equipment to intercept some of the leading-edge process technology, and we managed to bring inventory levels down on the order of $600 million, which was all consistent with what we'd said. As we go into Q1, the forecast for gross margin is roughly flat. What you're seeing there in terms of excess capacity is -- we'll continue to see an improvement in excess capacity, and we're going to start to see the increase in start-up costs. And those -- rough order of those 2 things offset. And then there's a couple of other puts and takes, but it ends up with a flat gross margin. As I think through then the shape for the year, which is the last part of your question, when I get to Q2, I think what happens is we see the further reduction in the excess capacity charges. In fact, they'll be pretty much gone in Q2. But Q2 is where we will peak in terms of the start up costs. And I think that the start up cost impact is a little bit more than the reduction in the excess capacity, so I'd expect gross margin in Q2, everything else being equal, to be kind of flat to down. And then we'll put 60% out for the year, so you should think about the second half expectations of gross margin back into the low 60s. And when I think about the drivers of that, it's the reduction in start-up costs as we peak in Q2 and they start to come down. It's increases in volume, which would be consistent with the seasonal second half, and then our costs come down over the course of the back half of this year. And those are the 3 tailwinds that I project to get me back up above 60%.",350

And if I might, I have a question on some of the other -- I mean, if you -- we load in the low-single-digit revenue growth you have for this year, and we throw in the double-digit Data Center and we throw in the single-digit growth in PC client, that means the rest of your business must be falling something like 8% year-over-year for calendar '13. And some of these segments like the other IA group include some of your growth areas like you've been talking about in tablets and smartphones. Can you share with us your build plan -- or not your build plan, but your plan for the year, or how you're thinking about some of these other groups over the course of the year?",129

First, I don't get to the same math and so we'll just start there. We talked about both the PCCG group, and we talked about the Data Center Group being back in the low double-digits. When we kind of run through the rest of the businesses, the -- we would expect to start to see some progress in tablets over the course of the year. I think phones is going to be -- will be winning design, but it's not going to move the needle from a revenue standpoint. We talked about IMC in terms of, I think, that growth returns to that business as LTE ramps, which is really -- come out in time with the end of this year and into next year. We expect embedded will see some growth. It's been a nice growth engine for us, and we think NAND growth. I think I hit them all there. I don't think I missed anything.",159

As you know, I have a month left in my career at Intel, and this will be my last conference call with you. I've been doing these calls since 1993 and have done approximately 80 calls with you. I wanted to take a departure from my traditional remarks during this, my final earnings call.
During the next few minutes, I'd like to share some perspective on the company and on our industry drawing from my career and my experience as Intel's fifth CEO. I came to Intel nearly 40 years ago, eager to join the team of extraordinarily smart, creative and driven engineers and a legendary team of founders, some of the greatest minds in technology. In 1974, Intel was still a startup, with revenues of $134 million and a culture built on relentless innovation and designed to thrive on change. A revolution in computing had just begun, but it would take us another decade before we realized how dramatically it would change our business and the world. Amidst all of that change and reinvention, there has, however, been a constant. From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessor, from one architectural battle to the next, and across generations of form factors and operating systems, Intel has grown and thrived.
Naturally, constant change and reinvention creates plenty of room for both opportunity and skepticism. As the industry and the company evolved, risk and uncertainty were common, but the company's inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise and intense drive allowed it to create and capitalize on opportunity over the long haul.
In May of 2005, I became CEO and over the past 8 years, we've executed a broad strategy to reposition the company to participate in all segments of computing by capitalizing on all of our considerable strengths. We implemented the Tick Tock model, which set the pace of innovation and has become an industry benchmark of execution. We developed the Atom microarchitecture to address low-power and low-cost market segments. Through the acquisitions of Infineon Wireless Solutions and McAfee, we've invested in strategic capabilities like baseband technology and security that position us to deliver important new capabilities and compete across an even broader range of devices. And we've invented and implemented manufacturing breakthroughs that are allowing us to deliver on the promise and competitive benefits of Moore's Law.
Never in the history of our company has our ability to participate across the spectrum of computing been greater. From industrial machines that are increasingly connected to the Internet, to the smallest battery-powered devices, from traditional PCs to Ultrabooks, and from high-performance servers to microservers, storage and networking equipment, we now compete wherever there is computing. At the same time, we put more distance between us and the rest of the semiconductor industry than ever before. In the first quarter, we shipped our 100 millionth 22-nanometer processor using our revolutionary 3D transistor technology, while the rest of the industry works to ship its first unit. That breakthrough is just one in a long history of material science firsts, following innovations like strained silicon and High-k/Metal Gate. This leadership in material science and manufacturing technology is the foundation on which our future success will be based, arming us with the world's lowest power and lowest-cost transistors.
But even as I prepare to pass the baton to a new generation of leadership, I know Intel's story is nowhere near completely written. I'm excited about what lies ahead for Intel. The company has a historically broad portfolio of products spanning the spectrum of computing and price points. And as we begin to transition to 14-nanometer technology later this year, our architectural and process technology investments and innovation will become increasingly apparent and valuable for our customers and to the market.
Over the past few months, I've been traveling to our sites here in the U.S. and around the world. That creativity and drive that first attracted me to Intel almost 4 decades ago has never been higher. The company's core architectural and manufacturing strengths have never been more valuable. And the opportunity presented by the evolution and expansion of the computing industry has never been greater. It's for those reasons that I'm confident that Intel will continue to invent, grow, thrive and deliver the best technology to a world increasingly hungry for the products of the microprocessor revolution.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",741

I'd like to take a minute and talk about what we're seeing in each of the segments of our business, and our expectations as we look forward to the rest of the year. Starting with the PC Client Group.
PC Client volumes were down seasonally in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations. In addition, we believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in the first quarter as customers decreased inventory of older generation PCs. In the second quarter, we will launch Haswell, enabling a new wave of ultra-sleek designs across multiple form factors by our customers. We believe the combination of an improving macroeconomic environment, Haswell coming to the market, ultra-mobile form factors like Ultrabooks, convertibles and tablets and touch-enabled devices leads to a return to growth in the second half of this year.
Moving to the Data Center Group. Data Center Group revenue in the first quarter grew 7% from a year ago. On a year-on-year basis, we saw significant growth in both the cloud and the high-performance computing segments of the market. We continue to refresh our product lines to expand our offerings across all ranges of performance, performance-per-watt and performance-per-watt per dollar.
At IDF Beijing last week, we announced that our next generation Atom processor for the microserver segment of the market codenamed Avoton, and our Ivy Bridge product for Xeon-class servers will be shipping in the second half. These leadership products, coupled with our leading-edge process technology and the secular growth trends of the data center market, give us confidence in double-digit revenue growth for the year. We are making significant progress in tablets and phones. First quarter tablet volume more than doubled from the fourth quarter, and we expect it to double again in the second quarter. We have shipping designs across both Windows 8 and Android operating systems. In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail, which will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points. In the phone segment, we had a good first quarter in our baseband business. We are shipping LTE versions today and are on track to ship multimode, voice and data LTE baseband solutions by the end of the year.
We are winning designs with our new Clover Trail+ apps processor, where customers and third parties are highlighting both the performance and power efficiency of our architecture and are on track to ship our next-generation product codenamed Merrifield by the end of the year.
In other important segments of our business, we saw year-on-year growth in both our Software and Services Group and our NAND business.
Turning to our financials. First quarter revenue finished at $12.6 billion, in line with our expectations. We are forecasting revenue of $12.9 billion for the second quarter, which is slightly higher than the average seasonal increase as we expect some pipeline inventory replenishment as we launch Haswell and in anticipation of a stronger second half.
Gross margin of 56% was down 2 points from expectations. Increased demand from our customers allowed us to increase production of Haswell products prior to qualification for sale. The result of this was a higher than anticipated inventory write-off, which we expect to get back throughout the rest of the year as the product is expected to qualify for sale in the second quarter. In addition, we saw higher than expected excess capacity charges in older generation process technologies. We are taking advantage of the excess capacity on older generation process technologies to take capacity offline and reuse more equipment and space for 14-nanometer and beyond. The results of these actions allows us to lower our capital spending forecast for the year by $1 billion, down to $12 billion.
In addition, our inventories decreased almost $400 million from the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 2 points to 58%. And the gross margin forecast for the year remain 60%, with gross margins in the second half back into the low-60s. Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, with earnings per share of $0.40.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.1 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. The reduction in cash was a result of shifting almost $1 billion from short term to longer-term investments. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $4 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased a little over $2 billion in capital assets and repurchased $0.5 billion in stock.
As Paul said, our manufacturing leadership is extending and gives us the world's lowest cost and lowest power transistors. In the first quarter, we shipped our first silicon to a foundry customer, and we announced a significant foundry design win with Altera, who will move their leading-edge products to our 14-nanometer process technology. Building on this leadership, we are on track to start production on 14-nanometer process technology in the back half of this year. The combination of an improving macroeconomic environment and new products coming to the market over the course of the year that take advantage of our manufacturing leadership increase our confidence in being able to achieve financial growth in the second half of 2013.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",889

I would just characterize it as a fairly benign pricing environment. The way we characterized at the beginning of the year is that we have, I think, a strong product position really across different form factors in the market and that played out as we expected.

And then for my follow-up, just on the server piece, in the last couple of quarters, units were pretty flat and then volumes were down 6% in the calendar first quarter.

I think it's a little bit of an improvement of what we saw in the fourth quarter in the Enterprise segment of the Data Center and then we continue to see very robust growth rates across the high-performance computing and the big IP data centers that support the cloud. So it's a nice continuation of growth in those segments and then a little bit better in the Enterprise segment. And as I think forward to the back half of the year, my suspicion is, we'll start to see the Enterprise segment growing again just based on macroeconomic improvement.",118

My first one is, Stacy, if you could please talk about the capacity. How much of the CapEx is -- can be moderated lower if the PC industry continues to be weaker than probably what you thought going into the year? So that's my first question.",50
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2013",2013-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2965.0,442718.0,20710059.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,12,"Okay. I'd say, we're really well-positioned right now from a factory and a utilization standpoint. And let me just rewind what we did in the first quarter. We saw that units were a little bit weaker than we expected and our expectations came down a bit. That allowed us to bring utilization down on some older generation process technology. You can see we brought our inventory levels down pretty significantly and actually a bit more than I thought when I started the quarter, and we took $1 billion out of CapEx by rolling forward some older generation technologies to offset things what we needed to buy for 14-nanometer and new process technologies. In terms of your question of the levers that we have, I think that's a good example of how we can be responsive in a very tactical time horizon to changes in demand. And as I look forward across the year, the prediction right now is we're going to run in the healthy rate of utilization. In fact, we're starting the quarter at that utilization rate. I think inventories will continue to be healthy. If demand turns out to be stronger, we have some whitespace that we can grow into, so we can respond up. If demand ends up being a little weaker than we thought, you saw the playbook in Q1, we can pretty quickly react and bring CapEx down if that's the case.",237

And then my follow-up on the foundry strategy, maybe for Paul or for you. What's the long-term vision? Getting Altera was a feather in your cap, but then looking out ahead, what implications does that have for a, business mix and then also for the long term margin structure for the company?",53
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2013",2013-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2965.0,442718.0,20710061.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,14,"Sure. Well, I've described the strategy before as a crawl, walk, run strategy. We're past crawl. We're in the mode of collecting serious customers. The design win activity leads the announcement activity, as you'd expect in this business. And there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly announced. In terms of the business, as Stacy said, I think last quarter, it will not have a significant revenue impact to the company for 2 to 3 years. That's the design cycle for these products. And in the case of someone like Altera, that tends to -- products tend to run for quite some time. So think of that as something that will start 2-plus years from now and run for quite a number of years thereafter on several generations of technology. The business model that we have for the foundry assumes value-based pricing.

First, just relative to what your units did in PCG versus some third-party data and kind of your commentary that you thought that the PC supply chain went through an inventory reduction, there seems to be a little bit of a mismatch where you guys have outperformed. To what extent is that just netbooks not being classified in your PC Group and being classified in third-party data? To what extent is that emerging market strength perhaps picking up that the third-party data is not sort of capturing?",93

Actually, I'll start. This is Stacy. I'll start by saying, we're -- when you take into account all of the different categories that the third parties are looking at, I'd say we're pretty aligned with how they view the year. And so you start with the traditional PC segment of the market. We do expect that to be down. We expect netbooks to be down significantly. You can see that in our Other IAG results. And in fact, it's getting close to 0. I think that category is coming to the end of its life. And then we see some of the new form factors of computing that are growing significantly. I think Gartner would call those ultra-mobile devices. So things like Ultrabooks, detachables, convertibles. We're seeing robust growth there. And then we're now participating across a broad range of tablets between Windows 8 and Android. And with Bay Trail coming out and then Merrifield behind that, we start to participate in a much broader set of screen sizes and price points than we are today. And so when you net all of these up, you look broadly at the market for computing, you see some of the traditional form factors down, you see growth in these new form factors, we get to kind of very slight unit growth for the year, and that's pretty consistent with how the third parties are viewing the year.",236

And then Stacy, as my follow-on, just the operating profitability of DCG was down about 500 basis points sequentially. And I guess it's the lowest in the data set that I'm looking at. Is that incremental OpEx, you guys try to broaden out into new areas like networking and storage, is that a gross margin problem? Can you help me understand the profitability? And when do we get back to kind of like 50% op margin that we saw maybe 5 quarters ago if ever?",88

And you'll notice, John, that it's also impacting PCCG. As we said at the beginning of the quarter, we had significant excess capacity charges that hit both PCCG and DCG, and we had a big increase in startup costs as you'd kind of expect based on where we are in the 14-nanometer ramp and those 2 business units are the ones that really drive both of those. And so that's where those costs hit. So as the gross margin improved, so yes, we expect that Q1's the bottom, it's up a bit in Q2 and then at back half, it gets back into the low-60s. You'll see the operating profit moving back into what you historically come to expect in DCG.",128

I mean, I think that the ground rules that we've laid out which are -- I had 3 that I was looking at, one is that the value-based pricing to take advantage of our technology.

It's pretty similar to last year. I know none of us want a repeat of the second half of last year.

That's consistent with what we're seeing from most economists. Now you'd say, that could be a repeat to what we thought, we thought last year. I think the world was expecting a stronger macroeconomic second half of '12 and it didn't materialize. But that is my belief right now. That will directly impact our Data Center business. There's a big portion of that business that really is correlated to GDP growth when you look at it over a long period of time. And then secondly is our product portfolio. We now participate across a broad range of devices: tablets and convertibles and detachables and phones, although phones won't really drive the results in the second half. And so we can embrace this broad market for computing now. And wherever the demand increases, we can participate in it. And a year ago, we were in the middle of that transition. And so as tablets ramped, and in particular as Android tablets ramped, we really weren't in a position to participate in those segments of the market.",202

The explosion in form factors and the competitiveness of that platform is going to be substantially different at price points down into the $300 or $400 range enabling touch. We didn't have that last year.

Again, I know you said, Stacy, that you're confident in double-digit growth for the year and that macro is a big part of it.

Maybe it's useful, I'll give you a little bit of color commentary on Q1, just so you can kind of see what we're seeing in terms of growth rates. We saw the -- if you look at the traditional Enterprise segment of the market on a year-over-year basis, as I said earlier, it's growing a little bit, but it's -- think of it as a pretty low growth rate. And that's compared to the last couple of quarters where we saw that market in decline. So I think you'd say, it's improving, but it's not robust. And then we continue to see very high rates of growth in things like the cloud and high-performance computing. And when I say high rates of growth, think of things that are in the 20%, 30%, 40% year-on-year unit growth rates in those segments of the market. I think that second piece is really a secular driver as all these devices compute and connecting to the Internet, driving the build-out of the cloud. And then the first piece, I think, is improving and will likely improve into the second half.",187

And then I guess for my follow-up side of things, thinking a little bit about inventory and then how it plays along into utilization. You guys over the last 2 quarters have taken the better part of $1 billion out of your inventory. A year ago at this time, you started ramping that back up, and then obviously demand was a problem and you had to go back to the underutilization side of things. Are you going to be a bit more cautious on the pace of utilization and inventory build this year or are some of the things macro-wise and product-wise that are giving you confidence in the back half demand going to lead you to be the same behavior or just as aggressive as a year ago?",130

I think we're all learning how to operate more efficiency. Now it may go up a little bit in the second quarter as the various versions of Haswell qualify, which is part of the story for the Q1 margin miss. But yes, we'll continue to manage things very lean. And as I said, as an answer to a question earlier, we're now in a really nice position where we have the capability to flex capacity up if we need to. And so that says I don't need to run with big inventory levels.",122

First, if you take out the 450-millimeter, we're down a couple of billion dollars from where we were last year, a pretty significant reduction. And if you just look at our capital spending as a percent of revenue relative to the last several years, we're in the high-teens, and the last couple of years, we've been in the low-20s. So I think we're kind of in the range, and you compare that against some of the people we compare against, a TSMC or a Samsung. They're spending some significant multiple of CapEx relative to revenue to what we are. So I think we're spending the right amount. I think we can be responsive if the market is a little bit weaker. I think we have the ability to flex up if the market ends up being stronger. I'm very comfortable with our positioning. And as I just discussed with Ross, the operational indicators look really good. I think we can -- we're at a healthy level of inventory. We brought it down another $400 million this quarter. We're running healthy utilization, and I expect both of those to continue through the year.",205

By the way. 2000 just -- on other thing, 2009 is a weird comparison point because you're in the aftermath of the financial meltdown. And as we disclosed to you at that time, that gave us the ability to roll forward entire factories full of equipment from one process generation to the next. So I think if you choose that particular time period, you're going to get a weird compare.",136

And the other thing is, in your full year revenue guidance, can you give us any idea of roughly what percent of full year sales might be related to tablets and smartphones? What's assumed for that?",38

Well, so let me take it at a higher level, David. And I'll get to that. But the short answer is, smartphones is -- it doesn't move the needle for us from a revenue standpoint. As we said, we're in the design win phase there. Tablets is interesting, but I want to talk about that in the context of kind of the broader market for computing. So let's start with a Data Center. It's about 20% of our revenue. We've said we expect it to be double-digit growth. So if you just do a simple manager math, that says, that just the Data Center is giving a couple of points, maybe a smidge more than that to the company's growth rate that we've said is low-single digits. So just the Data Center kind of gets us there. Within the broader market for computing, it's the answer that I gave John earlier, which is, we're seeing a decline in some of the traditional form factors. We're seeing an increase in things like Ultrabooks, convertibles, tablets. We're refreshing our product line there. When you net all of that out, you get to some very modest unit growth across all of those devices. So think of that as being flattish up a smidge. And then the rest of it is relatively small compared to those 2 businesses, and that's how you get to low-single-digit growth for the company.",236

First of all, the overall performance goes up, the graphics performance goes up, as well as the integer performance. So it's a better punch in the package than we've had with Ivy Bridge, point one. Point two, the power envelope or the battery life for that level of performance is exceptionally better than Ivy Bridge. Third, it gets into the form factor innovation and the integration with touch that I spoke about earlier, which I think is really part of the recipe required for Win 8 adoption. I recently converted personally to Windows 8 with touch, and it is a better Windows than Windows 7 in the desktop mode when you implement the touch and the touch-based applications and operating environment. It's just a lot easier to use. There is an adoption curve. And once you get over that adoption curve, I don't think you'll go back. And we didn't quite have that same kind of adoption curve in Windows 7 versus XP before it. This requires a little bit of training, and I think people are attracted to touch and the touch price points today are still fairly high, and they're coming down very rapidly over the next couple of quarters.",210

And as I think you know, we don't share prospectively what we're planning to do with the buyback just as a matter of policy. What I can share with you is that our priorities are still the priorities that we have been talking about. It's invest in our business first, it's dividend second, and I've shared with you the expectation that we want a dividend that's on the order of 40% of free cash flow. And I think that's giving us a pretty good dividend yield today. And then buybacks, we used as the other way to return cash to shareholders and to modulate cash balances. And so what you can take from less buybacks is just a bit uncomfortable with the cash balances.",125

But if I'm just looking over the, I guess, the last 3 months, we have weaker results in Q1, which raises the operational bar for the second half on both top line and gross margin, which suggests you're even more confident in that back half ramp than you were 3 months ago even in the wake of what looks to be pretty challenging market data. You're also taking CapEx down though, which would belie that increased confidence somewhat. I was just wondering, can you help me identify, I guess, the sources of that increased confidence in that back half ramp versus where you were 3 months ago, as well as help me rationalize that with the cut to the CapEx outlook?",133

And first of all, just to make sure we're not oversoaking things here, you really just need seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low-single digit revenue growth. So I don't think we have a hugely high bar out there, and I went through a dissection of where I think the revenue comes from. In terms of the things that give me confidence that, or at least I personally believe it could be better than seasonal, is improving macroeconomic environment. So things we talked about, improving macroeconomic environment. It's the fact that we are now participating across a range of compute devices and so the mix between those don't impact us nearly as much. And then third, as Paul said, you have innovative form factors coming out in Ultrabooks, in convertibles, in detachables that are hitting these really compelling mainstream price points that are touch-enabled. As we get into the Christmas selling season, our expectation is, you will see touch-enabled Ultrabooks that are $499 and $599, pretty commonly out there, $599 commonly and $499 is kind of special SKUs. And then we'll see because of Bay Trail coming into the marketplace, you'll see touch-enabled, thin notebooks with really good performance that are hitting kind of $300 price points. And then with our Android tablets, you'll see things that are significantly, hey, 1/2 that. So we're participating across this broad range of compute devices as we get into the back half of this year.",247

That's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the, I guess, the trajectory of your fab output. It sounds to me like your current plan for loading is similar to what you had last, last quarter, which was I think full fabs in the second half. It almost sounds like you may be running close to full right now. What does that mean for, I guess, your expectations for how much your fab output may grow in 2014 year-over-year, given how I would think you anticipate running full in 2014 and we were pretty lean in the first part of 2013? With double-digit upside be the right way to think about that in terms of fab output? And how much of that increase might be inventory replenishment versus, I guess, demand upside?",139

If demand for older products exceeds what we could build on 14, we can still build 22 for quite some time. So I don't -- I really think it depends on whatever demand scenario you see out there. In any event, the most important thing for us is to make that transition to 14 and continue to have the leading edge.",81

Just mathematically though, if I'm running full in 2014, and I was pretty empty in the first part of 2013, even if you're not adding a tremendous amount of capacity, doesn't that imply a very significant uptick in your fab output in '14 versus '13?

So we take capacity offline.

And I wouldn't -- I wouldn't paint the entire customer base with the same brush that you just did, Doug. I mean, certainly, if you look just at last quarter even inside the PC space, Lenovo outperformed everybody else and actually had a very good year-on-year set of numbers in a down year. Apple continues to do well. Subsets of customers in different segments are also doing very well in terms of, say, those providing products into the Internet data centers. What I see when we look out is a tremendous amount of innovation, particularly at the ODM and Taiwanese OEM side, where the ability to miniaturize and bring things into extremely thin form factors is really as revolutionary amount of changes I've seen in my time in this industry. And so I think what we can do is give them the product like Haswell and Bay Trail to innovative around. We can help them with other feature sets like voice and speech that go around them and just help them build better products.",184

I mean, I think that in the foundry thing that the investment is really going to be taking advantage at least near term with the current customer base of capacity that we're already putting in place. That doesn't mean that at some point, we won't have to actually build extra capacity for a foundry customer or the foundry business. But today, up to this point, it's certainly within our ability to absorb. The set-top box spending or the stuff we're doing in Intel media in the grand scheme of things is not a lot of spending. So the real issue is inside of our core microprocessor and platform development. And we're at a point now where roughly 1/2 of our spending is focused on System on Chip inside the microprocessor world. And the System on Chip environment is really a lot of the ultra-mobile products. It's the phones. It's the tablets. It's embedded systems. It's automotive, et cetera, where we have fairly strong growth opportunities. So it's not the same monolithic Tick Tock model that we put in place 8 years ago.",196

We saw an inventory burn in the broader pipeline in Q1 and our inventory levels are down more than I expect when I started quarter and down pretty significantly. So I think inventory levels are lean. And I also want to put in perspective, you're talking a minor difference, being up 3% quarter-on-quarter is kind of well within Q1 to Q2 seasonality. I don't think there's any one big driver there. I do think we'll see people putting in place some Haswell-based systems in anticipation of the second half selling season just as they burned inventory on some of the older generation systems in the first quarter.",118

I mean, even if you look at Gartner data, it's growing robustly. But there's this reinvention going on just broadly across the notebook. And we're seeing now the percent of thin and light notebooks in the market relative to the total notebook market, they're kind of in the order of 1/3 of the market, which -- and I think that grows from here as we hit price point. So I think the reinvention of the form factor is well underway. Some of those are going to be more premium Ultrabooks with touch and then new form factors of convertibles and detachables. A big chunk of that's going to be that wedge volume behind that, which are thin and light, touch-enabled notebooks that aren't categorized as Ultrabook. All of that is good for us.",156

It's great to have a chance to speak to you, all, on my first earnings call as CEO. The last 2 months have been exciting for me. I've spent the majority of my time meeting with customers, employees and my executive team. I've heard a wide variety of views about our industry and Intel, how we're positioned, where we're strong and where we can improve. I've had the opportunity to share my vision and strategy for our company and lay out my expectations as we move into the new era with an updated set of priorities. Those conversations leave me more enthusiastic and more confident than ever about our opportunity as a company. Intel has unmatched assets in process technology and architecture, a powerful brand and talented employees that are producing some remarkable results. Let me give you a few highlights from the second quarter.
There were several significant milestones in mobility. First, we unveiled details about our next-generation Atom architecture, codenamed Silvermont. The Silvermont architecture will deliver up to a 5x reduction in power at the same level of performance or up to a 3x improvement in performance over our prior generation of architecture. Silvermont is unique in its ability to span the market's appetite for computing, from ultra-mobile devices to the Data Center, and it supports both Windows and Android. The Silvermont platform will underpin our products for tablets, 2-in-1's and desktops, as well as our phones and microserver products for the Data Center. Our products will be Bay Trail, Merrifield and Avoton, respectively. Then at Computex, we launched the Haswell family of processors, which delivered the biggest improvement in battery life in Intel's history, making no compromises, high-performance 2-in-1 devices that made all-day battery life a reality. Haswell, along with Bay Trail, will power the more than 50 different 2-in-1 devices in the pipeline, including the very first fanless Core design.
During the same week at Computex, we also announced a landmark tablet design in the Samsung GALAXY Tab3. The GALAXY Tab-3 will use an Atom SoC and our LTE solution, signaling important progress in the tablet space. The Data Center strategy is continuing to pay dividends. Our cloud storage -- cloud and storage business each grew their revenue of more than 40% year-over-year. Networking grew more than 20% and High-performance computing's business won 98% of all new systems entering the Top 500 list. In fact, the #1 system on the Top 500 was all Intel for the first time since 1997, using a combination of Intel Xeon CPUs and Xeon Phi accelerators.
And finally, our investments and expertise in process technology continue to be the foundation of our industry leadership, with 22 nanometer defect density and throughput times at record low levels and 14 nanometer on track into production by the end of the year. Together, these accomplishments highlight to me what's possible when we focus our resources on the right objectives and we hold ourselves accountable for results. At the same time, I understand that we've not always lived up to the standards that we've set for ourselves. Intel was slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trend. The importance of that can be seen in the current market dynamic. The traditional PC market segment is down from our expectations at the beginning of the year, while ultra-mobile devices like tablets are up. Even more important, there will always be another next big thing. It's our job to continue to scan for emerging trends, unlocking, participating in and shaping these nascent markets. Doing that will require some changes in Intel, which we have begun.
Just a few weeks ago, I announced a significant reorganization. The changes we've made throughout the organization improved decision-making and will contribute to our culture of even greater accountability. These elements are critical in the fast-paced ultra-mobile environment. In addition to the organizational changes, we have made several strategy and priority changes that will allow us to focus and win in that environment. These changes will drive a greater emphasis on Atom-based products, bringing the full weight of our process and architectural leadership to the Atom family. We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology and focus on the SoC integration of key components like graphics, communication and other devices. This does not mean we will lessen the value or leadership of our Core product family. But rather, make Atom an equal player in technology leadership for the ultra-mobile space. Both product lines will be driving Intel's future.
Some of the changes we're making are subtle and some are more transformational. In general, you are likely to see us making moves and adjustments in the market before you hear us talking about them. But we'll, of course, have a substantive update for you at the investor meeting in November. What I can say now is that all of the changes are focused on value creation. Our company has a strong record of cash flow generation and returning that cash to our owners. I recognize that we are the stewards of our owners' capital and that tradition will continue. I'm excited about what lies ahead. Intel is a company where there are extraordinary assets at its disposal. And I'm looking forward to making the most out of those assets in an environment where the pace of innovation and market transformation is faster than it's ever been. 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.",908

I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through our second quarter financials and our expectations as we head into the back half of the year. Then we can get right into Q&A. 
The second quarter results came in as expected. Second quarter revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. The Core business came in as expected, but we saw some softness in our baseband business. At a segment level, the PC Group grew 1% sequentially and the Data Center Group grew 6%. As expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly as customers began building Haswell-based PCs. But inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages based on uncertainty heading into the back half of the year. For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range as a result of our expectation that our customers will continue to operate with lean inventory levels exiting the third quarter.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin of 58% was in line with our guidance and up 2 points from the first quarter as a result of the qualification for sale of additional Haswell products and higher volume. As expected, the reduction in excess capacity charges in the second quarter was offset by an increase in 14 nanometer startup costs.
For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 3 points to 61% as we qualify our Bay Trail product line for sale, increase our volume and start to see factory start-up costs come down.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.7 billion. For the third quarter, we're forecasting an increase to total spending of $100 million. The reclassification of spending on process engineers from cost of sales to R&D increases our spending, but we expect this will be mostly offset by spending reductions across the company. These spending reductions allow us to reduce our spending forecast for the year to $18.7 billion.
Operating income for the second quarter was $2.7 billion with earnings per share of $0.39.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, up slightly from the first quarter. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
While our first half financials played out as expected, the overall PC market segment for 2013 is expected to be weaker than we forecasted at the beginning of the year. Our expectation is now that revenue will be approximately flat to last year. As a result, our gross margin forecast for the year is now 59% versus the prior forecast of 60%. Additionally, we have reduced our forecast for capital spending by $1 billion to $11 billion.
We have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the second half of this year across all the segments of our business. Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across the diverse lineup of ultra mobile form factors like 2-in-1 convertibles, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail, which will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablet and PCs. 
In our phone business, we are on-track to ship multimode data and voice LTE baseband solutions as well as our next-generation applications processor, codenamed Merrifield, by the end of the year. 
In the Data Center, we have new microserver and Xeon-class products coming to market in the second half. This leadership product portfolio is built on an extending manufacturing lead, which gives us the world's highest performing, lowest cost and lowest power transistors. Building on this leadership further, we are on track to start production on our 14 nanometer process technology in the back half of this year. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",687

If I look at your guidance for the year and your guidance for Q3, the implication is 7% sequential growth in revenues for the fourth quarter. And I wonder -- that's, obviously, high relative to historical norms, kind of like numbers we saw back in the early part of the last decade. And I wonder what gives you the confidence there. Is there something about the mix, obviously, in your products, is there also something about the mix maybe between Data Center and Client?",98

I would characterize -- I guess I'd say this. It's a little early to get that specific about Q4. At this point, I'd expect seasonal, which is a little less than what you said, but still gets us into that kind of flat year-on-year revenue growth. And I think that the tail for us will really be written in the back half of Q3 when we start to see how our customers are putting in place inventory in anticipation of that fourth quarter selling season. And right now, our view on that is fairly cautious. We expect that it'll continue to run lean inventory levels, but the reality is we won't know that until we get into late August, early September. That's when you normally start to see them putting in the supply line that also aligns with other things in the industry. And so we think that's when we're likely to really get a sense of Q3 and the momentum into Q4.",167

The question is, now that you're in that role for a couple of months and, as you say, you've talked to customers. Today, Intel has very good products in mobile and tomorrow we'll have, arguably, the best products in mobile hitherto today. And I wonder in your discussions with customers, if you think that, that's enough, if the customer base is now open to accepting an x86-based processor, in what has traditionally been on our market or does it matter?",97

As Mark said, it was a little hard to hear you on our side, we're having some network issues. But let me try to answer your question. The question is, can x86 go into these ultra-mobile markets and how the customers view that. And my answer would be they are more than willing to accept it. And the fact that x86 works on both Android and Windows is a real advantage to our OEM base. They look at that and say that they can have 1 architectural design, 1 set of products and use both operating systems. So it's a unique feature that we are able to provide. It's more focused by Intel of actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products in there. You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail. Haswell on the Core side and Bay Trail on the Atom side, really being designed for those ultra-mobile products. We talked about Haswell producing the first fanless Core products out there in the market in any kind of real volume. And then Bay Trail really being designed for the much lower price points that you see these tablets and even down to the entry-level of tablets. And so the fact that it's x86 is an advantage, actually, because we've been able to produce both Android and Windows on our product now.",229

I'll take that one because it was in the CFO commentary that I put out. You should think of it as mix shift for us and share win at the low end of the market. I think if you look at our first half results, you'll see we came in pretty much in line with what we thought, but during a time where the TAM was somewhat weaker than we thought. I think the offset there, the plug is that we gain some share at the low end and so we have a bit more mix at the lower end, and then due to share win in that particular segment of the market.",119

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3126.0,484932.0,22384078.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,16,"Relative to gross margin. Sure. So the start-up cost trend, directionally the same as what we've seen in other generations, it will be the same shape, generally the same impact on gross margin. So you see the peak and start-up costs in the second quarter, will come down some in Q3 and then we'll get a bigger benefit in Q1 and then -- or Q4. And then they'll come down a bit more in the first half of next year. So it's a comparable trend. 
In the fourth quarter, the puts and takes, so let me just do the gross margin progression across the year. We were at 56% in Q1. We hit our forecast in Q2 of 58%. We're expecting a few points of increase in the third quarter to 61%. And then as I think about Q4, I think we have a couple of tailwinds. So I would expect volume to be up some. We should get some good news associated with start-up costs. And then the offset in Q4 is going to be -- we should be well into the build of Broadwell. They're doing the build on the prequalification materials. So my sense is we'll have an increase in inventory write-offs in the fourth quarter and that will offset some of those good news. Net-net of all that, expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be at or maybe a little bit higher than where we are in Q3. And that forecast in another 90 days. And just -- certainly, we don't get lost in code names, that product is our lead product on 14 nanometer. So that kind of aligns with being in manufacturing and the back half of the year on 14 nanometer.",290

So I don't know if anything really surprised me. I think the things that were positive for me is that our customers, especially, they want Intel to get into this expanding ultra-mobile market. They're looking for Intel to be stronger and have a better and more capable product lineup in there. And they're excited about the products that we have coming. The Haswell and Bay Trail. So it's a -- the key message that they've been giving us, though, is we really want you there, we see the products coming, we want even more and we want a faster lineup following those. And so that you hear -- you heard in my speech today and in the earnings release, that we're really putting much, much stronger effort on Atom and driving our SoC integration and pulling it forward to the leading-edge. So I'd say that was the major point or major comments I got back from our customer base.",160

I'd say it's a couple of things. And I'll also say what we're guiding for Q3 is some seasonal growth. So it's off of -- an okay Q2, but not a gangbuster Q2. So I don't think it's a widely optimistic forecast. In terms of the tailwinds that I see, first and foremost is the product cycle. Haswell is a great product for Ultrabooks and 2-in-1s. And as Brian said, with Bay Trail coming to the marketplace, we're going to be hitting price points in the touch-enabled segment of the PC market that we've never touched before. And we will be able to do that profitably. And we'll start to gain share in tablets. We've got kind of our first big tablet wins out in the marketplace. And with Bay Trail, we think, again, will enable other designs to come to market at price points that are going to be, I think, nice year in consumer price points. The second tailwind that I'd say is we expect, generally, an improving macroeconomic climate as we go into the back half. I think that's in line with most economists. In the first half, the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we had thought starting the year, China was a little bit weaker, but, generally, I'd expect an improving macroeconomic environment in the back half.",224

And I think that's driving a concern in the investment community with whether or not Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to cannibalize Haswell. And so I guess I'd like to get your thoughts on how do you can segment the market properly? To what extent do you think you're a slave to market forces and to what extent do you think you can bring applications that are mid intensive into the ecosystem and secure the Core business even as you try to get more aggressive in Bay Trail and Atom?",113
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3126.0,484932.0,22384087.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,25,"Sure. So first, let me tell you, I -- our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don't believe it will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe -- what it really does is allows us to get into these markets that we're not in, in a big way, today. And that as Stacy said, on these sub $400, sub $300 in some case, clamshells and touch-enabled convertibles and 2-in-1 devices. In tablets, $199 and below, some you're going to see even lower, below $150 and much below that as we go to the holiday season. So Bay Trail really, first and foremost, we believe, gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the competition in price points in markets that we're simply not in, in a big way, today. So we look at it mostly as an expansive. The other thing that I'd make as a point is Haswell, as we said, is the largest battery life improvement in Intel's history, along with great performance and it's providing products that have Core level performance that will be fanless for the first time. So we still believe that there's a strong drive for performance in segments of this market that look for high-def video performance, gaming. All of the things that, if you actually look at a lot of the tablets usage even, people are doing more and more. And definitely in these 2-in-1 convertible devices, people look for that kind of application. So we believe that Haswell allowing us to go down into those better price points and lower powers, will give us the performance option to keep people up into those regions.",276

First off, just to reinforce what Brian said, there still is a big gap in terms of performance and features between the best of Bay Trail and the Core i3, i5, i7 segment of our product line. And if you look at the last 3 years, even in a time where the market has been relatively weak, Core i5, i7 volumes have been very healthy. And if anything, we've seen a larger mix overall to Core over that time period. So as I said, there's still this healthy segmentation in the marketplace. Where Bay Trail will play, it will start to expand into markets where we don't play today. And because of the cost structure, we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we would be able to do if we were going after that segment, say, with Celeron or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful product from that perspective, John.",187

And then as my follow-on, Stacy, several years back, you put out a long-term gross margin target of sort of 55% to 65%.

I'm just kind of curious, as you start bringing Bay Trail, Merrifield, put a renewed effort into the Atom space, should we think that the next 3 years, that range is going to be more directed towards the lower half? Or are there other puts and takes within that gross margin range?",101

We're running at a 61% gross margin at the company level. As Brian said, the market is going to go where it's going to go.

Let me go there. So first, I'd say, we would actually expect that overall compute units, so tablet up to your PCs, they'll be down some this year. And that's consistent with the flat revenue forecast for the company. So let me just kind of walk you through. And I'll just start with what you've seen from Gartner and IDC of their view of the year. We're pretty aligned with those numbers in terms of our view of the classic PC market. But to get to then our units, you have to make some adjustments to that. So first off, in their classic view of PCs, that will not include some of the ultra-mobile devices, i.e. the Microsoft Surface Pro. So you'd add that in to get to our PC Client Group units. We think we're gaining some share in tablets, so that's a little bit of an offset. Netbooks, for us, is declining pretty significantly. That's not in the PC Client Group segment, that's in the other IAG segment. And then as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, we think we gained some share, so that also gives us a little bit of help. But when you net all that out, you'd say our units and our revenue for the PC Client Group is down year-over-year. It's just not down as much as the headline number that you'll see from Gartner. So you start there. And then the offsets to that, the places where we're going, is Data Center Group, which we think grows in the low double-digits, if you do manage your math on that, it's 20% of our revenue. So that adds a couple of points to growth to the company. NAND is probably worth 1 point on its own. They look to be having a good year. You have some other smaller things, but you kind of net that out against the PC Client Group that's down a bit and you get to flat for the year. So just kind of in rough math, that's how I'm viewing the different segments. Did that answer your question?",353

And as my follow-up, if I could carve into the Data Center a little bit. So you are still -- looks like you're still looking for low double-digit growth in this business. That seems to be unchanged from the last couple of quarters. Does that not imply a very significant ramp both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year? I mean, in the ballpark of 15% to 20% sequentially as well as year-over-year in the second half. Can you give us some -- I guess, where your confidence comes from that you're going to get that kind of growth in the Data Center in the second half. Is it all macro or is it something else? What drives that?",119

I'll answer that one. Yes, we're still confident in the second half growth of our Data Center business overall. As we mentioned, we're seeing strong growth in the cloud, the High-performance computing, our networking and our storage. And we think those continue through the second half of this year. What was down, as Stacy mentioned, was the enterprise data centers were down a bit in the first half. We think as the macroeconomics continue to improve through this year, that picks up a bit. And when you put that all together, we believe that, absolutely, we -- our view is that we can continue through this year with that low double-digit growth.",116

You said that the hard drives or storage and networking, all this other stuff, was up 20% to 40%. I think your total Data Center business in the first half year-over-year is just flat to up a little bit. So that enterprise piece had to have been down quite a bit year-over-year in the second half. So you're saying that you're going to see a very significant reversal of that trend in the second half?",86

In the first half of last year, we were in the steep part of the ramp for Romley. In the second half of this year, we'll be launching other versions of Ivy Bridge into the Data Center. So you -- so the short answer to your question is yes, I would expect some pretty steep quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comps in the back half of this year. That is what we're planning for.",89

On that focus on the ultra-mobility side of things. Can you talk a little bit about what that implies for the OpEx for Intel? The OpEx is elevated as a percentage of sales versus where it's been historically, mainly on the R&D side. My understanding is the majority of that spending is for the mobile effort. Is your efforts to expedite that process likely to mean more OpEx to deliver those better results? And maybe a follow-on to that is when do we get either results on the top line happening or you rationalize some of that OpEx?",103
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3126.0,484932.0,22384105.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,43,"Sure. So let me start. The simple answer is no, we're not going to increase our OpEx spending. And in fact, what we really been focusing on is managing that, as well. What you're going to see, and remember this, as we move our architecture more and more towards SoC, a lot of the work we do bridges between Core and Atom. And as we pull Atom forward on to the leading-edge technology, again, that allows a lot of the architectural work to be in alignment and be shared amongst the 2 products. So we believe that we can move faster on Atom and into this ultra-mobility space without having to change or increase our OpEx. So absolutely, that's the current model that we're working under. From a -- when will you start to see it, some of these changes have been started a while back. And you see Bay Trail coming out towards the end of this year. It's a product that is on that Atom Core, that is truly industry-leading. We talked earlier about a lot of the benchmarks coming out, showing it very strong against the competition, if not leading the competition in many of the metrics. And so we believe that you'll start to see some of this just naturally over the next 6 months as Bay Trail ramps up and gets into production. Now we have a series of products after that and you'll see more and more acceleration. So don't think of this as a one-time shift where you'll see a digital move. Look at it as a constant pushing of the accelerator down and the thing just gets faster and faster as time goes by. And so you'll just see more and more strength of that Atom line as time goes through here. And you'll be kind of -- you'll look back and say, wow, it's obvious that Atom line has truly become strong and they've got share in the tablet space.",329

You, I'm sure, noticed we brought down the overall spending forecast for the company. We know that we're running hot in terms of spending as a percentage of revenue. We've been very consciously making investments in that space. What I've seen of Brian in his tenure is, he is very focused on driving that efficiency and bringing it down. We'll come down a few points between where we were in Q2 and the end of the year in terms of spending as a percent of revenue. And the expectation is we can come down more next year.",119

And efficiency and structure that we put in, both the reorganization that we did and flattening and decision-making, and just the cost things that we've already put in through efficiencies in both the OpEx and the CapEx that you saw. We expect that same level of efficiency to keep moving forward even as we make this transition. So to me, those are not separated. Those go hand-in-hand, actually, as you become more efficient.",110

Switching gears, again for BK but on the foundry side of things. I think Paul described it that you're no longer crawling on the first quarter conference call. I know that's a business that's near and dear to your heart, given your prior job. Can you give us some benchmarks that we should watch for to deem the success or lack thereof that Intel plans to have? And generally speaking, can you explain how your strategy in foundry may be any different than the prior CEO?",89
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3126.0,484932.0,22384113.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,51,"Sure. You have to remember that even when you sign up a foundry customer, it's 18 to 24, sometimes even longer, 30 months before that foundry customer is able to start producing product. Especially when they move from one foundry to another as they do -- go through their design cycle and their product qualification. So you should think even the customers that we've already signed up that you've heard about in the press, those revenues and that impact on Intel's bottom line is still a ways out. And any changes we'd make in strategy or additional customers we'd make now will have that same timeline. I think, again, Paul said it right, you want to kind of crawl, walk, run. Not necessarily because that's what we should do in order to manage it, it's more you really want to make sure that the systems and the customer support models that you have are in place to handle the volume that you're really taking on. And since we haven't been a foundry business all our life, we wanted to go and make sure we really knew what we were doing there. We are moving from, I'd say, that crawl space to the, at least, the walk space. I think that the philosophy we have moving forward is that we're going to treat every one of these customers that come to us and come talk to us about foundry opportunities individually and look at them from a strategic standpoint, what size of business they bring. And whether their products can really take advantage of our process leadership. And so we don't take a look at this as separating out the do -- we will or won't. We're taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders, from bringing value to the shareholders with this technology that we have.",318

As we said on the call, our view of the overall market is less now than it was when we started the year. I think you've seen us trying to be very responsive to changes in demand and get the balance right. And so as our view of the market changed, we saw some opportunities for things that we thought we were going to put in place this year that we no longer have to put in place. And it's across-the-board, is no one thing. Similar to what you saw in Q1, we've got opportunities to drive more reuse. Here, we're finding some opportunities to push some capital out of the year. Some of it is 450, not based on schedule changes but it's just based on some efficiencies that we're able to find and shortening the time it takes us to install certain things and that kind of stuff. Some of it is M&E for the 14 nanometer. Some of it is space. But just a variety of kind of small things that added up to $1 billion.",186

It does change my round. I was rounding up to 2 and now it will round to 1.5. But it's -- in the scheme of the $1 billion change, it's not the largest driver. It's not even that large of a driver. I think it's interesting when you deconstruct the CapEx and you just kind of get down to the level of CapEx that's in place for kind of current run rate, you take out the 450, you can take out some the capital that's being spent, not necessarily for our current production but things like IT and labs. You take out some of the greenfield space that we built in place. And you get down to a run rate of CapEx kind of in support of the current business, it's in the mid-50s in -- $55 billion or so in revenue, in that range. That is, I think, a nice, healthy level. A nice, sustainable level. And I can run at that level and generate a 60% gross margins. So it feels pretty good from that perspective. And as we said, we're continuing to try to balance the CapEx relative to the business size.",206

And if I -- I'll use my follow-up on the CapEx as well. So it's great to see the CapEx come down from the 13 originally to the 11 today. The first half spending is 4.9. So that would still imply pretty far below the 11. Obviously, that shell -- maybe a little more of that shell comes in the back half. So that would be some of the increase in the back half CapEx. But can we get any kind of hope that, potentially, even 11 is a number that there's some downside to?",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3126.0,484932.0,22384127.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,65,"No -- so first, the linearity -- the more of that shell -- most of that shell, frankly, is in the back half of the year. So that shifts the linearity. And you'll also see the 14 nanometer spending going back up in the back half. So it's kind of a back-half loaded year. I think, as I've said earlier, we will -- we will continue to look for the right balance between the capital and demand. But I want to stress when you really deconstruct our CapEx, it's kind of $7 billion to $8 billion of capital being spent to support a business that's in the mid-$50 billion in revenue. It's the right level of CapEx. I'm very comfortable with that. It's not putting in a bunch of incremental capacity. And it's a level that I can sustain gross margin that's in that range that I've been talking about and kind of the -- right at 60%.",158

And keep in mind, that Atom spans from servers to the PC segment of the market now, where we're enabling these $299 price point to phones to tablets, right? So there's -- it's worthwhile to have a deeper discussion about the different segments. As we articulated earlier, generally, when you're looking at the predominance of our volume, the Core business, when Atom is price point replacing a Celeron or a Pentium, we're doing it at a better margin dollars per unit than we were selling Celeron into that space and we're enabling lower price points. So from that perspective, it's a great product and lets us kind of fight on the front foot and go after markets profitably that we tried to go after before.

Should we have the view that PC is, basically, past the peak, continues to decline? And if not, what catalyst do you see going forward?

My answer would be simply Haswell has been not a single product launch. Let me start first with Haswell. We launched the quad Core products in the second quarter. As we go into the third quarter, the Dual-Core products, which go more into those lower price point regions, is actually going out to the market. So it's a staggered launch, which is a little bit different than we've done with some other products. So we're just now really starting to see the ramp of Haswell into the consumers' hands. So I think it's really way too early to say here's where Haswell is. And you're just going to see, as we move into the second half, the fanless devices with Haswell. As we move forward, Bay Trail and 14 nanometers as we move into next year, well, you can imagine will drive prices and battery life and the number of fanless devices up even more. So that will be my first answer. The second answer, I'd tell you, what's different moving forward, again we've kind of talked about this, is Bay Trail. Bay Trail is going into some of these same classic PC devices that you see today. The clamshells, where they've got touch-enabled clamshells coming down into the $300 range. You're going to see convertible clamshells where you can detach or flip and it acts as both a tablet or a PC, in the sub $400 range, right around $400. And as we move into next year, those price points will continue to drop. So the fact that PCs, especially with Bay Trail, are going to move down into this -- let's call it $200 to $400 range, is going to shift that market, we believe, as well. And that's different than what's been out over the last few years. So you've got fanless Haswell, you've got Bay Trail coming in, all of those things allowing devices that haven't been allowed in the past with our designs.",337

During the third quarter, our revenue grew 5% sequentially and was flat versus the third quarter of 2012. Year-over-year, PC CPU volume declined, slowed and were offset by solid growth in the Data Center and Enterprise. While consumer demand in emerging markets was sluggish, we started to see early signs of improvement in North America and Western Europe. 
I see our performance in this environment as evidence of an increasingly broad and diverse product portfolio. I'd like to highlight a few of the most important results from the quarter. Following the launch of Ivy Bridge EP and the Atom-based Avoton SoCs, the Data Center Group delivered all-time record revenue. DCG saw strength across its lines of business and geographies. Cloud revenue was up 40% year-over-year; Storage was up 20% and High-Performance Computing was up 27%. Even traditional enterprise servers were up a bit over the last year on the strength of our MP product line.
While the Data Center Group's results demonstrate some of Intel's Core capabilities, we saw strong performance beyond DCG. Our Embedded business grew 21% year-over-year, reaching an all-time record for revenue, driven by communications infrastructure, transportation, The Internet of Things and retail. Embedded revenue is well on its way to a double-digit growth year. 
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our newest product family, Quark, an ultra-low-power and low-cost architecture. And while any significant revenue impact is some time away, the architecture and the speed with which we're bringing it to market are evidence of the changes we're making to ensure we're in a better position to lead and define technology trends moving forward.
And finally, our NAND business grew 20% over last year as enterprise and data center customers' increasing use of high-performance SSDs have put this segment on a path to double-digit growth for the year. We continue to make progress with the industry's first 14-nanometer manufacturing process and our second-generation 3D transistors. 
Broadwell, the first product on 14-nanometer, is up and running as we demonstrated at the Intel Developer Forum last month. And while we're comfortable with where we're at with yields, from a timing standpoint, we're about a quarter behind our projections. As a result, we're now planning to begin production in the first quarter of next year.
In the Wireless business, I was pleased with our progress on LTE. Our multimode data modem is now available in the Samsung GALAXY Tab 3. By the end of the year, we expect to have voice-over LTE versions available for customers. And our second-generation of voice-over LTE product with carrier aggregation will be available in the first half of next year.
Over the past couple of months, we've also launched 15 new 22-nanometer Atom SoCs. These products are designed for markets ranging from consumer tablets to cloud data centers. During the holiday selling season, you'll see Atom SOCs and tablets as low as $99 and in 2-in-1 systems as low as $349. 
At the same time, you'll also find Haswell systems with outstanding performance and 50% better battery life using Windows 8, Mac OS and Chrome as low as $299. Together, Bay Trail and Haswell are making possible a range of innovative new form factors at breakthrough price points. 
The past few years have seen dramatic changes in the way consumers use and interact with technology, and those trends aren't slowing down. And while preferences for form factor, OSs and price points have evolved, the market appetite for computing has continued to grow. We're going into the fourth quarter with the broadest portfolio in Intel's history, positioned to fully participate in all of that growth. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",614

The third quarter revenue came in as expected and gross margin was slightly better than the midpoint of the forecasted range. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter. 
At a segment level, the PC Client Group grew 4% sequentially and the Data Center Group grew 6%. The Data Center Group returned to double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, growing 12% from a year ago. As expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly as customers built Haswell-based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.7 billion, up 2% from the third quarter. Relative to the historical seasonal increase, the fourth quarter forecast reflects the orders we are seeing from our customers and their desire to keep inventory levels lean. 
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 62% was up 4 points from the second quarter and up 1 point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was as a result of lower platform unit costs, higher platform revenue and lower write-offs. In addition, factory startup costs came down in the third quarter as spending on process engineers was reclassified from cost of sales to R&D. For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to decrease by 1 point to 61% as we increase factory spending on 14-nanometer.
For the third quarter, spending was down $100 million from expectations and flat from the second quarter at $4.7 billion. The $100 million decrease from expectations was as a result of a lot of small actions across the company to reduce spending. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting spending consistent with the third quarter at $4.7 billion. 
In order to better align resources with our priorities, during the third quarter, we approved and communicated several restructuring actions. Restructuring charges in the third quarter were just north of $100 million, and we expect restructuring in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. 
Operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 billion, with earnings per share of $0.58. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $19.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $6 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock. Inventories were flat from the second quarter.
The fourth quarter revenue forecast of up 2% reflects the caution we are seeing from our customers due to weak consumer end markets for the PC segment of our business. That said, we are seeing some important positive trends. The enterprise market for PCs strengthened in the third quarter, and the consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe appeared to have bottomed out. Our Data Center business returned to double-digit year-on-year growth based on a resumption of growth in the enterprise market segment and continued robust growth in cloud, high-performance computing and storage.
From a product perspective, we have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to the market this holiday season. Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across a diverse lineup of ultramobile form factors like 2-in-1 convertibles, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. We are also starting to see our customers come to market with Bay Trail-based designs that will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs. 
This extension of our product lineup across devices, price points and operating systems positions us to grow our business across a broad range of compute devices. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",629

If you look at the IDC data, they actually showed sequential growth that was a little higher than yours. So I know you got tired of us asking all the time why you guys were above them when they were negative. Just any reconciliation that you could give us on -- yes, they looked like they showed sort of 8% sequential growth reconciliation of their numbers to yours.",76

But when we look at their view of the year and our view of the year, it still is roughly in line. So it could come down to just what's happening in inventory pipeline, sometimes differences come down to what's happening in China. But I think we're pretty aligned with their view. Remember, our unit growth will be a little higher than what they show in their headline PC number because our unit growth will include things like tablets and 2-in-1s and things like that.",104

And then the comment that inventories in the PC supply chain built slightly sequentially but are still below normal. Can you characterize what's going on there? And where do you expect that to go over the course of the rest of this year?",45
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165226.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,9,"Yes, I think it's a continuation, Joe, of what we have seen really in the last 4 or 5 quarters that the -- our customers are managing the worldwide inventory of PC supplies to lean levels. I think it's a reflection of just how dynamic the industry is, in some of the markets how volatile it is. So they're keeping inventory levels low. That was true in Q2, it's true in Q3 and the expectation in Q4 is that people will continue to manage things lean. And I'll say for our own inventory levels, we've taken $1 billion-plus out of our aggregate inventory. It was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. And again, as I think about Q4, I think we'll keep our inventory levels flat to down from this.",127

We don't see those as varying greatly amongst them, so we see all of those segments growing as we move into the fourth quarter. And as we said in our prepared statements, what we saw in the third quarter and we believe will move into the fourth quarter as well is a stabilization in what I'll call the mature markets, U.S., Western Europe and with Asia and especially China still remaining relatively volatile. And that's where we see the growth as well as in mature and emerging Western Europe and U.S. markets.",96

Brian was talking about the clients there. In the server market, we saw nice unit growth in Q3, and I'd actually expect that unit growth on a year-over-year basis to accelerate in Q4. So I think we'll have an acceleration of server DCG revenue growth when we get into the fourth quarter. And that'll be significantly above the corporate average.",71

And then as you look at this kind of touch-enabled device, how those expectations of adoption of that progress through the year and as you look to the holiday season.",61

This is again, Brian. So remember, Bay Trail has always been a second half and really a late second half introduction product, and that was a pull-in. So we pulled that in, in order to bring it into 2013. We've seen great adoption. We have over 50 design wins, with about half of those being 2-in-1 devices. We talked about those devices hitting new price points. The other place Bay Trail is going into is tablets. We think that by Black Friday, you'll see 8 to 10 SKUs on shelf. So that's less than we'd hoped for, but that still shows -- the 50 design wins shows really strong adoption. The second part of your question was around touch, which is a broader question. We continue to see touch adoption growing month by month as the price points come down, and the price point adder now is below $50. We've put touch as a requirement for the fourth generation Core Ultrabooks. And you're seeing Bay Trail clamshells with touch-enabled at $299, which is a new, real price point for touch-enabled devices. So we see it continuing to grow as we enter next year.",194

You even talked about Avaton and low-power server. Your notebook ASP, I think, was also down slightly year-over-year. Can you talk about and give us some perspective on the trajectory of your ASPs longer term? And then I mean, is this something that really concerns you guys?",62
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165235.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,18,"ASP for us will really be a function of mix. I think we have a very strong competitive position when you think about the server segment of our business, the Core segment of our product line. I think the pricing within the bands in those markets is pretty stable. We haven't been increasing pricing even at a time period where our ASP increases. It's just been a function of mix. And so if I think out at the next couple of years, what I think will happen is you'll see those higher-end price bands, we're driving for some low level of growth. You'll see faster growth at the low-end price bands and then you'll see faster growth in the server segment of our business, and how it plays out to the average is going to be a function of mix. The thing you don't want to lose here though and we've talked about it before is that we have very different cost structures among the different segments of the business. So for us, Bay Trail, if I could, has a lower ASP, isn't necessarily a bad thing relative to a Celeron because it also has a much better cost structure relative to the Celeron.",204

And then also I think you talked about a delay of Broadwell production by a quarter. If you had reentered this quarter, what would the impact have been to gross margins? I guess in other words, what are some of the things we should think about when that production actually ramps?",54
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165237.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,20,"Yes. So no impact to Q3 gross margin and you can see that on the reconciliation and no impact to Q4 gross margin from what we were expecting. We would -- as I kind of telegraphed on the call last time, 14-nanometer spending was projected and will increase quarter-on-quarter. That will be about 0.5 point decrement to gross margin but that's the same decrement. It will probably hit us in different buckets, but it's the same impact on gross margin.",80

Also, I'd give you the same answer as I think about 2014. Roughly speaking, the spending on 14-nanometer is going to be the same, which means that the gross margin impact over the course of 2014 will be the same as it was. Again, it may hit in different buckets, but it will be the same gross margin impact.",61

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165242.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,25,"Yes. That's probably a better conversation for the Investor Meeting that's in a month. I'll start to give some of the puts and takes on 2014 gross margin and how we're viewing the business. But it is related back to the question that was just asked on the 14-nanometer push. And so let me walk you through a little bit about the categorization in Q4, which may give you some insight into how this could play out. As I said and as Brian said, we're moving production on 14-nanometer out about a quarter. We're seeing an increase in 14-nanometer spending in Q4 as we would have expected. What we thought a quarter ago and what I telegraphed on the call is that as that spending increases and we start production, we move costs from start-up to production costs, but then we reserve it out. And if you remember last quarter on the call, I said expect some headwinds in Q4 to gross margin because we'd have an increase in reserves. Well, as we push the production date, what you'll see is the same impact on gross margin, but in Q4, it's likely to be a little bit of an increase in start-up cost and then you won't see the reserve impact that we had expected a quarter ago. So slightly different buckets. I'd still expect next year, you'll see a reduction in startup costs and maybe a little less than what we've seen in other even-numbered years, but then you'll see an offset on the other side of that of reserves. And so the same gross margin impact over the course of the year.",274

And for my follow-up, Brian, could you give us an idea of your first couple of quarters here? And we've noticed clearly with Quark and your move to try to make the company move a little quicker, we're now having some restructuring charges. Where are those restructuring charges targeted at? And what might be some the trigger points that you have to make you move the ship in a different direction? Is the slowdown in PCs or notebooks? Is there a trigger point that makes you change the way in which you attack some of these businesses?",98
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165244.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,27,"Sure. So first, I would separate a bit the restructuring charges from our desire to move quicker and into broader markets. Restructuring charges were mostly around the shutdown of the Hudson, Massachusetts factory. And that was really talking about a factory that was our last 200-millimeter factory on 130 nanometers and that factory had just finished its life as a factory and it couldn't be upgraded to 14-nanometers or beyond. So that's what most of that was. And in general, restructuring charges aren't necessarily driven by how you move an organization like this into innovative new areas. For me, the way I look at this is, this is really about pushing our architecture in both directions. It's moving down and moving Atom to be more integrated, more capable, with higher graphics and higher connectivity and in moving up on the data center side with more robust products there, more integration up there and more unique products by customer and by workload to target those areas that can utilize our Core technologies. And the trigger points for me as we move through these is really around how fast is the organization able to adapt. So we have a process coming, where we want to be able to adjust products because we believe these markets are going to be changing up until the last minute before you ship something. So 3 or 4 months before a product is going to ship, we want to get to a point where we could make changes in the characteristics of those products. And we're a ways away from that, maybe 1 year, 1.5 years, but we believe we can get to a place where we have the kind of flexibility and IP configuration that we can do that.",293

I'm going to give -- I'll give Brian a little more credit here than he was giving himself. He's right in the restructuring piece. The asset impairment is almost entirely driven by the factory. The larger portion of that is the people movement piece of it. And I think Brian and Renée are both moving fast in terms of picking areas where they want to make investments, picking areas where we're going to invest less, and so that's the lion's share of that particular line item. And almost all of the Q4 number is just as we're looking to move people from 1 part of the company to make investments in an area where we think we're going to get an enhanced return.",125

I'm just kind of curious why the pushout? Can you elaborate a little bit? Is this a technical issue? And if it is, why are you confident you overcame it? Or is this really a market issue, i.e. there's a little bit excess Ivy Bridge inventory, which is pushing out Haswell, which is the ramp, which is pushing out Broadwell. If you can elaborate, that would be great.",75

It's absolutely not the latter. It was simply a defect density issue. This was -- as we develop these technologies, what you do is you're continually improving the defect densities, and those resulted in a yield, the number of die per wafer that you get out of the product. And what happens is you insert a set of fixes in groups. You'll put 4 or 5, maybe sometimes 6 or 7 fixes into a process and group it together and run it through. And you expect an improvement rate. Occasionally, as you go through that, you -- the fixes don't deliver all of the improvement you thought. We had one of those. Why do I have confidence? Because we've gone back now and added additional fixes, gotten back on to that curve so we have confidence that the problem is fixed because we have actually data that it is fixed. And so that gives us the confidence that we're getting keep moving forward now. And that happens sometimes in these development phases like this. So that's why we're going to move it a quarter. Remember, Broadwell and Haswell are pin compatible, so they're -- for the most part, these will slide into existing systems, and it delivers the next-generation of the low-power Broadwell Y, which is going to give even more capability for fanless Core products. So we and our OEM partners have a strong desire to get Broadwell to the market. So if I could, there would be nothing slowing me down. This is a small blip in the schedule, and we'll continue on from here.",268

That's helpful, Brian. And as my follow-up, Stacy, the last couple of quarters relative to the gross margin bridge or puts or takes, you've kind of given ASP as a potential allowance on the downside. And I guess I didn't see that in Q4, which kind of confuses me a little bit, given that that's the Bay Trail quarter ramp. And so I'm kind of curious are you just getting more confidence as you're mixing lower that, that ASP is not a factor in gross margin or how should I think about that?",94

So yes, I mean, as we're successful with Bay Trail, it will cause the average ASP to come down in the Client Group. But keep in mind, we're forecasting a very robust growth rate in the data center. And so you have kind of the highest end of the Intel product family growing significantly faster than the rest. By the way, I think it's also notable in Q3, our ASP was up a smidge. It was about 0.5 point of gross margin good news, which was better than I expected.",102

I'll take those and Brian can editorialize on our elected representatives. The -- on the Data Center, yes, we're -- don't pin me down to exactly 10% growth, but we're going to be within spitting distance of that for the year. That does imply a growth rate that's significantly accelerated from the 12% that we had in Q3, and that's what I expect and that's what Brian expects from the GM of that business. Generally, what we're seeing -- Brian talked about the really robust growth rates we're seeing in the cloud, high-performance computing, storage and we've seen a resumption of some growth rate in the enterprise, which has been headwind that we've been facing in that business. To your question on the debt ceiling debate, I'd say we have not seen any impact in our business. I think generally, the financial markets have been pretty tame in their reaction to this.

I think this is a case where at least up until recent times, especially in the U.S., as companies became more comfortable with what the spending horizon was going to be and what their projections for the rest of the year were, they started to unleash IT budgets, and so we started to see an uptick in that, especially Western Europe and the U.S. started to continue -- started to grow again slightly. Do we think it will be -- continue? At least through the fourth quarter. We're not making any projections yet for 2014. We'll talk about those at our Investor Meeting.

We don't enter businesses to lose money, so our intent is to improve it. I think it's probably worthwhile to talk about what's happening when you do year-over-year, quarter-on-quarter, probably year-over-year is the more illustrative portion of that. What you see going on in other IA is, first and foremost, the embedded or the Intelligent Systems Group had a very good quarter, record revenues, robust growth rate, very profitable. Offsetting that is really 3 things that impact the operating profit. So first, netbooks are coming to the end of their life as a category. We're down to some single-digit millions of revenue from netbooks. A year ago, that was pretty robust and those were pretty profitable products. A year ago, if you recall, we were talking about a buying pattern from 1 particular customer in the modem space. That didn't repeat this year, so you got a little bit of a year-on-year comp. And then the other impact is this is a place where we've been making significant investments. The things that we've been talking about here of having products, SOCs that span across price points, across operating systems, those are places where we're making investment. We believe that investment is really important to the future of the company and we believe that investment gives us a differentiated, competitive advantage out in time and let's us bring the best products to the market out in time.",253

Is it not the right form factor for OEMs, which is causing -- and we all understand the macro is pretty anemic.

If your question is around the number and variety of form factors, we're actually pretty excited about the rate of innovation we're seeing in 2-in-1s, in convertibles, in OS forms, Android, Chromebooks, Win 8, 8.1. So we've been pretty enthusiastic about what we're seeing and in fact, we've been meeting with most of our customers and OEMs and looking at their Q1 lineup with them. And I mean, I've been astonished by the amount of innovation and creative designs that are coming. I think when you talk about just the market in general, how we see it, we're trying to bring innovation to the PC, but we're also trying to move into these markets that are growing already like tablets and phones. And so our view is that at the end of the day, the customer is going to choose their form factors. And tablets are absolutely here to stay, and we plan to participate in those. And that's why you see us in tablets from $99 to $350. And our job is to try to innovate and actually drive capabilities into the tablet space that nobody else could deliver and bring that valuation and drive up in those markets. Across PCs, we believe that as 2-in-1s, especially Haswell-based 2-in-1s with all-day battery come to life, we are already seeing some signs of tablet market share win-back as these 2-in-1 devices, especially in enterprise and the business side, hit the market, and people see the value of having both devices -- the best of both devices, a tablet and a PC all-in-one. And so we believe that as we go through the fourth quarter and we get more of these devices out there, we'll see how this plays out over time now.",302

And then on the pricing front, Stacy, you highlighted yes, pricing could be lower on the mix, but then cost is lower for Bay Trail. But I'm just looking at the dichotomy in desktop and notebook and maybe there's a very simple explanation. Desktop volume is down year-over-year, ASP is up, notebook is the reverse. On the ASP front, ASP is down year-over-year, but volume is down as well. So could you just help me understand why the difference in the 2 trends?",86

I think it's as simple as that. I think that the desktop piece also is really interesting. What we're seeing in the desktop, again, I'm kind of zooming out and taking a 2-year view. You've seen a segment that's been relatively slow growth. Think of it as kind of single-digit percent growth, but a lot of segmentation happening within the category. And so it's gone from the desktop business being primarily these beige boxes to all-in-ones, and detachable all-in-ones and pretty high-performance devices that are doing gaming, as well as these very cost-effective machines for first-time buyers in emerging markets. So you've seen this hypersegmentation of the category and more stability in the pricing as a result because you have these different segments. I think we're on the verge of seeing that kind of segmentation play out now on in the notebook segment with what we're seeing with 2-in-1s and Ultrabooks and detachables and convertibles, so it'll be interesting to watch that play out.",187

We have not changed our timing. We're still targeting the second, later half of this decade. We continue to see great value in 450. It's -- it brings tremendous economic value to everybody who participates in it. We can -- we continue to work with our partners. We are part of the joint development program in New York, continuing to work on 450. We continue to work with our partners, especially TSMC and Samsung, and we're still targeting the back half of this decade. This is a long 10-year program when you really take a look at it.

When you're talking average die size, it's really going to be a function of mix. So it becomes hard to answer. I think when you look at it by segment, we're improving our cost structure in each of the segments of the business, so die size is going to get better in the Core family. It's going to get better in Bay Trail. It's going to get better in the tablet segment of the business, but the mix will really dictate the average. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that.",105

Each one of the families of products, we have roadmaps with -- even with integration, but because of Moore's Law, we have to continually drive down the die size. It's going to be mix-dependent. We think, if you look at the average mix, it will be down slightly. But it's not a dramatic drop at least, but again, it will be mix-driven.",68

And then if I could ask for my follow-up, in terms of the mobile market, the handset market in particular, how important do you think connectivity and the other surrounding pieces around the processor are for Intel to be successful in this market? And how do you feel you're positioned in those complementary pieces around the processor?",60

The connectivity and comms both are very important. We've had Wi-Fi for 12-plus years, so our position in Wi-Fi is good. We've made acquisitions in GPS and GNSS lately to add to our portfolio. And we've talked about in the prepared statements about our progress on LTE, and we actually believe we're making great progress in LTE. We have LTE data now, LTE data and voice. By the end of the year, LTE with carrier aggregation first half of next year. That's very good progress in our minds on LTE. I want to remind you though, that it's really -- when you take a look at these SoC products, it's about all of the IPs. So you've got to get the graphics right, you've got to get the connectivity right and you've got to get the comms right. And we really have a drive to both get our individual IPs correctly there and then to integrate them into the silicon. And that's kind of the order that you have to do it in. You have to go get the IP correct, that's why you see us -- our LTE products standalone now, and then you integrate them in once you get the capability in a standalone product, and we'll be working on that next year.",216

Can you help us quantify traditional enterprise versus some of the growth categories in cloud, storage and networking? And where I'm going with that is when does this lateral growth part start dominating and what are the implications on ASP when that happens?",50

I mean, if you take a look at it, we said that cloud, storage, networking, we're growing 20-plus percent. I'd have to go back and take a look. We can have that discussion maybe at the Investor Meeting on how those percentages of the business change over time.",60

And what you'll see there is enterprise is 40%, 50% of the overall enterprise segment. These other segments in aggregate are overtaking it kind of as we speak and growing really fast. So -- and we'll talk a lot more about that in a month.",79

And then as my follow-up, I wanted to just get a sense for how much of a leapfrog advantage does 14 nanometer provide in the mobile market? Because recently, we saw very impressive benchmarks from Apple on their A7 SoC. I understand that they optimize a lot of things within their system that other customers may not be able to do, but they were able to show very impressive benchmarks on 28-nanometer silicon. And I'm wondering, as you think about your 14-nanometer products and the fact that you really need to leapfrog to get major share in mobile, how should we think about how big those advantages will be, right, what the discussion with customers have been so far?",121
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2013",2013-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3156.0,527988.0,24165299.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,82,"Sure. So let's make sure we -- I mean, you just kind of used the generic word of benchmarks, and there's a lot of different ones that are out there. And so I'm not sure exactly which ones you're talking about. But if you just take a look at our products, and all of our products are 64-bit, so we've had that for an extended period of time, and the products that we're shipping today are already 64-bit. If you take a look at things like transistor density and you compare, pardon the pun, apples-to-apples and you compare, say, an A7 to our Bay Trail, which is the high density 22-nanometer technology, then our transistor density is higher or more dense than the A7 is. So it's a good product. I'm not in any way trying to deface that, but we do see the Moore's Law advantage from 28 to 22, as an example, when you compare dense technologies to dense technologies. We believe -- I mean, 14 nanometer is just another extension of Moore's Law. So it will have that same roughly twice density that you'll see between 28 and 22. You'll see that same kind of increase or improvement as you move to 14. It is a true 14-nanometer technology. Did I answer your question?",217

So Brian, maybe what I was trying to get to was as you look at the kind of Android customers or Chrome customers that you might engage with, with 14 nanometer, how is that changing from the engagement that you have with Bay Trail? Basically, the question is, is the level of engagement accelerating as they look at your 14-nanometer progress?",62

I think more importantly than just 14-nanometers, what they see is a roadmap from us around the Atom SoC. And they see Bay Trail as a great first step, it's a great product. You've seen some of the performance benchmarks out there. We just talked about the transistor density. So there -- that's -- Stacy has talked about our costs and our ability to hit these lower price points. It's got good graphics performance. And as I've said, we are able to provide a 64-bit solution across all OS options as well. And so they look at that and then they look at our roadmap and say, ""Okay, they've got LTE. They've got connectivity. They've got them on standalone. They have plans to integrate those technologies in a basic SoC, and they're starting to build confidence in our roadmap along with us."" And that's, I think, what they really look at this as is, that they see an Atom roadmap that's highly competitive.",173
