380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4616.0,443655.0,20750624.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your participation. Today, my presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter 2013 and followed by the guidance for the second quarter. 
Our first quarter revenue turned out better than guidance, due to a more favorable exchange rate and stronger mobile demand and TSMC's strong position in 28-nanometer. Compared to the previous quarter, first quarter revenue increased 1% to TWD 133 billion. On the margin side, gross margin was 45.8%, down 1.4 percentage points from the fourth quarter last year. Higher capacity utilization and the NT dollar depreciation contributed to a favorable impact to our gross margin by 3 percentage points. However, the inventory valuations adjustment on a quarter-over-quarter basis has impact our gross margin by 4.4 percentage points. This is consistent with the accounting treatment under R.O.C. GAAP number 10 as before. 
First quarter operating margin was 33.5%, down 1.8 percentage points from the prior quarter due to higher opening expense for Fab-15 capacity expansion for 28-nanometer. Nonoperating items was again of TWD 1.3 billion for this quarter, much better than the loss in the fourth quarter of 2012. The difference is mainly due to the lack of impairment charges of TWD 1.5 billion we took in the fourth quarter last year for certain invested companies. Also in the first quarter, we disposed a portion of these mixed shares at a profit of TWD 0.7 billion versus its value on our book. Overall, our EPS was TWD 1.53. ROE was 21.3%. 
As you may have noticed, we are preparing financial statements in accordance with Taiwan IFRS starting this year. To illustrate the difference, we prepared a comparison table under both R.O.C. GAAP and the Taiwan IFRS, using 2012 number as example. I would like to highlight a few items here and you can find a more detailed explanation on TSMC website. On the profit side, TIFRS required us to reclassify some items among operating and nonoperating items. For example, technical service income were reclassified from nonoperating item to revenue. Also, loss of impairment of idle assets will be reclassified from nonoperating expenses to other operating expenses, et cetera and et cetera. The overall impact on our net income is small increase of TWD 0.2 billion in profitability, which is less than 0.1% of our total net income. On balance sheet, the key changes for TSMC is the reclassification of sales return allowance from deduction in accounts receivable to other current liabilities. Therefore, the balance of both accounts receivable and other current liabilities increased. This leads to a 4-day increase in accounts receivable turnover days in calculation. 
Now let's move back to revenue analysis for the first quarter of 2013. Overall, revenue from all applications showed better than seasonal quarter-over-quarter changes in the first quarter. As mobile product IC designers accelerated preparation for new product launches, demand for communication-related applications showed the a strongest growth of 4%. Computer increased by 3%, consumer increased by 3% and industrial revenue declined by 2% in the first quarter. 
If we look at the revenue by technology, demand for our 28-nanometer technology remained robust. 28-nanometer contribution to total wafer revenue further increased from 22% in the fourth quarter to 24% in the first quarter of 2013. With solid demand and a smooth ramp, we expect 28-nanometer revenue continue to grow each quarter and we are confident the 28-nanometer wafer revenue for 2013 will triple that of 2012. Overall, advanced technologies, defined as 40-nanometer and below, accounted for 47% of our total wafer revenue, up from 44% in the fourth quarter last year. 
Let me make a few comments on the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities increased TWD 38 billion to TWD 185 billion at the end of the first quarter, mainly due to a process from insurance of corporate bonds. By the same token, our long-term interest-bearing debt increased TWD 45 billion to TWD 127 billion. Looking at financial ratio, our accounts receivable turnover days remained flat at 43 days, and days of inventory increased by 1 day to 51 days. 
On the cash flow side, in the first quarter we generated TWD 74 billion from operations, invested TWD 80 billion in capital expenditure and raised TWD 45 billion through corporate bonds. In the U.S. dollar turn, our capital expenditure was 2.7 billion in the first quarter. We expect the total CapEx to be front-end loaded for the whole year. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 43 billion to TWD 186 billion. Free cash flow ended at negative TWD 7 billion, mainly due to higher capital expenditure in the first quarter. 
Lastly, let me make a few comments on our capacity plan. In the first quarter, due to fewer working days and a scheduled maintenance, our total capacity decreased 1% to around 3.9 million 8-inch equivalent wafers. While we continue to add a 28-nanometer capacity, our second quarter capacity will pick up to a level close to 4 million wafers, up 3% from the first quarter. 
For the full year, our 12-inch capacity is expected to increase 17% in 2013, contributed by the ramp of Fab-15 and our total annual capacity will increase 11% year-over-year to reach around 16.5 million wafers. 
I have finished my financial report. Now let me provide you our second quarter guidance. Based on our current business expectation and a forecast exchange rate of 29.82, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 154 billion and TWD 156 billion, representing about 17% Q-over-Q growth. In terms of margins, we expect the second quarter gross margin to be between 47.5% and 49.5%, and operating margin to be between 35% and 37%. 
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Morris Chang for his remarks.",963
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4616.0,443655.0,20750625.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"I would like to make some comments on industry outlook and on 1Q and 2Q. And then on our technology department, 28, 20 and 16, as well as specialty technologies. And finally, I will talk about this year's capital expenditures. For the industry outlook, for the full year 2013, our estimate of global GDP remains unchanged at about 2.6% growth. At C [ph] market, we now estimate to be about 4% growth, that is up from the 3% earlier estimate, due mainly to memory price recovery. Fabless industry, our estimate of fabless industry growth remains unchanged at 9%. Foundry industry, we now estimate to grow at 10%. That is up from 7%, mainly due to the raise of our own estimate of our growth. TSMC growth will be much higher than the foundry industry growth of 10% that I've mentioned earlier. 
On inventory. Supply-chain inventory at the end of 4Q was close to seasonal, was reasonably balanced, close to the seasonal norm. And we expect it to remain slightly above seasonal in all 4 quarters this year. And basically, we feel that it is reasonably -- it will be reasonably balanced every quarter this year. On 1Q and 2Q of 2013, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and we are encouraged by the business prospects of the second quarter, as Lora has already guided. Both quarters are strong, good and seasonal. We attribute our strength to, first, mobile-related applications whose demand remains strong and TSMC's strong position in 28-nanometer technology, which has become widely adopted by many mobile-related applications. 
Now a few comments on 28-nanometer. I said before and I say again, our capacity and output continue to ramp up aggressively. Both our production and our revenue of 28-nanometer wafers in 2013 will triple the production and revenue of 2012. This year, our volume and our revenue will triple that of 2012. Our high-K metal gate version will overtake the Oxynitride version in third quarter of this year. Market share this year is expected to remain very high due to, first, we have better yields on 28 LP, which is the Oxynitride version. We have better yields on the Oxynitride version than competition. Second, our differentiated offering in high-K metal gate, namely, we have gate-last versus competition's gate-first, offers better performance for our customers' products. So 2 reasons why our market share will remain very high. First, the 28 LP, the Oxynitride version has better yields than competition. Second, our high-K metal gate version is different from what the competitors may offer because we are gate-last and theirs is gate-first, and our gate-last version, our gate-last is better performance for our customers' products. 
Lastly, I have been asked a couple of times how our gross margin is doing on the 28-nanometers and I'm happy to report that the gross margin of 28-nanometers will be slightly higher than corporate average this year, the whole year, every quarter. 
A few comments on 20-nanometers and 16-nanometers, FinFET. On 20-nanometers, risk production has started in the first quarter, that is last quarter. Engagements with the customers are on schedule, have scheduled 20 product tape outs for this year from multiple customer, many of these tape outs will drive high-production volume and yield progress on 20-nanometer is on track. 
On 16-nanometer FinFET, we have said several times that this is a change in cadence in our new technology introduction. It used to be 2 years per node and in the case of 16-nanometers FinFET, it follows just 1 year, by 1 year, the 20 SoC. So it is a quickening of cadence and that is because of market request, market requirements, customers' requests. Compared with the 20-nanometers, the 16 FinFET has same metal pitch but tighter front-end FinFET design rules. The reason we can introduce it so quickly after the 20 is because the 16 FinFET can leverage the learning from 20-nanometers in interconnect and in double patterning. The yield improvement of the 16 FinFET is ahead of schedule. It is on track to begin volume production within 1 year from 20-nanometers. 
Now for 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer, as a whole, I expect that they will be in combination a bigger node than the 28-nanometers. A few words on the competitiveness of our 20-nanometer and, now, 16-nanometer. I have 3 points to make: First, TSMC technology is based on an open environment, the Open Innovation Platform, OIP. That open platform facilitates and invites innovations from all participants in the OIP. The participants include, of course, most importantly, our customers and they also include, as design ecosystem partners, of course, TSMC itself is a very important part of this open platform. The second point I want to make is that we have been collaborating with our customers and ecosystem partners for more than 15 years. Through the ecosystem OIP, TSMC's technology has been collaboratively optimized for SoC development. With our customers, we have been optimizing our technology for SoC development. And then together with our customers, established power efficient ARM-based architecture and comprehensive mobile IPs with our ecosystem partners. We are confident that our customer products with TSMC's 20- and 16-nanometer technologies are very, very competitive. I think that is already proven by our customers' enthusiasm of our technologies, 20 and 16. 
Now, a few words on specialty technologies. We don't want to neglect them at all. We talk about advanced technologies most of the time but the specialty technologies are growing even faster and they already account for a very significant volume in our revenue. And I'm talking about fingerprinting technologies, motion sensors' technologies and products, Near Field Communication products, audio codec, power management, touch sensors and an old friend but still a very exciting technology, that is CIS, the imaging products, cameras, cameras. These enhanced requirements for human machine interfaces will fuel the growth of TSMC's specialty technology businesses in mixed signal, MEMS, Embedded Flash and high-voltage and most of those technologies are now embedded in our less than leading-edge technologies. 45- -- 40-, 65-nanometer, 90-nanometer, 0.18, 0.15, et cetera, et cetera. 
Finally, CapEx, capital expenditures. CapEx will be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion this year. This is an increase from the last guidance we gave, which was about $9 billion. Basically, we have stepped up the preparation for the ramp-up of 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. We have pulled some of the capital in because we want to be -- to have as high yields as possible when we do start ramp-up, volume ramp-up. And of course, we are continuing to build up 28-nanometer capacity. Therefore, approximately 90% of the capital expenditures are for 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, both building facility and equipment. Another 5% is for R&D and that's mainly for 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, et cetera. And 2% for specialty equipment and that's on the specialty technologies that I just mentioned. And 1% for the land in Zhunan, which we announced a few months ago. 
Basically, I feel that the company is entering or has already entered a new growth period. We started to invest in this growth period even at the depth of the recession in early 2009. And we have been investing in increased R&D, in increased capital for several years now. And we have begun to see the benefits. We have been scaling new heights in revenue for 4 consecutive years, including this year, and we have scaled new heights in net income for 3 of the last 4 consecutive years. And the best part is that the best is yet to come. Thank you.",1254

My -- first, congratulations on the very good second quarter guidance. That was -- first question is on the 20-nanometer. Some investors and also your customers has been talking about the cost per transistor might start to go up after double patterning, et cetera, et cetera. And what's your view on this impact to the supply chain, your profitability and your customer's profitability and the adoption of technology, et cetera? And my second question is on TSMC's -- I just want to hear from you, again, the return and the profitability for future nodes, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer.",109
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4616.0,443655.0,20750629.0,Answer,Morris Chang,,Executives,6,"Thank you. Transistor cost -- 20-nanometer transistor cost. Yes, the slope of decrease of transistor cost has been less in -- between 28 and 20, the decrease in transistor cost is less than the decrease in transistor cost between 40 and 28. But now, the important point is that the value we offer in any new node is, I think, gradually shifting, or has already gradually shifted from just pure lower transistor cost to the performance aspects, performance speed and power. And, of course, in addition to speed and the power we also offer value in quick access to market and services and those things. So I think that there is -- there are opportunities for regaining the slope, the decrease of transistor cost. There are opportunities for regaining it. For instance, I think that the recent developments in EUV, I think, are encouraging and they do have -- they will have an important role to play if those developments continue to progress. Now on the other hand, the value that the new node offers in performance and power is exactly what our customers are looking for, and I think that yes, the transistor cost reduction has not been so great, but I think the acceptance of the 20-nanometer SoC will prove -- and I'm certain of the exceptions. I think exceptions will prove that the customers are still getting value. As to the return profitability of 20 and 16, while I'm not prepared to offer you a quantitative measure of the return profitability but I will repeat our goals in this 5-year period, I think starting 2012 to 2017, I guess. That is 10% per year compounded annual growth in profit before tax and return on equity of 20% or higher. And those targets, I announced 2 years ago, I believe, and we remain fully committed to those.",309

I think the follow-up is, I think for -- recently, TSMC just had that news release talking about tape out with ARM Cortex-A57 for 64-bit application processors.

So my question is, except for this Cortex-A57 16-nanometer FinFET, do you have any 64-bit ARM application processor on 20-nanometer or 28-nanometer technology?",62

There are second sources on 28-nanometers. But second sourcing is not as simple in the foundry business, though. You have to work with -- the customer has to work with the foundry for quite a long time before you can use the foundry. So this is not a commodity business. A commodity business, you can set up second sources very quickly but this business, you can't. But still, having said all that, yes, there will be second sources. But if you look at 28-nanometer and I know that the analyst reports, the press have been talking about second sources and competition for TSMC in the 28 node. But the fact of the matter is that this year, which is the second full year of production and ramp-up for us, even this year, we see relatively little competition, and we will still have a very high market share of 28-nanometer.",151

So let me try to answer. Actually, that question is probably more appropriate at the ASML Analyst Call but let me try to answer what I can, anyway. EUV recently has had a breakthrough. The wattage, the power source wattage has now gone up to 40 watts. Now that will allow a throughput of some 30 wafers, 30-something wafers per hour, which is still far from enough. To make it economically desirable, we'll need over 100 wafers per hour throughput. And that will require a power source of more than 100 watts. So there is still some distance to go but ASML is optimistic. And certainly, I mean, we certainly cheer them on. We are a stakeholder of ASML in more than one way. We are a financial investor, we are also going to be a significant user and, hopefully, significant beneficiary of the EUV. So -- but all right, so now when are we going to use it? I think if we are optimistic, I would say that we will be using it, at least partially, in the 10-nanometer node. And anyway, I think I have given as much answer as I can. Yes.",207

Altera. I very much regret Altera's decision to work on the 14-nanometer with Intel even though the financial impact is relatively small and Altera remains a major and valued partner of TSMC's. We have gained many customers in the last few years but I really hate to lose even a part of an old one. We want them all, really. I regret it and because of this, we have thoroughly critiqued ourselves. If there was a thing like an investigative commission on what happened, we had it. And there were, in fact, many reasons why it happened and we have taken them to heart. And it's a lesson to us and I don't think that we -- at least, we'll try our very best not to let similar kinds of things happen again. Now -- but I just want to emphasize that Altera remains a major and valued partner of ours and I say this with Altera's concurrence. Now Intel as a competitor. I noted Intel's yesterday's analyst call, in which they said they have now gone from crawl to walk and then will go on to run and that's all very beautiful in metaphor. And then they also raised several conditions or several criteria -- 3 criteria but there's really nothing new in those and they have said those before. And I still view Intel as a selective picker among customers. As a foundry competitor, they will pick their targets and so on. And I don't view them as a general competitor because they have already said, through the 3 criteria that they used, they have already said themselves that they will not be a general or front [indiscernible] competitor. But they are a very serious competitor to our customers. I mean that, really, I would say, applies even greater pressure on us than they as -- than Intel as a direct foundry competitor. They are a very serious competitor to our customers. Our customers rely on us. That is very serious pressure and we respond to that pressure, of course. We respond to that pressure. Yes.",362

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start my presentation with the financial highlights for the second quarter, and I will follow that by providing the guidance for the third quarter. I'm very pleased to announce another record quarter for TSMC in both revenue and net income in the second quarter this year. The record results once again demonstrate that our investment in R&D and advanced capacities has started to pay off. Looking at the numbers, our revenue increased 17.4% to TWD 156 billion mainly due to strong demand for 28-nanometer technology, while customers need in building their inventory for the launch of mobile product in the second half also helped. 
On the margin side, second quarter gross margin was 49%, up 3.2 percentage points from the first quarter, thanks to high utilization rate, cost improvements and more favorable exchange rate. Total operating expenses increased 14.8% to TWD 18.8 billion, mainly due to higher R&D and operating expense. Despite that, second quarter operating margin expanded 3.5 percentage points to 37% on larger revenue base and higher gross margin.  Non-operating item was a gain of TWD 2.4 billion in the second quarter, up from TWD 1.3 billion in the previous quarter. The increase is mainly due to the legal settlement income, dividend from invested companies and one-time gain from the deconsolidation revaluation of assets. None of these are recurring, but together contributed about TWD 0.04 of EPS to the second quarter. Overall, we made TWD 2 EPS in the second quarter and the single quarter ROE was 24.7%. 
Let's have a look at the revenue by application. Mobile computing devices continue to drive our business growth in the second quarter. The revenue contribution from the communication segment further increased from 55% in the first quarter to 57% of total wafer revenue in the second quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue increased across the board of all major segments. Communication again show the strongest growth of 22%, followed by: computers, 18%; industrials, 11%; and the consumer, 9%. 
In terms of revenue by technology, the 28-nanometer continue to ramp successfully. The revenue contribution has significantly increased to 29% in the second quarter from the 24% in the first quarter. Riding on the success of 28-nanometer, revenue from advanced technologies, defined as 40-nanometer and below, now already represents 50% of our total wafer revenue. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities increased TWD 38 billion to TWD 228 billion at the end of the second quarter, mainly due to proceeds from issuance of U.S. dollar corporate bonds. Correspondingly, our long-term interest-bearing debt increased TWD 43 billion to TWD 171 billion.  Current liability increased by TWD 85 billion mainly because we accrued the cash dividend of TWD 78 billion which will be paid by the end of July. 
Looking at the financial ratios, our accounts receivable turnover days remained flat at 43 days. Days of inventory decreased by 4 days to 47 days, mainly due to shipment out of finished goods and a lower working process inventory days.  On the cash flow side, in the second quarter, we generated TWD 75 billion from operations, invested TWD 78 billion in capital expenditure and have raised TWD 45 billion through corporate bonds. In U.S. dollar terms, we spent $2.6 billion in capital expenditures in the second quarter, together with the $2.7 billion spend in the first quarter, we have already spent about 55% of our guided full year CapEx, which is USD 9.5 billion to USD 10 billion dollars.  Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 40 billion to TWD 226 billion. Free cash flow ended slightly negative at 3 billion. 
Lastly, I would like to talk about our capacity plan. Our total capacity increased 3% to around 4 million 8-inch equivalent wafers in the second quarter and a wafer increased by another 6.5% to 4.3 million wafers in the third quarter. For the full year, our 12-inch capacity is expected to increase 17% year-over-year, and our total annual capacity will increase 11% to 16.4 million 8-inch equivalent wafers. 
I have finished my financial summary. Before we talk about third quarter outlook, I would like to brief you one changes that impact our consolidated revenue. We used to consolidate Syntek, one of our invested company because TSMC support representation in Syntek was greater than half. Recently, Syntek expanded its core structure by adding 2 independent directors in June. As a result, TSMC's board representation is now less than half, therefore, we will no longer consolidate Syntek starting June 30 this year. The consolidation impact would be close to 1% reduction of our total revenue in the third quarter. Taking this into consideration, our third quarter guidance will be as follows. Based on current business expectation and a forecast exchange rate of TWD 29.83, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 161 billion and TWD 164 billion.
In terms of margins, we expect the third quarter gross margin to be between 47% and 49% and operating margin to be between 35% and 37%. This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Morris Chang.",862
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5981.0,484981.0,22386713.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On the screen, you'll see an outline of what I'm going to say in my message today. First, second quarter and third quarter. Second quarter was a record quarter for TSMC, both in revenue and in earnings-per-share. The strength was mainly driven by the strong growth in margin-related -- mobile-related applications and TSMC's strong position in the 28-nanometer technology. We are rather pleased about the results of the second quarter. Third quarter guidance has already been given to -- has already been given by our CFO, and there will be growth in the third quarter, and we are rather pleased about the expected performance of our third quarter as well. 
Next, let me talk about the industry outlook, the forecast and supply chain inventory. For full year 2013, we are forecasting a global GDP of 2.6%, which is unchanged from our forecast 3 months ago. For semiconductors, however, we are lowering our earlier forecast of 4% growth to 3% in 2013 for semiconductor growth. For fabless, we continue to forecast 9% growth. This is unchanged from our last forecast. For foundry, we are forecasting now 11% growth. This is the foundry industry. We are forecasting 11% growth, which is up from 10%. For TSMC, we again forecast a revenue growth, which is much higher than the foundry industry growth, and that's unchanged. 
Now let's look at the supply-chain inventory. Two things have happened in the last 3 months or 2 things have actually become more obvious in the last 3 months. First, the IC vendors inventory preparation for product launch by several major handset makers, the IC vendors preparing for product launch by major -- by several major handset makers, has caused the supply inventory days, inventory days to increase. Second, the lower than expected sales of PCs and several smartphone models have again caused the supply-chain inventory to become higher. Now in April, we have forecast the fabless supply-chain inventory, fabless supply-chain inventory to be 73 days -- I'm sorry, to be 70 days, 70 days. In April, we have forecasted fabless supply-chain inventory to be 70 days at the end of the second quarter. Now we are forecasting -- saying, we are saying that it will be -- or it was 73 days at the end of the second quarter. 
Now 3 months ago, we're forecasting the supply chain, the fabless supply-chain inventory to be 68 days at the end of the third quarter, and now we are forecasting it to be 71 days at the end of third quarter. About the fourth quarter, 3 months ago, we were forecasting the inventory again for the fabless to reach 66, and now we are still forecasting 66. So our inventory days forecast for the Fabless supply-chain has increased for the second and third quarter, but remains unchanged in the fourth quarter. This is an early indication that the fourth quarter may be a down quarter because we expect the supply-chain to take serious action to manage their inventory in the second half. And the overall inventory, however, will approach the seasonal level by fourth quarter. I'm talking about the 66 days that we are forecasting. That's very close to the seasonal level. 
Now a few words on our structural profitability. Since '09 -- I picked '09 because that was the year when I resumed my CEO responsibilities. Since '09, our structural profitability at constant exchange rate has improved by 7.7 points -- 770 basis points. On the other hand, the '09 exchange rate was 32.87 and the year-to-date 2013 exchange rate is 29.66, a change of 9.8%, almost 10% and we have said several times that each point of change, being exchange rate, causes 0.4% change in our margin. So the almost 10% change in exchange rate has caused a 4% change unfavorable in margin. And therefore, at prevailing exchange rates, our structure profitability has improved by only 3.8%. Still, I think it's very encouraging, and there are signs that the exchange rate may stabilize or perhaps the NT may even depreciate a little bit, and if that happens, it will of course help our progress in structural profitability even more. 
Next, I want to talk about -- anyway, the message in the last section is that, in the last 4 years, our structural profitability has improved by 3.8 points at prevailing exchange rates. 
Next, I want to talk about high-end, mid-end and low-end mobile product world and TSMC's position. Mobile products have been important in driving the demand in recent years. And we'll continue to enjoy robust growth in this year, as well as in coming years. High-end year-on-year growth this year was 18% -- or is 18%, we estimate, from 361 million last year to 428 million this year. Mid-end grows from 167 million units to 227 million units, a 36% growth. Low-end rose from 202 million to 341 million, 69% growth. So this year, we will see high-end units to grow 18%; mid-end, 36%; low-end, 69%, for a total smartphone year-to-year growth of 36%. We are uniquely -- as a foundry, we are uniquely positioned. Because of our comprehensive technology portfolio, we have solutions to address each tier, high, low, middle, each tier of the smartphone market, and of course, would benefit from the overall strength of the smartphone demand. We, in particular, I want to point out, I think everyone knows that our 28-nanometer technology has allowed us to be very well-positioned in the high-end, and probably, mid-end. But I want to particularly point out that we are very well-positioned in the low-end. Because of the comprehensive technology portfolio, we can -- through silicon area shrink and layer reductions, help our customers to streamline features and to integrate functionalities for their overall lower-cost designs. 
China, of course, is a fast-growing area for mid- to low-end smartphones. We are seeing our Chinese customers taking a more important role in providing chip solutions to the market. Many of them have accelerated their cadence in adapting advanced technology. As a result, our business from Chinese customers has doubled in the first half this year from 1 year ago, and for the whole year, our Chinese -- China region is expected to account for 6% of our total business this year. 
Next, a few words on 28-nanometers. Our 28-nanometers is on track to triple in wafer sales this year and our 28-nanometer high-K metal gate is ramping fast, and will exceed the Oxynitride solution starting this quarter. For the Oxynitride solution in which we do have competitors, we believe that we have a substantial lead in yield. For the high-K metal gate solution, we do not have any serious competitors yet. We believe we have a substantial lead in performance. If you recall, ours is a gate-last version and our competitors are mainly in the gate-first version. 
So in high-K metal gate, we have a lead in power. Power is lower. In performance, our performance is better and should the competitors who are in gate-first now switch to gate-last, they will be considerably behind us in yield learning in yields. Our continued lead in yield and performance will keep our 28-nanometer market segment share strong for both this year and in future years. 
Now a few comments on 20, 16, and I want to say a few words on our grand alliance, and also I want to show you a few photographs of our new GIGAFAB, which is dedicated to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. 20-nanometer SoC and 16-nanometer FinFET are both progressing well. On 20-nanometers, we see little competition. The risk production has started in the first quarter, and volume production will start in early 2014, next year and I'll see you -- I will show you the photograph of our brand-new fab, and the equipment are already being installed. The equipment are streaming and are being installed, are going to be tried out and the volume production will start in early 2014. On 16 FinFET, it will start volume production about 1 year after 20 SoC, in other words, early in 2015. Our R&D progress on 16 FinFET is very good. New improvement is better than planned, and is better than 20-nanometer a year ago, and we have been working on -- we have been working with several major customers and many tape-outs. Many product tape-outs are planned for next year, but the joint work is essential for before tape-outs, of course, and that joint work has been progressing for some time. 
Grand alliance, by that, we mean our alliance with customers, with the design -- electronic design EDA companies, and companies such as ARM and imagination technology and companies like Cadence, Mentor Graphics, as well as our own platform, the Open Innovation Platform. So it's an alliance with the customers, with the EDA companies, with the IP providers, and of course, with the -- our key vendors, critical vendors. 
Now the reason I want to point that out is that for TSMC, we have entered a new era of competition. We pointed that out almost every time we get together in this meeting, and we've been pointing out for the last 1 or 2 years now. Now in this new era of competition, the competition is not foundry to foundry. It is not foundry to IDM. It is grand alliance to IDM. Have I made it clear? That's the reason I'm pointing it out.  
Now so we feel on the 16 -- on the 20, as I've already said, we see little competition. On the 16, if we put it on a foundry to foundry or foundry to IBM basis, we are competitive. If you put it on a grand alliance to IBM basis, we are more than competitive. 
Now I want to show you a few photographs of our new GIGAFAB, which as I said, is dedicated to 20, 16 -- 20 and 16. Now is there no pointer? There's no pointer? Well, that's too bad. But I don't think there'd be any problem with this photograph or with the next 2, because you see, the big building almost in the middle of the photograph, and that's our P5, phase 5, of Fab 14. It's located at -- in Thailand, and it will start -- it's the first one, it's just 1/3 of the GIGAFAB, 1/3. I will show you the other 2/3 in the next 2 photographs. And this 1/3 of this 16, 20, 16-nanometer, 20-nanometer GIGAFAB, will start production, I said earlier, in early 2014, and this picture says February 2014. And this particular phase 5 has a total floor space of 184 square meters.
Next, please. Why, if you -- can you switch it back, please? This is finished, the building is finished, as I said. The equipment are streaming in, being installed, being tested out to get ready for the volume ramp-up in early 2014.
Next photograph is the second 1/3 of our 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer GIGAFAB. And this one is only half-finished because volume production will start only in May of next year. And it's about the same size, the total floor space is 180,000 square meters, about the same as the last one.
Next, please. This is the last 1/3 of this new GIGAFAB. And you can see that you don't see very much yet, but you will see what's going on, it's very busy. I think the foundation and so on has been laid, et cetera, et cetera. It's -- it will start production, volume production, in April of 2015. And its total floor space, it's about the same as each of the other 2.
Altogether, these 3 phases of this mega fab, the GIGAFAB, is about 550,000 square meters. Just in comparison, our 28-nanometer facility, which is in Taichung, is about 400,000 square meters. So this one is 550,000 square meters, it's dedicated for 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer, and the 28-nanometer is about 400,000 square meters. And I -- all right, let's show the next photograph.
Without a pointer, this is going to be more difficult. But this is our Tainan campus or complex. And well, the -- in -- on the -- in the upper part, you will see the older fabs. Well, old, well, most of them are less than 10 years old, but they are old compared to the new phases I just pointed out to you. Then right below them, you see the new fabs. And there's one on the side, is our back end. That's where our 3D IC is going to be. That's where our CoWoS is also now. And now actually -- yes, thank you very much. I think this will help.
Well, I'm not going to point out the old fabs, but this is phase 5. That's the first of the new phases, phase 5. And this is phase 6, and this is phase 7. Now I do want to point out one very, very important aspect of this super fab. Even though you see 3 separate buildings, but they will all be connected, they will all -- all of these 3 will be connected by clean room links, clean room links.
All right, so much for the photographs.
A few words on EUV. Last time, I think I pointed out that we had -- we just had a breakthrough last time on EUV. Or I should say ASML had a breakthrough on EUV. Now progress has continued. Saima [ph] and ASML have demonstrated an EUV power output of 40 watts on their factory floor. The next step for ASML is to achieve 80 watts of source power. While there's still some distance to reach the source power of 250 watts, 40 watts already achieved. Next milestone, 80 watts. And then the economically desirable threshold is 250 watts. 250 watts will give us a throughput of 125 wafers per hour, which is the economic threshold. While there's still some distance to get there, we are collaborating with ASML very closely to ensure that EUV can become production ready by 10-nanometer, at least for the critical layers.
Next, specialty technologies. Specialty technologies, when we say specialty technologies, we mean we include high-voltage or power management ICs, mixed signal for audio codec, embedded flash for MCU, MEMS for motion sensors, image -- I'm sorry, CMOS image sensors for digital cameras. Now in addition to those that we have been working on for a long, long time, in addition to those, the following specialty technologies are expected to grow significantly next year: Image signal processors stacked with CIS, that is processors stacked with the sensors; mixed signal for fingerprinting sensors; high voltage for small panel drivers, small panel drivers; and better flash for Near Field Communication, smart cards and touchscreen controllers.
What differentiates TSMC in the specialty technology foundry arena, besides the fact that we have in -- we have the largest capacity in the broadest scope, is our superior ability to integrate specialty devices, flash, CIS, RF, high voltage, power MOSFET, integrate those specialty devices into our strong CMOS baseline while maintaining our CMOS IP compatibility.
Those are all the comments I've prepared. I believe we are now open for Q&A.",2531

For third quarter guidance, I just want to see why you're guiding a decline for margins on a small increase in sales. And into 2014, as you ramp 20-nanometer with a steep ramp, do you see any margin impact in the early stage of 20-nanometer?",58

We are adding capacity in third quarter. I was talking about another 6.5% leading-edge technology. The third quarter, as Chairman just mentioned, we are going through the image corrections period, so we expect the third quarter utilization will be lower than second quarter. That's the main reason that the revenue improved, the margin does improve. You also asked about the, going to 2014, when we ramp 20-nanometer, how will that affect our margin. Every new technology, when it comes to the mass production, it -- in early beginning, it always start with a lower margin, but when in -- the quantities start to go up, maybe after 7 or 8 quarters, the margin will be getting closer to corporate average. So we expect that will happen for 20-nanometer as well.",141

The second question, and it probably relates to some of the pictures of the big fabs that are getting built, and I want to ask if you have any concern.

In fact, it was a year ago when I said that the fourth quarter might be down and the first quarter might also be down, fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year might a little bit. By the second quarter, we will see a strong rebound. I said that in July of 2012. And it happened that way, pretty much. And now this year, July 2013 and I see almost the same thing, except I think there is a bit of difference. The fourth quarter down could be a little more severe than the last year -- than the fourth quarter down last year. And however, the first quarter down will not be as severe as the first quarter down this year. And did I make it -- myself clear? I mean, I think that, last year, incidentally, our fourth quarter was down by, it's about, 7%. And I just said now that -- well, anyway, it could be a little more severe than that. And the first quarter, however, could be reasonably flat from the fourth quarter. And however, the second quarter, next year, second quarter, rebound is going to be, I believe, a very strong one, just as this year's second quarter rebound was.

And we base the confidence on the work that we have already been doing with the customer.

And I noticed that comparing TSMC with Samsung and Intel, TSMC definitely have huge fabs. They are connected versus -- the other 2 are more scattered around the world for various reasons. For TSMC, number one, that will give you more cost advantage. Is that still the case for FinFET, et cetera, going forward, even you have one large -- very huge customer?",85

I believe, there is some cost advantage in connecting all the fab into one GIGAFAB. But I think the main advantage is probably in time to expand or time to market. That is -- we qualify only once because -- in one big GIGAFAB, we qualify only once. Whereas if they are disconnected, if they are separate fabs, there, usually, we have to qualify each fab on the same product for this, yes -- well, on the same technology, let's say, yes.",85

First one, I remember last year almost at the same time -- I think it's July 20-something. You mentioned that Q4 will be down. In that time, you said what the ballpark of the double-digit probably close to 10% decline, but -- and there was a rush order and Q4 rather declined only 7%, the same for Q1. Earlier, you guide a similar decline like Q4. And that was 1% decline. Based on your current visibility -- earlier, you mentioned it will be similar or worse, worse than last year, are you saying worse than 7% decline or worse than what your original guidance last year, where you give about 10%?",119

No, I -- no, I don't expect it to be double. I don't -- look, I think it would be a decline and -- but I normally don't even guide or forecast the quarter after this. But when I see something unusual happening, I do try to tell you in advance. And that was the case last time, and it's a year ago. And it's the same case this time -- same situation this time. I see a very -- a finite possibility of the fourth quarter being down from the third quarter.

So during this time, we're going to see TSMC adding new capacity. You're ramping your new GIGAFABs. But also this time, you're going to have GLOBALFOUNDRIES clients who have a lot of 300-millimeter capacity. They eventually get into 28-nanometer high-K metal gate.

Brett, your question is with respect to the potential oversupply condition for 28-nanometer, starting fourth quarter of this year.

Well, you want to know the reasons why it won't happen? Well, look, I already said it. I think we have a substantial lead on yield and on performance in 28-nanometer. So while other competitors or at least some of the other competitors are talking about building capacity and even actually building capacity, but -- I think that we will have a much higher utilization in our capacity than those competitors, much higher. And this has happened before. When -- this impact has been happening all along in the last 15 years or so. While we always build capacity when we knew who our customers would be and at least -- we knew at least approximately, what they're demand would be, real demand, while we build our capacity on that kind of knowledge, our competitors often, often build capacity on speculation. So you may say, ""Well, that's certainly not very advantageous to you either."" Well, now, it was not very advantageous to us, but we still managed to hold our profitability. We still -- over all of these years, in almost all nodes, 0.13, 90-nanometer, 60-nanometer, 65-nanometer, 45-nanometer, I mean, it has always happened. Our competitors build capacity on speculation. Well, the result in every generation was that we still got our profitability. In fact, our structure profitability, as I pointed out, has improved. And we also had very much high utilization in our capacity at each node than our competitors. And if you look at the history, you will find out this is -- this was why our profit -- I think even now -- of course, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is not a public company. And Samsung, Intel, I don't think exactly disclose their foundry revenue or income. But back when we had competitors -- foundry competitors that disclose their revenue and earning, we had only 50% of the revenue of the total industry. But we had 100% of the profit. So that means that the rest of the competitors are -- I mean, they even had -- if they had negative profit -- well, if they had positive profit, it was canceled out by some others' negative profit. We had a 50% revenue and 100% on the profit. And I think that it will continue to be that way, frankly. So I -- yes?",396

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start the presentation with financial highlights for the third quarter, and I will follow that by providing the guidance for the fourth quarter.
In the third quarter, TSMC set another record in both revenue, and net income, thanks to our leadership in leading-edge technologies. In the third quarter, revenue increased 4.3% to reach TWD 163 billion. Gross margin was 48.5%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially, due to the lower capacity utilization, offset by favorable inventory valuation adjustment. Total operating expenses was TWD 19.3 billion, slightly increased from the second quarter, mainly due to higher R&D expense for 20 SoC and 16 FinFET technology development. The operating margin was at 36.7%, down 0.3 percentage points from the second quarter. Non-operating items was a loss of TWD 0.3 billion in the third quarter, mainly due to the TWD 1.35 billion impairment charge associated with our investment of Stion. Stion is a U.S.-based solar company which we invested in 2010. The EPS impact for this event is about $0.05. Overall, EPS was $2 in the third quarter, and ROE was 26.8%.
Let's take a look at our revenue by applications. After 5 consecutive quarters of growth, communication segment declined by 3% in the third quarter, as consumer -- customers start to manage down their inventories. Computer segment declined 18%, Consumer segment grew significantly in the third quarter, thanks to the strong demand from the game consoles. Meanwhile, Industrial and Standard-related revenues grew by 5% from the second quarter.
Despite the volatilities across different applications, our 28-nanometer continued to grow and contributed 32% of total wafer revenue in the third quarter, up from 29% in the second quarter. Combined with 40-nanometer, the advanced technologies represented 52% of our total wafer revenue.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 218 billion. Current liability decreased by $95 billion, as we paid out $78 billion of cash dividend in July. On the financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 2 days to 45 days. Days of inventory further decreased by 2 days to 45 days, as we had less working process inventory in the third quarter.
On the cash flow side, during the third quarter, we generated TWD 96 billion from operations; invested TWD 55 billion in capital expenditure; distributed TWD 78 billion cash dividends; repaid TWD 13 billion bank loans; and erased TWD 41 billion of company bonds. Overall, our cash balance decreased $9 billion to TWD 217 billion. Free cash flow was an inflow of TWD 41 billion.
In U.S. dollar terms, we spent USD 1.8 billion in capital expenditure in the third quarter. This adds to the total of $7.2 billion for the first third quarters, which is about 74% of our total year CapEx, which is about USD 9.7 billion.
Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on our capacity plan. Our total capacity grew 6.5% to around 4.3 million 8-inch-equivalent wafers in the third quarter. And we will increase another 1% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our 12-inch capacity is expected to grow 17% year-over-year, and our total annual capacity will increase 11% to 16.4 million 8-inch-equivalent wafers.
I have finished my financial report. Now let me provide you our fourth quarter guidance. Based on current business expectations and a forecast exchange rate of 29.5, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 144 billion and TWD 147 billion. In U.S. dollar terms, this will translate to around 10% quarter-over-quarter decline. On the margin side, we expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be between 44% and 46%, and operating margin to be between 32% and 34%.
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to Chairman.",636
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2013",2013-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6140.0,529835.0,24253225.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My message is outlined here on the screen. First, a few comments on third and fourth quarters of this year. Third quarter was another record quarter for TSMC, both in revenue and in EPS. In a period where sales of certain mobile products was slowing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, as they demonstrated once again TSMC's strong position in the leading-edge technologies, particularly in the 28-nanometer node.
As I said 3 months ago, the fourth quarter may be a down quarter, lower than the third quarter, because we expected the supply chain to take serious actions to manage the inventory in the second half of this year. That has happened and is still happening. As the CFO has just indicated in the guidance, our fourth quarter revenue will decline by about 10.5% from the third quarter. This decline is mainly attributable to the softer demand for certain high-end smartphones and the inventory correction. We believe the decline is short term. Meanwhile, TSMC's structural profitability, our technological strengths and our close customers' bonds remain intact. And we are optimistic about 2014.
Next, a few comments on industry outlook, supply-chain inventory and mobile products market. For the full year 2013, we estimate that semiconductor market, the world semiconductor market, will grow 4%. This is a bit higher than the 3% that we estimated last year -- last quarter, mainly due to the strength of the memory segment of the semiconductor industry. We again estimate that the fabless industry will grow 9%, that's unchanged from our last quarter estimate. We estimate that the foundry industry will grow 11%, unchanged from last quarter. And we now estimate that TSMC this year will grow between 17% and 18%, which of course, is much higher than the foundry industry growth.
On inventory, in the third quarter, due to slower sales of certain high-end smartphone models, we estimate that the supply chain DOI in the third quarter went up and was about seasonal -- above seasonal. That was higher than we forecasted 3 months ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the supply-chain DOI to decline significantly and to approach seasonal level by the end of the fourth quarter.
On mobile products. The smartphones. 2012, 730 million units. 2013, we estimate 987 million units, a 35% growth. 2014, we estimate about 1.2 billion units, a 26% growth over 2013. Tablets. In 2012, 165 million units. This year, we estimate 255 million units, a 54% growth. And next year, we estimate 310 million units, a 22% growth. 
Next, I will talk about 28 nanometers. 28 nanometers is now in our third year of volume production. It still leads our competitors in yields and performance. Since the second quarter this year, our quarterly revenue from 28-nanometers has exceeded the USD 1 billion mark, and we expect to continue to grow our 28-nanometer business further in the next year. TSMC's 28-nano market share -- 28-nanometer market share in our served available market is about 84%, which is higher than our 45-nanometer was in its third year of ramp. It is also higher than the market share of our 65-nanometer, our 90-nanometer and our 0.13-micron in their respective third year's ramp.
In 28-nanometer's Oxynitride solution, we have a couple of competitors. But TSMC delivers higher performance, better yield and shorter cycle time, which helped mitigate customer's inventory risk. Our market share of the Oxynitride solution is about 75% this year. In 28-nanometer, high-K metal gate solution, we have little competition. Today, our market share of 28 high-K metal gate is above 90%. As some of our customers begin to migrate to more advanced nodes, 20-nanometer and 16-FinFET, we will have second wave customers to come in to fill our 28-nanometer capacity. As a result, we expect to maintain a high level of capacity utilization for 28-nanometer in the next few years.
Because of our substantial lead in yield, speed, power, and our customers trusting us, which we make a hard effort to earn every month, every year, every day, and because we have a multitude of second wave customers adopting 28-nanometer in future years, we expect to keep our 28-nanometer market share strong for a long time. Indeed, keeping a high market share in every one of our more mature technologies, has been part of our corporate strategy all along. As the leader in the foundry field, we usually started it with a very high share at the leading edge. Then as competitors begin to appear, they capture some market share. But our share in every mature technology, up through 45-nanometers, has never gone below 50%.
Now, a few comments on 20-nanometer and 16-FinFET. We will begin volume production of 20-nanometers in first quarter 2014, that's 90 days from now. 16-nanometers will follow 20-nanometers in 1 year. We view both 20-nanometers and 16-nanometers as virtually 1 node. Specifically on 20-nanometers, we have received 5 product tape-outs, and scheduled more than 30 tape-outs in this year and next year from mobile computing CPU and PLD segments. And all those tape-outs represent big volumes.
Design ECO system on 20-nanometer has been validated in real products, and is ready to support customers. Yield learning is in line or better than the 28-nanometer path. We expect a fast ramp of 20-nanometer next year. With revenue from 20-nanometer in 2014, bigger than that of 28-nanometer in 2012. You see, 20-nanometer will be starting next year, whereas 28-nanometer actually started in the fourth quarter -- third, fourth quarter of 2011. So the corresponding point for 28-nanometer was 2012, but our ramp in 20-nanometer in 2014 is going to be faster than the ramp for 28-nanometer in 2012. While 28-nanometer ramp was a record for TSMC, 20-nanometer ramp will be even faster by about 30%.
On 16-FinFET. Technological development is progressing well, risk production is on schedule by the end of this year. More than 25 customer product tape-outs are planned in 2014, including mobile computing, CPU, GPU, PLD and networking applications. We are on track to begin volume production within 1 year of 20-nanometers.
On both 20-nanometers and 16-FinFET, we are confident that we are competitive. We derive our confidence from our close working relationship with several large customers. It is they, our large customers, who have to come out with products that will prevail over their competitors. It is they, our large customers, who ensure that our 20-nanometer and 16-FinFET technology will enable them to prevail over their competitors.
Next, let me talk about CapEx growth and revisit the 2010 5-year plan. As Lora just said, CapEx this year will be around $9.7 billion, give or take, a couple of hundred million dollars. This year, our CapEx is partially for this year's growth, but primarily for next year growth. We expect another double-digit growth year for 2014. Now let's take a moment to revisit the 5-year plan we announced in 2010. In 2010, we set a target of 10% per annum PBT growth and ROE of equal or greater than 20%, for the 5-year period of 2011 to 2015.
We were down, an immediate setback in 2011. Our PBT in 2011 actually retreated from the 2010 level. But since then, we have been catching up. This year, the gap between our forecast and the trend line, the 10% per annum trend line, is a very small one. In the meantime, we are still comfortably above ROE 20%. We expect -- on the profit before tax, we expect to more than catch up with the trend line, the planned line in 2014 and 2015.
Next, I'll make a few comments about the CEO succession, and the Chairman's continuing hands-on role. I'll get to the bottom line first, and then I'll offer a few words of comment. The bottom line is just as that say -- that says. We do plan to appoint a CEO or 2 co-CEOs before June of next year. And let me just say that before June of next year, it doesn't have to be next year, it could be tomorrow, between now and June of next year. And the other part of the bottom line is the Chairman's, my -- my continuing hands-on role. I think it's no news to you that I will continue to be Chairman. But today I want to emphasize, hands-on, continuing hands-on.
Now let me offer a few words of comment. Well, you remember that I came back in June of '09 -- is this loud enough? In June of '09, because -- to become the CEO. I was always the Chairman, and I will continue to be Chairman. But in June of '09, I came back to become -- to resume CEO responsibility. It was because I saw golden opportunities for TSMC and also serious challenges. I cried the Henry V rally cry, ""Once more unto the bridge, dear friends, once more.""
Now, unfortunately, the meaning of that rally cry was lost on many people, because not very many people saw either the opportunity or the challenge as I saw them. As far as the challenges were concerned, many people thought that I was referring to an emerging company, the star itself as a global company. But actually, even at that point, I looked through that challenge and my gaze was already upon the two 700-pound gorillas in the industry. As far as opportunity was concerned, very few people saw very clearly, the mobile products opportunity. Now, of course, it's clear.
I also said back in 2009, June of 2009, that I would be CEO for 3 to 5 years. 3 years because I felt that was the minimum amount of time I needed to shift the company strategy and to execute it. 5 years because I thought, well, by that time, I will have done my bit. I will have really done my duty with TSMC. Now, 4.5 years, almost 4.5 years have passed, and I did realize the shift and the -- at least the -- much of the execution of a new strategy at TSMC. So I plan to follow the initial intention that I said on the 5-year part, and that's why I said that 5 years, which is next June. Before then, we will appoint CEO or co-CEOs.
Now, the Chairman's role. I think that many people, but not everybody, knows what the Chairman's role in a company is in Taiwan. And let me just point out a few salient facts. Under both the Taiwan company law, and under the Taiwan customs, the Chairman of a company is always, always the ultimate authority. There's no such thing as a nonexecutive Chairman in Taiwan. And there's no such thing as an Executive Chairman either. The title Chairman does not require any modifier, any adjective, nor does it even admit of a modifier. Chairman is Chairman, and is the ultimate authority. However, not every Chairman is hands-on. Many Chairmen, well, not many, but a few, are not hands-on. I, frankly, was not hands-on between '05 and '09. And now, I'm telling you that I will be hands-on.
Well, those are the comments that I wanted to make. I guess, we are now ready for Q&A.",1869

A couple of questions. First, on the 16-nanometer, you have made an accurate prediction of your position in 28 in 2 respects. You had said that TSMC would extend your lead at 28 several years ago, and that has occurred. And you'd also indicated that you would actually be with your partners more competitive than the 2 biggest foundries, who were at 22. So could you offer us to forecast of 20 and 16 on both metrics, number 1, will you extend your lead relative to your competition in your view? And number 2, where do you rest with your partners relative to the IDMs on 16 and 20?",127

On 20, well, definitely, I think on 20. On 16, I think the battle is still raging. On 20, I believe that we will start with a very high market share, just like we did on 28 and so on. And we'll keep that high market share for quite a while, several years. On 16, I believe that we do have the serious competitors, the gorillas that I mentioned, and -- but my goodness, we intend to prevail. But I'm not going to tell you now that we have already won, all right? I hope to tell you in, let's say, 1.5 years, I guess, that it's -- that we have already won. But on 16, the battle is still raging.",138

Well, I don't think I'm an expert on that. I'm however, you know who our ecosystems are -- people are, and we do have Cliff, I think. Well, not I -- nor just I think, I know that we have Cliff that's in charge, responsible for that part of working with our ecosystem partners. And as you know, ARM is a very important one and -- but others -- and others -- other EVA and IP providers are also very important. But more importantly I think, that our large customers don't need the ecosystem as much as the middle-sized customers. And that's why the bond, our bond with the large customers becomes very important. And we have really, I believe, worked very hard. I -- even 15 years ago, I started to say that we had the 3 major strengths: Technology, manufacturing and customer partnership. And that's true today. Technology, manufacturing and customer partnership. And we later kind of rotated between the word partnership and the word customer's trust. To us, it means the same thing. So the large customers are most important, and they don't rely on the ecosystem as much. They do use it, they don't rely, because they have their own special stuff.",210

And second question for Lora would be on the EPS growth comments that you made earlier getting probably back, about back to trend, if not exceeding trend on the EPS growth. Does that require that your gross profit, structural profitability, will actually increase next year to achieve that target? Or can you sustain -- achieve that EPS growth with maintaining your current structural profitability?",67

I know many analysts was concerned about our capital intensity being so high, how can we maintain our structural profitability? I have went through the number myself. So let me explain it to you this way. Our depreciations, there's about 85% of our depreciation that goes to COGS. If you just look at the depreciation increase, you will see, ""Oh, year-over-year increased so high. Now this year versus last year is around 20%, next year will be more than 35%. So how can you sustain your structural profitability?"" The thing is, we will invest in capital expenditure, actually we're adding the capability to do more business, so our quantity will also increase. So if you divide it by the unit cost with depreciation cost, actually it doesn't increase that much. Other than that, since we have migrated technology to more leading-edge, so our average ASP will go higher, as you have seen the past few years. In addition to that, with the continued productivity improvement from our operation people, we were able to drive the non-depreciation costs go down on a per annual basis. That means we can maintain the structural profitability.

And so I would not rely on that normal seasonal pattern. And as to what the first quarter will be, I think that it's a little too early to forecast at this point. But seasonality refers to what happens during 1 whole year, what happens quarter-to-quarter. I have said earlier that we are very optimistic about next year will be a double-digit growth year, the whole year, the full year. Now, if the first quarter comes in a bit low, you will have a surge in the second and third quarter. We'll rattle our teeth. And in fact, the mobile product's fourth quarter, well, this time in this year, was fourth quarter is a bit down, 10% down.

As Chairman just talked about, the ramping profile for 20-nanometer will be more aggressive than 28-nanometer. So we expect 28-nanometer -- 20-nanometer will contribute quite significant revenue in 2014, because of our skill ramp so fast, so we can expect the margin growth will be faster, in a much faster slope than 28-nanometer if you compare to the same period versus same period.",79

We had a setback in 2011, and we had to make up. So in 2012, if you show that slide again, the dotted line -- the upper dotted line is that 10% growth line, and we had a setback in 2011. And so in 2012, we had to grow faster than 10%, PBT had to grow faster than 10%. And then in 2013, it grew faster than 10% again. And now, in 2014, I'll drew a kind of hazy ellipse here to show where it might fall, and my expectation is that it's going to -- we're going to more than catch-up in 2014, and we're going to do -- by the time 2015 comes, I think we'll be above that. So now, we're going to grow double digit, I think, comfortably double digit next year, not just barely double digit, but comfortably double digit next year, okay? And it's our intention to grow our PBT proportionately. So you say how can we do that? Well, gee, that's complicated. You can't just -- it's a mistake to try to analyze our company one technology at a time, or one customer at the time. I run a company as a whole, and parts of the company may be down, but parts of them were up. And I just want to be sure, that's my hands-on, that the up parts more than balance the down parts, okay? So just to try to say that the mobile part -- the mobile part is -- mobile product growth is slowing down and that's why maybe our revenue growth next year will be a bit less than this year. This year is 17% to 18%, and next year, maybe a bit lower. But it will still be comfortably, as I said, double digit.",320

On the outlook for beyond 2015, well, look, we made a 5-year plan, and I thought that was pretty far-reaching back in 2010, and nobody even remember that until today when I brought it out again, okay? So now, I said in my autobiography that as far as semiconductors are concerned, I am an eternal optimist. I believe that people will keep finding new applications for semiconductors. Now it's the mobile products. Now the next one may well be something even more miniature and something even more convenient, now like the wearables, I like the watches and the -- but I think it could well be something even beyond that. But you -- I don't think one can foretell what the future holds for us in semiconductors. I know that it will be good, because it's a fundamental component. It's just as indispensable to the world as almost food is, I would say. Now, of course, people can never go without food, but in this information technology world -- and information technology was what drove the economic progress in the last 30 years.

But I do think that the capital intensity has either peaked this year -- this year, the capital intensity is about 50%. We have $20 billion of revenue, and about $10 billion of CapEx. So I do think that 50% is about the right peak. So now, then EUV. Well, actually, I just met with our ASML partners yesterday, and they told me just a reverse of what you just said; it has slowed or something. No, I think that the EUV progress is good and we are obviously tracking it very, very carefully. And remember, we are a significant investor in ASML and we also join in their EUV R&D program, and so we're tracking it very carefully, and we are pretty sure that we're going to need it sometime in the future.",253

But then, the first wave was taken over by the IC makers, IC suppliers for the mobile products. And the second wave now, is what used to be the first wave. Well, in the first wave, there are some users that are later than the first, first wave.

I suspect, since the original first wave leading [ph] technology adaptor, are many for the computer for QWERTY of FPGA PLD.

It's not found the Poly/SiON, because I think that for them, they need more powerful devices. So that means going forward, of growth -- revenue growth for 28-nanometer probably will be even faster than the [indiscernible] growth because with this high-K metal gate adoption, we go for the higher ASP and a higher gross margin.

My second question is on the 10-nanometer side. I think that Intel is pushing out 14-nanometer production, mass production by 1 quarter to maybe first quarter next year.

According to your product roadmap, now you are going to risk production 10-nanometer from 2015.

I think not a different direction, but I think we modify our tactics almost all the time. The general direction I think is still the same. The general direction is that this is a technology, ours is a technology business and we want to lead in technology. Now however, to allow that, we have to generate enough income from the existing products, existing technologies. And therefore, we need a good structural profitability. Now, all right, so once we have good structural profitability, we push R&D, we push R&D expenses, we push our R&D, expand our R&D capability to the limit. And of course, to realize all the benefits that technology leadership brings in, we also expand our capacity, our manufacturing capability relentlessly. That has been the general direction, all right. At the same time, in order to make sure that we have customers, large customers all the time, we, as I said, we work every day to earn the customer's trust. So I mean, all of this is, to say, integrated the whole. So that general direction does not change. Now as far as the tactics are concerned, they change quite often. How much emphasis do we put on 1 technology versus another, particularly the specialty technologies, how much do we put on one versus another? How much really can we afford to expand on the -- and how much emphasis we could put on 1 customer versus another? Those are changing all the time. But the general direction does not change. The general direction as I already described it. First, you have to have good structural profitability. Then you push, you expand, you strengthen R&D to the limit of your affordability, and then to realize the benefits that technology leadership brings you, you expand manufacturing. So I mean, just then if you have listened to what I said, you'll begin to understand why our R&D expenses have gone up, why we have emphasized so much technology leadership, and why our capital expenditures have gone up so much.

And she's saying that 20-nanometer will follow the same pattern. I tend to think that 20-nanometer will reach the corporate average sooner than 8 quarters, because as I said earlier, the learning curve is faster up to this point than 28-nanometers. So I think that, that will continue. And in fact, I think it's almost necessary for 20-nanometers to learn faster because the ramp-up is very fast. The ramp-up is faster than 28-nanometers. So in time, it will have to take a shorter time for 20-nanometers to reach corporate average. So I think it will -- I cannot answer you exactly what it will be by the end of next year, because the end of next year, will only be the third or  fourth quarter but I do say that there will be -- the gross margin will be higher than the 28-nanometer was at its third or fourth quarter.",154

And just to follow-up, I think you talked earlier about unit costs, and we can all see at 20-nanometer, this is the first node you start multi-patterning and FinFET will be expensive. If you're expecting to maintain your structural profitability and the cost arising, what do you think the impact of this is going to have on the mobile value chain? Do you think the mobile market can absorb a cost increase, or do you think that chip prices are structurally going to start rising?

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your participation today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of 2012 financial performance, followed by the guidance for the first quarter.
In the fourth quarter, despite inventory correction in the IT supply chain, demand for our products was higher than we expected 3 months ago, resulting in above-guidance revenue and profit margins. On a sequential basis, our fourth-quarter revenue decreased 7% to TWD 131 billion. Gross margin was 47.2%, down 1.6 percentage points from the third quarter. This is mainly due to lower capacity utilization, while cost improvements and the favorable inventory evaluation adjustment offset some of the decline. Operating margin was 35.2%, down 2 percentage points from the third quarter. Operating expense as a percent of revenue increased 0.4 percentage points over a smaller revenue base.
Non-operating items were small losses of TWD 7 million in the fourth quarter as we recorded an impairment charge for certain invested companies. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 1.61; ROE was 23.8%.
In terms of revenue by application, as I just mentioned, inventory correction in the IT supply chain has affected overall demand for TSMC’s wafer. However, demand for mobile computing devices remained firm, making communication the only growing segment in the fourth quarter. While demand for computer, consumer and industrial-related products all declined by double digits. As a result, revenue contribution from communication-related applications further increased from 49% in the third quarter to 54% in the fourth quarter.
On a full year basis, communication increased 23% and that would be turned at 50% of our wafer revenue. The major contributing segment includes application processors, base vent, CMOS image sensor and wireless LANs, reflecting the strong demand for mobile computing devices.
Another fast-growing application is industrial and standard which grew 42% year-over-year. The growth was mainly contributed by the increasing usage of Power IC data converter, touch controller and a flash controller within mobile devices. This also reflected our success in developing specialty technology businesses.
If we look at our revenue by technology, thanks to customers’ strong demand for TSMC’s 28-nanometer technology and the excellent execution by the operation team, revenue contribution from this node jumped from 13% in the prior quarter to 22% in the fourth quarter. We see 28-nanometer as a very successful node for TSMC, which already accounts for 12% of our full year revenue in 2012. Looking forward, we remain confident 28 revenue contribution will exceed 30% for the whole year in 2013 and margin will be at corporate level starting from this quarter.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, on the asset side, cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at TWD 151 billion, slightly increased from last quarter. Long-term investment increased to TWD 66 billion, mainly due to the TWD 31.5 billion investment in ASML shares. This strategic investment will be recognized as available for sale in our balance sheet.
On the liability side, current liability increased TWD 23 billion, mainly due to increase in payables to contractors and equipment suppliers as well as increase in short-term loans for hedging purpose. Long-term debt increased by TWD 4.4 billion to TWD 82 billion as we issued more corporate bonds in the fourth quarter.
Our days of inventory increased by 6 days to 50 days, mainly due to higher work-in-process for 28-nanometer product in response to a strong market demand and an increase of raw material.
On the cash flow side, we generated TWD 85 billion from operations in the fourth quarter and invested TWD 60 billion in capital expenditure. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 5 billion to TWD 143 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Due to higher operating cash flow and the lower capital expenditure, free cash flow improved from negative TWD 2 billion in the third quarter to positive TWD 26 billion in the fourth quarter.
Now let’s take a look at the capital expenditure. We spent $2 billion on capital expenditure in the fourth quarter. As a result, full year CapEx ended at $8.3 billion, in line with our prior guidance.
Let me make some comments on our capacity plan. As we continued adding capacity for 28-nanometer process technology, our total capacity increased 4% to around 4 million 8-inch equivalent wafers in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, our 12-inch capacity had increased by 21% and the total annual capacity increased by 14% to reach about 15 million wafers. We expect the total capacity to continue increase -- to decrease slightly by 1.2% in the first quarter of 2013 due to fewer working days and scheduled maintenance.
Now, I would like to give you a recap of our performance in the year of 2012. 2012 is a record year for TSMC. Our strength in technology and manufacturing made us well-positioned in the mobile computing markets. We are happy to mark a year with record sales and profitability, despite difficult macroeconomic environment.
Compared with 2011, our revenue increased 18.5% year-over-year to reach TWD 506 billion. We continue to outperform semiconductor and foundry industries. As for profitability although the rising depreciation and fast ramp of 28-nanometer has indeed put pressure on our gross margin. Nevertheless, our gross margin has increased to 48%, a 2.7 percentage point increase from 2011, thanks to higher utilization of the capacity we invested in. Earnings per share increased 23.8% to TWD 6.41, and ROE for the whole year was 24.6% compared to the 22.3% in 2011.
Before I dive in the first quarter guidance, I would like to brief you about the changes in our effective tax rate in 2013.
TSMC’s tax rate is projected to be 14% in year 2013, which is significantly higher than 8.7% in 2012. The higher tax rate are due to the following reasons. First, the introduction of capital gain tax in Taiwan, coupled with the increase of the AMP rate from 10% to 12% will cause our effective tax rate to increase by 2 percentage points.
Second. Higher tax penalty on our profit on return earning as we are making more net income by keeping the same dividend. This will add 1.7 percentage points to our effective tax rate. Third, a 0.9 percentage point increase caused by an expiration of certain tax exemptions. Lastly, a 0.7 percentage point is attributed to the absence of certain subsidiaries’ loss carried forward. Under the current tax environment, we expect the tax rate for 2013 and 2014 will be around 14%.
I have finished my financial report. Now, let me provide you our first quarter guidance. Based on our current business expansion and the forecast foreign exchange rate of 28.90, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 127 billion and TWD 129 billion. In terms of margins, we expect the first-quarter gross margin to be between 43.5% and 45.5%, and operating margin to between 31.5% and 33.5%.
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Morris Chang.",1169
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6159.0,2471636.0,93604814.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I’ll make a few comments on last year’s achievements, on this year as a whole, and specifically on first quarter. And I will also comment on 28-nanometer technology and on 20-nanometer and the 16 FinFET, and then finally on CapEx, this year’s CapEx.
Lora has already reported the financials of last year to you. Basically, last year was a year of achievements for us. Revenue grew 18% to reach $17.1 and EPS grew 24% to reach TWD 6.41 per share.
28-nanometer technology was a resounding success. The production in 2012 increased more than 30-fold, 30-fold over 2011. And we have enjoyed throughout the year, in spite of a lot of attempt by the competition, we enjoyed throughout the year close to 100% foundry market share in 28-nanometer technology.
We have also, in the year 2012, further strengthened our R&D. Our R&D expenditure increased from TWD 33.8 billion in 2011 to TWD 40.4 billion in 2012. Our R&D people increased from 3,400 at the end of 2011 to 3,900 at the end of 2012.
Now, a few words on 2013 and the first quarter of 2013. For the full year 2013, we are forecasting a global GDP growth of 2.6%, which is a bit higher than last year’s global GDP growth for 2.4%, now we’re forecasting 2.6% for next year -- I’m sorry, this year.
We are forecasting a world FTE market growth of 3%, we are forecasting a fabless company growth of 9%. We are forecasting a foundry industry growth of 7%, and we are forecasting a TSMC revenue growth much higher than 7%. So those are our forecast for the full year 2013.
For first quarter 2013, I have some comments on supply chain inventory to make. Three months ago, in the last investors conference in October, we expected the supply chain inventory to decline from 7 days above seasonal in fourth quarter to 1 day below seasonal in the first quarter. That was our expectation [ 3 ] months ago that the supply chain inventory will decline from 7 days above seasonal in fourth quarter to one day below seasonal in the first quarter, all together an 8 days decline.
Now, because many mobile product manufacturers have accelerated their new product launch this year, and so late in the year they have now pulled ahead to earlier in the year. And therefore, they need IC supplies, IC inventories earlier.
So the supply chain inventory now is forecast to decline only slightly from fourth quarter to first quarter. And so 7 days above normal to 1 day below normal, we are now forecasting that the inventory will decline from 6 days above seasonal -- well you know, in sort of 7 days. Three months ago we thought the inventory was going to be 7 days above seasonal. Now, we have better information and we think it’s 6 days above seasonal in the fourth quarter. So the big change is that we are forecasting it to decline to only 4 days above seasonal in the first quarter, which is only a 2-day equivalent, 2-day decline, instead of the 8-day decline that we had forecast 3 months ago.
Orders resulted in a higher first quarter than we thought 3 months ago. So now we expect the first quarter revenue to decline while in 3 months ago, we expected to decline. The first quarter revenue we expected to decline from the fourth quarter. We now expect the first quarter revenue to be essentially flat in U.S. dollars from the fourth quarter. Essentially flat from the fourth quarter in U.S. dollars.
A few more words on 28-nanometer technology. After accomplishing a 30-fold increase in production, 28-nanometer capacity and output continued to ramp up aggressively this year. Production of 28-nanometer wafers in 2013 will triple that of 2012, adding the newcomers may ask we have customers. The old customers, I think, know us well enough not to ask that, if we have customers.
High-k metal gate will surpass oxynitride. That’s in the 28-nanometer. We have, as you know, actually 4 types. Three of those are high-k metal gate, and the earliest type that we introduced was the oxynitride, and indeed last year, the majority of the production was the oxynitride. But the more advanced version high-k metal gate will surpass oxynitride in the third quarter this year. And in the fourth quarter, it will even surpass oxynitride even more.
Gross margin percentage of 28-nanometer in 1Q ‘13, which is this quarter, will be slightly higher than corporate average, and is expected to remain so in 2013. This is neither dragging the corporate average down nor is it pulling it up.
Now, a few words on 20-nanometer and 16 FinFET. Both technologies are in progress in R&D. Both represent state of the art, leading-edge technology not just in foundry but in the whole SC industry.
And enough discussions have taken place with enough customers with large requirements to lead us to believe that in both its first and second year of production, in both the first and second year production of 20 SoC and that first year will be next year, 2014. The second year will be a year after that, 2015. In both those years of 20 SoC production, the volume of 20 SoC will be larger than 28-nanometer in its first and second year of production, which were last year and this year. That’s a long sentence, but let me repeat it. In slides it didn’t work. We think that our volume of 20 SoC next year, 2014, will be greater than the volume of 28-nanometer last year and we think the volume of 20 SoC in 2015 will be greater than the volume of 28-nanometer this year.
So a few more words about CapEx. This year it will be about TWD 9 billion, give or take a few hundred million. TWD 9 billion. 88% of it will be for 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, building facility equipment. But basically, 88% will be for 28, 20, 16, everything. We are building new buildings now, in fact, or we have been building new buildings for quite a while.
Facilities and equipment. 5% will be for R&D equipment. That’s basically 10-nanometers and beyond and the co-laws or whatever. 2% for specialty technology equipment, and that is power, embedded flash, micro controller, imaging and so on. 2% of capital. And 1% is for the piece of land that we just acquired in Zhunan. I think I told you about it last time. Did I not? I think I told...",1096

Both LED and solar, our strategy is first to achieve a technological distinction, either better performance than competitors -- current competitors or better cost than current competitors, anyway, a technological distinction before we start large-scale production, before we put a lot of capital money into it, et cetera. That’s the philosophy. That is the strategy, philosophy, for both solar and LED. At this point, I think we are perhaps a little further ahead in LED than in solar. I think the environment is a bit more friendly to the LED also. So in LED, we are forging our way ahead. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, last quarter, we already had some commercial revenue. By commercial revenue, I mean more than samples; a really real product, for real money too. We already have some revenue and we expect the revenue to increase pretty dramatically this year. I don’t know if it is going to be 30-fold or not, but it will increase pretty dramatically this year. Now, on solar, as I said, the environment is not as friendly because the world has at least silicon solar capacity gloves. And major countries are putting up incentives for more production. However, we think that our thin-film, our thicker CIGE technology is a pretty promising one. And we are spending a lot of R&D money to try to achieve a distinction with the thicker technology, but we are not in the commercial production, commercial revenue stage yet.",246

So are you considering to change your depreciation here on your 20-nanometer, 30-nanometer or even 50-nanometer investment, since most of these investments on these certain liabilities increment actually can be shared. So that means that investment on the banking on Lifescience is basically are you considering to really depreciation here for the investment on this node?",80

I’m not trying to be coy. It’s just that if I say -- if I predict more specifically, I think that we’ll get a call from the Taiwan SEC and they will wanted. So that’s the reason. So now, you asked about the driver. The driver is the 28-nanometer. And just a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation will show you that the growth of 28-nanometer this year will actually be greater than the total growth of the company if the total growth of company -- even if the total growth of the company is much higher than 7%. With our stocking about what, this year’s production of 28 -- tripled, yes. So that will be in line. And I think your question was originally on what customers, and I’m not going to comment on customers, but I will say that the driver is 28-nanometer technology.",172

I wanted to ask and maybe talk a little bit more in terms of some of the end markets, because I did notice that your computer and consumer businesses were pretty good in 2012, showing a pretty strong growth.

So I think every one of them is a formidable competitor, but I also think that we are ready to tackle, to fight every one of them, as we have always been ready to fight every new competitor. I remember all the quarreling that I went through when we had UMC, we had Snake, and we had global foundry, and now we have Samsung and we have Intel. Well, every one of those I think -- everyone was a formidable competitor at that time. Everyone was. And we take every one very, very seriously, but we also fought with everyone in the past, and with the current competitors that have just appeared on the scene, we have always felt that we have a lot of strength.

If I could follow up on the R&D investment where you had significant growth in 2012, could you talk about whether you expect the same growth in R&D and OpEx as a percent of sales, or as you accelerate your sales growth rate, do you think there’s a bit of operating leverage?",55

First of all, I said a little earlier that the growth engine in the next few years is going to be technology. Our growth engine is going to be technology. And we have proven it now already with 28-nanometer, and we are going to improve it with 20, with 16 and then a little later with the 10. So why are we -- why have we so dramatically increased our R&D effort in the last few years? Number one, all right, because slow -- technology is going to be our growth engine, and I have said, more than once, more than 2 or 3 times, in fact, that as far as Moore’s law is concerned, if anyone is going to pursue Moore’s law to the end, we will be there. So a large part of the money is being spent on the further pursuit of Moore’s law. And that, of course, also includes really the investment that we have made in ASML, and it also includes the more path-finding type of R&D to improve transistor performance. So now, a smaller part will be spent on cores and then another part, which is perhaps a bit later than what’s spent on cores, will be spent on specialty technologies and embedded flash and imaging, power, power management, and all those specialty technology, that we expect to fill our more mature capacities. Then we grow on new technology and we stay profitable, both with the new technology and with the backfilling of the capacity by specialty technologies. I guess those are about the main uses of R&D fund, R&D money. Those are the biggest reasons for us to expand R&D. First, relentless pursuit of Moore’s law, all facets of it, performance as well as costs as well as density, and including and the transistor performance improvement. Second. Cores and specialty technologies. So those are the main uses.",335

Each one of the next few years will be either a growth year or a strong growth year. Well, by strong, I mean double digits. By growth year, well, I mean, I don’t consider a 1% growth for the year. So 1% to 10% is a growth year. And strong growth year is double digit. So the next few years I expect that every one of them will be either growth or strong growth. And so R&D expenditure will go up, even though the percent of revenue is not going to change very much. I don’t think it’s going to decrease.",147

I mean, about 1 percentage point better than last year. 100 basis points better than last year. On the other hand, we have a couple of uncertainties; one quite large and one not so large. The quite-large one is the molding of the more -- the mature -- all the technologies except 28. 28-nanometer, we are quite confident will have a utilization rate of around 100%. But all the other technology lines may have a lower utilization than last year. Now, keep in mind that last year was a tough comparison. Last year, everything was low to the -- close to 100%. And so, I’m not saying at all that this year, our utilization will be bad, but I’m saying that last year was a tough comparison. And so, even though our structural -- our definition of our structural profitability is leaves utilization to one side, so our structural I would rate this year will be better than last year, no less than 1 percentage point better than last year. But if you start to talk about actual profit margin, then you have to take into account the utilization, and as I said, the uncertainty, the large uncertainty, is the relation. And you’ve mentioned -- we have hold the numbers before.",221

It all points towards several good years ahead of us. Now for that to happen, I think obviously technology, you need to migrate. And I think we can also predict about that. But the end margin also has to be growing at a much bigger -- a faster pace than before as well. I’m wondering if you could talk about what gives you the confidence in multiple years out, because it’s a very different comment than you saying forecast for additional couple of quarters.

Last year, I meant 5 years, and now, I mean 4 years, okay? So it’s not multiple, multiple, multiple years. It’s 4 years, okay? And then you are concerned that the world may end in the next 4 years? Anyway, it would be same. No, of course, we are not predicting anything like that and we are just following the conventional, consensual economic scenario, which is that the developed countries, U.S. and Europe, will grow very slowly. Well, actually, U.S. will grow sort of medium slowly, 2.5% perhaps, and Europe will do worse and Japan, also, will do worse than the United States. Of course, one never knows what the new Prime Minister is going to do when those -- what he has already done seems to be a bit on the positive side. But anyway, we’re assuming that, and we are also assuming that the developing economies will do quite well, China principally, but also a lot of other countries that China now exports to. Now all these smartphones and some tablets that China makes are not for Chinese consumption. They go to other countries. They go to other developing countries. And we believe that those developing economies will do quite well. So that’s our macroeconomic scenario. As far as the market is concerned, the application market is concerned, we predict that the mobile products will be the dominant new product on the computer scene. And I think that they will continue to eat into the traditional notebook PC market. And I think these are really not -- they are pretty conventional assumptions. And those are the assumptions that we are making when we say that we are going to grow quite strongly in the next 4 years, 4 years’ time, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. Yes.",304

But 3 months ago, I deliberately omitted the word “strong”, but I said there’ll be rebound. So now, I can maintain my words that I used 3 months ago. There will be rebound. Yes. But it would not be a strong rebound as we thought it was going to be 6 months ago. Six months ago, we thought this quarter would be quite low. In fact, 6 months ago, we thought the fourth quarter and first quarter will be quite low. And it has now turned out that the fourth quarter was quite a lot stronger than we anticipated 6 months ago. And the first quarter is also stronger than we anticipated 6 months ago. But then second quarter, the strong rebound that I referred to 6 months ago in the second quarter will not be quite as strong as we thought 6 months ago.

It was the philosophy that I started 27 years ago, when TSMC was starting. My philosophy then and my philosophy now is I want all the products we make to be within a pretty narrow gross margin range. So that remains true to today. I don’t want -- I mean, the reason I started that philosophy was because I hated that you have to pick because of the gross margin. Well, capacity becomes tight. We make more of this because it’s higher margin, and that was such an unnecessary burden on the manager’s mind. I mean, I didn’t want that. And now, I still don’t want that. I don’t want to have to pick between the various opportunities like this because of gross margin. So a simple answer to your question is we charge and keep the margins on all products within a pretty narrow range, I would say, as a 10-point range. Well, not even that big.
