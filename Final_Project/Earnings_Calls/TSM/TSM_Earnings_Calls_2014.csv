Good afternoon, and happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start my presentation with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of 2013's financial performance, followed by the guidance for the first quarter of 2014.
In the fourth quarter, TSMC's business was negatively impacted by semiconductor supply chain's inventory management. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter revenue declined 10.3% to TWD 146 billion. Gross margin was 44.5%, down 4 percentage points from the third quarter, mainly due to lower capacity utilization. Total operating expenses decreased 11% as we took several expense cutting measurements during the quarter. This led to an operating margin of 32.8%, down 3.9 percentage points from the third quarter. Non-operating items was a gain of TWD 2.6 billion. We have reversed the TWD 1.2 billion impairment loss due to strong business recovery from one of our invested companies. In addition, we received the last payment of litigation settlement from SMIC. Overall, EPS was TWD 1.73 in the fourth quarter. ROE was 21.7%.
Let's take a look at revenue by applications. During the fourth quarter, inventory correction continued across all major segments of the semiconductor supply chain. Our Communication-, Computer- and Consumer-related revenue declined 13%, 7% and 20%, respectively, while Industrial and Standard product remained flat during the quarter.
On a full year basis, Communication increased 29% and represented 54% of our revenue of 2013. This reflected the strong demand for application processors, base band, display driver and other peripheral ICs used in mobile computing devices. Computer decreased 10%, with PC graphics declining the most. Consumer increased 43% year-over-year, reflecting the strong demand in the next generation game consoles. Industrial and Standard increased 14% as mobile devices use various ICs enabled by our specialty technologies, such as touch controller and the power management IC, et cetera. 
By technology, 28-nanometer contributed 34% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 32% in the third quarter. On a full year basis, 28-nanometer tripled and had contributed about 30% of our total wafer revenue, a big increase from the 12% in 2012.
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities was TWD 245 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Current liabilities increased by TWD 42 billion due to higher accounts payable to equipment suppliers. Accounts receivable turnover days increased to 48 days. Days of inventory remained at 45 days. 
Let me make a few comments on the cash flow. During the fourth quarter, we generated TWD 103 billion from operations, invested TWD 74 billion in capital expenditure and repaid TWD 2 billion short-term loans. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance increased TWD 26 billion to TWD 243 billion. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of TWD 29 billion. 
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in year 2013. 2013 was another record year for TSMC. Thanks to the technology leadership and excellent manufacturing execution in 28-nanometer, we were able to capture the strong growth in mobile computing market. From a financial point of view, revenue increased 18% year-over-year to reach TWD 597 billion or, in U.S. dollar terms, about USD 20 billion. On the profitability side, gross margin declined 1.1 percentage point to 47.1% due to lower capacity utilization in 2013, while our structure profitability continued to improve. On cash flow, we spent TWD 288 billion or USD 9.7 billion in CapEx, up 17% from 2012. However, we were able to grow operating cash flow at a faster rate of 22% to reach TWD 347 billion. Therefore, free cash flow increased by 54% year-over-year to reach TWD 60 billion. On earnings, income before tax increased by 19% versus 2012. Meanwhile, we took a hit by the higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate went up from 9% in 2012 to 13% in 2013. As a result, EPS increased at a slower pace of 13% to reach TWD 7.26, set a new record. Overall, our ROE was 24% for the whole year, meet our long-term financial objective of bigger than 20% ROE.
I have finished my report on financial part. Now let me provide you with first quarter outlook. Based on the current business expectation and a forecast exchange rate of TWD 30, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 136 billion and TWD 138 billion. This will translate into 6% Q-over-Q decline. On the margin side, we expect the first quarter gross margin to be between 44.5% and 46.5% and operating margin to be between 32% and 34%. As you can see, first quarter gross margin is expected to be better than the fourth quarter despite a lower revenue. Let me explain why. You all know our business has certain seasonality. First quarter is normally a slow quarter. If we can start a wafer earlier in a slower quarter, then we will be able to complete more wafers in the following quarters when the business pace picks up. This way, we're able to complete and ship more wafers to support a surge demand in the peak quarter without having to deal to a peak capacity for that quarter. Meanwhile, we can also benefit from better utilization rate. In a slower quarter, it improves our profitability. We began to implement this practice a few months ago and expect it to benefit our gross margin by 2 to 3 percentage points in the first quarter. 
Another thing I want to highlight is the tax rate for 2014. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 13.3%, which is about the same as 2013's 13%. However, from a quarterly perspective, second quarter would carry about 40%, the total tax burden for the whole year, due to the need to accrue the 10% return -- on which field we'll return earnings.
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman, Dr. Morris Chang.",999

Today, our comments are scheduled as on the slide on your left. First, I am very glad to have the opportunity to introduce our new, hot management team.
I first start with Lora, although I think everyone -- most are aware of. Lora has a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and master's degree from National Taiwan University, both degrees in finance. She worked for Cyanamid, Wyse, Thomas & Betts and TI-Acer before she joined TSMC in 1999. And she has been TSMC's CFO since 2003. 
Next, Dr. C.C. Wei. C.C. is -- has a bachelor's degree from Chiao Tung University and a Ph.D. from Yale University, both in electrical engineering. C.C. worked for TI, SGS, Chartered before joining TSMC in 1998. C.C. has been Senior VP of Operations, Senior VP of Business Development, Co-COO. And in the Co-COO job, C.C. was successively responsible for our R&D and our operations. Now C.C. is President and Co-CEO. C.C. is 60 years old, and I should add that Lora is 57 years old.
Mark Liu. Mark has a B.S. from National Taiwan University and a Ph.D. from Berkeley, both in electrical engineering and computer science. Mark worked for Intel, Bell Telephone Labs before joining TSMC in 1993. And at TSMC, he has been VP, Senior VP of Operations, and he was also a Co-COO. And all the time he was Co-COO, he was responsible for our sales, marketing and planning. And now Mark and C.C. are Presidents and Co-CEOs of the company. Mark is 59 years old. I'm not going to introduce myself. I think you already know me.
So let me talk about 4Q, and I will just give you a few comments, a few words, on the year 2013. And I will say more words for this year. 4Q, I think Lora already discussed it. It's pretty much as we guided it 3 months ago. Our revenue was affected by the supply chain's inventory management across almost all major segments, particularly in Communication-related applications. The supply chain DOI declined from 1 day above seasonal in the third quarter to 1 day below seasonal in the fourth quarter. However, our structural profitability remains intact. The lower utilization caused by lower revenue resulted in a lower gross margin and operating profit percent than 3Q. On 2013, overall, we are pleased by the results. It was another consecutive year of record performance. And as Lora pointed out, revenue grew by 18%, and profit before tax grew by 19%.
Now looking at 2014, we expect still another consecutive year of double-digit growth in revenue, and I will talk a little more about profit later. 1Q is a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies, including us, and supply chain continued to manage inventory conservatively even when the DOI has already reached below seasonal level. We expect the supply chain DOI to be 2 days below seasonal in 1Q -- at the end of 1Q. Our structural profitability in 1Q still remains intact. In fact, it will probably improve slightly, as you can tell from the guided profit margins.
For full year 2014, we forecast the following industry numbers: For worldwide semiconductor industry, we forecast 5% growth. For fabless industry, we forecast 8% growth. And for foundry industry, we forecast 10% growth. For TSMC, as I already did, we are forecasting revenue growth surpassing the growth of the foundry industry. 2014 capital budget is estimated to be between TWD 9.5 billion and TWD 10 billion, similar to that of last year. About 95% of the capital expenditure is for advanced technologies, and we mean 20-nanometers, 16-nanometers, more 28-nanometers, R&D and our [indiscernible]. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by about 35% year-to-year. The ratio of depreciation expense to revenue is expected to rise by a few percentage points in 2014. 
However, we will have a higher than the ASP by several percentage points resulting from our new technologies, principally the high-K metal gate 28-nanometer and the 20-SoC. We also plan to have better operating efficiencies. The higher operating efficiency would include lower variable cost to wafer, higher manufacturing productivity, et cetera. Now between those 2, principally, the higher blended average price which results from the richer product mix, principally from that and also partly from the better operating efficiencies, we intend to offset the increase of depreciation as a percent of revenue. We believe we can maintain and perhaps even improve our structural profitability in '14 versus past year. From second quarter on, we'll see strong growth.
We are growth engines. In terms of market segments, mobile products, smartphones and tablets, we'll be a growth engine. In terms of technology, high-K metal gate 28-nanometer and 20-SoC are our growth engines. 
I will say a few words about mobile product now, and C.C. will a little later talk about the technologies -- the new technologies. Smartphones are expected to grow by 25% to 1.246 billion units, and tablets are expected to grow by 21% to 307 million units. Now to be a little [indiscernible] range, the high-end smartphones are expected to grow 8% year-over-year to 325 million units; the middle end, 22% year-over-year to 449 million units; the lower end, 45% year-over-year to 472 million. And due to the continued performance improvements, which means multi-mode and 64-bit, et cetera, and also due to feature enhancements, such as fingerprint, MEMS, NFC and new standards in WiFi and Bluetooth, we expect silicon content for the mobile devices to continue to rise -- silicon content in the mobile devices to continue to rise. And TSMC share in the mild [ph] memory silicon content of these devices is expected to increase from 45% last year to 47% this year. As a result, TSMC revenue from mobile products are expected to grow more than 35%.
And just looking a little further ahead, further than this year, we expect to continue benefiting from the growth of mobile products in 2015 and expect to see emerging devices, such as wearables and others, to join the line for the mobile products.
Now let me ask C.C. to speak to the technology aspects of our global venture. C.C.?",1026
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6498.0,568453.0,25860652.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm C.C. Wei, and I will give you the update of our 28-nanometer high-K metal gate version.
Okay. Let me recap the history. We start the 28-nanometer's volume production in year 2011, now meaning under 28 ERP [ph], the oxynitride-gated version. And since then, the business continued to grow. So last year, we had tripled the 28-nanometer applications versus year 2012. And in this year, year 2014, the business, 28-nanometer, will continue to grow at least by another 20%. And all the increase are coming from the 28-nanometer, the high-K metal gate version, which is -- we named it 28HPM. Let me add more color to it. We expect we're going to have about -- more than 100 tape-outs from about 60 customers that -- in this year, in 28HPM.
Now you may ask why there are so many product, what is designed on this technology. One of -- the main reason I can give to you is the performance, the superior performance. For example, 28HPM compared with a 28 ERP [ph] now locks in another 30% of the speed at the same type of power consumption. Or you can say that at the same power consumption -- same speed, it will consume 50% less power, and everybody knows that the power consumption in a mobile device is very important, okay. That's why we think we have a very high put [ph] business on the 28HPM. 
Now furthermore, after the 28HPM, we also offer 28HPC [ph], which is a low-cost version of the 28HPM. The 28HPC [ph] is developed to meet the customers' demand to compete in the need to go in smartphone market. We expect that this 28HPC [ph] will have a very strong demand in the next 2 years. That's why we have it, okay.
Then to give you some information on the competition to explain why we are so confident on this 28-nanometer's high-K metal gate business. If you still remember that long time ago, we mentioned about gate-first data -- still remember that terminology? All right. So simply to say that gate-last version will give you better performance and better product control. And as a result, all our customers will enjoy their imaging, the gate-last version of technology, to have a higher or better performance if -- than other product, which are designed and -- with a different approach. In addition to that, I'll say that because of better product control and TSMC's manufacturing excellence, we have a much better yield than our competitors. And so that our customer will enjoy the lower bad [ph] cost. That's why we have it. And that's why we explained that our confidence on the 28 nanometers business, it will continue a very good business for us.
Now let me switch the deal to 20-SoC. That's another exciting news that we have I want to share with you. 20-SoC is -- have launched -- we've developed to enable TSMC customers to bid in the mobile device market. And this technology, we, beginning this year or next year, we'll have a very good business to capture. So probably, the space is now the 20-SoC. We have 2 fabs, Fab 12 and Fab 14, that complete the core of 20-SoC. And as a matter of fact, we started production. We are in the volume production as we speak right now. So it's in the high-volume production as we are speaking right now.
Let me add more information to that: First, there are more than USD 10 billion have been committed to build the capacity. Second, we have more than 2,500 engineers and 1,500 operators right now in manufacturing, doing the 20-SoC, the volume production. The rank and grade will be the fastest one in TSMC's history. Using the rank and grade, you can get a hint of the business, how big the business is. 
I've another fact to share with you. We have probably, at the end of this year, we have more than thousands of tape-out from about 1,000 customer that they are producing the 20-SoC product, okay. You might ask, ""How's business? How about the competition?"" If you have a very strong competition, you might -- you cannot have too much confidence on the future. Let me talk about the competition. I'm very confident that our 20-SoC is of high-K density, the volume production, as the 20-nanometers node. Please remember that high-K density and the high volume production. I don't think any competitors can say [indiscernible] and this kind of production and with this kind of K density at this time, nobody. And most of our competitors, to be frank with you, they are not even into this game yet. So we are confident we will have a good business that will contribute to TSMC's revenue, wafer revenue, by probably around 10% this year.
And that will conclude my presentation, and thank you for your attention.",823

Now looking into next year now, 2015 and perhaps even 2016, I think next year, this time, I will be telling you that our growth engines in technology next year, a year from now, is going to be 16-FinFET. Now recently, Intel published some data which showed our 16-FinFET technology to be behind, and we think that the data is highly misleading.
So I now would ask Mark Liu to speak to TSMC's competitiveness versus Intel and Samsung.",81
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6498.0,568453.0,25860654.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,5,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I will start this topic by update you our recent development status of our 16-FinFET technology. 16-FinFET technology has been a very fast-paced development work in TSMC, and we have achieved to reach production milestone of 16-FinFET in November '13, November last year. And this month, we should have the 1,000 hours, so-called, the technology qualification. So the technology is ready for customer product tape-out. Our 16-FinFET yield improvement has been ahead of our plan. This is because we have been leveraging the deals, learning on 20-SoC. Currently, 16-FinFET SRAM yield is already close to 20-SoC. And with this status, we are developing an enhanced transistor version of 16-FinFET plus, with 13% performance improvement. It will be the highest performance technology among all available 16- and 14-nanometer technology in 2014. The above progress status is well ahead of Samsung.
Let me comment on Intel's recent graph shown in their investor meetings, showing on the screen. I -- we usually do not comment on other companies' technology, but this -- because this has been talking about TSMC technology and, as Chairman said, has been misleading, to me, it's erroneous based on outdated data. So I'd like to make the following rebuttal: On this new graph, the vertical axis is the chip area on a large scale. Basically, this is compared to chip area reduction. On the horizontal axis, it shows the 4 different technologies: 32, 28; 22, 20; 14, 16-FinFET; and 10-nanometer. 32 is Intel technology, and 28 is TSMC technology so is the following 3 nodes, the smaller number, 20, around -- 14-FinFET is Intel, 16-FinFET is TSMC. On the view graph shown at Intel investor meeting, it is with the gray plot, showing here. The gray plot showed the 32- and the 20-nanometer TSMC is ahead of the area scaling and -- but -- however, with 16, the data -- gray data shows a little bit uptick. And following the same slope, go down to the 10-nanometer, was the correct data we show on the red line. That's our current TSMC data. The 16, we have in volume production on 20-nanometer. As C.C. just mentioned, this is the highest density technology in production today. We take the approach of significantly using the FinFET transistor to improve the transistor performance on top of the similar back-end technology of our 20-nanometer. Therefore, we leverage the volume experience in the volume production this year to be able to immediately go down to the 16 volume production next year, within 1 year, and this transistor performance and innovative layout methodology can improve the chip size by about 15%. This is because the driving of the transistor is much stronger so that you don't need such a big area to deliver the same driving circuitry. And for the 10-nanometer, we haven't announced it, but we did communicate with many of our customers that, that will be the aggressive scaling of technology we're doing. And so in the summary, our 10 FinFET technology will be qualified by the end of 2015. 10 FinFET transistor will be our third-generation FinFET transistor. This technology will come with industry's leading performance and density. So I want to leave this slot by 16-FinFET scaling is much better than Intel's set but still a little bit behind. However, the real competition is between our customers' product and Intel's product or Samsung's product.
TSMC's Grand Alliance, that is the alliance of us, our customers, EDA, IP, community and the supplier, is the largest and the only open technology platform for the widest range of product innovations in the industry today. As for the tape-out of our 16-FinFET, more than 20 customer product tape-outs of 16-FinFET technology is scheduled this year already. They include wide range of applications, baseband application processors, application process for SoCs, graphics, networking, hard disk drive, field-programmable array, CPUs and service. Our 16-FinFET technology captured a vast portion of products in the semiconductor industry. We've been actively working with our customer's designer on this. It's been -- since last year. TSMC's speed and productization of the customer's product and our ability to execute for a short time-to-market for a customer are far superior than Intel and Samsung.
So lastly, I will comment on the mobile products. With this 16-FinFET technology and the innovations of processor architecture and various IT from our customers, we are confident that this planned 16-FinFET mobile product, which is going to tape out to us, will be better than Samsung's 14-nanometer and better than Intel's 14 SoC.
Thank you very much.",762

Summary. In summary, I want to say the following: First, in 2014, we expect double-digit revenue growth and we expect to maintain or slightly improve our structural profitability. As a result, we expect our profit growth to be close to our revenue growth. In 2014, the market segment that most strongly fuels our growth is the smartphone and tablet, mobile segment. The technologies that fuel our growth are the 20-SoC and the 28 high-K metal gate, in both of which we have strong market share. In 2015, our strong technology growth will be 16-FinFET.

They build some inventory and that's all we're doing too. Of course, in our case, we have to get right, but I do believe that we have organized ourselves. We actually -- I wanted to start doing it as early as August of last year because, even at that time, we saw that the fourth quarter and the first quarter would be rather slow. And well, also, we had to organize [indiscernible] and people. People have to do better. If not their job, but their bonus is on the line.

We didn't get -- we really didn't get going until sometime in the -- around the middle of fourth quarter. So the effect of inventory building on the fourth quarter was minimal.

We started the President and the Co-CEO in November, and it has been now 2 months. And if you ask me now, has my life changed in the last 2 months, my answer is no. It has not changed. But I think that my effort, my time, has been spent more on the coaching aspect. I think that -- I do believe that I do more coaching. If I spend 100 hours and -- I now perhaps spend about 20 hours of the 100 hours on coaching, whereas in the past, I'd probably spend only 5 or 10 hours of the 100 hours on coaching. Now actually, this is an overseas call, is this correct? Yes. So let me just very -- explain very briefly what the Taiwan law and customs are in relation to a Chairman's authority and responsibility. Basically, by both law and custom, the Chairman of a company has the ultimate authority and responsibility, basically. However, he may delegate this authority and responsibility to the President. He may also take it back anytime. He can re-delegate it at any -- any and all, any or all of the responsibilities to the President. And now these 2 gentlemen are -- their title is President and Co-CEO. President comes first. They are, in a very legal sense, Presidents. Now the co-CEO is basically a western term. And then in the United States, a CEO usually bears the final, ultimate responsibility and authority. A Chairman in Taiwan does. In the U.S., it's the CEO. Now so my role in the future is really to convert these 2 gentlemen from the Taiwan-sense President to the U.S.-sense CEO, and it will be a gradual process.

So let me tell you a story, although it's not bad. It's customer focus. We, actually, first got committed to the 20. We got committed, and then suddenly, we realized that there was a need for FinFET or a faster FinFET. Since then, one of the guerillas in the business announced that there was a FinFET business. Now if we hadn't committed us already to 20, we might have skipped 20. I think we would have skipped 20. But we were committed already. So that was a good thing, getting committed. The customer was committed, too. That was a good thing. That was value we've gained a great deal, I think, on the 20. But we have to hasten up to do the 16 now. And I think the key, the team in TSMC, the R&D team, did a tremendous job in now getting the 16 to where it is now. That's the small -- the brief history. Did that answer your question?

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
I will start my presentation with financial highlights for the first quarter and follow by the guidance of the second quarter. You may have noticed from the information we provided to you today, starting from this year, we have changed the wafer units to 12-inch equivalent, as 12-inch accounts for the majority of our production capacities.
The first quarter came out better than expected. Our revenue, gross margin and operating margin were -- all exceeded the revised guidance. In the first quarter, the demand for TSMC's wafer was much stronger than we had initially predicted in mid-January. The strength then came from customers' better first quarter results, which led to a more positive outlook for the whole year, prompted to the active replenishment of inventory from a very low base in the fourth quarter last year. We were able to capture the bigger market share of customers' upside demand, thanks to the better performance and the higher yield and reliability for our advanced technologies.
First quarter revenue increased 1.7% on a sequential basis and 11.6% on year-over-year basis to reach TWD 148 billion. Gross margin was 47.5%, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter last year mainly due to higher capacity utilizations, a favorable foreign exchange rate, offset by unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments. Operating margin was 35.4%, up 2.6 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Non-op item was a small gain of TWD 0.78 billion. Overall, the first quarter EPS was TWD 1.85. And ROE was 21.9% in the first quarter.
Let's take a look at revenue by application. If you recall, the fourth quarter inventory correction was mostly serious in the communication-related applications. When customer demand came back in the first quarter, communication shows the strongest increase. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, communication increased 8%, computer increased 2% and the industrial-related revenue increased 2%, while consumer declined 14% during the first quarter.
By technology. 28-nanometer revenue continued to grow and account for 34% of our total wafer revenue in the first quarter. 40-nanometer has a nice rebound, now represents 21% of our total wafer revenue. The 2 advanced technologies, 28-nanometer, plus 45-nanometer, represented 55% of our first quarter total wafer revenue, increased from 51% a quarter ago.
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased TWD 10 billion sequentially to TWD 235 billion at the end of first quarter. Current liabilities decreased by TWD 15 billion mainly because of the decrease in accounts payable to equipment suppliers. Meanwhile, we borrowed TWD 9 billion in short-term loans for hedging purpose. Accounts receivable turnover days decreased 3 days toward 45 days. Days of inventory increased to 52 days, reflecting the strong demand in the second quarter and the starting of the 20-nanometer ramp.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated TWD 95 billion cash from operations, invested TWD 115 billion in capital expenditure and borrowed TWD 9 billion short-term loans. At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance decreased TWD 11 billion to TWD 232 billion.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was an outflow of TWD 20 billion due to higher capital expenditure in the first quarter.
On CapEx and capacity. First quarter CapEx was USD 3.8 billion. We expect 2014 CapEx will be about USD 10 billion, which -- with front-end loaded pattern. About 70% of the budget will be spent in the first half to support the quick ramping of 20-nanometer. On a full year basis, we plan to increase our capacity by 10% from 2013, so the total annual capacity will reach 8 million 12-inch equivalent wafers.
So I have finished my reports on the financial part. Now let me turn into the second quarter outlook. Based on our current business outlook and a forecast exchange rate of TWD 30.10, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between TWD 180 billion and TWD 183 billion. This would translate into around 22% quarter-over-quarter increase. On the margin side, we expect second quarter gross margin to be between 47.5% and 49.5% and operating margin to be between 36.5% and 38.5%.
At the January investor conference, I talked about that tax rate for the year will be about 13% and the second quarter will carry more burdened. Let me give you an update this time. According to the accounting principle, when shareholder approves the earnings distribution in June, we need to accrue the 10% retained earning tax for the undistributed earnings. Therefore, our second quarter tax rate will go up to 21% and will then go back to the normal level of around 11% in the third and fourth quarter. Full year tax rate, however, will still be 13%.
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our co-CEO Mark and C.C. for their comments.",823

Let me cover the first 3 items on the agenda.
Let me begin by saying our 2014's market outlook has improved since our mid-January investor conference. The first quarter is typically a slow season for our customers and for TSMC. However, since mid-January, we started to see strong orders across all segments. We now have an improved demand outlook from the following 3 perspectives: First, the demand in smartphone appears healthier than we expected last quarter. The acceleration of LTE infrastructure build up. LTE smartphone proliferation and the increased silicon content of smartphone improved our demand outlook. The silicon content increases come with multicore 64-bit application processor, multimode baseband, multiband RF transceiver, image sensors, MEMs, Near Field Communications and fingerprint. These are all included in the smartphone.
The second, TSMC's 28-nanometer technology's performance and quality, suffice to fill more of those customer's demand. Fabless DOI was substantially below seasonal when we exit 4Q last year, so we still expect fabless DOI will be below seasonal in 1Q '14. So for second quarter '14, we expect our demand will continue to be strong and above seasonal in all major applications.
Now I'll cover the market and supply chain and demand of second half and full year for 2014. Since first quarter fabless DOI is below seasonal, the second quarter demand on us is unseasonably strong, but we expect fabless DOI will return to seasonal level at mid-2014. Therefore, our second half demand would be more normal.
TSMC will gain 28-nanometer market share, with 28-nanometer high-K metal gate transition in the second half of 2014. TSMC also expect to gain overall foundry market share in second half 2014 when we ramp up 20-SoC in the second half 2014. However, since our first quarter and second quarter will establish a higher base, the quarter-to-quarter growth of second -- third quarter and fourth quarter will be -- both be positive but will be more moderate than our second quarter.
For the full year of 2014, our outlook improves from last quarter as follows: semiconductor revenue growth from 5% to 7%, fabless revenue growth from 8% to 9%, foundry revenue growth from 10% to 14%. For our growth for full year of 2014, it will be higher than the forecasted foundry growth by several percentage points.
Then I cover the updates on 16 FinFET, 16-FinFET plus and our 10 FinFET. First, we have 2 general offers for customers, 16-FinFET and 16-FinFET plus. 16-FinFET plus offers 15% speed improvement, the same total power compared to 16-FinFET. More importantly, 16-FinFET plus offers 30% total power reduction at the same speed compared to 16-FinFET. Our 16-FinFET plus matches the highest performance among all available 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer technologies in the market today. Compared to our own 20-SoC, 16-FinFET plus offers 40% speed improvement. The design rules of 16-FinFET and 16-FinFET plus are the same. IPs are compatible. We will receive our first customer product tapeouts this month, about 15 products planned for 2014, another about 45 in 2015. Volume production is planned in 2015.
Since 95% of tools of 16 and 20 are common, we will ramp them in the same GIGAFABs in TSMC. 16-FinFET yield learning curve is very steep today and has already caught up with 20-SoC. This is a unique advantage in TSMC's 16-nanometer.
For 10 FinFET. 10 FinFET offer TSMC's third-generation FinFET transistor designed to meet the power and the performance requirement of mobile computing devices. 10 FinFET will offer greater than 25% speed improvement with the same total power compared to 16-FinFET plus. More importantly, 10 FinFET offer greater than 45% total power reduction at the same speed compared to 16-FinFET plus. 10 FinFET will offer 2.2x of density improvement over its previous-generation 16-FinFET plus. So currently, 10 FinFET development progress is well on track. Its risk production will be in 4Q 2015.
Above are the key messages on the 3 items. Thank you.",656

Wei,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
My remarks are exciting forecast on our second quarter and the second half of year 2014. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you -- the 2 topics with you: again the 20-SoC ramp and TSMC's advanced assembly solution to our customer.
First, our preview on the status of 20-SoC ramp. Let me recap what we have said in last meeting here. We started 20-SoC production in January this year. And by fourth quarter of this year, the 20-SoC will account for 20% of the quarterly revenue -- wafer revenue. And for the full year of 2014, we expect 20-SoC will be about 10% of our total wafer revenue of the year of 2014, of course. All these expectations remain the same today.
Now we have some major achievement I would like to share with you. First, on the ramping speed. 20-SoC, by far, is the fastest ramping in TSMC history. Of course, this fast ramp is to meet customer's strong demand. And I believe this production of 20-SoC in TSMC represents one of the largest mobilization in semiconductor history. Let me share with some numbers so you can have a snapshot of this ramp.
In about 1 years’ time, we have built a manufacturing team of 4,600 engineer and 2,000 operators in 2 fabs, Fab 14 in Tainan and Fab 12 in Hsinchu. More impressively, in the same time period, close to 1,000 engineer has been relocated among TSMC's fabs in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan. All these are prepared for the 20-SoCs ramp-up. This led to the mobilization, I believe. It's not an easy job. We move people around that show our strengths in manufacturing, and this highly mobilization is not moving the tool or just a handful of ramp. We are talking about we are moving that engineer and operator among TSMC fabs. In the meanwhile, we have installed more than 1,500 major tools for this 20-SoC ramp. Of course, the faster ramp is done with a very good device reliability and a very good wafer defect density. Without those, the fast ramp will have been -- will have made no sense.
Now how important are these 20-SoCs ramp? Well, we knew that 20-nanometer provided the engine of TSMC's profitable growth in the years of 2012 and 2013. And similarly, we expect 20-SoC will provide the engine of TSMC's profitable growth in year 2014 and 2015.
Now let me switch gear to advanced assembly technologies. The purpose of -- for us to develop the advanced assembly technology is to provide our customer as a better performance and a lower power consumption while at a lower cost, as compared to the previous assembly solution. For example, we have developed CoWoS. And CoWoS has been developed to connect 2 dies or more dies together to have very high-performance and very low-power consumptions. And today, CoWoS is in a small volume production already. However, the cost structure of CoWoS has made CoWoS only suitable for some very high-performance application and products. To address the cost structure issue and for those mobile -- very large-volume mobile devices, we have developed a derivative technology called InFO. That stands for integrated frameout. InFO will have significant lower cost as compared to CoWoS, and at the same time, InFO also can have the same capability to connect multiple dies together, just as the CoWoS did. Currently, we are working with major customers on the InFO to incorporate this structure into their future product. We have delivered many functional dies to our customers already, and the process optimization are ongoing. In fact, we are very excited about TSMC's advanced assembly technology development, as we are building an innovative solution for our customers' product which required high-performance, low-power consumption and at a very reasonable cost structure.
Now let me sum up of today's key measures which was presented by Mark and myself. First, we have revised our 2014's forecast for the semiconductor inventory -- for semiconductor industry and for foundry segment, as our outlook has become very positive. More importantly, TSMC will be able to strongly outperform our foundry peers, and we will continue to increase our market segment share as we have done in the past 4 years. The demand from 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer will provide the foundation for our profitable growth and the stronger outperform of this year. 20-SoCs ramp is a new record. That is one of the largest mobilization in the semiconductor industry.
Our 16-FinFET and especially 16-FinFET plus are highly competitive. And we have a very similar, good defect density performance already, which of course, just like Mark said, is 95% similar to 20-SoC, which we already have a very good defect density performance. Our 10-nanometer technology development are on track. And we are working on cost-effective advanced assembly solution InFO for our large-volume mobile devices. And we believe all these activities will pave the way for our continued profitable growth for the next few years.
This ends our prepared remarks, and thank you very much.",845

I probably cannot give you as detailed numbers as you wish, but let me give you some numbers from my perspective, from my granularities.

But for -- this increase significantly stands out, it's in the high-end smartphone. High-end smartphone, last year, we are about $10.8 per unit in average. This year, we expect to be $13.9. So that's a major increase. For the mid-end and the low-end, we see similar. Last year was about $6, and this year, it will also be $6. And low end is $3.6, and this year will be $3.6 also. However, we do see the low-end performance spec continue increasing -- mid-end and low-end smartphone spec continue increasing. And we see the -- a lot of features, regardless the mid-end and low-end, and is still increasing almost like the high-end of last year. So these are the perspective we can see now, okay? Secondly, about the ASML's message, I really don't know what he means, but let me give you some comments on that. If you talk about the FinFET technology difficulties, I must tell you that our 16-FinFET technology development is well on track and our new improvement is well on track. And we are working with customer closely and we expect to ramp up 2015. But I think one unique feature of our 16-FinFET is our 16-FinFET has the same design rule -- packing design, rule, like the 20, so that we can leverage all the yield learning, all of the massive work C.C. has talked about, in this year into next year's 16-FinFET. Secondly, if you observe the industry, mobile device industry, we do see -- in the past 6 months, we do see the 32-bit conversion to 64-bit in the processing after the Apple's announcement. And that's changed. That transition include indeed bringing a lot of attention of the product development back to 28- and 20-nanometer product design. And that indeed, we see increased demand on the 28 and 20 this year as well as next year. So that's a second message. And the last message I would like to comment with that is, if you combine in 20 and 16, our Chairman has mentioned to you, that combined 20 and 16 total revenue in the first 8 quarters, or first 2 years, will be even bigger than the 28-nanometer revenue in total. So with that, I give you this about. Thank you.",454

But remember, we and our customer worked on 16-FinFET design 1.5 years before, so what the other customer already designed, the design is on 16-FinFET, okay? So the customer, for those customers, when the product tapeout, for example, we have a first product tapeout this month, it will ride on 16-FinFET processes. And for those customers taped out in the second half, mostly -- I will say, mostly will be -- ride on the 16-FinFET plus. Now that's -- so I would think the majority of our process customer will run on 16-FinFET plus. And looking into the volume coming for the next year, I will say that most of the product will be running on 16-FinFET plus, okay? Thank you.",132

As I just gave you the guidance, on second quarter, we will grow 22%. We believe second half would be normal means less than 22%. I cannot give you a specific number, I'm sorry. We also talk about the margin. I think, last quarter, a lot of analysts are asking how can we maintain an even better structure profitability given a 35% year-over-year depreciation increase. Let me elaborate, and I will talk about the 28-nanometer impact, okay? The reason we can improve structural gross profitability are the following. Number one, you see the 35% increase in depreciations, that's on dollar to dollar, but we are also increased 10% capacity. So if you divide that by unit basis, actual depreciation on a whole basis go up by 22%. That's number one. Number two, depreciation accounts for about half of our manufacturing cost. We have another half. That's basically the variable cost, indirect material and other fixed cost. We work extremely hard to drive those costs down, yes. So with very good progress, okay? With that, along with the better blended ASP, thanks to the technology migrations, and our higher-yield and better performance, we are able to raise the overall corporate SGM level, okay? Now with the ramping of the 20-nanometer, which just started in the second quarter, we will have very, very small volume shipment, but we'll have much more volume in the third and the fourth quarter of any new nodes, starting with a low margin. So we expect there will be some dilutions to corporate-level margins starting from second quarter. The magnitude of that impact, about 1% in second quarter. They will be slightly bigger than 1%. It will be a very low single-digit impact on our second half, but for the whole year we still expect to see a slightly higher SGM compared to last year.",319

Let me answer this question. The 28-nanometer SoC is not a transition node, okay? We have worked with our customer already, come out with very powerful products and in the ramping up. So -- and these customer, some of them indeed will quickly transition to 16-FinFET Plus. However, still some other products will stay on 20-SoC for quite a long time, for quite a long time. Not every product requires the highest speed, for example. But the key is we manage this transition by 2 commonality between 20 and 16 are 95%. So when the customer moves from 20-SoC to 16-FinFET, we only need to increase much smaller -- very marginal amount of the capital to suffice that demand. Of course, the ASP and the product will be more competitive for our customer. So that's how we -- so we consider 20-SoC, CapEx wise, almost very similar. So we always put it together as 1 node. But it does provide our customer their product grade or product spec be continually improved year after year.",175

I think, as you know, typically, in the past few years, we see the end of the year, people can try to control inventories. And toward the end of the year, it's about back to the seasonal level. However, last year, we looked at our fabless DOI. And in the industry, they drastically control the inventory -- reduce inventory. Even at the end of Q3, we see them get to seasonal. And going to Q4, everybody finds that their inventory is below seasonal, what our data shows, below seasonal by 6 days, which is didn't happen before. Therefore, you see the -- the reason they did this because of their perspective for the outlook when they were in the third quarter last year, okay? Now for this quarter, we see the inventory, not even back to seasonal. It's still, from our data, is minus 5 days below seasonal. So they don't have time to replenish inventory, even the better outlook. So what's happened to refill the inventory will happen in the second quarter. Now whether this year will be as bad as last year, I think I'm typically more optimistic, because even down to the second quarter is only to the seasonal level, okay? So it might -- even we assume this doesn't overshoot, it shouldn't be very much below seasonal. So this is the difference we see this year, okay?",232

Obviously, I think your competitor will try to come after your clients next year very aggressively. So I wanted to just check, what is your view on design portability? And is it a realistic threat as sort of with the move from 20 to 16, we're using the same design rule, does that really mean that your competitors can actually try to get some of these customers?",88

So William's question is with respect to design portability in the sense that if 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer shares the same design rule, will we open the window for our competition to learn something about our 20-nanometer design rule, and then compete with us on 16-nanometer?",47

Wei,,Executives,110,"Let me answer the question. First, 20-SoC and 16-FinFET are totally different device structure. Even the back end design rule are similar, you cannot import from one to the other easily. No, it won't be easy. And what's your second question?",41

So I guess, when 20 to 16, it's difficult. But in terms of perhaps you having 16, your competitors are having 16-nanometer as well, obviously, I think there's been some talk in the market about them having some ability to port designs. Do you think that's a realistic threat, or is that really just a lot of wishful thinking?",60

Wei,,Executives,112,"Well, Mark already answered this kind of question, saying that from -- porting from one foundry to the other foundry are getting harder and harder. The real reason is all the device characteristics right now is related to the stress, strain, all those kind of things, which you cannot just copy. You cannot delay, or you cannot do the reverse engineering, to look at what is the device structure, and get the same kind of I-V characteristic. So it's quite very hard, it's actually very hard. That's how it is.",90

Let me answer the -- well, the porting, it happens. And we -- I just want to bring out 2 points. We just want to deal -- live with it, deal with it. Let me point out 2 points. One is the 14 is -- costs more and more nowadays for this generation. I think it takes a lot of R&D resources to do that. Secondly is, we just have to do a better 16 technology. There are reasons to do that, because first of all, we've ramped 20-SoC massively this year and a lot of learnings, a lot of process window control, a lot of design collaboration with our customer, we'll build ahead of our competitor. So we believe our 16-FinFET right on top of our 20-SoC, given their same design rule, will be more mature at the time compared with our competitor.",145

We've, again and again, this industry encounters some big node changes, and 28 was fraught with problems that TSMC didn't anticipate, and your customers did not anticipate when 28 was first rolled out. How should we think about 16? This is really unchartered territory, it is in a totally new device structure. Should we be a little more conservative on the possible unknowns coming in, and that this could easily be pushed out, say, a few quarters? How much are you really setting expectations here, very high that you can have 16 in the market, should we be thinking of this as a pretty uncertain node given how early it is?",124

We'll accept that and think. And I think we -- at this point, we develop our technology. We can only make sure our technology do not stand in the way. When customer has need or product needs, we'll be there, and mature to support their business with enough capacity, okay? As I mentioned earlier, industry market does change. For example, from 32-bit to 64-bit, that does sway some of the schedule of the 16-FinFET. But today, I really talked about our readiness, okay?

Setting the expectations low, that's good. I want to follow up on this InFO, this is quite interesting. Could you maybe elaborate a bit more on what exactly are you going to be attaching? So which devices are we talking about in terms of -- with CoWoS it was pretty much PLD companies were there and others, some baseband. But what devices are you attaching on the initial generation between the different chips? And second part of that question would be, what kind of -- how many customers do you expect to manage, to have in this area, because you start handling lots of devices and lots of customers, it gets a little complicated. You start to look more like an OSAT. So I'm wondering if this is going to be a pretty small group of high-volume products. And finally, on -- as you attach, are you actually doing the chip attach, or will you be doing only the wafer-level activity, and will you be having -- working with the OSATs to do the actual do the actual chip attach?",182

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start my presentation with financial highlights for the second quarter, followed by the guidance for the third quarter. 
Second quarter 2014 is a record quarter for TSMC, both in revenue and in net income. In this quarter, we saw strong demand for our wafers across all major segments. Our revenue increased 23.5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to reach TWD 183 billion. 
On the profitability side, gross margin was 49.8%, 2.3 percentage points higher than GAAP in the first quarter. And higher margin was mainly driven by higher capacity utilization, partially offset by inventory variation adjustments and a small margin dilutive effect from 20-nanometer ramp. 
Operating margin was 38.6%, up 3.2% percentage points from the first quarter, reflecting an improved operating efficiency for the company. 
During the second quarter, we recorded a TWD $2 billion disposal gain from the sale of Vanguard International Semiconductor company's share. 
We also saw a big jump in the corporate tax rate from 10.4 percentage in the first quarter to 19.8 percentage in the second quarter. The 9.4 percentage point increase was attributed to the accrual of retained earnings tax, which is incurred in the second quarter every year. We estimate our full-year tax rate for 2014 will be about 13%. Overall, the second quarter EPS was TWD 2.30, and ROE was 26.9%. 
Let's take a look at the revenue breakdown by application. Our revenue from all major segments increased sequentially in the second quarter. Compared to the first quarter, communication increased 19%, Computer increased 14%, Consumer increased 31% and Industrial-related revenue increased 25% during the second quarter. 
By [ph] technology, our 28-nanometer grew more than 30% from the previous quarter. It's contribution to our total wafer revenue increased from 34% in the first quarter to 37% in the second quarter.
Combining the 2 advanced technology nodes, 28-nanometer and 45-nanometer, we derived 56% of total revenue in the second quarter. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities reached TWD 315 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our cash increased TWD 23 billion during the quarter, while our marketable securities increased TWD 58 billion, as we reclassified certain long-term investments to short-term marketable securities. Current liabilities increased by TWD 72 billion, as we accrued TWD 78 billion for the cash dividend in the second quarter. Accounts receivable turnover days increased 5 days to 40 days. As our revenue increased at a much faster pace than average accounts receivable in the second quarter, days of inventory increased 1 day to 51 days.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated TWD 82 billion cash from operations, invested TWD 73 billion in capital expenditure and borrowed TWD 10 billion short-term loans for hedging purpose. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance increased TWD 23 billion to reach TWD 255 billion. Free cash flow for the second quarter was an inflow of TWD 8 billion.
In U.S. dollars, our second quarter CapEx was $2.4 billion. That means our CapEx totaled USD 6.2 billion for the first half of the year. Our full year CapEx budget remains in the range between USD 9.5 billion and USD 10 billion. 
Regarding our capacity, we now expect to increase our capacity by 11% from last year. This is a small increase from the 10% growth that we forecasted earlier, and it is mainly derived from our productivity improvement. Total annual capacity is expected to reach 8.1 million 12-inch equivalent wafers this year.
I have finished my report on the financial part. Now let me turn to the third quarter outlook. Based on our market outlook and the business exchange rate and forecast exchange rate of 29.81, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between TWD 206 billion and TWD 209 billion, representing between 12.6% and 14.2% sequential growth. Gross margin is expected to be between 48.5% and 50.5%, and operating margin is expected to be between 38.5% and 40.5%. 
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman, Dr. Morris Chang.",694
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2014",2014-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5476.0,658659.0,29307891.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I want to make a few comments on the supply chain inventory situation and the second half demand, and then a few words on 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer progress and then a few words on 10-nanometer progress.
First, on supply chain inventory and second half demand. Our second quarter was record breaking in revenue, operating income and net income. We have noted in past investor conferences, that supply chain inventory dipped to a low point at the end of last year. The past 6 months have seen a rebuilding of inventory, which partially explains the strength of demand in that period. We estimate that the supply chain inventory has returned to seasonal level at midyear, from a very low point at the end of last year to a seasonal level at midyear. We further estimate that it will actually continue to build through the third quarter, and DOI will be 2 days above seasonal at the end of third quarter. But then, we estimate that DOI will decrease and will be at 2 days below seasonal at the end of the year. So last 6 months have seen a rebuilding of inventory, and at midyear, it's about seasonal level. It will continue to build some, modestly, to 2 days above seasonal at the end of third quarter and then, it will dip to 2 days below seasonal at the end of fourth quarter.
So one might characterize the next 6 months as a period of cautious inventory management by the supply chain. However, the widespread adoption of 4G LTE tends to increase the demand of our 28 and 20 technologies. Overall, we are guiding third quarter to be another record-breaking quarter as Lora just did. It will be another record-breaking quarter in revenue, operating income and net income. Also, at this point, because of our strength in 20-SoC and our strength in 28, 4Q appears to be a sequential growth quarter also.
Now a few words on 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer progress. In the last 2.5 to 3 years, 28-nanometer technology has driven our growth. In the next 3 years, 20- and 16-nanometer technologies are going to drive our growth. 28, in the last 2.5 to 3; 20 and 16, in the next 3.
After 2 years of meticulous preparation, we began volume shipments of our 20-nanometer wafers in June. The steepness of our 20-nanometer ramp sets a record. We expect 20-nanometer to generate about 10% of our wafer revenue in third quarter, and more than 20% of our wafer revenue in fourth quarter. And we expect the demand for 20-nanometer will remain strong and will continue to contribute more than 20% of our wafer revenue in 2015. We will reach 100% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter of this year, and it will be above 20% of our total wafer revenue next year. 
The 16-nanometer development leverages up 20-SoC learning and is moving forward smoothly. Our 16-nanometer is more than competitive, combining performance, density and yield considerations. 16-nanometer applications cover a wide range including baseband, application processors, consumer SoCs, GPU, network processors, hard disk drive, FPGA, servers and CPUs. 
Volume production of 16-nanometer is expected to begin in late 2015, and there will be fast [ph] ramp-up in 2016. The ecosystem for 16-nanometer designs is current and ready. 
A few years ago, in order to take advantage of special market opportunities, we chose to develop 20-SoC first and then quickly follow with 16-nanometer. We chose this sequence to maximize our market share in the 20-, 16-nanometer generation.
As the 20, 16 foundry competition unfolds, we believe our decision to have been correct. Number one, in 20-SoC, we believe we will enjoy overwhelmingly large share in 2014, 2015 and onwards. Number two, in 16-nanometer, TSMC will have a smaller market share than a major competitor in 2015, but we'll regain leading share in 2016, 2017 and onwards. Number three, if you look at the combined 20 and 16 technologies, TSMC will have an overwhelming leading share every year from 2014 on. Number four, in total foundry market share, after having jumped 4 percentage points in 2013, TSMC will again gain several percentage points in 2014. This is for total foundry market share covering all technologies. After having increased 4 percentage points last year, TSMC will gain another several percentage points this year.
Now a few words about 10-nanometer. The 10-nanometer development is progressing well. The 10-nanometer speed is 25% faster than the 16-nanometer. The power consumption is 45% less than 16-nanometer. And the gate density is 2.2x that of the 16-nanometer. Power is 25% faster -- did I say speed -- power? I meant speed. Speed is 25% faster; power is 45% less; gate density, 2.2x more, all compared with 16-nanometer. 
We work closely with our key customers to co-optimize our 10-nanometer process and design. We expect to have customer tapeouts in the second half of 2015. 
Those are all my prepared comments. We -- I believe we are ready for Q&A.",838

Randy's question is with respect to Chairman's comment on 2015's market share at 16-nanometer, where we said that we will be lower than a major competitor in '15.

Well, we need to go back to history a little bit. 32 -- 28-nanometer followed 32. And that particular major competitor that I referred to chose 32 and skipped 28. And then, of course, we came to 20 and 16. 16 for us, 14 for him. And we chose to do both. Actually, we chose to do 20 first and 16 about a year or so later. But it was a pretty quick succession. And this major competitor skipped 20 and went on to 16. So you asked why is our market share on 16 lower than this major competitor in 2015. Well, the answer is we got started a little late because we chose to do 20 also, and 20 turned out to be a very, very important node, as I already spoke to just a few minutes ago. So we have both 20 and 16. Now how can we be sure that we'll regain 16 share in 2016? Well, the answer is that the technologies these days, you just have to engage with the customers way in advance, like about 2 years in advance, before you get orders. You will get -- you talk with the -- you discuss with the customers, the customers follow your technical progress and then the customers give you tapeouts, and you have to qualify the tapeouts, et cetera, et cetera. The whole process is about 2 years in advance of actual delivery, volume delivery. Well, how can I be sure that we'll regain share in 2016? Well, this is middle of 2014, about 2 years ahead of 2016. I think I have a pretty good idea of how much order I'm going to get in 2016.",285

You're asking whether our R&D will build up even faster than revenue, is that right? I think that it's possible. In fact, that's really our first priority. I think we want to strengthen our technical side even more. But, it's not going to be [indiscernible]. Right now, actually, we modeled R&D at 8% of revenue -- 8% of revenue at the beginning of the year. Now, the revenue has turned out to be bigger than we thought it was going to be. So right now, R&D is only 7.3% of revenue. And in my mind, however, the model is still 8%, all right?",107

I believe Chairman comment in AGM that TSMC's 16-nanometer is ahead of competitor's 14-nanometer in 3 -- first is technology and productivity, and also trust of customers. I think, for the productivity and trust of customers, actually we have no doubt about that. So can Chairman quantify how big the lead it is for your 16-nanometer FinFET to competitors' 14-nanometer FinFET?",71

Really, if you combine the 3, speed, density and power, we feel that we are more than competitive. Now you ask me how big a lead we have, et cetera, et cetera. Well, I think, that would be a very difficult to -- a very difficult question to answer, because our competitors on the 16 are the 2 companies that I, in the past, refer to as the 2 big gorillas of the industry. And each has its strengths. So the 2 are not the same at all. And each has its strengths; each has its weaknesses. And a competitor may be technologically strong, but if he turns out to be a competitor of his potential customers, then that's a weakness. And if a competitor is already used to being both a competitor and a supplier, but he has got technology weaknesses, well, that's a problem too for him. Well, I don't think I can really answer your question in a very simple way. I can only answer it by just repeating what I said earlier, combining performance, density and speed -- speed, density and power, we believe we are more than competitive. And in terms of the ability to get business, we believe we are more than competitive.",226

The revenue guidance now is up 12% to 14%. But I think the 20-nanometer itself probably be contributing more than 10%. So that means, on 20-nanometer revenue growth in 3Q, probably will be below seasonality. So is this any reason behind this? Or is it really just because of the capacity constraint for the 20-nanometer revenue?",68

Since our guidance of the third quarter sequential growth rate is 12.6% to 14.2%, but then our 20-nanometer growth rate is going to be a lot faster, which means the non-20-nanometer geometry's growth rate will be slower. And so, what was the reason behind the slower growth rate in other nodes? Is it because of capacity constraint or some other reason?",71

The line dropped there. Your 20-nanometer ramp is very impressive, very steep. But I guess if I think about your revenues excluding 20-nanometer going to 10% of revenues and more than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter, it kind of suggests rather anemic growth for the industry in the third quarter and a pretty sizable down in the fourth quarter. So is that what you think the industry is doing? Or do you think that maybe 28-nanometer competition and pricing pressures are starting to have an impact there? It just seems odd when I think about your revenues excluding 20-nanometer, because that really is driving so much of your growth in the second half of the year.",124

Well, I haven't said anything about fourth quarter, total fourth quarter yet. But I'm just mentally calculating what it looks like if we take out 20 in the fourth quarter. And the answer of my mental calculation is that we will still have a little growth, yes. I don't know how little is little. It may not be too little, you know. So yes, we'll still have growth, but I think just as Lora has said now, we are -- and I also said in my opening remarks, that the inventory will be cautiously managed. It almost always is towards the end of the year. Last year, in fact, it went overboard, the precaution went overboard, and as a result, we had a pretty bad fourth quarter, and a lot of people had a pretty bad fourth quarter only to recover it in the first half of this year. And, we are projecting, as I said earlier, that inventory will be very cautiously managed. And of course, we will tell you again, 3 months from now what it looks like at that point. But just based on the numbers that we have already given out, I would say that, yes, even if you take out 20, we will still have growth. We will certainly have growth in the third, and we'll still have growth in the fourth. And, that's already -- that is already taking into account the cautious inventory management that will happen in the second half of this year.",262

Maybe we just one quick question for Lora. I noticed in the management report, you no longer were breaking out depreciation within cost of goods sold, and I think you've guided for total depreciation to grow, I think it was 30% to 35% this year.

We have a chart in a later page, the last page of management report that shows the depreciation, including the [indiscernible]. But what I can tell you, the overall depreciation for the first quarter this year is TWD 41.6 billion, and the second quarter will be TWD 45.9 billion, will go up very steeply in the third and fourth quarter.

If the cost is low enough, the demand will increase, because we can see a lot of applications that are just waiting there. Of course, I'm talking about the mobile product, but I'm also talking about Internet of Things, wearables and so on, so on, Internet of Things. The applications are just waiting there for better or faster speed, and lower power and higher density IPs. Cost is definitely in the equation. So yes, so when you asked will the demand be there. If we can get the cost down to an acceptable level, demand will be there. And of course, that's why -- that's how things like EUV come into fashion. Nobody has asked about that yet. We actually were prepared to answer that. It was the same answer that we gave you last time, by the way, that we are still trending to -- it's still a possibility to use EUV on 1 -- no, 2 -- no, just 1 layer with 10-nanometer. Yes, 1 layer, 1 layer in 10-nanometer. And 7, I think, is, of course, an even better candidate.",199

That's what happened when I said that, that program wasn't necessary for too long. We didn't have the capacity anymore after, I guess, since what, March maybe? Since March, yes. So that program was in place, inventory building program. Inventory building meant anticipating orders, not having orders and building inventory. That's what it means. But -- and that was the case, I guess, in the fourth quarter last year and between January and February. And then from March on, we began to be flooded by orders. So there was no capacity to build inventory with. All the capacity had to be devoted to building orders, to build into orders.",128

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start my presentation with financial highlights for the third quarter and followed by the guidance for the fourth quarter.
We had a good quarter. The third quarter, we have set a new record of revenue and profitability, thanks to strong demand in our successful ramp of 20-nanometer. Our revenue increased 14% sequentially and the 29% on year-over-year basis to reach TWD 209 billion. Our gross margin exceeded 50% to reach 50.5%, which is also a record since the second half 2006. Compared with second quarter, gross margin improved 0.7 percentage point. The higher margin was contributed by consistent cost improvement, favorable inventory valuation adjustment, partially offset by 20-nanometer dilution as we are still in the early stage of the production.
Operating margin was 40.4%, up 1.8 percentage point from the second quarter, reflecting an improving operating efficiency for the company. After a big jump in tax rate in the second quarter due to accrual of 10% return earning tax, in the third quarter, the effective tax rate fell back to normal level of about 11% of profit before tax versus the 20% in the second quarter. Overall, the third quarter EPS increased 47% sequentially to TWD 2.94. The single quarter ROE was 33.3%.
Let's take a look at revenue by application. Compared to the second quarter, communication showed strongest growth. Revenue increased by 26%. Industrial-related revenue also increased 9%, while computer and consumer declined 6% and 3% during the third quarter.
By technology, after 2 years of meticulous preparation, we began volume shipments of 20-nanometer wafers. The revenue contribution went up from 0% to 9% of the third quarter wafer revenue. This is the fastest and the most successful ramp for a new technology in TSMC history. In addition, customer demand for 28-nanometer wafers continue to be strong. Our 28-nanometer wafer revenue continue to grow sequentially in the third quarter, representing 34% of total wafer revenue. Accordingly, the 2 advanced technologies, 20-nanometer plus 28-nanometer, represented 43% of our third quarter total wafer revenue, increased from 37% a quarter ago.
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 290 billion. Current liability decreased by TWD 74 billion, mainly due to we paid out the TWD 78 billion of cash dividend in August.
On the financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days is 44 days, which is the normal level of our average days of receivable. Days of inventory increased 5 days to 56 days, mainly due to higher working process inventories associate with the fast ramp and the longer cycle time for 20-nanometer.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated TWD 91 billion cash from operations, invested TWD 48 billion in capital expenditure and have paid out TWD 78 billion in cash dividend. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance decreased TWD 29 billion to TWD 255 billion (sic) [ TWD 226 billion].
Free cash flow for the third quarter was an inflow of TWD 43 billion, a big improvement versus previous quarters. In U.S. dollar, our second quarter CapEx was USD 1.6 billion. This adds to the total of USD 7.8 billion for the first 3 quarters.
Regarding our capacity, we expect to increase our capacity by 12% from last year. Total annual capacity will reach 8.2 million, 12-inch equivalent wafers this year, slightly higher than our previous estimate of 8.1 million.
I have finished my report on the financial part. Now let me turn into the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current business outlook and the forecast exchange rate of 30.30, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between TWD 217 billion and TWD 220 billion. This will translate into around 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter increase.
On the margin side, we expect fourth quarter gross margins to be between 48% and 50%, and operating margins to be between 38% and 40%. You may ask why we guide slightly lower margin rate despite 4% to 5% revenue growth. This is because we will continue ramp our 20-nanometer to more than 20% of our wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. We expect to see a mild margin dilutions with our aggressive productivity improvement efforts.
This concludes my remarks. Thank you very much.",732

Let me start with CapEx. In January of this year, we guided TSMC's 2014 CapEx budget to be between USD 9.5 billion to USD 10 billion. Today, we are able to provide more specific number, which is about USD 9.6 billion.
Majority of this year's CapEx budget is spend for 20-nanometer expansion. In 2015, we will continue our investment in 16-nanometer capacity installation and 10-nanometer engineering capacity. Based on our current plan for 2015, our CapEx budget for the next year is likely to be slightly higher than USD 10 billion.
On free cash flow outlook, you may recall in the past 4 years, TSMC has increased CapEx substantially to capture the growth opportunity brought by the mobile computing devices. As a result, our free cash flow dropped to about USD 1 billion to USD 2 billion per year, which were below the cash dividend we paid. The cash dividend, $3 cash dividend is about USD 2.6 billion a year. However, with the substantial increase in operating cash flow this year and a similar level of capital expenditure compared to last year, we expect to more than double our free cash flow in 2015. And we are confident that the free cash flow level will rise further in the foreseeable future.
The sustainably higher free cash flow should enable TSMC to afford paying a higher level of dividend per share going forward. The Board of Directors will consider increase in cash dividend in February of next year.
Now regarding the supply chain inventory, we have noted in our last quarterly conference that we estimate fabless DOI would increase and be 2 days above seasonal at the end of third quarter. And then fabless DOI would decrease and be 2 days below seasonal level at the end of this year. Our data and model for the forecast still warrants the same estimate today.
You can see from this chart, we estimate 4Q '14 fabless DOI will be 2 days below seasonal. But compared with 4Q '13 last year, which is 1 year ago, the fabless DOI was 6 days below seasonal. Based on our model, we anticipate a much milder inventory correction in fourth quarter this year.
With that, I will turn the podium to Mark, who will share with you our view on the near-term demand.",402
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2014",2014-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5120.0,704505.0,31105239.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,4,"Good afternoon. I will continue cover the near-term demand. The strong demand of our 20-SoC customers enable our continued growth in the fourth quarter overcoming our seasonal demand pattern of a sequentially weaker fourth quarter.  And the cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of our customers rendering the slower 4Q demand. 
This fourth quarter demand from our customer does not validate the recent forecast by Microchip. Our recent demand in China still appears normal, little deviation from their seasonal pattern. And we see China's 4G smartphone sales and infrastructure buildup remains to be very aggressive. So we are expecting another record-breaking quarter with a 4% to 5% growth in the fourth quarter.
On 10-nanometer development. Our 10-nanometer development is progressing according to plan. Currently, we are working on early customer collaboration for product tapeouts in 4Q of 2015. The risk production date remain targeted at the end of 2015. Our goal is to enable our customer's production in 2016. To meet this goal, we are getting our 10-nanometer design ecosystem ready now. We have completed certification of over 35 EDA tools using ARM CPU core as vehicle. In addition, we have started the IP validation process 6 months earlier than previous nodes with our IP partners. We are working with over 10 customers on their 10-nanometer product design. The product plans show wide range of applications, including application processors, baseband, CPU, server, graphics, network processor, FPGA and game console. Our 10-nanometer will achieve industry-leading speed, power and gate density.
Then I will cover the -- say a few words or clarify next growth momentum of TSMC. We think the growth of smartphone and tablet in propelling our revenue growth will continue for at least several years. In addition, the recent innovations in wearable devices, including smart watch, in cloud computing, in fog computing, in Internet of Things, including smart car, smart homes, all are very exciting. And we are currently closely working with our customers on all these applications to set the stage of the next growth wave to move us forward.
That's my comment. Now I turn the microphone to C. C.",354

Wei,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This afternoon, I will update you the 20-nanometer ramp-up status, followed by 16-nanometer's progress and 28-nanometer status.  
First, the 20-nanometer ramp status. We shipped 20-nanometer in high-volume during third quarter. The yield is meeting our target. Revenue generated from 20-nanometer accounted for 9% of third quarter wafer revenue. And because of the strong demand from the high-end 4G smartphone, which are equipped with 64-bit cores, [indiscernible] and more advanced graphic and video performance. Our 20-nanometer will continue to grow and we expect it to contribute greater than 20% wafer revenue in first quarter. We expect the strength of our 20-nanometer business to continue in year 2015. And we expect that revenue will account for roughly 20% of next year in wafer revenue.
Next, I'll talk about a 16-nanometer ramp and competitive status. In 16-nanometer, we have 2 versions, 16-FinFET and the 16-FinFET plus. FinFET plus has better performance and has been adopted by most of our customers. 16-FinFET, we began the risk production in November last year and since then, have passed all the reliability core early this year. For the FinFET plus, we also passed the first stage of qualification on October 7; and since then, entered the risk production.  The 4 qualifications, including the technology in product core is expected to be completed next month. 
So right now, we have more than 1,000 engineers working on ramp-up for the FinFET plus. Under your [ph] earnings side, the progress is much better than our original plan. This is because the 16-nanometer uses similar process to 20-SoC, except for the transistors. And since 20-SoC has been in mass production with a good yield, our 16-FinFET [indiscernible] from 20-SoC and enjoy a good and smooth progress. So we are happy to say that. 16-nanometer has achieved the best technology maturity at the same corresponding stage as compared to all TSMC's previous node.
In addition to the processing technology, our 16-FinFET design ecosystem is ready also. It supports 43 EDA tours and greater than 700 process design kits, with more than 100 IPs, all these are silicon validated. We believe this is the biggest ecosystem in the industry today.
On performance side compared with the 20-SoC, 16-FinFET is greater than 40% speed faster than the 20-SoC at the same total power or consume less than 50% power at the same speed. So our data show that in high-speed application, it can run up to 2.3 gigahertz; or on the other hand, for low-power application, it consumes as low as 75 milliwatts per core. This kind of performance will give us -- give our customer a lot of flexibility to optimize their design for different market applications. So far, we expect to have close to 60 tapeouts by the end of next year.
In summary, because of the excellent progress in yield lending and readiness in manufacturing maturity and also to meet customers' demand, we plan to pull in 16-nanometer volume production to the end of Q2 next year or early Q3 year 2015.
The year performance and smooth progress of our 16-FinFET plus further validate our strategy of starting 20-SoC first, quickly followed with the 16-FinFET and FinFET plus. We choose this sequence to maximize our market share in the 20-, 16-nanometer generation. 
And I would like to repeat our Chairman stated last time in combined 20- and the 16-nanometer, TSMC will have an overwhelming leading share every year from year 2014.
In total foundry market share, TSMC will leap several percentage points in 2014. He also said that he's happy to add, that this trend increasing the market share will continue in year 2015.
Next, I will talk about the 28-nanometer status. We have a strong growth in second quarter in 28-nanometer. And you are -- the business grow another quarter and account for 34% of TSMC's wafer revenue in third quarter. [Indiscernible] we continue our effort to improve yield and tighten the process corners, so that our customer can take advantage of these activity and shrink thereby size and therefore, reduce the cost.
Let me give you an example. On 28LP, the polysilicon gate version will now offer a variety of enhanced process to achieve better performance. We'll also offer a very competitive cost so that our customer can address the mid to low-end smartphone market. In addition to the 28LP, we also provided a cost-effective high-K metal gate version, the 28HPC, for customer to further optimize the performance and the cost.
Recently, we add another 28-nanometer offering, we called 28 ultra low power. For ultra low-power application, obviously, we believe this 28ULP will help TSMC customers to expand their business into the IoT area. In summary, we expect our technology spend in 28-nanometer node, will enhance TSMC's competitiveness and ensure a good market share. We also expect the strength of the demand for our 28-nanometer will continue for multi-years to come. In response, we are preparing sufficient capacity to meet our customers' future demand.
Thank you for your attention.",837

I think it's been progressing quite a while, and as Lora said, it's going to be around 20% by the end of Q4.

So second question is more of bigger [ph] picture about your China competition. I think recently, we had observed quite a lot of move inside China, including privatization of EDA [ph] or spectrum. And OmniVision could be another target to shoot for. Also, your competitor, UMC, last week announced they're going to set up a 12-inch joint venture with the local government. So I think my feeling is these guys seem to be aiming for the next growth potential market, which is IoT. And by taking the leverage of the huge demand market in China, #1, and also, the very favorable Chinese government policy in favor of local production. So my feeling is -- will you worry about this kind of potential competition in the longer term, because you only operate in aged [ph] fab in China? Or do you have any strategy to cope with this potential threat from China in the next couple of years?",158
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2014",2014-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5120.0,704505.0,31105257.0,Answer,Mark Liu,,Executives,22,"Okay. This is a complicated question. Let me put this question to 2 parts. One is the China government's subsidy effects. Secondly, is the IoT opportunities. On China government's subsidy, the recent announcement about RMB 1,200 billion subsidy does cost a lot of activities across the industry for us. We think -- currently, we have a very strong penetration on our Chinese -- China design houses. Many of them, over 80%. And they are -- most of them are claiming [ph] towards leading edge. And with these subsidies, they will be more aggressive. And we think that is -- we will be ready to capture the business given the existing good penetration. And this subsidy may also bring into a merger position because China government wants to -- small company bringing into big, to be more competitive. And I do think that is the healthy development for the industry with the bigger stronger design houses to compete with. Of course, there will be downsides because on the back of this subsidy, maybe some of the company will -- under the influence of using local foundry and capacities, and that is a threat. I mean I put it this way. So -- but putting these positive and negative factors together, so long as we have technology leadership, so long as we have a strong manufacturing, so long as we have a good service, customer service, we think our business opportunity in China will grow -- will be bigger with this development. On the IoT, IoT, indeed, IoT has been anticipated by many companies and including us. For us, we have -- we are currently actively developing IoT-related technologies, okay? And including sensors, including processors, including wireless connectivity, advanced packagings and all the power management IC are included. All striving for ultra-low power. I mean the power -- or technology provide a lower powered designs. On the capacity, yes, we are increasing our mature technology capacities today. And we will continue to expand the mature technology capacity, deviating from our past strategy increasing those capacity to capture the potential growth of demand. In terms of further new fab, we are -- we don't exclude any possibility, including the fab in China.",369

So as you're expanding your capacity in mature technologies for the IoT and MEMS and NFC and the whole range of things and you're expanding your advanced technology, TSMC has held a dominant position in 28-nanometer for almost 4 years. And 28-nanometer accounts for 34% of revenue now. As your key customers are moving to 28 and 16 and competition is, obviously, heating up as well, I'm wondering what steps you guys are taking to keep your 28-nanometer fabs fully utilized? You talked about HPC as a cost-down version. Will this be a potential headwind to keep those fabs full in 2015? And if so, how you're able to address the competition as well?",119

This is the last node that you enter into the 2P2E, double etch, double pattern. And so its application is very -- being widely adopted. So we expect that the demand for the next few years -- or actually, for a long time, we will continue to increase. And a lot of the companies will take advantage of the cost effective and the performance also. So as we said, we are [indiscernible] from the application side.

And then the second question is with regard to 20-nanometer margins, I guess, for Lora. So it looks as 20 will be over 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter.

So it's increased price significantly, is #1. So the whole year 2015, 20% is a big number. How do we hold the profitability? I would say today's 2016 profitability is acceptable. I won't say it's great, but it is acceptable. And we continue to work on it as we have done for other nodes in the past. And the margin will gradually improve, so we have more volume coming on the line. So I'm still stand [ph] what I said, and we believe we can achieve corporate level margin in 8-quarter timeframe, 2016.",104

So will kind of additional customers coming into 28  because you previously said you felt this was going to be a major node.

The second question is a comment that I think Mark and Lora have both talked about, which is smartphone is going to drive growth for multiple more years. I think that's a little bit different from what is the consensus view, which is that you're going to get unit growth but a lot of it, going forward, is going to be more lower end. And Lora also said just now that, percentage-wise, smartphone is going to be about the same next year. So can you talk about why you think it's going to drive growth for a few more years? What do you see that gives you that confidence?",111

Lora, if I have read you right, you said increasing volume after you bring up a new technology, actually your key factor for bringing up the growth margin overall. And also, I look at, in the past, how you said it takes about 7 to 8 quarters to bring up new technology growth margin to corporate level. That actually is 7 to 8 quarters. Also, was around the time you bring up the total revenue to above 20%, probably 20%, 23%, 25%. So my question is on your -- for your 20-nanometer, is 4Q [indiscernible], the revenue now is above 20%. So is this 20% actually is a big threshold level for you to bring up the growth margin? Because I think with this 20% total revenue contribution, I think the volume there is big enough. Or there is another factor to have the a margin for 20-nanometer?",156

And you talk about the 20-nanometer as a separate node. When we look at 20 and 16, we feel it's the same node because 16 is continuations of 20-nanometer. And this year, a lot of the same equipment and the same process, almost. So if you combine these 2 nodes together and -- well, I cannot say is 20% a threshold or not. What we look in the company is we're looking to the -- how efficient can we run this node and what will be the scale and what's our engagement with the customers and how effectively we bring down the capital efficiencies -- bringing up the capital efficiency, so on and so forth. So we don't usually link that to the percentage of contribution to company revenue.",145

But for the volume-wise, actually, I think it is big enough now.

A little bit complicated to me. Okay, switch to second question. Second question is TSMC actually has delivered a very good job, I think, from 2010 to 2014. You have 2 strategic financial goals. One is for your PBT to grow more than 10% in CAGR. The other one is ROE to be above 20%. I think that from 2010 to 2014, I think, TSMC have been -- TSMC's [ph] performance is above your goal.

I'm just looking at the end market focus for TSMC. PC is not -- never been a big part of your business. But when I look at AP for next year, the transition to 64-bit and the introduction of FinFET, are we moving -- is the AP moving into a world where it can realistically address mainstream PCs? Now that we've got Windows 10 coming and we have Chromebook ramping up and Android is moving to 64-bit, how do you see this AP evolving into mainstream computing? And maybe just a follow-up to that, can you maybe just compare and contrast -- if you're an ARM fabless chipmaker building these APs for computing, how would you compare the cost and the performance using 64-bit ARM and your FinFET plus versus Intel's Broadwell? Do you think it would be cost competitive versus Intel's Broadwell? And do you think it will be performance competitive versus Intel's Broadwell?",165

Brett, let me repeat your question. You basically are asking us whether or not the migration of technologies and then with the arrival of ARM-based 64-bit core, the fabless today can design application processors that can go into the mainstream PC market and if they could, how would they compare with the existing incumbent players, such as Intel, in terms of cost and performance.

We are building our new facilities to ramp the 20- and 16-nanometer, which will be located in our Tainan site. So the number you're seeing in the balance sheet is associated with those building constructions, and some of them are equipment purchase. From what I can tell you, the depreciation change, this year, with $9.6 billion CapEx, the depreciation year-over-year change will be roughly 30%, which has actually been lower. I was telling somebody 35%, right, earlier. Now it's come out to about 30%.

Wei,,Executives,113,"We -- let me answer your question. First, your impression of we're slowly moving 16-FinFET equipment. I think Lora just mentioned that we are going to spend also a big CapEx next year. And from this year, next year, we invest on the 16-FinFET and 20-SoC also. And some of the tools, actually a high portion of the tools, are common for these 2 nodes. So no, it's not slowly moving, as you say. Yes, we did the ramp-up the 16-FinFET behind our competitor, yes, and that's why our Chairman says that we are going to have a smaller market share. But our situation improved as time goes by because of manufacturing maturity and good yield performance and also the customer pulling their demand. So we decided to pull in the ramp-up schedule, and we are in a very high stronghold [ph] to bring up the 16-FinFET. I said we have more than 1,000 engineers preparing for the ramp-up. So that gives you a hint that we are full speed actually preparing for that.",174

We believe you are going to be very aggressive at 16, the capacity -- the FinFET capacity for next year. And your comment I recognize very aggressive. Probably, will keep it aggressive.

And the opportunity is to have a follow-on process simplification using EUV, the masking layer simplification. But that's some way to go. It could not catch the -- our initial ramp of 10-nanometer. The current challenge still be the power of the source and the availability. And -- but still very encouraging that power of -- source power is continually increasing. And other factors, as mask defects, mask technology and the photoresist have a lot of improvements. So we are looking at the follow-on insertion point, after the 10-nanometer ramp, for the cost reduction or for the process simplification.",108

They realize that there is 1 argument from about the 14-nano FinFET. It's the way Intel to go and the Samsung go. So once they go to the 10-nano, if they go at a different way, probably we will see the 2 different ways in the 10-nanometer FinFET and then for the client to choose. That probably will bring a risk on either side. So I don't know this argument makes sense from your point of view. Does that make sense?",82

The next one is -- I remember last time, Lora mentioned the CapEx for sales for next year is going to be higher than this year.

I didn't say that. I probably said we'll be lower than last year. That's probably what I said, okay? Given the total CapEx, as I just indicated, will be slightly higher than $10 billion, but we have not decided how much it's going to be. We don't decide revenue for 2015, so it's probably too mature to comment on capital intensity for next year.",81

The last 3 years, you guys have clearly benefited, 28-nanometer dominance, smartphone industry going at kind of 40% compound annual growth rates. You guys have grown 20%, 25% per year, I think, in the last 3 years or so. And I got to do the calculation again for this year, maybe you're actually above that. When you think about the next 3 years, I think people are forecasting smartphone CAGRs maybe more in the under 15% type range. Do you think -- and you guys gained a lot of market share, I think, in the last couple of years as well. Are laws of large numbers catching up to you guys? Is -- without smartphone growth and that significant increase in silicon content per phone, do you think these growth rates that you've been enjoying, this 20%-plus, for multiple years are headed lower over the next few years? And then, to what magnitude?",165

I didn't forget it. So on the 20-nanometer, coming back to that. Fourth quarter contribution for this year as a percentage of sales, will this -- will 20 grow 1 year later, so fourth quarter next year? Will that -- what contribution to sales do you expect 20 per se to be, 20-nanometer next year? Because you've  obviously pulled in 16-nanometer, and so there's new dynamics there. I'm wondering if you're going to see any growth year-on-year from 4Q this year to 4Q next year. Will the dollar value grow year-on-year?",103
