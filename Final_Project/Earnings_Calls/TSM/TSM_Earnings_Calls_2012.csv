380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,3675.0,293354.0,14449362.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good morning and good evening to everyone. Thank you for joining us in the first quarter earnings conference call. Tonight I will start with the financial results for the first quarter and give you the outlook for the second quarter followed by some comments on the supply chain inventory.
The first quarter 2012 was the stronger than seasonal quarter for TSMC. Compared to a normal seasonal decline, our revenue increased 0.8% to TWD$105 billion. In the U.S. dollar terms, the increase was 2.7% over last quarter, which was a slightly better than our guidance. During our last earnings conference call, we had expected the beginning of inventory replenishment in certain applications to drive first quarter demand. On top of that, the better technology also contribute to the first quarter spend. 
On the margin side, first quarter gross margin was 47.7%, or 3 percentage points higher than that in the fourth quarter of 2011. This is also about 3 points higher than our guidance, as the first quarter utilization rate was a lot higher than we had expected, reflecting a stronger demand in the first quarter and second quarter. The first quarter gross margin also includes the negative impact from NT dollar’s appreciation and the temporary margin dilution effect from 28-nanometer which takes place during the initial ramping stage of every technology node.
Operating margin was 33.6%, up 2.2 percentage points. Operating expense increased about TWD$1 billion, mainly due to higher operating expense for Fab 15 in preparation for 28-nanometer ramp-up, as well as the increased R&D investments for 20-nanometer technology. Overall our first quarter EPS was TWD$1.29. ROE for the first quarter was 20.8%.
Let’s move on to revenue analysis. For applications, computer, consumer and industrial-related revenue benefit from the customers’ inventory replenishment and increased by 11%, 17% and 11% respectively, whereas [ph] communication decreased by 9% due to the product transitions in emerging markets.
By technology, as we had expected last quarter, 28-nanometer contribution more than doubled to 5% of total wafer sales in the first quarter. This was the fastest ramp in foundry’s history as we tried to chase customers’ massive demand. Meanwhile 40/45-nanometer continued to be solid and contributed to 32% of our total wafer revenue, exceeding 65-nanometer for the first time. Overall, contribution from 65-nanometer and below technologies increased 4 percentage points to 63%.
Our days of inventory increased by 4 days to 39 days in the first quarter - sorry, the days of inventory increased by 4 days to 47 days in the first quarter. The increase was mainly from the higher working process inventory in response to the strong second quarter demand.
On the cash flow side, we generated TWD$57 billion from operations, invested TWD$49 billion in capital expenditures, raised TWD$17 billion through corporate bonds, and increased TWD$9 billion in short term loans for currency hedge purpose. As a result, our cash balance increased TWD$27 billion to TWD$171 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Let me move on to our full year capacity plan. We expect our total capacity to increase about 12% to reach 14.8 million wafers in 2012. Majority of the increase comes from a 17% increase in 12-inch wafers. Our third GigaFab, Fab 15, begins 28-nanometer volume production this month and then ramp at fastest speed in our history to reach about 50,000 wafers per month by the end of this year.
On the supply chain inventory, after the inventory adjustment through the second half of last year, supply chain DOI=related dropped below seasonal level by the end of fourth quarter. We estimate that now the DOI exiting the first quarter will be even lower and then approach the seasonal level by the end of second quarter.
Before I turn to our next quarter guidance, I would like to talk about some dynamics in our second quarter gross margin, including utility costs, exchange rate, production costs and utilization. First of all, the utility rate in Taiwan will start to increase from the middle of next month. For TSMC, this means about 38% increase in the average utility rates, which will take out 0.4 percentage point from the second quarter gross margin, or 0.5 percentage point from operating margin.
For second half of this year, the impact will go up to about 1% of operating margin. Moreover, the higher summer utility price will start to be applied in July and take about 0.3 percentage point from gross margin in the second quarter. As for the exchange rate, we anticipate a slight NT dollar appreciation to impact the second quarter gross margin by 0.2 percentage point.
On production costs, Fab 15 will start to contribute revenue from the second quarter. Given the higher initial production cost of ramping 28-nanometer, particularly in the new fab, its margin impact is estimated to be negative 2.5 percentage points. Apart from 28-nanometer, other technology nodes will see efficiency improvement which will contribute about 1 percentage point to our gross margin.
Lastly, on utilization, thanks to the strong wafer demand driven by mobile computing devices, our utilization will continue to pick up and contribute about 2.8 percentage points to gross margin. Overall, our second quarter gross margin will increase slightly from first quarter.
Now let me turn to outlook for the second quarter this year. Based on our current business expectation and the forecast exchange rate of TWD$29.58, we expect our revenue to be between TWD$126 billion and TWD$128 billion, which translates into a sequential growth of 19% to 21%. In terms of margin, we expect second quarter gross margin to be between 47% and 49% and operating margin to be between 34.5% and 36.5%.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.",962
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,3675.0,293354.0,14449363.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Hi, ladies and gentlemen. Good evening or good morning, as the case maybe. The news in the last quarter has ranged from encouraging to exciting. Encouraging was the macro-economic news from the United States and China which are our largest end markets. Both economies seen to have averted a worse-possible scenario and are playing out being a medium, good scenario.
Encouraging was also the world semiconductor market trend. It now looks to exceed our earlier forecast of plus 2% growth this year. Exciting was that after 2 quarters of sequential decline, TSMC’s business points to a solid growth year this year.
In the first quarter, 3 months ago, we had estimated that first quarter would be flat or a little down. It turned out to be a little up. Not only that, the incoming orders were strong enough, that allowed us to guide a very solid growth second quarter as Lora has just done. Not only that, the orders forecast, which is our forecast of incoming orders in the next few months, is also very strong. And that means that third quarter in all likelihood will be a continued growth quarter. 
Most exciting is that our 28-nanometer, which is being ramped up just now -- in fact, first quarter was the first ramp-up quarter -- 28-nanometer is now turning out to be a roaring success. The success has exceeded the expectations of our partners who have designed with our 28-nanometer technology and the success, of course, has exceeded our expectations too.
Let me talk more about 28-nanometer. Its performance and cost are both attractive. We are the only effective foundry supplier. We are quite confident that we will remain the only effective foundry supplier for quite some time to come. And we are also confident that in the long run, which means many years, we will be the primary supplier.
Demand of 28-nanometers has surpassed our customers' and our expectations, resulting in a supply shortage. I think the worst of the supply shortage is behind us. We expect that we'll be very close to catching up in the fourth quarter of this year, and we expect to have completely caught up with demand by the first quarter next year. And we will not fall behind again.
This supply shortage problem is not caused by new problems but by underestimate by both our customers and us of the capacity and ramp-up speed required this year. The D-0 [ph] and yields are on plan and exceed those parameters in the early stage of 40-nanometer. Significantly, this is the first time that mobile product customers have played a big role in our leading edged node. Now we are anticipating that in 20-nanometer, the next node, the mobile product customers will perhaps play an even more important role. It is now clear that 28-nanometer will be one of our biggest and most successful nodes, if not the biggest.
Turning to 20-nanometer, the development is on track with very good yield on SRAM. Compared with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer is 1.9x the density and has significant performance improvement in both speed and power. We have engaged with more first wave customers than even the 28-nanometer. If you recall, 1 year or 2 ago, I told you that we were very pleased with the number of engagements on the 28-nanometer. Now this time on the 20-nanometer we’re engaged with even more customers than in the 28-nanometer. Also, this early engagement with a large number of customers on 20-nanometer means earlier collaboration so that when the ramp-up starts, it will be faster and smoother. We plan to roll out 20-nanometer at the end of this year.
Now FinFET. For significant performance case, we’re going to introduce FinFET after the 20-nanometer planar. We’ve been working on FinFET for more than 10 years. We’re quite confident that we will have a robust FinFET technology.
Now turning to subsystem integration. I mentioned 1 year or so ago in more than one of these conferences that we are working on things like CoWoS, which stands for Chip on Wafer on Substrate; BoT, which stands for Bond on Trace; and wafer level fan-out. All those are reported on more than once. All those are under our subsystem integration program. We do plan to provide system or subsystem solutions and they are innovative solutions consisting of CoWoS, BoT and wafer level fan-out. We will also provide manufacturing capacity to better capture value. We also are building an ecosystem with key partners in memory, EDA tools, IPs and substrates.
Now I would like to say a few words about our capital expenditures. Our company mission is to be the trusted provider of technology and capacity to the global logic IC industry in the years to come. We will provide our customers with capacity and technology. We are going to back them 100%.
With 28-nanometers and the subsystem and system technology developing, 28-nanometer is being rapidly ramped up. 28-nanometer and speciality technologies, as well, are being developed actively. We see very strong growth for the company in the next few years. The strategy we outlined to you 2 or 3 years ago is going to bear fruit. It has borne some fruit and it is going to bear even more fruit. The fruit will be a period of very strong growth for the next few years. 
Keeping our mission in mind and looking forward to the very strong growth for the company for the next few years, we have increased the estimate of capital expenditure of this year from $6 billion to $8-8.5 billion. Of the increase of TWD$2 billion to TWD$2.5 billion, TWD$1.3 billion to TWD$1.5 billion is for 28-nanometer, TWD$700 million is for 20-nanometer pull-in. We originally had planned to spend the first large increment of 20-nanometer capacity next year. Now we are planning to pull-in that investment to this year. About TWD$200 million is for BSI and the embedded flash. About TWD$100 million is for back-end which is the system and subsystem integration that I just talked about.
Therefore after the sequential decline of the second half of last year, I am very happy that we now have bright news. And it’s not just a cyclical movement because the outlook is based on primarily technology progress. 28-nanometers, 20-nanometers, some specialty technologies, embedded plash, CMOS imaging sensor, and then in the slightly longer-range future, subsystem integration.
Thank you very much.",1065

Today you had -- in just in your opening comments you had mentioned that FinFET would be introduced after the 20-nanometer planar version. I don’t know if I am reading into this too much or not, it sounded like maybe a little bit of a different tone than previously. I believe last time you, guys said that FinFET would be on mostly likely on 14-nanometer. So just to clarify that, would FinFET possibly be on a later version of 20-nanometer or is it still embedded in the 40-nanometer ramp -- 14-nanometer?",102

But as far as the long term is concerned, I am talking about 3, 4 years, I am quite confident that our 3 or 4 year growth is sustainable, because we are not just talking about the handheld products, the mobile products sector, although we do depend quite a bit on it. But in addition to the strong growth of the mobile product sector, which benefits us, we are also talking about leadership. Technology leadership, capacity leadership in the entire global logic IC industry. Of course, I'm talking about leadership of -- leadership as a foundry. But that’s getting to be more important in the whole scheme of things also now. So I am banking on leadership technology and the capacity [ph] leadership plus trust from our customers, which we have had for a long time and we plan to maintain in the future. I am banking on our leadership in those areas plus the strong growth of the mobile products.",175

So today you had mentioned that it’s quite difficult to predict the mix of 20-nanometer, which is exceeding your expectations for the fourth quarter, I think. Over 20% of revenue by fourth quarter, which is a very steep ramp. But predicting the mix between the bulk version or so-called Poly/SiON version and then the higher performance low power version of the high-K metal gate version. Predicting the mix between those is difficult and I understand somewhat customer driven. Once the high-K metal gate kicks in, are there ASP implications for that? Is that a higher -- command a higher ASP variety of the 28?",121

Now I think 2 or 3 years ago when I first resumed the CEO responsibilities that was a very controversial issue. And at that time, I think I took some time to explain to the investors what the technical differences were. And basically both have their advantages, gate-last and gate-first have their advantage. And both also have their disadvantages. And just to put it very simply, gate-first appeared to be easier to implement. However in the actual implementation you could run into serious difficulties. And we anticipated that perhaps better than the people who decided to use the gate-first approach. So we felt that ultimately gate-last would be the correct route. And all right. So I say the battle is over because even though some companies have continued to pursue gate-first on the 28-/32-nanometer but they have also decided to switch to the gate-last route in their 20-nanometer. So I don’t think that is an issue anymore.",175

After 2008, it was expense. That actually has quite significant impact to our profitability. Now we have allocate about 13.5% of our net income to employee bonus. If I remember correctly, the impact to operating margin is about 5% each point. So that’s the major difference. Nowadays, utility costs will go up. In the second quarter, we anticipate the utility costs for TSMC will go up by 38% in average. That will cause the 0.5% operating margin decline in the second quarter and going forward to second half, the impact will be bigger, will be about 1 percentage point. So other than that, we also have foreign exchange impact. NT dollar has appreciated pretty much in the recent few years. If I -- you remember, we have -- keep a rough estimation for every percent of exchange rate change. The impact to our gross margin was about 0.4 percentage point, so that’s another factor that’s beyond our control.",160

Last quarter of ’05, the employee bonus, the employee profit sharing was not expense. And so if you normalize the profit margin, the operating profit margin at that time to the present day situation, you would lose 5 points right away there. So you said 42%, did you not? So you lose 5 points by that, so it’s 37%. And Lora then went on to explain the power cost and the exchange rate and so on. So now, if you are asking whether one day we’ll get back to 37% again -- operating profit, 37% operating profit, my answer? Yes. Yes, and I would like to see that day come.

Let me - 2-year cadence, second half ’13, yes. Well, look let me answer the first part of your question first. What were the factors that caused us to pull in the 20-nanometer, let’s say, pilot line? Actually the motivation was quite tied to the experience we have - we are having on 28-nanometers. Now in the 28-nanometer node, 28-nanometer is the first time when the mobile product IC customers played a big role in the ramp-up. And they are very big users. So that -- so right now we are having to ramp up very fast. Faster than we ever have previously because previously we did not have big users that needed a lot of chip wafers at the initial stage of the ramp up. Now we anticipate that in the 20-nanometer we will have big users just as we have done now in 28-nanometer. In 20-nanometer we will have to ramp up very fast, even faster than we are doing, or I think will be faster than we are doing in the 28-nanometer. So it will be much to our advantage to shorten the learning cycle. And the TWD$700 million capital expenditure was just pull in. We were originally going to do it sort of a bit later in next year. And now we feel that it will be to our advantage to learn faster sooner, and that’s why we want to pull in this TWD$700 million capital expenditure into this year. Now, the second, the 2-year cadence, what does that mean?",262

So wanted to see if that gets you back so that second half of 2013, we should start the real volume inflection on 20-nanometer now?",62

And maybe the following question. Wanted to see -- because capacity will take a few quarters to ramp up and I think you mentioned first quarter 2013 you will be fully caught up.

I'll follow that up later. And then a question on production. I asked earlier today about the capital intensity ratio. That’s kind of 40% to 50% of revenue it looks like you’re going to spend for extend for 3 years here. And I asked, ""Is that the new norm,"" and you said, well, you didn’t think necessarily that was a norm. It was part of the cycle. But I guess I'm thinking out just over the next 2, 3 years. FinFET's going to be pretty expensive and I assume there’s going to be a 450-millimeter fab investment sometime in the next few years as well. Isn’t there a risk that we actually do have to sustain this kind of high level of capital intensity?",125

I mean, it all comes back to having to integrate all the financial factors into the business equation. All I can do is to say that before we commit the kind of capital we must have the potential returns, meaning potential profit and the potential return on investment, in pretty good grasp before we commit the capital. So in a strong growth period, I do not think that the 40%, 50% capital intensity per se bothers me, but in the long run, I don’t really think that it’s permanently sustainable. I mean, I think that’s -- you have to run huge gross margins in order to justify a 40%, 50% capital intensity. But in a short burst, and I mean by short burst I mean a 3-, 4-year burst. I really think that as long as we have the potential returns and grasp, I really think that just 40%, 50% capital intensity per se does not bother me. We have history to prove that. We have experience to prove that. We had experience to prove that in several -- in periods of several years we could sustain 40%, 50%. And then for again a pretty long period of time, we had only 25%, 20% capital intensity. And those happen to be low growth years too -- the 20% to 25% capital intensity years happened low growth years too. So it’s a question -- I think it’s a question of seizing an opportunity, a growth opportunity when it presents itself.",264

If I could just sneak in 2 housekeeping questions here. Your tax rate is a little bit lower than I expected, Lora. I am curious what the outlook is for your tax rate. And then secondarily, I didn’t see that you gave any guidance on where you thought the segment’s growth rates were going to be. What was going to be the relative outperformers or underperformers in the second quarter? If I get help with those 2 last questions, that’s it for me.",86

The reason being it’s lower than the corporate income tax rate of Taiwan is because we have some tax credits. And we also grandfather by the sunset of incursion of taxing incentive. We still enjoy that, and we will continue enjoy that for several years. So before that happens, our tax rate will now be as high as 17%. So it will be like 8% and it will gradually go up to 10%, 11% in the coming 2 years. Okay. Your second question is about segment growth for the second quarter. In second quarter we see across the board growth for all segment. The 3 segment will grow above seasonal. They are industrial and auditors [ph], communication and the computer. But for consumer we expect the growth will be lower than the seasonal.",165

And immersion throughput is -- there are plans to increase it pretty dramatically.

Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Today, my presentation will start with the financial highlights for the third quarter, followed by the outlook of the fourth quarter.
I am pleased to report a record quarter for TSMC in both revenue and net income, thanks to customers’ strong demand for mobile computing applications and our leadership in technology. Third quarter revenue increased 33% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to reach TWD 141 billion, exceeding our guidance. The better-than-expected revenue was due to higher shipments to support China smartphone demand and higher mark in the back-end revenue.
On the profitability side, third-quarter growth margin was 48.8%, operating margin was 37.2%; both are better than our guidance. The higher margin was due to higher utilization and a better product mix and a higher yield. Total operating expenses in dollars increased slightly in third quarter, however, as a percent of revenue, decreased to 11.6% on a larger revenue base.
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 1.9. ROE for the single quarter was 30.3%.
Let’s move to revenue by product segment. During the third quarter, wafer demand for mobile computing devices continued to be strong, leading to double-digit growth in communication and industrial-related segments, while demand for computer and consumer-related products were relatively soft during this quarter. We are happy to see the good progress of our 28-nanometer. 28-nanometer revenue and shipments more than doubled during third quarter due to solid customer demand and excellent execution.
The contribution to total wafer revenue has increased from 7% in the second quarter to 13% in the third quarter. We expect 28-nanometer revenue will exceed 20% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter and will be more than 10% for the whole year.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at TWD 148 billion, down TWD 40 billion from the second quarter. Current liability decreased by TWD 93 billion, mainly due to the payment of TWD 78 billion cash dividend in July. Taking advantage of the low-interest environment, we raised TWD 40.6 billion in corporate bonds at an average interest rate of 1.33%.
Our total long-term debt, interest-bearing debt, has increased to TWD 78 billion.
On the cash flow side, we generated TWD 77 billion from operation in third quarter, invested TWD 78 billion in capital expenditure, paid TWD 78 billion for dividend, and raised TWD 41 billion through corporate bonds. Overall, our cash balance decreased TWD 40 billion to TWD 139 billion at the end of the third quarter. Due to more capital expenditure, the free cash flow in the third quarter was negative TWD 1.7 billion.
Let me make some comments on our capacity plan. As we continue adding capacity for 28-nanometer, our total capacity has increased 5% to 3.8 million wafer in the third quarter. We expect 28-nanometer will be fully utilized. For the full year, our 12-inch capacity is expected to increase 21% in 2012 and total annual capacity for the company will increase 14% to reach TWD 50 million 8-inch equivalent wafers.
Regarding capital expenditure for this year, up to the third quarter, we have spent $6.2 billion, representing 75% of our total year budget. I have finished my report on our financial highlights. Now let me turn to the fourth quarter outlook.
Based on our current expectations and the forecast exchange rate of TWD 29.47, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 129 billion and TWD 131 billion. In terms of margins, we expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be between 45% and 47%, and operating margin to be between 33% and 35%. This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Morris Chang.",628
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5067.0,370090.0,17687447.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. For the third quarter, we had a record quarter in both revenue and net income, as Lora has already reported. Fourth quarter, as guided, is going to be a modest dip, about 8% in revenue. We also think that this will be followed by another modest dip in the first quarter and we expect a rebound in the second quarter. All this we actually predicted three months ago.
The fourth quarter dip and the first quarter dip is caused by supply chain inventory adjustment. Right now, the days of inventory, DOI, is about 13 days above seasonal. We expect that it will be adjusted to 7 days above seasonal at the end of the year. And then, it will become normal in the second quarter of next year. That is consistent with our prediction of 2 dips caused by supply chain inventory adjustment.
Now, both our third quarter and our fourth quarter are better than our expectations 3 months ago. Third quarter, we did exceed guidance. And even though fourth quarter will have a dip as we forecast now, but it’s a dip from a higher level than we forecasted 3 months ago. Why? We think the reason is the strength of mobile product demand.
First, mobile IC demand is indeed very strong, stronger than we expected even 3 months ago. Secondly, TSMC is foundry leader in mobile IC. And together with our partners, we are the technology leader in mobile IC. This is a leadership that we and our partners will continue, will maintain.
Third, TSMC value-added increases as smartphones get smarter and feature phones gets smart. We expect mobile products to fuel TSMC growth for a number of years, a number of years.
Next, I will talk about a few product segments. 28-nanometer. In the third quarter, it was 13% of our revenue. In the fourth quarter, it will be higher than 20% of our revenue.
And for the whole year, next year, we expect it to be more than 30% of our revenue. Yields have continued to improve and the gross margin of the 28-nanometer will be in the low 40s -- low 40% in the fourth quarter. And it will be, in 2013, it will be at corporate average.
Another product segment, CMOS image sensor. We have made significant improvements in optical performance. And dual cameras and higher-resolution sensors have been introduced in smartphones and tablets, as an example of value-added increase in mobile products.
Next, another example of value-added increase in mobile products. TSMC value-added increase in mobile products, and that’s the fingerprint authentication and near-field communication.
On 20-SoC, 20-nanometer SoC. Our 112-megabit SRAM yield has progressed significantly and we are now accepting customers’ test chips. In fact, we have already accepted several customers’ test chips and are accepting more. On 16 FinFET, we plan to accept test chips in first quarter, next quarter, first quarter 2013, 2013 next quarter. And then in June of next year, we plan to have a first cyber shuttle.
And then in November of next year, we plan to start risk production. This is a somewhat faster cadence than our previous generations. And one big reason for that is that basically 20 and 14 are quite alike. The interconnects are very, very alike, of course. 16 is FinFET; that’s the big difference. But other than that, there are many similar aspects. And so we will be able to introduce 16 quicker, a lot faster than normally we introduce a new generation.
Another point that’s worthy of note, along with our development of 20-SoC and 16 FinFET, that’s that our Open Innovation Platform, OIP, which is our design ecosystem, it is becoming a more important competitive advantage as the technology advances to 20-nanometer. At 20-nanometer, our competitive advantage in our design ecosystem is greater than in 20-nanometer or earlier generations. Our customers rely on us for design exploration, solution development and design validation.
Next item I want to report is that we did invest in ASML to the tune of approximately €1.1 billion. Of the €1.1 billion, 1/4 is in R&D sharing and 3/4 are investment in the stocks. The R&D sharing will be spread over a 5-year period, starting in 2013. This investment is important to us because of EUV and 450-millimeter lithography, both of which are important to us at 10 nanometers and beyond.
Next item I want to report is that we have purchased 14 hectares of land in Zhunan. It’s about 20 minutes of driving from the Science Park in Hsinchu. So it’s really very nearby. And the reason it has to be nearby is that we’re using the land for our new advanced R&D fab. And that R&D fab is going to be for 450 millimeters and 7 nanometers development.
Next, we expect 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, those 4 years, to be either growth years or strong growth years. We believe that the strategy we adopted a few years ago of vastly expanding our R&D and our capital investment is beginning to pay off. Actually, you can already see it from the last couple of years’ results, but more is yet to come. The best is yet to come. And we will continue the R&D expansion.
Now on capital expenditure, I will make separate comments. Capital expenditure will be about TWD 8.3 billion this year, which is right in the middle of the range that we guided a few months ago. We said TWD 8 billion to TWD 8.5 billion and it now appears that it will be about TWD 8.3 billion this year. Of course, the resulting cash flow stream from this capital expenditure is going to be much greater, much greater than the capital investment.
I will give you a ballpark number for next year’s capital expenditure now. It will be the same ballpark as this year’s capital expenditure, same ballpark. Now just to preempt the question of how big is your ballpark, well, my answer is, it’s neither very small nor very big. It’s in the same ballpark. I think that you can use this common sense. I’m a very commonsensical person. I’m not trying to play any tricks on you.
We plan to do more borrowing via corporate bonds. Actually, our net cash flow from operations in the 3 years, 2012, 2013, 2014, I’m talking about a 3-year period, our net cash flow from operations in those 3 years is sufficient to support our CapEx in those 3 same years.
[Indiscernible] because that defines another boundary for our CapEx. So why do we borrow money? We borrow money to pay dividend, which we will keep at TWD 3 per share in this period. That concludes my comments. Thank you very much.",1126

So to your current question, I said that I think that, your present question is -- I said 3 months ago that second quarter will be a strong rebound and I’m -- you are a very alert person. You had noticed that I did not use the word strong this time. Is that the origin of the question?
Well, my answer however is that, no, I did not use the word strong because we are now talking about a higher level in the first quarter. So it will be rebound. In fact, in some people’s eyes, I think it will be viewed as a strong rebound, but I think that we better -- I decided not to be too aggressive on these sort of things, so I say be a rebound. We’re still pointing -- I mean, it’s still 2 quarters away, frankly. Even though I think our visibility is in general quite good, but 2 quarters away, we can’t be sure exactly what the strength of the rebound is. But I know I am 100% certain that there will a pretty good rebound.",235

Then, I think my second question is regarding the 20-nanometer and the 16-nanometer. And a lot of your clients talk about the 20-nanometer cost, the cost saving of [Indiscernible] actually still not reached the economy or reach the and actually both also have the same comment during yesterday’s earning conference. So my question is since a lot of the customer actually, they are not aggressive to get into a 20-nanometer so far, and however, listening to your comment, you are very aggressively talking about 20-nanometer and even 16-nanometer demand. So my question is, is this a 20-nanometer or 16-nanometer? Is there customer-specific -- driven by customer-specific demand or this is just for overall demand?",115

And the power reduction is 20% to 25% at the same speed. You got that? 15% to 20% performance gain at the same power, and 20% to 25% power reduction at the same speed. Now, I know that some customers want even more. But one phenomenon that we faced is that our customers are consolidating. The bigger customers are bigger than the other customers, than big customers used to be bigger than other customers. All right?
So incidentally I was rereading a passage of Michael Porter’s classic “Competitive Strategy” just the other night, and he said that there are 5 things that every company has to cope with. One of those things is customers’ bargaining power. Another thing is suppliers’ bargaining power. And I’m glad to report that after looking over those 5 things and thinking about each of them in relation to us, we have come out, I think, pretty good overall. But your question reminds me of customers’ bargaining power and also customers’ relative importance. So, all right. So here there may be a larger number of customers that want more performance or less power than their customers who are already satisfied with them, but it turns out that those that are already satisfied with them buy more than the ones that want more.",232

I wanted to follow up on a question I had last quarter, a bit on the idea of perhaps building kind of more of a focused fab approach for some of your larger customers versus the very diversified fabs that you currently run. I guess, as you look at some of the largest mobile chip users in the world, you look at their product cycles, can be quite volatile with some huge swings on your product cycles back and forth.
I’m wondering, as you manage those fabs, should we anticipate, perhaps, more volatility in those fabs versus your very diversified tabs? Granted you’re getting new business, so perhaps it’s good that you’re generating more revenue, albeit, perhaps, with more volatility? Or do you think you can achieve kind of the same level of returns on a focused fab versus a broad-based diversified tab? Thank you.",160

And so Dan’s question is, given single product life cycle, product life cycle could be more volatile than a diversified pool of products. So if we have fabs that are dedicated to one or two single products, we have to able to manage higher volatility, or Chairman thinks that the volatility will be about the same? Volatility.

Well, then I think it’s very important for us to be able to convert to a new technology, to convert the fab to a new technology with as little loss as possible. And I think that’s an art that the DRAM companies actually have learned, and we have also done some of that, but we are going to do the same thing to the DRAM companies had done in the past. We’re trying to make the product, the equipment, as commonly usable as possible. I think that now, of course, we do have additional advantage because we do have a very large second wave of users. We have always had that. We have always had that.
And so in the past, the second wave users have always begun to take over the fabs that the first wave users leave behind, and we will continue to have that.
Now, I do want to clarify this business of dedicating fabs. Well, I don’t think that one should take that literally, in many cases. There may be or there will be very rare cases when we will dedicate something to a customer, but that’s not going to be a very common practice.",200

So to assume that corporate average is -- I think the 100% utilization is -- we do get 50%, yes, right.

Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you see depreciation moving q-on-q and whether there’s any changes ahead in other manufacturing costs for wafer? The guidance seems to imply there’s some savings in cost of sales, so I just wanted to understand that more.
And then the second question for Dr. Chang, regarding the trend towards CoWos and TSV, when you think about your wireless customers moving to these new packaging technologies, how do you engage with memory as part of this roadmap? And is there a need for a more strategic partnership with DRAM makers? And given there are so few mobile DRAM makers out there, how do you really manage this with your leading-edge wireless customers going forward?",136

You also asked about how do we reduce announced [ph] depreciation costs. To be frank with you, we have to take a significant effort in the past 2 months trying to reduce all other costs, including the material purchase price, the indirect material used for the wafer, productivity and so on and so forth. I have seen, actually, one of the continual effort in TSMC, especially when we see there’s a continual 2 quarter in the downturn and the management team has put a lot of effort trying to reduce that.

And the second classification I think perhaps I wanted to ask, on your definition of foundry, obviously the lines are getting blurred now. I think most of the capital equipment companies include Samsung and their concept of foundry. I know that it’s both on IDM as well as a foundry as well as an equipment company. So perhaps in your definition going forward, whether or not you could talk about foundry growth, incorporating your largest competitor, Samsung, when you’re talking about forecast, is that something that you would entertain? 
You’re frequently talking about the semiconductor forecast, which, in fact, is not relevant to your forecast. What is important is your perception of the foundry growth industry. But your forecasts are excluding Samsung. I’m wondering, going forward, if we could have your forecast of the foundry growth, including Samsung?",141

As Moore’s Law going forward to 26-nanometer, from your discussion with your customers, do you think that the absolute growth of the high-end revenue, that the leading-edge revenue will continue to grow at the same pace because of mobile computing? Or we are going to see us, like people are more hesitant to migrate after 20-nanometer, which seems to be having an inflection point?",76

For instance, our 28-nanometer revenue is -- well, while it’s leading edge, is now ahead of our 40-nanometer at the same stage. So I anticipate that 20-nanometer will be the same way. So I think that will continue.
Now, of course, you didn’t ask about -- nobody asked about how important EUV is, how important 450-millimeter is. They are very important. I mean, EUV I think is the only economic way of doing -- I won’t say 10, but surely it will be the only economic way of doing 7. Even a 10, if we have a good EUV, high-throughput EUV, I think that our costs will be in good shape, will be in better shape. Of course, we can use double patterning, triple patterning, quadruple patterning, but those we would like to avoid. And to avoid them depends on getting ASML to succeed with their high-throughput EUV.
Now likewise, 450-millimeters, that’s going to be another impulse on cost reduction, I think. And I think that will cut in at -- 450-millimeter will cut in at 7-nanometer. It may cut in earlier. I think that Intel is talking about cutting in at 10-nanometer, but my feeling is that it will cut in at 7.",224

TSMC is much larger than its competitors. It’s going to have 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter from 28-nanometer, when many of your smaller competitors are still struggling to get their first 5%. So for now, you’re just dominating this space. The competition is trying to get more aggressive there. I’m curious what you think about the total capacity out there and if the competitive environment is going to be more intense, maybe by mid next year, at 28-nanometer. Do you have any thoughts on that?",93

Not nearly as good as ours, but good enough for them to sell. I think so. But on the high-K metal gate, which is our 28HP and our 28HPM, I think that we will be the only one that has effective capacity.

Good morning and good evening to everyone. Welcome to our 2011 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Before I start I want to extend by my best wishes for year of the dragon. It is only few days before the Chinese lunar New Year. During today's call I will start with the financial highlights in the fourth quarter followed by a recap of 2011. Then we will move on to the outlook for the first quarter 2012. All dollars figures are in NT dollars unless otherwise stated.
Our fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7% sequentially to TWD 104.7 billion. In the U.S. dollar terms, revenue decreased 5.4% compared with the third quarter. Our wafer shipment decreased 8% to 2.9 million 8-inch equivalent wafers in this quarter. This customers' inventory adjustment continued to affect TSMCs wafer demand. By applications, computer consumer and industrial related revenue were more affected and decreased by 13%, 10% and 14%, respectively. Worrier [ph] communication increased by 6%, thanks to the demand for smartphones. Overall, communication accounted for 56% of our total wafer sales in this quarter, while computer, consumer and industrial accounted for 20%, 9% and 18% of our wafer sales respectively.
By technology contribution from 28-nanometer process technology already represented 2% of the total wafer sales. We believe 28-nanometer contribution will be more than 10% in the second half of 2012, also for the whole year. 40-nanometer contribution remained at 27% in the fourth quarter, while 65-nanometer increased 3 percentage points to 30% of total wafer sales. Combined contribution from 65-nanometer and below represented 59% of total wafer sales in this quarter, which is 5 percentage points higher than the previous quarter.
Gross margin was 44.7%, up 2.7 percentage points from third quarter, mainly attributed to a favorable exchange rate and a higher utilization rate. Operating margin was 31.4%, up 1.7 percentage points. Operating expenses increased 5% from the previous quarter mainly due to higher opening expense for Fab 15 in Taichung. Overall, our fourth quarter's net margin arrived at 30.2%. EPS was TWD 1.22. During this quarter we further reduced our inventory level by 2 days to 43 days. We believe this inventory level is healthy.
Cash flow from operations totaled TWD 73 billion, up TWD 18 billion from third quarter, primarily due to higher other operating sources. Also our capital expenditure decreased by TWD 8 billion in the quarter. These two factors helped us -- helped our free cash flow increase from TWD 17 billion to TWD 43 billion during the fourth quarter. Overall our cash and short-term investments increased TWD 30 billion to TWD 151 billion. Our capital expenditure was US$1 billion in the fourth quarter. Total capital expenditure for the whole year was US$7.3 billion.
Our total capacity slightly declined in the fourth quarter as a result of capacity conversion in 12-inch fab and annual maintenance in certain 8-inch fab. Full year total capacity increased by 17% year-over-year to 13.2 million 8-inch equivalent wafer while 12-inch wafer capacity increased by 29%. We expect our total capacity to increase by 5% sequentially to 3.6 million 8-inch equivalent wafers in first quarter of 2012, mainly due to increase in 28-nanometer capacity.
Next, let me give you a recap of our performance in 2011. 2011 revenue was TWD 427 billion. Gross margin was 45.4%, operating margin was 33.1% and the EPS was TWD 5.18. 2011 was a challenging year for the semiconductor industry. Despite a difficult macro environment TSMC still achieved top line growth. In U.S. dollar terms our revenue increased 9% year-over-year to US$14.5 billion in 2011, continually outperforming the foundry industry regarding profitability. Despite rising depreciation, R&D expense and unfavorable exchange rate, we still maintain gross margin at above 45% and achieve our long term financial targets of and above 20% ROE.
Supported by solid financial performance we are committed to invest in R&D for future growth and strive for long-term shareholder value. Now let's turn to the outlook for the first quarter 2012. Based on the current business expectation and the forecast exchange rate of 30.25, we expect our consolidated revenue in the first quarter to come in between TWD 103 billion and TWD 105 billion. In terms of margins, we expect our first quarter gross margins to be between 42.5% and 44.5%. Operating margin to be between 28.5%-30.5%.
Our first quarter revenue outlook is similar to revenue in the previous quarter but the profit margin is slightly lower. The main reason is that our 28-millimeter wafer sales contribution will increase rapidly to around 5% in the first quarter from 2% in the fourth quarter 2011. As margins of any process technology are typically lower than corporate average at initial stage of roll-in production. This increase in 28-millimeter contribution will have some temporary negative impact on our margin.
This concludes my remark today. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.",823

First I would like to look at the 2011 in retrospect. In 2011, the world's semiconductor growth was close to zero. The world's foundry industry growth was 4%. TSMC growth was 9%. All these figures were in U.S. dollars. TSMC growth was mainly driven by the strength of 40 and 45-nanometer nodes and the emergence of the 28-nanometer nodes. Revenues from our advanced technology, that is 65-nanometer and below, grew from 46% of total wafer revenue in 2010 to 55% in 2011.
Now, a few words on supply chain inventory. The supply chain inventory has been working down throughout the second half of 2011. We expect that the supply chain's BOI in aggregate is about 7 days below seasonal at the end of 4Q '11, and will continue to be below seasonal throughout 1Q '12. Next, I would like to say a few words about this year 2012s semiconductor and foundry outlook. The outlook for 2012s economic condition is, for world GDP to grow at 2.4%, that's how estimates are. It's higher than some and lower than others.
We expect the world semiconductor market to grow at about 2%. In the semiconductor market, mobile part of our product will enjoy particularly strong growth. TSMC is well positioned in the mobile part of market with the right technology and we have the manufacturing capacity. We should perform better than the overall semiconductor and foundry industry this year. I have asked C.C. Wei, Senior VP of Business Development, to give a special presentation on TSMCs positioning in the mobile products today. He will speak after me.
TSMCs Q1 revenue is about flat from last year's Q4, but stronger than seasonal. According to our current booking forecast our second quarter revenue will be stronger than first quarter. On our capital expenditures. In order to leverage our leadership position in 28-nanometer and to expand out development work in 20-nanometer and beyond, we expect to spend about US$6 billion in capital expenditure. About 80% of the spending is for tools, loadings and facilities for 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer nodes, and 12% of the total spending is for R&D.
I will say a few words on the status of our 28-nanometer ramp. Our 28-nanometer entered volume production last year and contributed 2% of 4Q '11s wafer revenue. Defect density and new progress is ahead of schedule and is better than 40-45-nanometer at the corresponding stage of the ramp-up. We expect 28-nanometer ramp this year to be fast and we expect 28-nanometer will contribute more than 10% of total wafer revenue this year.
Our tape-outs on the 28-nanometer. We have so far completed 36 individual tape-outs and have scheduled another 132 individual product tape-out in 2012. While three versions of the 28-nanometer technology, the LP, the HP and the HPL have entered volume production, the fourth version, the HPM, has entered risk production this quarter and is expected to begin volume production in the second half of this year.
Now, I will give you report on some technology development. First, on 20-nanometers and beyond. Our 20-nanometer development is on track to start risk production at the end of this year. We combine our high performance planar transistors with system integration such as COWOS and our ecosystems partners. We think that with the combination of those three, the high performance planar transistor, the high-density system integration, such as COWOS, that stands for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate by the way. And our ecosystems partners such as ARM and other EDAs. TSMC's 20-nanometer technology will be most competitive in the marketplace.
For FinFET, TSMC will offer second generation FinFET transistors at 14-nanometer node, with risk productions in 2014. Their feasibility has been proven. We are in the process of integrating it into the technology platform. To solidify and enhance our R&D efforts we have invested a few hundred million dollars of additional equipment and put in hundreds of engineers to start up a R&D process center in order to deliver the 20-nanometer and 40-nanometer prototypes with quick cycle time.
I wanted to say a few words on high voltage. The fast growth of mobile computing devices has fueled the growth of demand for high voltage, HV technology. The HV technology is needed for power management IC and for display driver. The mobile computing devices require smaller footprint, high efficiency, with predictable use and large capacity to support. TSMCs strength of integrating logic and HV fits well in this trend. For power management IC, TSMC's 0.25 micron PCB is in volume production, and customers are designing into our 0.18 micron PCB while 0.13 micron PCB is under development. For display driver the requirements include high resolution, thinner frame to narrow the edge and faster data rate to refresh the screen. TSMC's 110 nanometer HV and 80 nanometer HV fit well in this trend with the smallest design volts and the largest capacity for the market. We plan to offer 55-nanometer HV next year to further extend our leadership.
Next chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, COWOS. TSMC offers a robust COWOS solution to enable future advanced products featuring low power and consumption. The solution integrates advanced silicon technology and interposer technology. We expect COWOS to start at 28-nanometer and become significant at 20-nanometer and below. We've been collaborating with customers to develop COWOS product for qualification in 2012 and industrial production in 2013. That will be the 28-nanometer regime. The COWOS echo system improves memory manufacturers and wholesale partners. Initial applications will be in the areas of high-end GPU, FPGA and networking.
And now a few words on the status of our solar and solid state lighting business. This year, we have seen very quick price jumps in both solar and solid state lightning. In this environment, we are proceeding cautiously and hopefully prudently. We are spending somewhat longer time in getting the technology to an even higher performance than we originally planned, before we switch to production. We are still focusing most of our efforts on development and that will last well into 2012, our development will last well into 2012. Although we do expect modest revenue in 2012 for both solar and solid state lighting.
Our goal in solar is to produce high quality solar modules at competitive costs. And we have started to move in tools into our new solar fab in Taichung. And recently we're able to demonstrate a circuit efficiency of 17.12% on 30x30 centimeter cells. To the best of our knowledge, the highest efficiency that has been achieved anywhere is 17.2% for a cell of similar size, and as I said we achieved 17.12%, very close to the highest efficiency that has been achieved anywhere.
And in solid state lighting our goal is to produce emitters at a stable high quality level, and are making good progress in developing our technology and converting them from R&D to pilot production. We are now approaching the 120-lumen per watt level, also bringing this new activity in the top bracket of technical performance.
Now, I would like to turn the talk over to Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Senior VP for Business Development, and he will talk about mobile computer products. C.C.?",1186

Ltd., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2012",2012-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4013.0,2466752.0,93384287.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,4,"Thank you, sir. Good day, everybody. Let me start with the two most important products in the mobile computing business, that is the smartphone and tablet. In year 2003 to year 2011, smartphones grew from 10 million units to 456 million units. Year 2011 is also the first year that smartphone outnumbered PCs. Looking forward for the next five years, the growth would likely continued with 21% CAGR and reaches about 1 billion units, probably in year 2015 but no later than 2016. In addition to smartphone, the tablets grew from 18 million units in year 2010 to 60 million in last year. We also expect that a greater than 30% CAGR for the next five years for tablets. So, both smartphones and tablets are expected to have very strong growth in the future.
Equally important is the mobile data traffic. According to Cisco's estimate, the number of mobile data traffic by smartphones and tablets almost double every year. From about 91 petabyte per month in year 2009 to 546 petabyte per month last year. And will increase to more than 1153 petabyte per month this year and more than 2,000 petabyte per month next year. The quantitative increase of data traffic almost are sure to sink. First, the number of smartphones and tablets all have a very strong growth in the future. And second, higher transmitting speed and larger bandwidth will become necessary. So as a result, better semiconductor technology is required and that what leads to my next topic, why TSMC has very strong positioning in the mobile computing market.
As I mentioned, in the mobile computing world device speed is very important. But yet another factor to be considered, that is the power consumption. Lower power is essential because you want to determine the smartphone and tablet use time. So in summary, all in all, the speed, the low power that turned out to be the semiconductor technology is very, very important. In the last three years we have increasingly invested on R&D to enhance our progress in the technology and so we are working with our customer. TSMC can provide to our customer the leading edge technology optimized for speed and lower power consumption.
In addition to processing technology, we are also benefiting from the ARM architecture which is famous for the low power operation and have been used by almost all TSMC customers in their product. And in fact, it is no surprise that TSMC customers are gaining their market share in the mobile computing and we are growing with them. Further, needless to say that TSMC and ARM both are cooperating together to catch the great opportunity in this mobile computing area.
Next, I want to talk about why TSMC good positioning in the wind of foundry market segments here. We have seen a faster technology migration in the past two years. For example, a 65-nanometer node, we sold about 35 products at the initial volume ramp and the number growing to 43 products at 40, 45-nanometer node and about 80 products at 28-nanometer node. Not only the number of products increased, we also saw the same trend in the volume ramp compared with the same period of time. And the faster technology migration actually is mainly driven by the performance need in these three years, higher speeds, lower power, everything.
In order to keep up this faster technology migration, there is shortened time to the market. TSMC customers has borne the increased expenditure to have earlier and deeper cooperation in technology definition. As a result, we believe this faster technology migration will help TSMC to gain foundry market segment share. And indeed we have observed foundry market share gains of about 2 points from the year 2008 to 2011 in spite of new entrants in the same period of time. Thank you.",639

The revenue contribution of the 28-nanometer is going to be more than 10% for the whole year this year. And roughly, in the first quarter, it will be 5%. As you know, and we said that in the fourth quarter, it was 2%. This quarter it will be 5% and it will gradually build up so that the whole year it will be 10% or a little more than 10%. And High-K metal gate, when does it kick in. It has already started to kick in but it's a little bit behind the oxynitride. But it will build up quite fast. So at the end of the year we expect about half, half oxynitride and half High-K metal gate.",131

Looking to hear more color on that going forward. That sounds like interesting initiative. And then finally a very quick questions for Lora. If I could get some color on the different fab capacity movements in the first quarter. I don't know if you can pull up that slide. It seems as though some of the 8-inch fab capacity, you've got some fabs declining, Fab 2 and 3 declining. Fabs 5 and 6 are actually increasing. The only reason why I am bringing it up is they have been pretty stable over the last couple of quarters and in the first quarter it seems to have some capacity movements on the 8-inch. And then as you look on the 12-inch front, the two big increases that you have already talked about on the first quarter, Fab 12 and Fab 14, I presume, are 28-nanometer. And finally the third part of the question is, how much growth this year will you have in 40-nanometer? Because I do understand that you're upgrading some of your excess 65-nanometer to 40-nanometer. So how much growth in 40 will there be as a result of those upgrades?",193

Some fabs have increased in the first quarter. You just mentioned, there were some changes in 8-inch. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, there was some 8-inch coming down from the annual maintenance. So the capacity for those fabs will be slightly smaller than the fourth quarter. The two big 12-inch fab for 40-inch trials, they are all undertaking the expansion for 28-nanometer as a majority. In fact, 14 has a comfortable increase over 40-nanometer.

So is perhaps the longer term outcome is that moving the memory off-chip on a interposer. That this is a meaningful cost reduction for your customers and therefore we are creating more value. Because I think some investors are confused whether this is you moving into the backend and taking away business from the backend process or is this really essentially a frontend value creation exercise?

Secondly, actually it's for the performance because when you put two together, you can save the power consumption. You eliminate a lot of IOs, all right.

Okay. And then one other thing, I noticed, the mix of your revenue by fabless versus IDMs. Back in 2007, IDM accounted for a third of your revenue, now it has gone down to about 15%-16%. Is that a reflection of this secular change, more of a ARM ecosystem, or does that mean that when IDMs see full utilization rate, they are going to come back to you and it would have additional revenue opportunity for you?",79

The line between IDM and fabless is a very, very much blurred one now. This has happened just in the last four, five years, and at leading edge technology in fact it started with 40-nanometer. There are only -- or I would say, two IDMs. And that's true at 28-nanometer also. So all the rest at 28 and 40, everyone except those two is a fabless.",75

Just as a follow-up, when we compare the 28-nanometer transition to prior transitions, let's say 65 to 40 and with IDMs not having any 28-nanometer capacity. Does that mean that the pricing power for TSM is better compared to the previous time? 28 is more capital intensive that's why your margins are below corporate. But once you get a scale, does that change your pricing power compared to previous transitions?",71

It happened every generation and I expect that it will happen in the future, in future generations. 20-nanometer and 40-nanometer and so on. Because this is the well known learning curve effect, and when you start making something in production, it's always is a pretty high cost. The scale is low and the use is generally still on the very sharp upslope and so -- you can possibly, if you try to charge a price that compensates you for the very inefficient manufacturing at the early stage of technology then you'll find that nobody is willing to pay it. So the fact that the margin is low this year to us, it's something that we accept in every new generation. And as I said earlier, I expect that the margin will become very close to the corporate average by the fourth quarter of this year and I expect it will actually surpass the corporate average next year.",175

Good afternoon, good evening and good morning to everyone. We had a very good second quarter. The financial results came in at the high end of each of the guidance.
Revenue grew 21% Q-over-Q to set a record of TWD 128 billion. This strong demand for mobile computing devices and our leadership in 28 nanometer gave us a strong growth in the second quarter.
On the margin side, second quarter gross margin was 48.6% or 0.9 percentage point higher than that in the first quarter. The increase of gross margin mainly came from the higher capacity utilization across all technologies, although 28 nanometer gross margin is currently below corporate average. We expect it will reach to corporate average by first quarter of 2013.
Operating margin was 36.5% in second quarter, up 2.9 percentage points, both R&D and SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by about 1 percentage point each.
You may notice that we had a loss of TWD 0.8 billion in a non-operating item. This is mainly due to a one-time impairment charge of TWD 2.68 billion on our 5.6% holding in SMIC shares. This contributed to TWD 0.09 drop of our second quarter EPS.
Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 1.61, ROE was 26%.
Let's move on to revenue by product segment. We have seen revenue from all applications increased sequentially among the 4 major product segments. Communication increased by 27%; computer increased by 20%; consumer increased by 9%; and industry-related revenue increased by 39% in the second quarter. The high growth of industrial and standard application is mainly due to a strong demand for ICs used in mobile computing devices, such as power management IC and a touch controller.
In terms of technology, revenue from 28 nanometer grew nearly 90% in the second quarter. We expect shipment of 28 nanometer to double in the third quarter. Revenue from advanced technologies, that is 69 nanometer and below technology and beyond technology, accounts for 61% of our second quarter revenue.
Take a look at the balance sheet. The cash and marketable securities ended the second quarter at TWD 188 billion. Accounts receivable and the inventory amount went up as a result of business growth. Current liability increased by TWD 86 billion mainly due to the accrual of dividend payable of TWD 78 billion.
On the cash flow side, we generated TWD 70 billion from operations, invested TWD 59 billion in capital expenditure, repaid TWD 3.9 billion in short-term loan. As a result, our cash balance increased TWD 7.6 billion to TWD 178 billion at the end of the second quarter. Free cash flow generated in the second quarter was TWD 10.5 billion.
Let's look at the capacity. On February 15, we began volume production of 28 nanometer in the second quarter and we expect to ramp at a faster pace in the second half of this year. Given our CapEx, we expect our total capacity to increase by about 14% year over year and 12-inch capacity will increase about 21%.
Now, let me provide you our guidance for the third quarter. Based on our current business expectation and a forecast exchange rate of 29.76, we expect our revenue to be between TWD 136 billion and TWD 138 billion, which is a sequential growth of 6% to 8%. We expect the third quarter gross margin is to be between 46% and 48% and operating margin between 34% and 36%.
This conclude my remarks. Let me turn the podium to the Chairman.",587
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5717.0,2467096.0,93393636.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora and good afternoon mainly, ladies and gentlemen. Today I will make a few comments on the second quarter and third quarter, and then I will also give you some color on world economy, the supply chain inventory and our fourth quarter outlook. Then I'll talk about a few major technologies of ours. And then lastly, I will talk about the CapEx, capital intensity and growth.
Second quarter was a good one. We were actually quite pleased with it. This year, every quarter the major effort has been to ramp up 28 nanometers. And in doing so, of course, we did incurred a lot of costs and also as a result, the gross margin of 20 nanometer all year this year would not be up to the corporate average standard.
But in spite of all that, and also, in spite of an extraordinary item in the second quarter, which Lora mentioned, the impairment charge of SMIC shares, which actually accounted for TWD 0.09 earnings per share, in spite of the unusual costs in the 28 nanometer ramp up and the unusual item relating to the impairment charge of the SMIC shares, second quarter was good, was very good, and we expect a good third quarter. We will see a growth, as Lora has already guided, at the midpoint of our guidance, we will see a growth of about 7% in revenue in the third quarter, sequential quarter to quarter revenue growth of about 7%. And since we will not have the impairment charge in the third quarter, our EPS growth between second quarter and third quarter will actually be stronger than 7%.
Now, so it looks okay. Now, as we look further into the future, fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, we do have some worrisome signs. World economy, as you know, and I will not dwell on it, the outlook, I am actually talking about the outlook, the future outlook of world economy, and I'm comparing it now with the outlook as most people saw it 4 months ago, 3 months ago or 6 months ago.
The outlook now certainly has deteriorated in the last 3 to 6 months. The U.S., which matters the most to us because our market is still very much, is majorly, majorly in the U.S. So the U.S. economy matters to us the most. It has gone into a less optimistic situation than we saw it even 3 months ago. The very good job creations record early in the year has now disappeared and there does not seem to be any political solution in sight for the forthcoming financial cliff at the end of the year. And the retail sales, the recent data are not good. And so, the U.S. outlook for the U.S. economy has deteriorated in the last few months.
And then, next to the importance to us of the U.S. economy, you have Europe, Japan, mainland China and Taiwan, and I will say that the outlook for any of those economies has not improved in the last 3 months.
Now, we, of course, have do pretty thorough, pretty extensive market research on our business and one key factor besides the world economy, one key factor, of course, is the supply chain inventory of our products, and that is not good. And I will give you some numbers.
At the end of the first quarter, the overall supply chain inventory in days of inventory at the end of first quarter was 6 days below seasonal. At the end of second quarter, it was 3 days above seasonal. And we're forecasting that at the end of the third quarter, it will be 12 days above seasonal. And this, of course, indicates that there will be a correction in the fourth quarter. And we, indeed, are forecasting that there will be inventory correction in the fourth quarter to about at the end of fourth quarter we forecasted that the inventory will be only 8 days above seasonal. So, 12 days at the end of the third quarter and 8 days above at the end of the fourth quarter. And we are also look at our customers' days of inventory. The fabless customers at the end of first quarter was 2 days below and at the end of the second quarter was 4 days above. And we are forecasting that at the end of third quarter customers' DOI will be 10 days above. And there will be a correction, but at the end of the fourth quarter, it will still be 6 days above.
Now those numbers are for the fabless customers. For IDM customers, the pattern is similar but numbers are different but the pattern is similar, so I'm not going to talk about them. Fabless customers accounted for a very large, dominant majority of sales, anyway.
We are now seeing a dip in our revenue in the fourth quarter, a dip from the third quarter level. I think it will be a dip in our forecast, not just I think, our forecast is that the dip will not be nearly as serious as the dip we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008. That I wouldn't even call a dip, I would call that a plunge, this one I think is a dip of certainly far more modest magnitude than that one. Now, as to exactly how much it will be, I think it's too early to say but we can see that there will be a dip and then we have, of course, accordingly made the preparations, we have seen it coming for oh, at least a month, maybe 2 months now. We saw early signs of it actually 3 months ago but those were very, very early signs but 2 months ago we became surer and one month ago we became pretty sure that there will be a dip in the fourth quarter. Now, further, we also think that the dip will continue into the first quarter. And then still further, we see a pretty healthy recovery in the second quarter.
So in summary, I am saying that we will have a dip that will last 2 quarters, fourth quarter and first quarter next year, and by the second quarter, we will have rebounded pretty strongly. Those are the indications that we have now.
Now I would like to say a few words about our technology progress. 28 nanometer is progressing very well. Our output and our yields are both above the plans that we set for ourselves and the plans that we communicated to our customers early in the year. Early in the year means January-February of the year, we set our plans in output and in yields and we, of course, tried ever since then, we tried to exceed the plan and we had also communicated the plan to our customers at the time. And we have indeed exceeded the planned in both output and yields.
We expect to ramp up to about 68,000 wafers per month by the end of the year, 28 nanometer, 68,000 12-inch wafers per month by the end of the year. And by fourth quarter, we will be nearly caught up with the demand and we expect to fully meet the demand from the first quarter of 2013 on we will fully meet the 28 nanometer demand. It is also then that we expect that the 28 nanometer gross margin will catch up with the corporate average.
As I said today, both the defect density and use are better than 40 nanometer at the same stage of the volume ramp and they are also better than what we have - what we planned early in the year and what we communicated to our customers at that time.
Now, next a few words on 20 nanometer, 20 SoC. We have made very good progress on the 112 megabit SRAM yield. Now there are still challenges to overcome in meeting our yield plan of the entire chip. We have made very good progress on 112 megabit SRAM, there are still challenges to overcome in meeting our yield plan of the entire chip, which has both the logic and the SRAM on it, of course.
Now, our 20 nanometer SoC, we believe, is fully competitive with industry leaders, other companies' 22 nanometer for the served available markets that we serve. For our markets, we believe our 20 SoC is fully competitive with anyone's 20 nanometer or 22 nanometer offering.
And one important point to make is that our 20 nanometer has the industry's leading metal pitch of 64 nanometers. Our leading competitors have 80 nanometer metal pitch. That allows an advantage in the device's density and die size.
Now, as for the timing, we expect our 20 nanometer technology to be qualified by the end of this year and will be ready to support customers [indiscernible] in Q1 of 2013.
Now today, last time I mentioned that we will have a FinFET product after 20 SoC. And today, I'm glad to say that we have been planning the 16 nanometer FinFET. Right after our 20 nanometer planar [ph] which is the 20 SoC, we will offer FinFET at 16 nanometer for significant active power reduction. We expect to achieve speed and density, speed and logic density levels comparable to industry's leading players 14 nanometer FinFET.
So, we expect our 20 SoC to be competitive with competitors' 22 nanometer or 20 nanometer products and we expect our 16 nanometer FinFET to be competitive with our competitors' 14 nanometer FinFET products. You might ask why are we calling it 16 nanometer? The only reason, in fact, until 2 days ago, we were undecided on whether to call it 14 or 16 FinFET. Now the only reason we decided to call it 16 FinFET is first, we want to be somewhat modest; second, we are told quite a few major customers ask the 16 FinFET, that designation and we didn't want to confuse our customers by now switching it to 14. But we expect it to be competitive with other people's 14 nanometer offerings.
Now 16 nanometer FinFET, our 16 nanometer FinFET, is expected to deliver about 25% speed gain given the same standby power over the 20 nanometer SoC. It is expected to give 25% to 30% power reduction at the same speed and the same standby power, and for mobile products, it is expected to give 15% to 20% speed gain at the same total power. As for timing, we expect it to be about one year after 20 SoC, namely it should be ready for risk production at the end of 2013 or early 2014, about one year later than the 20 SoC.
Now, I want to make some comments about CapEx, capital intensity and growth. I know that several analysts have written about foundry industry's capital intensity and our TSMC's capital intensity and so on and so on. And so, I'm addressing the subject today because I have seen all these reports. I have seen them without agreeing with them obviously - without agreeing with some of them, anyway, there are some that I do agree with.
Now, why are we having such high capital intensity? Now, well, I think this is actually a focus point of our internal discussion among our top level managers for the last 2 years now. And basically, we invest in capacity to get future growth. So you look back at history. If you look at our TSMC history, during '97 and '02, between 1997 and 2002, during that 6-year period, TSMC's capital intensity ratio stayed mostly above 60%, 60% during that 6-year period. And there was, as you recall, there was a high-tech bubble bursting in late 2000 and early 2001. But in spite of that, our revenue CAGR between '97 and '07, here after having spent a lot of capital, having sustained high capital intensity for 6 years, '97 to '02, our revenue CAGR between '97 and '07, that's a 10-year period, was 20%, compounded annual growth rate of 20% in revenue during the 10-year period; the first 6 of which was marked by high capital intensity. During that 1997 to 2007 period, foundry industry growth was 16% in the same period and ours was 20%. As a result, our market share rose from - foundry market share ' rose from 31% in '97 to 43% in '07.
So, when we had those internal discussions about capital and that's really a major focus of our internal discussions, top level managers, I mean, we looked at 4 things. First, are we going to be the technology leader in the capacities that we are investing in? So the first question is, are we going to be the technology leader? The second question we asked ourselves is, are we going to be able to retain our leadership in flexible and responsive manufacturing? So we asked ourselves the question technology, are we going to be the leader; manufacturing, are we going to be the leader? Third question that we asked ourselves are we going to retain the customers' trust, major, major customers' trust or perhaps, are we going to even add customers? And then, the fourth question we asked ourselves is at the price and cost we expect on the new technologies, the capacities at which we are investing in, at the expected cost and price, are we going to be profitable, are we going to be able to make the same kind of money that we have gotten accustomed to? Only if the answers to all 4 questions is yes, only if we are confident in those 4 issues, 4 points, do we start to spend the capital money.
Now, all right, I actually have not made a secret of that, in 2010, I believe late 2010, I told you that 2010 was the first year we started to spend a lot of capital. In late 2010, I told you that our goal was to achieve in the following 5 years, achieve a growth of - I am sorry, a pre-tax income, pre-tax profit growth of 10% CAGR in the 2010 through 2015 period. At that time, which was late 2010, I said that our goal - financial goal was to achieve a 10% pre-tax income growth CAGR and retained or exceed ROE of 20%.
10% pre-tax income growth, 20% ROE, well, that was 2 years ago, 2010. And we have now raised our goals. It is not 10% anymore. Although, the ROE we still keep it at equal or greater than 20% ROE, but the growth - the pre-tax income growth - pre-tax income growth goal is more than 10% now.
I'm not prepared to answer you yet, what it is. But let me assure you that when I say it's more than 10%, I don't mean that it's 10.1%, okay? It's significantly above 10%. And so and we believe that this is not only the right strategy, it is the only strategy. If you want to do well by your shareholders, I believe it's the only strategy.
And as far as this year's CapEx is concerned at this point, we are still following the guidance that we gave you last time; I believe TWD 8 million to TWD 8.5 million. At this point we are still following that. But next year, I am - we are not going to forecast until early next year. But I think I have already given you a view of our reasoning and our strategy and our objectives. So but as to the exact number, I will not give you until early next year.
All right. I believe those - I have finished my prepared comments I believe we are open for questions are we not?",2636

Given the huge amount of demand and growth in the application processor market that we are seeing proliferate in the mobile area, and with competitors scaling up there, manufacturing facilities. I am wondering would help TSMC's efficiencies to start to dedicate some lines or specific fabs to be more product-focused as you go forward in these very high volume businesses or you keep your very large broad based fabs?",122

I think that's almost a natural outcome the way the market is trending. I think that they are going to be larger customers, and now it makes complete sense to dedicate a whole fab to just one customer a whole fab ' 2 whole fabs in fact to just one customer. Now remember, we made our mark in serving many customers. In fact, that's a really part of our secret source of success. The ability to serve many customers to their satisfaction and we'll still we'll retain that capability, but there are customers that are getting bigger and bigger. So it makes sense that we dedicate a whole fab, or even more than a whole fab, to just one customer.
As far as specific products are concerned, well, right now we are already concentrating for instance Taichung will have the vast majority of 28-nanometers, whereas Tainan will have the vast majority of 20 SoC and 16 FinFET. And both those are manufacturing centers are under one manager. Taichung is under one manger. Tainan is under one manager. I don't know whether I've answered your question.",187

I think around TWD 6 billion will be spent on 28-nanometers and the rest just maintenance including R&D. So this year the vast majority of the covenant spending is still on 28 nanometer. But 20-nanometer has already made a significant appearance in CapEx.
Next year, there will still be some capital spending on 28-nanometer, but relatively small and the vast majority will be on 20-nanometer and that spending - that kind of spending, the pace of spending on 20-nanometer will continue into 2015. And then of course, in 2015, the 16-nanometer FinFET will also be making an appearance and fortunately maybe conversion from 20 SoC to 16-FinFET is quite good.
In other words, we don't expect any significant loss in the conversion from 20-nanometer capacity to 16-nanometer capacity.",171

One is that our lead in both technology and manufacturing. I believe is strengthening, had strengthened. Remember, starting in 2010, we didn't just increase CapEx, we also increased R&D. Our R&D - right now R&D is double, double, what it was in 2009. So it was a 2-point plus - back in 2009, 2010. The 2 point plus was to increase both R&D and capital significantly. And R&D is now double what it was in 2009.
At any rate, I believe the region, 2 things behind why we've raised our pre-tax income growth number. One is that we believe that our technology be strengthened. And we have maintained our manufacturing lead which we have had all along and our customer trust lead which we have had all along.
And the other reason of course is that the handheld products, the mobile products, the smartphone and the tablets. I mean that was something that we did not completely foresee in 2010, and in 2010 we did not foresee this mobile products market not as clearly as we do now anyway, now. And so those are the 2 reasons why we raised our goal, well.",201

We've seen Intel recently and several of your customers talk about concerns over the transistor cost at 20-nanometer. It's not falling like it has in previous nodes, at least not their perspective, because of the number of process steps they are increasing at 20-nanometer. I wanted to get your perspective on this. And what do you think this means for the economics of established business model? To what extent, if the costs are going to be rising at 20-nanometer, can these costs be passed on up the supply chain?",98

And now the way we are making it up is by ' our, here, of course, the FinFET does have an advantage at least ultimately. And we're going to the FinFET in 16. But for 20-SoC, we do have the advantage of our denser metal pitch that I've talked about earlier.
The denser metal edge resulted in smaller die and so even though the transistor cost might be higher, but with a smaller die, smaller chip, the economics works out very competitively, that's - it's actually a pretty involved technical calculation, but that's the conclusion. The higher transistors cost, which is mainly because of the higher capital intensity, is compensated by the higher density and that's basically the answer.",149

I can give you one example for this year. You are asking a relationship between depreciating CapEx. For example this year we were planning to spend TWD 8 billion to TWD 8.5 billion and with the depreciation of about a little bit more than TWD 4 billion. So there is some relationship between the 2. But going forward and actually it will depend on when you spend depreciation, when you spend the money, which quarter, on what technology. And we also have some tailwinds are coming down from depreciation. So every year the number is different. So it's very difficult to answer - to give a very simple answer for you question.",120

Three years ago - 2 years ago - 3 years ago - anyway when you talk about competitive landscape, you and I will both think of UMC, et cetera with - at that time Global Foundry emerging. And now you ask me what the competitive landscape is. Competitive landscape is Intel, Samsung, Global Foundry, UMC.
And now 2 or 3 years ago, Global Foundry and the UMC were almost the 2 only ones, and now they are the 2 less important ones. So, all right, you asked me where the competitive landscape is, I think - I already think that you know the answer. I actually read the same thing that you do. Maybe you read even more than I do. Last thing I was reading was - well, I haven't finish reading it and that was Intel's call, the transcripts, I read all those damn transcripts also.
So, yes - well, I think it's a very - a very competitive environment. Very, very competitive. So it's a - our competitors have changed and they are even more powerful and more intimidating than our own competitors, not that we are intimidated. Okay.",201

Oh preparations, well, we have - already had 2 rounds of cost reduction in the last 2 months. The first round was I initiated that, and I made a responsibility of every fab manager and every functional manger of the company. And that's again I guess was about 30 or 40 of them and each of them had a unit, as for cost reduction and the results were compiled and it was a pretty significant round. But just 2 weeks ago I called for another round of cost reduction. Currently, our objective is to keep the gross margin and operating profit margin up as high as possible. So yes, preparations meant lots of cost reduction, cost and expense reduction, COGS and operating expenses reduction.",129

So - and that's mainly the - for the 28-nanometer, of course. So that's the main reason for this 7% growing revenue, but not as high as the bottom-line gross margin. But I believe that's temporary. When we ramped the 28 nanometer to a bigger scale and with the improvement of profitability, I think this issue can be resolved.",79
