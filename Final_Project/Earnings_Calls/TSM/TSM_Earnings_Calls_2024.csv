380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2024",2024-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4943.0,2997286.0,109687585.0,Presenter Speech,Jen-Chau Huang,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and recap of full year 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2024. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% sequentially in NT dollar or 13.6% in U.S. dollars, as our fourth quarter business was supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology. Gross margin decreased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to margin dilution from 3-nanometer ramp. 
Operating margin decreased 0.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.6%, slightly ahead of our guidance, mainly due to operating leverage on higher revenue. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 9.21 and ROE was 28.1%. Now let me move on to revenue by technology. 
The 3-nanometer process technology contributed to 15% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue. 
On a full year basis, 3-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 6% of 2023 wafer revenue, 5-nanometer was 33% and 7-nanometer was 19%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 17% quarter-over-quarter to account for 43% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 27% to account for 43%. IoT decreased 29% to account for 5%. Automotive increased 13% to account for 5%. And DCE decreased 35% to account for 2%. On a full year basis, smartphone, IoT, DCE decreased 8%, 17% and 16%, respectively. HPC remained flat, while automotive increased 15% in 2023. Overall, HPC accounted for 43% of our 2023 revenue; smartphone, 38%; IoT, 8%; and automotive, 6%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.7 trillion or USD 55 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 56 billion, mainly due to the decrease in accounts payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable days decreased 4 days to 31 days, while days of inventory also declined 11 days to 85 days, primarily due to higher 3-nanometer wafer shipment. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 395 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 170 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 78 billion for the first quarter '23 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 154 billion to TWD 1.47 trillion at the end of the quarter.  In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 5.24 billion. 
Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2023. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership enable TSMC to outperform the foundry industry. Our revenue decreased 8.7% in U.S. dollar terms to USD 69 billion or decreased 4.5% in NT terms to TWD 2.16 trillion. Gross margin decreased 5.2 percentage points to 54.4%, mainly reflecting lower overall capacity utilization in 3-nanometer ramp, partially offset by a more favorable foreign exchange rate. 
To extend our technology leadership, we continue to expand our R&D investment in 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development despite a lower revenue base in 2023. Thus, operating margin decreased 6.9 percentage points to 42.6%. Overall, full year EPS declined 17.5% to TWD 32.34 and ROE was 26.2%. On cash flow, we spent USD 30.45 billion or TWD 950 billion in CapEx, while generating TWD 1.7 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD 292 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 292 billion in cash dividends in 2023. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 18 billion and USD 18.8 billion, which represents a 6.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31.1, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our fourth quarter '23 and first quarter '24 profitability. Compared to third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin decreased by 130 basis points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to the margin dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to be flat sequentially at 53% at the midpoint, primarily as a less favorable foreign exchange rate assumption. It's offset by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. 
Looking at full year 2024, given the 6 factors that determine our profitability, there are a few puts and takes I would like to share. On the plus side, we expect our utilization rate to rise in 2024 as our business recovers. However, as we move -- as we have said before, N3 is expected to dilute our gross margin by about 3 to 4 percentage points for the full year of 2024 as the revenue contribution will be much higher than in 2023.
In addition, we have a strategy so that some of our N3 capacity can be supported by N5 tools given the strong multiyear demand. Such a plan will enable higher capital efficiency in the mid to long term, but requires cost and effort in the near term. Most of this conversion will occur in second half of 2024, and we expect it to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in second half of 2024. 
Finally, we have no control over the foreign exchange rate, but that might be another factor in 2024. Long term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. In 2023, we spent USD 30.4 billion, lower than our prior guidance of approximately USD 32 billion, as we continue to tighten up our capital spending where appropriate given the near-term uncertainties. 
In 2024, our capital budget is expected to be between USD 28 billion and USD 32 billion as we continue to invest to support customers' growth. Out of the USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion CapEx for 2024, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for the advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase close to 30% year-over-year in 2024, mainly as we ramp up our 3-nanometer technologies. 
Finally, let me make some comments on our long-term CapEx and cash dividend distribution policy. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. In the past few years, we have sharply increased our CapEx spending in preparation to capture or harvest the growth opportunities from HPC, AI and 5G megatrends.
Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is the target we communicated back in January 2022 Investor Conference. With our 2024 CapEx guidance of USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion, the rate of increase of our capital spending has begun to level off as we capture and harvest the growth. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders.
As a result of our rigorous capital management, in November, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the distribution of a TWD 3.5 per share cash dividend for the third quarter of 2023, up from TWD 3 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward. Third quarter '23 cash dividend will be distributed in April 2024.
In 2023, TSMC's shareholders received a total of TWD 11.25 cash dividend per share, and they will receive at least TWD 13.5 per share cash dividend for 2024. In the next few years, we expect the focus of our cash dividend policy to continue to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share. Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C.",1454
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2024",2024-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4943.0,2997286.0,109687586.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2024 outlook. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications with TSMC as a key enabler. 
In 2023, weakening global macroeconomic conditions and high inflation and interest rate, it's [ upper ] rate and prolonged the global semiconductor inventory adjustment cycle. Concluding 2023, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory industry, declined about 2%, while foundry industry declined about 13% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue declined 8.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. 
Despite the near-term challenges, our technology leadership enable TSMC to outperform the foundry industry in 2023, while we are positioning us to capture the future AI and high-performance computing-related growth opportunities. 
Entering 2024, we forecast fabless semiconductor inventory to have returned to a [ handsome ] level exiting 2023. However, macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties persist, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and the market demand. Having said that, our business has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technologies, strong demand for the 5-nanometer technologies and robust AI-related demand.
Coming off the steep inventory correction and low base of 2023, for the full year of 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase by more than 10% year-over-year, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be approximately 20%. For TSMC, supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we are confident to outperform the foundry industry growth. We expect our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024, and our full year revenue is expected to increase by low to mid-20% in U.S. dollar terms. 
Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress. Our 3-nanometer technology are the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. As a result, almost all the world's smartphone and HPC innovators are working with TSMC and 3-nanometer technologies. Our N3 successfully entered volume production and enjoy a strong ramp in second half '23, accounting for 6% of our total wafer revenue in 2023.
N3E further leverage the strong foundation of N3 to extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield. N3E has already entered volume production in the fourth quarter of 2023. Supported by robust demand from customers in both smartphone and HPC applications, we expect revenue from our 3-nanometer technology to more than triple in 2024 and account for a mid-teens percentage of our total wafer revenue.
We also continue to provide further enhancement of our N3 technology, including N3P and the N3X. With our strategy of continuous enhancements of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multiyear demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Now I will talk about the AI-related demand and our N2 status. The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models as the amount of computation required for training and inference  is increasing.
As a result, AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI. To address insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. 
At the same time, as process technology complexity increase, the engagement lead time with customers also started much earlier. Thus, almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC, and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. 
Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a rent profile similar to N3. As part of our N2 technology platform, we also developed the N2 with backside power rail solution, which is better suited for specific HPC applications based on performance, cost and maturity considerations.
N2 with backside power rail will be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our technology of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the AI-related growth opportunities well into the future. 
Finally, let me talk about our specialty technology strategies at mature node. For TSMC, today, around 70% of our total revenue is 16-nanometer and more advanced node. With rising contribution from 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer technologies in the next several years, this number will only increase. Thus, our mature node exposure is around 20% of our total revenue. 
TSMC's strategy at mature node is to work closely with strategic partner to develop specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. Our focus is to build a high yield capacity for specialty technologies rather than just a nominal capacity. Through the development, deployment of the differentiated specialty technologies, the profitability of our mature nodes can be around our corporate average gross margin. 
Looking ahead, we forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications, and we expect our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple types of specialty technologies. Thus, we are expanding our 28-nanometer specialty manufacturing capacity overseas to support the long-term structural market demand. We believe demand for the differentiated specialty technology will remain steady despite the potential industry capacity increase and our utilization rate and structural profitability and mature node can be well protected in the future. 
This concludes my prepared remarks, and now let me turn the microphone over to Mark.",1072

C. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. 
In today's fractured globalization environment, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase our customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government subsidy or support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders.
Firstly, in Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab in Kumamoto, which will utilize 12- and 16-nanometer and 22- and 28-nanometer process technologies. We will hold an opening ceremony for this fab on February 24, next month, and volume production is on track for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
In Arizona, we are in close and constant communication with the U.S. government on incentive and a tax credit support and making strong progress in facility supply chain infrastructure, utility supply and equipment installation for our first fab. We continue to work closely and develop strong relationships with our local union and trade partners in Arizona, including recently signed an agreement with Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council on a new framework for cooperation. This agreement extends our collaboration across enhanced workforce training and development, shared commitment to site safety, hiring local workers and establishing regular communication. It is a win-win for all parties. 
We are well on track for volume production of N4 or 4-nanometer process technology in first half of '25 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan.
In Europe, we plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications with our joint venture partners. We continue to be in close communication with the German federal, state and city governments and their commitment to this project remain strong and unchanged. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in Q4 2024 this year. 
In Taiwan, of course, we continue to invest in and expand our advanced technology capacities to support our customers' needs and their growth. Given the robust multiyear demand for our 3-nanometer technologies, we are expanding our 3-nanometer capacity in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing our N2 volume production starting in 2025. We plan to build multiple fabs or multiple phases of 2-nanometer technologies in both Hsinchu and Kaohsiung science parks to support the strong structural demand from our customer C. C. just mentioned. 
In Taichung Science Park, the government approval process is ongoing and is also on track. While the initial cost of overseas fab, I previously mentioned, are higher than TSMC's fab in Taiwan, we are confident to manage and minimize the cost gap and remain committed to deliver profitable growth and maximize the value for our shareholders. 
Now let me talk about my retirement. On December 19 last year, I announced that I have decided not to seek nomination of Board members for the next term and will retire from the company after the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting in June. Allow me to say this. Over the past 30 years, I have been incredibly fortunate to be able to work at and contribute to TSMC. 
I started at TSMC 30 years ago as a leader of a small 4-person fab construction team. It has been my privilege to serve as Chairman of TSMC and after our legendary founder, Dr. Morris Chang, over the last 6 years. During this time, we have reaffirmed our commitment to our mission, to be the trusted technology and capacity provider to the global logic IC industry for years to come, while adhering to our core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust.
TSMC's success is predicated on providing the industry's most leading-edge process technology at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, to enable all the innovators to successfully offer their best products to the world. We, together, have worked diligently to enhance our focus on our technology leadership, competitiveness, global manufacturing footprint, digital excellence sustainability and corporate governance to maximize the value for our customers and our shareholders. 
The past 30 years with TSMC has been an extraordinary journey for me, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to our incredible, talented team and all our TSMC's colleagues, whose diligence, dedication and can-do spirit have made the company into what it is today. 
Now TSMC's Nomination, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board has recommended Dr. C. C. Wei to succeed as the company's next Chairman, subject to the election of the incoming Board in June 2024. If Dr. Wei is elected to be Chairman, he should also continue in his current role as CEO, supported by a deep and experienced team of senior executives, many of whom have been with TSMC for many, many years.
As I look ahead to spend more time with my family and starting the next chapter of my life after our AGM in June, I remain fully confident in TSMC's strategy, leadership and execution and firmly believe TSMC will continue to perform outstandingly in the years ahead. Thank you for your trust in TSMC and the best is yet to come for the company and its shareholders.

Allow me to remain seated. I have a some long question to you. So first question is to C. C. I am very curious about your comment about the technology leadership, right, because your competitor and also customer, Intel, states that their PPA is ahead of your 2-nanometer, even the cost is lower. 
So I want to consult your opinion why there's a different story and how do we charge? And given this debate, how TSMC is going to plan the future capacity for this customer and also competitor? We want to seize this opportunity, but also avoid any overexpansion.",112

Thank you, Charlie. Just please allow me for the benefit of the audience here in person and online to summarize your question. So Charlie's first question is around sort of the technology leadership and also our relationship, I guess, our capacity planning with a specific IDM.
So the first part of his question is on the technology part. He notes this IDM says their PPA is ahead of TSMC's 2-nanometer and the costs can be lower, yet we said our technology is industry leading, so how do we reconcile the difference? And also, how do we plan the future capacity planning for such type of customer?",107

Wei,,Executives,8,"Charlie, you named my customer's name. That's my customer and my competitor. Let me repeat the last time when I comment on their technology. The comment stays the same, so that their new technology will be very similar or equivalent to TSMC's N3P. We further checked again with all the specs, all the possible published in the technology, transistor technology and everything. My comment stays the same.
With a big advantage in the technology maturity, because of in 2025, when they say that their new technology will go on production, for TSMC, that will be the third year with a very high volume production in the fabs. So again, I don't want to make too much of a comment on my customers' claim. But let me assure you, we continue to have a technology leadership and we continue to have a broad base of customer. And almost everybody, almost, they are working with TSMC, okay?",155

C. I think C. C. has been very modest. I think he's claimed that our N3P is comparable to their 18A. We still affirm our statement. But I would like you to look at a different perspective. And what C. C. -- what the other side claim might be right, but it's only to their own product. And IDM typically optimize their technology for their own product, where foundry, us, we optimize our technology for our customers' product, so that's a big difference. 
What you use for the high-power server could be very different than what is used with these gadgets on your hands, smartphone or even the large edge AI processors, so you should look at this. I think the time -- compared with PPA, we still affirm our statement. But I think just look at our customers' action, that just tell this -- all the stories.",156

So my question is about the content of your speech in November. The speech was about the TSMC in the era for AI. And you mentioned some very interesting data points. You use the AI technology to improve the defense [ cloudification ]. 
Also, the EUV throughput by, for example, 10%, right? So now it's -- the generative AI can be very big breakthrough in terms of technology. Do you think Samsung or Intel, by leveraging the generative AI, can really break through and catch up your technology? And also before your retirement, any kind of a big unfinished goal or targets for TSMC?",140

Thank you, Charlie. So Charlie's second question is directed to Chairman. He noted in November, Chairman gave a speech where he shared how TSMC has always been utilizing big data, machine learning and AI to improve our operational efficiencies. His question is whether now with generative AI, will this enable or allow our competitors to do the same thing and catch up and narrow the gap. Yes.",68

Thank you, Charlie. The talk I gave in last November was -- the audience is the Taiwan's industry, companies. The purpose I want to give that is I see artificial intelligence can be a great opportunity for the industry in Taiwan. Just like Taiwan is a big country for semiconductor, it can be a big country for artificial intelligence in the future. That's how I encouraged them. 
And as far as the -- whether our competitor are using AI, of course, of course, they use AI. And just look at all the company -- AI company in Silicon Valley or in U.S. That's not a secret. But on the other hand, AI is only in its nascent stage. Only last November, the first large language data is announced, ChatGPT announced. 
We only see the tip of the iceberg. So I want to give the industry an optimistic note that even though 1 nanometer or sub 1 nanometer could be challenging, but we have a new technology capability using AI to accelerate the innovation in science. And that is the -- that is our part, and we have been working on that for many years already.
So we opened -- of course, it's a fair competition. It's no secret. You have another question about one. Well, I still have -- yes, indeed, I will retire in June. And from now to June is a long time. And the company, a lot of thinking happened. And I think -- I hope we definitely execute to C. C.'s forecast of this year. I think by the middle of this year, I think we're pretty sure we can accomplish that.
And of course, C.C. just mentioned, our technology development is on the slew of success. And by June this year, we will know what we are going to fare in 2025. And I give our executive a milestone. I don't want to share with you, but it's going to be very exciting for TSMC. 
And of course, from now on, I simply want to encourage our people in TSMC that the world has changed. Just like you mentioned, we have to use artificial intelligence for future technology. So we will go into global -- we try our global footprint, and we are trying our digital excellence. By digital excellence, you mean we can't count on the hardworking of Taiwan engineer. Only we have to recreate our job to tap their talents and lift up the semiconductor technology engineering to a different level based on what we already have. 
And of course, the corporate governance is one thing I always see in my heart. During this transition, I want every executive and our Board to adhere to the sound corporate governance so that make sure all the process steps is abided by our ethical governance rules. Thank you.",474

I think, as C. C. mentioned, almost every AI chip is working with TSMC. However, the investors' concern is always like the dollar content, as a percentage of customers' cost for AI is a lot lower than smartphone or other chips. So as also C. C. mentioned, that you sell a wafer for your customer, but when you buy it back, it's a lot more expensive. 
So can we expect that the dollar generated by TSMC from AI can be increased in the coming years, whether it's through, like, node migration or advanced packaging or anything we can expect or what kind of rate we can expect for that?",120

Let me summarize Bruce's first question. I think, again, he is around AI related. He notes that basically, almost all the innovators are working with TSMC at AI, but the value per chip that we seem to be capturing is lower than for a smartphone or PC. So his question is that I think can we expect the dollar value captured by TSMC to increase in the next few years? And will this be -- this additional value more come from the front-end process node wafer production? Or will it be through the advanced packaging solutions?",97

Wei,,Executives,18,"Well, let me answer the easiest one first. The revenue come from the front end and back end together. Okay. To capture the value, yes, we are working on it, definitely. But first, let me say that I'm very happy that my customer has been very successful in the AI area, and we are a key enabler for the AI applications.
So far today, everything you saw on the AI came from TSMC, okay? Now here comes the question is that how are we going to capture the value. We are working on it. And actually, we see today, this is at the component total value in the AI. The whole AI data center is a very small percentage a month. If we narrow down the AI's component or the semiconductors' value in the whole system, yes, it's a small percentage. 
But for TSMC, we look at ours here, the AI's a CAGR, that's the growth rate every year, it's about 50%. And we are confident that we can capture more opportunities in the future. So that's what we said that up to 2027, we are going to have high teens of the revenue from a very narrow, we defined the AI application process, not to mention about the networking, not to mention about all others, okay?
And to further extend our value, actually, all the edge device, including smartphone, including the PC, they start to put the AI's application inside. They have some kind of a neural process, for example, so the silicon content will be greatly increased. Although the unit is actually low single digit in CAGR, but the silicon content is more important. So put all together, if we lumpsum all the AI-related application, actually, it's quite a big amount for TSMC to grow.",297

The second question is more for the technology leadership. I mean, as we move into the nanosheet or advanced node, we see another technology divide nowadays. For example, like a high-NA EUV tools. TSMC seems has a different view with other peers. I mean, in the past, like, 20, 30 years, there are several technology divide  that TSMC always choose the right decisions, right? So can you tell us about why you choose your current route comparing to your peers? What is the pros and cons? And what's the advantage? And how confident that TSMC can leverage that to be the key success factor for the leading edge?",109

Bruce's second question is in regards, I think, to technology development and decision-making basically. He notices that today, there's divergence or his words, divide between different companies technology decision, whether to adopt nanosheet transistor structure, whether to adopt high NA tools. He notes that in the past, that this is always occurred in our industry, but TSMC has somehow managed to make the right decision. 
So he is asking, especially how -- what do we look at or evaluate in our decision-making process, what are the pros and cons and advantages, and probably most importantly, how confident are we about our technology decisions going forward, whether nanosheet, high NA given our competitors' actions?",114

Wei,,Executives,22,"Bruce, you asked a very technical question. I'm not very sure everybody knows the high NA or is the nanosheet or gate all around. But let me answer the question. We always make the right decision, and our track record shows that. Is that enough? 
Okay. Let me elaborate a little bit more. Because of technology itself is no value. Only what that can serve your customer. So we always work with our customers to give them the best transistor technology and the best power-efficient technology and at a reasonable cost, okay? And more importantly, the technology maturity that -- in the high-volume production, that's all important. 
Everything. Everything counted together. So we -- every time we know that there are some new structure, new tools such as high-NA EUV, we look at it carefully, look at the maturity of the tools, look at the cost of the tools and look at the schedule of that -- how to achieve it. We always make the right decision at the right moment to serve our customer.
And so far, all our customers are happy with TSMC's progress, okay? Did that answer your question. Almost everybody worked with TSMC on 2-nanometer, except 1.",201

And that's why we have confidence that this AI's revenue will increase.
We only narrowed down to the AI application process, by the way. So we look at ours here, that we prepare the technology and the capacities in both our front end and also back end. And so we -- it's in the early stage so far today. We already see the increase, the momentum. And we expect -- if you guys continue to track this one, the number will increase.

In the downturn, we are forming out at much higher gross margin levels than before. Talk a little bit about what happens when we get back to close to full utilization. So I think we are still running at well below full utilization in 2023. And could you also explain the gross margin dilution that you're expecting in second half '23 because of this capacity conversion? What exactly leads to that gross margin dilution? And is that like a onetime kind of dilution that lasts for a little bit of time and kind of levels off in 2025?",104

Thank you, Gokul. So if I heard correctly, Gokul's second question is around gross margin. So 2 parts to it. Maybe the second part first, which is he is asking, I believe, about this gross margin in the second half of this year, particularly with what Wendell had described. They are planning to convert some of the capacity, the gross margin impact here, and is this a onetime thing? Is this better capital -- what does this mean in the mid- to long-term profitability? That's the first part. And then I'll go to the second one.",97

Second half, the -- as I said, there are 2 negative factors affecting our gross margin this year. The first one is the N3 dilution. N3 volume will be much bigger in the second half than the first half. So the second half impact from N3 dilution will be between 3 to 4 percentage points. 
And also the N5 capacity converted to N3. That will mostly take place in the second half as well. So that will be 1 to 2 percentage points, okay? That's for this year. For the longer term, if you look at these 2 factors, our N3 dilution will gradually reduce, because the profitability will continue to improve or increase in the next several years. 
And N5 converted to N3, it's a onetime short-term impact on profitability, which will bring capital efficiency to us in the middle to long term. And the benefits together will be much bigger than the onetime hit in the short term. So if you're talking about the longer-term profitability, including these 2 factors, plus we're selling our value, our technology value, as C. C. mentioned, we continue to drive down the cost. 
We build our capacity based on the long-term market profile and not the short-term cyclicality and therefore, enable us to have a pretty good utilization. The only thing we are not able to control is foreign exchange rate. So if you put all these together, we still believe that 53% and higher long-term gross margin is achievable.",249

So just to clarify, so given we are much -- at a much lower utilization than normal, what you suggests, Wendell, is that gross margin should get back to the mid- to high 50s once the up cycle starts to gain more momentum, just like what we saw in 2022. Is that a reasonable expectation?",56

Okay. Thank you, Gokul. So Gokul, really, he's asking 53% and higher. Can it be higher? Because, of course, he looks at last year, the utilization was lower, and we still managed to deliver.

Yes. And good luck to both Mark and C. C. as you go through the upcoming transition. I wanted to ask, going back to the question on the IDM. I think, earlier, you conceded that your competitor's process is actually pretty good for -- optimized to their own products. Could you talk about your view on sustainability of the ramp of that IDM outsourcing with your own products in HPC? If you look out over the next 2 to 3 years, if you see that continuing to grow or reversed, or there could be a bit of a cooling off from some of the opportunity you have right in front of you now?",114

If I can ask a follow-up, actually, just through the CapEx, where I think, earlier, you said the rate of increase would slow down. But I think still implying it should increase over time as you grow. If you could discuss -- the CapEx that you guided was flat. Should we think of it as a pause whereas you start to move into 2-nanometer, there should be another wave of increase?
And second part, somewhat related, but curious about the geographic expansion. There's been a lot of press about new fabs in Japan, second fab and potential third advanced fabs. And it feels like the first fab went smoothly. So are you starting to redirect or think more expansion to Japan rather than U.S.? Or potentially both, you have both options as you move to 3-nanometer?",137

That's a lot of questions. So I'm going to take that as your second question, okay, basically. So the first part of it is about the CapEx. He notes that Wendell said the rate of increase is beginning to level off. Randy's question is for this year and take the midpoint, $30 billion is basically flat. So is this just a temporary pause in the CapEx? And with 2-nanometer in the upcoming years, should we expect the dollar amount to go back up? That's the first part.",89

It depends on the different situation. The rate of increase definitely is slower than the past 3 years. And if you look at -- I think the other way of looking at that is the capital intensity. In the past 3 years, the highest point is 2021. So it's going to be -- it was over 50% and then followed by 47% and 43%. And this year, if you do the math, is going to be mid-30s.

I think you -- Japan, the second fab in Japan is in serious evaluation stage. We haven't announced to the public yet. And we're still discussing with the Japan government. Although many -- they are very cooperative, so we might be waiting for that.  But that technology will still be either 7 or 16, 12 technologies. And remember the -- our Kaohsiung fab, the first fab used to be 28-nanometer or 7-nanometer. Now it's becoming 2-nanometer. So that is the shift to -- for the -- if there is a second fab in Japan, that's our current plan. And as far as the...",105

And yes, there will be a gap, at least current planning is '27 or '28, yes. That will be the timeframe. 
To be honest, mostly -- most all the fab in overseas, what's actually being loaded, what technology being set up, really, it's a decision of customers' demand in that area at that timing, so nothing is definitive. But we are trying to optimize the value for the overseas fab for TSMC.",113

So I just have a question about what's your view on the mature node dynamic? And particularly, we are seeing that globally, consider the geopolitical tension. So we are seeing that the fab, all over the place in the world, so do you see that in the longer term, any concern on industry-wise overcapacity? So what's TSMC's strategy? And also, what's your view on your mature node profitability as well? That's my first part.",91

Thank you, Laura. So Laura's first question is on mature node strategy and profitability. She notes, with the geopolitical dynamics, that there's a lot of capacity being built on the mature nodes. So her question is do we see or expect an industry-wide oversupply, and probably more importantly, what is the impact to TSMC's mature node strategy and profitability?",60

Wei,,Executives,58,"Laura, I think your observation is right. There might be too much of a capacity being built right now for mature nodes. So the concern on overcapacity is valid. Now let's talk about the TSMC. As I said, the TSMC increased the mature node capacity for specialty technology, differentiated with others. We work with customers and that kind of capacity, actually, effective capacity as we name it, is with a commitment from customers loading and for the future business.
And because we offer the value for our customer to design their product, so we believe that they can retain their product's value even the capacity is [ broadened ] in the industry. And so long as our customer is doing well, TSMC is doing well. And so the profitability, as I said in my statement, it will be around the corporate average, so we don't have concern.",147

And also my second question is back to AI related. As we know that a lot of investors care a lot about your advanced packaging progress. We also know that TSMC got a very good progress on DDIC SoIC, so can you share with us your progress development beyond CoWos, what's your plan on the DDIC and what's the schedule and the capacity you are aiming for in the next 2, 3 years?",77

Thank you, Laura. So Laura, second question is on advanced packaging. She notes again the strong demand for AI-related applications. So advanced packaging, the progress. Of course, CoWos, demand is very strong. Her question is, really, I think, beyond CoWos, into true 3D IC or integration solutions, such as SoIC. What is the progress that we see the engagement from customers, the capacity and basically the outlook for these segments of the business?",74

Wei,,Executives,62,"The demand actually is very strong. Today's situation, that we cannot offer enough capacity to support our customer, and that condition will continue probably all the way to next year, although we are very -- working very hard to increase the capacity. For example, this year, we are doubling our output,  still not enough. And so we continue to increase for the next year. 
The progress, so far so good because we invested on the advanced packaging technology for more than 10 years, already. So we expect the growth rate for CoWoS for 3D IC or for SoIC per se, it will be more than 50% CAGR in the next few years, at least. And so we are confident that the demand is there. It's TSMC's capability to offer enough capacity to support our customers.",135

Gross margin increased 0.1 percentage point sequentially to 53.1%, mainly reflecting product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange rate. 
Total operating expenses accounted for 11.1% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance, mainly due to tighter expense controls. Thus, operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 42%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 8.7 and ROE was 25.4%. 
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 9% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, whilst 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 19%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 65% of wafer revenue. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 46% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 16% to account for 38%. IoT increased 5% to account for 6%. Automotive remained flat and accounted for 6%, and DCE increased 33% to account for 2%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.9 trillion or USD 60 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 113 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 140 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 44 billion in accounts payable. The increase in accrued liabilities and others was mainly due to the reclassification of the temporary receipt from customers from long-term liabilities. 
Our financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 31 days, while days of inventory increased 5 days to 90 days, primarily due to ramp of 3-nanometer technologies. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 436 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 181 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 78 billion for second quarter 2023 cash dividend. In addition, we raised TWD 23 billion in cash from bond issuances. 
Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 233 billion to TWD 1.7 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $5.77 billion. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality. 
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase and 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.3, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. 
Also, in the second quarter, we will need to accrue the tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be slightly above 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 13% to 14% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 15% to 16% compared to 14.5% in 2023. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on the impact from the April 3 earthquake. On April 3, an earthquake of 7.2 magnitude struck Taiwan, and the maximum magnitude of our fabs was 5. Safety systems and protocols at our fabs were initiated immediately, and all TSMC personnel are safe. 
Based on TSMC's deep experience and capabilities in earthquake response and damage prevention as well as regular disasters drills, the overall tool recovery in our fabs reached more than 70% within the first 10 hours and were fully recovered by the end of the third day. There were no power outages, no structural damage to our fabs, and there's no damage to our critical tools, including all of our EUV lithography tools. 
That being said, a certain number of wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, but we expect most of the lost production to be recovered in the second quarter and, thus, minimum impact to our second quarter revenue. We expect the total impact from the earthquake to reduce our second quarter gross margin by about 50 basis points, mainly due to the losses associated with wafer scraps and material loss.  
Next, let me talk about our first quarter '24 and second quarter '24 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter 2023, our first quarter gross margin slightly increased by 10 basis points sequentially to 53.1%, primarily driven by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to the impact from the earthquake on April 3, as just discussed, and higher electricity cost in Taiwan. 
After last year's 17% electricity price increase from April 1, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 25% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 70 to 80 basis points from our second quarter gross margin. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the impact from higher electricity cost to continue and dilute our gross margin by 60 to 70 basis points. We also expect the higher electricity cost to indirectly lead to higher materials, chemical and gases and other variable costs. 
In addition, we expect our overall business in the second quarter of the year to be stronger than the first half. And the revenue contribution from 3-nanometer technologies is expected to increase as well, which will dilute our gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in second half of '24 as compared to 2 to 3 percentage points in first half of '24.  
Finally, as we have said before, we have a strategy to convert some 5-nanometer tools to support 3-nanometer capacity given the strong multiyear demand. We expect this conversion to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024.  
To manage our profitability in second half 2024, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Longer term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.",1134

Let me repeat the guidance for second quarter again. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality. 
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase or a 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.

Compared to fourth quarter of 2023, our first quarter gross margin slightly increased by 10 basis points sequentially to 53.1%, primarily driven by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to impact from the earthquake on April 3, as just discussed, and higher electricity costs in Taiwan.

Finally, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Our CapEx and capacity planning is always based on long-term market demand profile. We reiterate our 2024 capital budget is expected to be between USD 28 billion and USD 32 billion as we continue to invest to support customers' growth. 
Out of the USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion CapEx for 2024, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making and others.  
Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C.",848
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817745.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I would like to take a moment and make a few remarks. 
On April 3, TSMC experienced a major-scale earthquake of 7.2 magnitude. Our deepest sympathies and heart go out to all those who are affected by this tragedy. I also want to recognize and deeply thank all of our employees and our suppliers for their dedication and hard effort during this time. 
Although it was largest earthquake in Taiwan in the last 25 years, we worked together tirelessly and were able to resume for operation at all our fab within 3 days with minimal disruptions, demonstrating the resilience of our operation in Taiwan. 
Lastly, I would also like to extend our great appreciation to our customers with their understanding and support as we work to recover the lost production during the second quarter.  
Now let me start my prepared remarks with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 18.9 billion, slightly above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the first quarter was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand.  
Moving into second quarter 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality. 
Looking at the full year 2024, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand. We thus expect the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to experience a more mild and gradual recovery in 2024. 
We lowered our forecast for the 2024 overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase by approximately 10% year-over-year, while foundry industry growth is now forecast to be mid- to high-teens percent, both are coming off the steep inventory correction and/or base of 2023. Having said that, we continue to expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC.  
Supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we expect that our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024 and reaffirm our full year revenue to increase by low to mid-20% in U.S. dollar terms.  
Next, I will talk about the strong AI-related demand outlook. The continued surge in AI-related demand supports our already strong conviction that structural demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. 
AI technology is evolving to use ever increasingly complex AI models, which needs to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware. No matter which approach is taken, it requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of our technology position is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technology at scale with a   dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering.  
In summary, our technology leadership enable TSMC to win business and enables our customer to win business in their end market. Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power. We forecast the revenue contribution from several AI processors to more than double this year and account for low-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024. 
For the next 5 years, we forecast it to grow at 50% CAGR and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028. Several AI processors are narrowly defined as GPUs, AI accelerators and CPU's performing, training and inference functions and do not include the networking edge or on-device AI. We expect several AI processors to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years.  
Now let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global IC -- logic IC industry for years to come. Given the strong HPC and AI-related demand, it is strategically important for TSMC to expand our global manufacturing footprint to continue to support our U.S. customers' growth, increase customers' trust and expand our future growth potential.  
In Arizona, we have received the strong commitment and support from our U.S. customers and plan to build 3 fabs, which help to create greater economies of scale. Each of our fab in Arizona will have a clean-room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logical fab. We have made significant progress in our first fab, which has already entered engineering wafer production in April with the N4 process technology. We are well on track for volume production in first half 2025.  
Our second fab has been upgraded to utilize 2-nanometer technologies to support a strong AI-related demand in addition to the previously announced 3-nanometer. We recently completed the [ tapping off ], in which the last steel construction beam was raised into place, and volume production is scheduled to begin in 2028.  
We also recently announced plans to build a third fab in Arizona using 2-nanometer or more advanced technologies, with production beginning by the end of the decade. We are confident that once we begin volume production, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in each of our fab in Arizona as from our fab in Taiwan.  
In Japan, we held an opening ceremony in February in Kumamoto for our first specialty technology fab. This fab will utilize the 12/16 and the 22/28-nanometer process technologies and is on track for volume production in the fourth quarter of this year.  
Together with our JV partners, we also announced a plan to build a second specialty fab in Japan with 40, 12/16 and the 6/7-nanometer process technologies to support a strategic customer for consumer, automotive, industrial and HPC-related applications. Construction is scheduled to begin in second half '24 with production target by the end 2027.  
In Europe, we plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications with our JV partners where construction is scheduled to begin in fourth quarter this year. Our overseas decision are based on our customers' need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. 
In today's fragmented globalization environment, cost will be higher of everyone, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors and the entire semiconductor industry. We plan to manage and minimize the overseas cost gap by, first, pricing strategically to reflect the value of geographic flexibility; second, working closely with government to secure their support; and third, leveraging our fundamental advantage of manufacturing technology leadership and our large-scale manufacturing base, which no other manufacturer in this industry can match. 
Thus, even after factoring in the higher cost of overseas fab, we are confident to deliver a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25% that we have committed to our shareholders. At the same time, TSMC will be the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer in the region that we operate. We are continuing to provide our customers with the most advanced technology at scale to support their growth.  
Finally, I will talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology leads our industry in addressing the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing, and almost all AI innovators are working with TSMC. We are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement at N2 and expect the number of the new tape-outs from 2-nanometer technology in its first 2 years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years.  
Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the nanosheet transistors structure and be the most advanced semiconductor industry technology in both density and energy efficiency. N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the AI-related growth opportunities well into future. 
This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention.",1358

So C. C., you kind of reduced the expectation for the overall semiconductor industry growth. Could you talk a little bit about where is the area where you have seen that slower pickup in demand? I think you talked about smartphone a couple of times in the call. Is it primarily the smartphone area where you've seen a slower pickup in terms of demand?  
And previously, a couple of quarters back, you talked about cannibalization or decline in regular data center demand due to the crowding out of AI and being a drag for TSMC. Do you see that the regular compute, regular data center networking kind of demand is coming back? Or is it still remaining muted and most of the demand uptick is still focused on AI?",135

So he notes that we have lowered our overall semiconductor ex memory growth forecast for this year to approximately 10% and foundry now to mid to high teens. So Gokul wants to understand, in what segments or applications or areas are we seeing a slower pickup in demand?

Wei,,Executives,10,"Well, Gokul, this is C. C. Wei. Let me answer your questions and some of your comment also. Yes, smartphone end-market demand is seeing gradual recovery and not a steep recovery, of course. PC has been bottomed out and the recovery is slower. However, AI-related data center demand is very, very strong. And the traditional server demand is slow, lukewarm. IoT and consumer remain sluggish. Automotive inventory continue to correct, okay? 
What does that mean to TSMC? The budget for a hyperscale player, their wallet share shifted from traditional server to AI server is favorable for TSMC. And we are able to capture most of the semiconductor content in an AI server's area as we define the GPU, [ edge AI ] networking processor, et cetera. Well, we have a lower presence in those CPU-only, CPU-centric traditional server. So we expect our growth will be very healthy. Do I answer your question, Gokul?",153

My second question, just wanted to understand gross margin trends. We talked about 3 to 4 percentage point gross margin dilution from N3 ramp in second half of the year. Should we think that the N3-related gross margin drag is more severe than usual for what we have seen for leading-edge nodes in the past? Or is it largely similar to what we have seen in N5 or N7? 
And when we go to N2, do you think that this will kind of be the similar pattern? Or do you think that the gross margin dilution will be lower when we go to like future process nodes given that N3 seems to be, at least compared to previous cycle, seems to be dragging a little bit more compared to like N5 or N7 in the past few years?",139

Thank you, Gokul. So let me summarize your second question, basically, is on gross margin. Gokul notes that N3, as Wendell said, will dilute our margin by 3 to 4 points, percentage points in the second half. So his question is, it seems that N3, the gross margin dilution or drag is more severe than past nodes such as N5 and N7. Is that the case? And also, of course, with N2 upcoming, will we face a similar pattern? Or what is the margin profile for N2? Which I think Wendell can address, yes.",95
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817757.0,Answer,Jen-Chau Huang,,Executives,16,"Yes, Gokul, it is true that N3 is taking longer time to reach the corporate margin than the other nodes like N5 or N7. N5 or N7 before, it was like 8 to 10 quarters to reach the corporate. But for N3, we think it will take about 10 to 12 quarters. And this is probably because N3 process complexity has increased, and also our corporate average gross margin also increased during the period. 
But another reason is that we set the pricing of N3 very early, several years ahead of production. However, we experienced a lot of cost inflation pressures in the following years. So as a result, N3 will take a longer time than N5 and N7 to reach the corporate average gross margin. For N2, based on what we can see so far is that we are doing a better job in cost and selling our value, and we expect N2 to have a better margin profile than N3.",162

So I think it's clear that AI is producing a large profit pool at your customers. And the HBM is also driving super-normal returns for memory players. So my question is, does TSMC believe they're getting their fair share of the returns in the AI value chain today? And is there scope for TSMC to raise pricing for AI chips in the future?",73

Thank you, Brett. So Brett's first question is looking at the AI-related demand. He notes that AI customers are earning very good returns, HBM and other components as well. So his question is that whether TSMC, do we feel we are earning or capturing our fair value or right value of the returns? And I think on pricing, how would we price for AI basically, I think.

For my follow-up question, I wanted -- yes, that's great, Jeff. And my follow-up question was on the lighting edge nodes at TSMC. And looking at Q1 sales for 12-nanometer and above, your overall revenues for these nodes collectively was off 20% year-on-year, and it's only 35% of your overall sales. Can you maybe share with us whether you see a recovery at all this year at these nodes? And we're seeing a lot of government support in building out new fabs in the U.S. and China around lighting edge nodes. So are you concerned at all about structural overcapacity for the older nodes to the cycle?",108

Thank you, Brett. So Brett's second question is more on the mature nodes. He notes that the demand for our mature nodes, 12-nanometer and older, are down year-over-year. So he wonders sort of what is the outlook for the recovery of mature nodes in the second half of the year. I think that's the first part of his question.",60

Wei,,Executives,24,"Okay. Brett, let me answer this question. First, the mature node demand remains sluggish because of a site. As we just announced it, the whole semiconductor industry is gradually recovering, but not fast enough. So we expect to gradually improve in the second half of 2024. 
As you mentioned that you -- do we have a concern on the overcapacity because of some of the companies, they continue to build a lot of mature node capacity. For us, actually, our strategy at a mature node is work closely with our strategic customers to develop specialty technology solution to meet their requirement. And we create [ an appreciated ] and long-lasting value to customers. So we have less exposed to this possible overcapacity environment. And we believe that our utilization and profitability on mature node can be well protected.",138

C.'s comment about a ramp profile similar to 3-nanometer for 2-nanometer. Could you clarify for the timing of the meaningful revenue ramp for that node? Is the expectation that would be starting early 2026 and ramping up steep through 2026? Or any potential to pull that in? 
And then just a second question on that is you noted that tape-outs are higher. Would there be potential with higher tape-outs in 3 and 5 for either steeper or it ramps to be larger than the prior nodes once underway or looking out a couple of years?",105
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817770.0,Answer,Jeff Su,,Executives,29,"Okay. So Randy's first question is around 2-nanometer. So his first question is to C. C. with that we said that the N2 ramp profile will be similar to N3. We also said, of course, the production begins in 2025. So his question partly is, when do we expect to see the revenue contribution, meaningful revenue contribution from N2? And then also that with N2, the tape-outs being higher, what is the multiyear opportunity or contribution from N2 maybe in terms of the revenue as compared to N3 or other nodes?",91
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817771.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,30,"Randy, the N2's ramp profile we say is very similar to N3 because of, look at the cycle time, we start the N2 production in the second half of 2025, actually in the last quarter of 2025. And because of the cycle time and all the kind of back-end process, and so we expect the meaningful revenue will start from the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2026. That's what we mean that is the profile is very similar to N3.
Now your second question is there have been a lot of engagement and the tape-out will be higher, and do we see a very steep kind of a production? Well, we do expect that, but let me say again, N2 is a very complicated work or a very complex technology node. So my customer, they also take a little bit longer time to prepare for the tape-out. So that's why they all engage with TSMC in the early stage. And -- but for their product ramp-up, they will have their own product road map and their own business consideration. However, we still say that N2 will be a very, very big node for TSMC. 
Randy, does that answer your question?",207

Great. No, that's helpful color. Yes. Yes, it does. No, helpful color. My second question is just relating to the upward expectations you gave for the AI accelerators. Curious how that ties to how you're looking at the CapEx, if you say that we're entering either higher growth or investment cycle, where capital intensity could need to rise up above that mid-30s range that you set or at least in absolute dollars from the $30 billion this year, we should start growing or thinking about CapEx at least growing with revenue.",92

Randy, for TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditure is always correlated with higher growth opportunity in the following years. We work with our customers closely, and our CapEx and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile that is underpinned by the multiyear megatrends.

The capital intensity, in the past few years, it was high as we invested heavily to meet the strong customer demand. Now the increase -- the rate of increase for the CapEx is leveling off.

I think another caller also addressed this topic, but I want to go a little bit deeper. Because given all the efforts you made, right, and also ongoing cost challenge made at the coming U.S. fab, electricity cost hike, I'm not sure if you can give investors kind of a range about a potential price adjustment or kind of the value you're going to sell to your customers.
Based on our back testing, I think based on your revenue and shipments in 2022 and 2023, we calculate your price hike could be around 10% in 2022 and the price hike of 5% in 2023. So C. C., I'm not sure whether you are planning to hike price in this kind of a range or magnitude for 2025, so we can be comfortable you can achieve the 53% gross margin in 2025.",150

So Charlie's first question is about TSMC's pricing strategy. He notes that TSMC, of course, makes a lot of efforts to deliver technology leadership and manufacturing excellence to our customers, but we also face a lot of cost challenges, whether from electricity price hikes or the higher cost of overseas fabs. So his question is, number one, I guess, what is our intention about pricing strategy to sell our value; and then, number two, he would like to know what percentage range, if any?",85
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817786.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,45,"Okay, Charlie, this is C. C. Wei. First, I would like to emphasize again this kind of a pricing strategy is very confidential and totally between TSMC and the customer. However, let me expand a little bit, we do encounter some kind of higher cost in the overseas or even recently, the inflation and the electricity. We expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers. 
And as I said, for the overseas fab, we want to share our value, which also includes the flexibility of [ geopolitical ] location or something like that. If my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC and the customer had to share the incremental cost. 
Charlie, did I answer your question?",134

I think passing through some cost or all the cost to -- incremental cost to customers should be fair, especially you are creating lots of value to your customers. 
And my second question is about AI. I know the -- your cost capacity has been very tight, very strategic. But I'm wondering how you're going to judge the demand and allocate the capacity to all the different type of AI semi customers. Because we're hearing your major customer is demanding for 2x capacity next year. 
So I'm wondering how you're going to allocate, so I mean, will you still reserve a certain percentage for some smaller or strategic customers no matter if it's ASIC or smaller GPU vendors? So what is the kind of benchmark you're going to allocate those capacity to customers? And are you okay with that if your major customers' demand cannot be fulfilled by you? Are you okay to give out or do some market share to some of your industry competitors?",173

So Charlie's second question is around, I guess, basically, our advanced packaging and more specifically, CoWoS. And he, of course, notes that the CoWoS capacity, the demand is very strong today and also into 2025. So the capacity is very tight. 
So his question is, how does TSMC decide on how to allocate the capacity to customers, where we have large customers, but will we reserve capacity to support smaller customers as well? And then lastly, would we be okay if customers want to use somebody else, so to speak? So several parts to this question.",97

Wei,,Executives,48,"Charlie, let me say it again, the demand is very, very strong, and we have done our best where we put all the effort to increase the capacity. It's probably more than double this year as compared with last year. However, it's still not enough to meet the customers' demand, and we leverage our OSAT partners to complement of TSMC's capacity to fulfill our customers' need. 
Still not enough, of course. But in my mind, my first priority is to make our customer to be successful, no matter which one. And of course, the long-term partners will have a better cooperation with TSMC in terms of technology and processing complexity, so much easier to be ramped up. 
However, no matter what, let me say again, the demand is very high, extremely high. And we do our best to increase the capacity to alleviate the shortage. We also leverage the OSAT partners. We want to make sure that all our customers get supported, probably not enough this year; but for next year, we try, we try very hard.

But my customers are working with TSMC for the next node. Even for the next, next node, they have to move fast because, as I said, the power consumption has to be considered in the AI data center. So the energy-efficient is fairly important. So our 3-nanometer is much better than the 5-nanometer. And again, it will be improved in the 2-nanometer.

So my second question is for dividends. We do see very strong free cash flow in the first quarter. And the capital intensity, as Wendell mentioned, is stabilizing. And we even started to pay a huge amount of return in tax. So do we -- can we turn more aggressive in terms of dividends? The current dividend level is much, much lower than 70% of free cash flow in the back-of-envelope calculation. So can we expect to see more dividends in the coming quarters?",86

Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question is on the cash dividend policy. He notes that in the first quarter, we're generating very, very strong free cash flow. As we have said, the capital intensity is beginning to stabilize and also that we are paying a very high retained earnings tax. So his question, I think, is, what is the outlook? Can we pay more dividends in the coming quarters? Or what should investors expect?",76

Bruce, the -- our dividend policy is, in principle, to pay 70% of our free cash flow in a year as cash dividends. So I would not just look at quarterly cash, free cash flow to make a judgment. But indeed, as we said before, now that we're harvesting the heavy investment that we did in the past few years, we expect our dividend policy to switch to steadily increasing from the sustainable in the past few years.",79

Thank you, Laura. So Laura's first question is on AI, but more specifically edge or what we call on-device AI. She notes that there's AI being added to smartphones and also AI for PCs. It's quite topical. So she wants to know how do we see this trend, more importantly, what is the implication to TSMC. Is that correct, Laura?",61

Wei,,Executives,68,"Okay, Laura. Let me answer the question. The edge AI or the on-device AI, the first order of magnitude is the die size. We saw without the AI -- with the AI for neuroprocessor inside. The die size will be increased, okay? That's the first we observed. And it's happening. 
And then for the future, I would think that replacement cycle for smartphone or for those kind of a PC will be accelerated a little bit in the future, at least. It's not happening yet, but we do expect that it will happen soon. And all in all, I would say that on-device AI will be very positive for TSMC because we capture the larger share of the market. 
Did I answer the question, Laura?",125

And so in that case -- yes, very helpful. So in that case, can we expect that our demand -- and see, because now it's still mostly on the smartphone or mobile. So can we expect that N3's revenue contribution in second half or next year will be bigger, say, like a 20% plus in the second half of this year?",62

So well, Laura's follow-on to the first question is then should we expect that N3 demand in the second half or into 2025. Sorry, I didn't catch the exact percentage, but a large percentage or significantly larger than it is today. Is that correct, Laura?",46

Wei,,Executives,72,"Okay. Certainly, as I said, we expect to happen at a larger die size. As I said, we already observed that. And for the replacement cycle to be accelerated, it will happen, but I cannot give you a definite number because of -- it's too early to predict in 2025.

That's very clear. My second question is about, again, advanced packaging. We know that TSMC is working on the 3DIC for many years. So I'm just wondering that what's the current progress?

Wei,,Executives,76,"Wow, you asked a very technical question about the TSV and the hybrid bonding. It's all together. The 3DIC's packaging technology is very complicated, and our customers start to adopt it. Not a big volume yet, but we expect it to start to grow from this year. 
How big it will be? It's hard to say, but I think it is a trend. Whether it is a micro-bumping or it's a hybrid connection, that it depends on the customer's product requirement.",81

But what I was wondering, considering the strong demand for AI chips and a recovery in smartphones, is there a scenario in which you would consider similar conversions from some of your older nodes such as N7 given that utilization and revenues there are still well below peak levels?",66

So Rolf's first question is about our tool commonality and conversion. He notes that we have already said we are converting some of the capacity -- using some of the N5 tools to support the strong multiyear demand for N3 for AI-related and such. His question is that given our 7-nanometer is still underutilized, will we also consider converting 7-nanometer tools to support more leading-edge stronger demand?",68
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2024",2024-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5845.0,3087823.0,111817826.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,85,"Well, let me answer this question. We can convert one technology node capacity to the next one is because of our GI's physical advantage, meaning, let me give you one example, our 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer are adjacent to each other, the fabs, and they are all connected. So it's much easier for TSMC to convert from 5 to 3. And that doesn't mean that every node can do the same. That's one. 
And your question about the N7 converted to N5, presumably. No, because we expect the N7 in the next couple of years, it will pick up, the demand will pick up again. And you want repeat -- probably repeat the same kind of experience we have in 28-nanometer. So today, no, we don't have any solid plan to convert the N7 into N5.",135

So Mehdi's first question is about our revenue outlook and guidance. His question is saying we have a nice upside to our revenue in the first half of this year, but we have kept the full year guidance in to grow low to mid-20s.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter 2024.
Second quarter revenue increased 13.6% sequentially in NT or 10.3% in U.S. dollars, as our business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3- and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by the continued smartphone seasonality. Gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 53.2%, mainly reflecting cost improvement and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin dilution from N3 ramp. Due to the operating leverage, total operating expense accounted for 10.5% of net revenue as compared to 11.1% in the first quarter. Thus, operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points sequentially to 42.5%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 9.56 and ROE 26.7%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 15% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17%, respectively. Advanced technology, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 28% quarter-over-quarter to account for 52% of our second quarter revenue, surpassing 50% for the first time. Smartphone decreased 1% to account for 33%. IoT increased 6% to account for 6%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 5% and DCE increased 20% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 2 trillion or USD 63 billion. 
On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 23 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 16 billion in the accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 9 billion mainly as we raised TWD 12 billion in corporate bonds. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased by 3 days to 28 days. Days of inventory decreased by 7 days to 83 days, primarily due to higher N3 wafer shipment. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 378 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 206 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 91 billion for third quarter '23 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 101 billion to TWD 1.8 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 6.36 billion. 
I finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 22.4 billion and USD 23.2 billion, which represents a 9.5% sequential increase or 32% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.5, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 42.5% and 44.5%. This concludes my financial presentations. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our second quarter '24 and third quarter '24 profitability. Our second quarter gross margin was 53.2%, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, mainly as we saw a higher-than-expected overall capacity utilization rate as compared to our forecast 3 months ago. We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to increase by 1.3 percentage points to 54.5% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to the higher overall capacity utilization rate in the third quarter and better cost improvement efforts, including productivity gains, partially offset by continued dilution from N3 ramp-up, N5 to N3 tool conversion costs and higher electricity prices in Taiwan. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over and factoring in the margin impact from our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years, and our CapEx and capacity planning is always based on the long-term market demand profile. As the strong structural AI-related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. We are narrowing the range of our 2024 capital budget to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion as compared to USD 28 million to USD 32 billion previously. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mass-making and others. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with the higher growth opportunities in the following years. Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C.",806
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2024",2024-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4278.0,3191776.0,113887360.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of USD 20.8 billion, above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, particularly offset by continuous smartphone seasonalities. Moving into third quarter 2024. We expect our business to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies. 
Looking at the full year 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory to increase by about 10%, which is unchanged from our forecast 3 months ago. At this time, we would like to expand our original definition of foundry industry to foundry 2.0, which also includes packaging, testing, mass-making and others and all IDM, excluding memory manufacturings. We believe this new definition better reflects TSMC's expanding addressable market opportunities in the future. However, I want to emphasize here that TSMC will only focus on the most advanced back-end technologies which help our customers in leading-edge product. Under this new definition, the size of the foundry industry was close to USD 250 billion in 2023 as compared to USD 115 billion under the previous definition. 
With our new definition, we forecast the foundry industry growth to be close to 10% year-over-year in 2024. TSMC's share of the foundry industry under our new definition was 28% in 2023, supported by our strong technology leadership and broader customer base, we expect this one to further increase in 2024. Over the past 3 months, we have observed strong AI and high-end smartphone-related demand from our customers as compared to 3 months ago, leading to increasing overall capacity utilization rate for our leading edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer process technologies in the half of 2024, thus we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong growth year for TSMC. We are raising our full year guidance and now expect our 2024 revenue to increase slightly above mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. 
Next, I will talk about TSMC's capacity planning process and investment disciplines. This is important especially when we have such high forecasted demand from AI-related business. TSMC's ambition is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. The continued surge in AI-related demand supports a strong structural demand for energy-efficient computing. As a key enabler of AI applications, the value of our technology position is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technology at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. As such, TSMC employs a disciplined framework to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile underpinned by the industry megatrend of AI, HPC and 5G. We work closely with our customers to plan our capacity. 
We also have a rigorous and [ rollout ] system that evaluates and judges market demand from both a top-down and bottom-up approach to determine the appropriate capacity to build. Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines, that is technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning a sustainable and healthy return. To ensure a proper return from our investment, both pricing and costs are important. TSMC's pricing strategy is strategic, not opportunistic to reflect the value that we provide. Today, we are investing heavily in leading-edge, specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support our customers' growth and enable their success. If customers do well, TSMC should do well. 
For example, we are happy to see many of our customers structure profitability improving in these past few years. At the same time, we faced rising cost challenges due to increasing project complexity, a leading node, higher electricity costs in Taiwan, global fab expansion in higher cost regions and other cost inflation challenges. And therefore, we will continue to work closely with our customers to see our value. We will also work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost performance. We believe such actions will help TSMC earn a sustainable and healthy return so that we can continue to invest in technology and capacity to support our customers' growth and fulfill our mission as a trusted foundry partner while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders.
Finally, I'll talk about our N2 status and A16 introduction. Our 2-nanometer and A16 technologies, this is an industry in addressing the sensible need for energy-efficient computing and almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC. We expect the number of the new tape-outs for 2-nanometer technologies in its first 2 years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years. N2 deliver full node performance and power benefit which 10 to 15 speed improvement at the same power or 25% to 30% power improvement at the same speed and more than 15% chip density increase as compared with N3E. 
N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track, all ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, we also introduced N2P as an extension of our N2 family. N2P features a further 5% performance with -- at the same power or 5% to 10% power benefit at the same speed on top of N2. N2P will support both smartphone and HPC applications and volume production is scheduled for the second half 2026.
We also introduced A16 as our next nano chip-based technology, featuring super power rail or SPR, as a separate offering. TSMC's SPR is innovative, best-in-class backside power delivery solution that is the first in the industry to incorporate a novel backside contact scheme to preserve gate density and device with flexibility. Compared with N2P, A16 provides a further 8% to 10% speed improvement at the same power or 15% to 20% power improvement at the same speed and additional 7% to 10% chip density gain. A16 is best suited for specific HPC product with complex signal route and dense power delivery network. Volume production is scheduled for second half 2026. We believe N2, N2P, A16 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the growth opportunities well into the future. This concludes our key messages, and thank you for your attention.",1062

Just on AI accelerator and related capacity both front end and advanced packaging, clearly, every customer is queuing up at TSMC for capacity. I think last time we talked about this maybe a couple of quarters back, C. C., you mentioned we expect to see supply to kind of reach balance -- supply/demand to reach balance by end of this year. Just wanted to see what is your current remark. How do you think about supply/demand balance for AI accelerator and CoWoS advanced packaging capacity? And I think in your symposium, you talked about 60% CAGR, compounded growth for CoWoS capacity in the next 4, 5 years. Could you talk a little bit about how much capacity for CoWoS would you be planning to build next year as well? Like last year, you said you're going to be doubling the capacity this year. Now that we are in the middle of this year, maybe can we get a view on what is the capacity expansion for next year? That's my first question.",187

All right. For the benefit of the audience online and in person, please allow me to kind of try to summarize your question. So Gokul's question, first of all, he understands and appreciates TSMC's disciplined framework in terms of looking at how to build capacity. His question is that it seems that everyone today, AI accelerators and advanced packaging is queuing at TSMC to ask for capacity. So his question is, when do we, C. C., expect supply/demand to reach a balance both for the accelerator side? And then for the CoWoS. At the symposium, we said CoWoS capacity will grow at a 60% CAGR the next few years. He also wants to know what are we planning to build or increase for 2025 CoWoS.",127

Wei,,Executives,7,"Gokul, I also tried to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot today. The demand is so high. I had to work very hard to meet by customers demand. We continue to increase. I hope sometime in 2025 or 2026, I can reach the balance. You're talking about the CAGR of gross increase of the CoWoS capacity. Now it's out of my mind. I mean we continue to increase whatever, wherever, whatever I can, okay? The supply continues to be very tight all the way to probably 2025 and hope it can be eased in 2026. That's today's situation.",101

Wei,,Executives,9,"The last time I say that this year, I doubled it, right, more than double, okay? So next year, if I say double it, probably, I will answer your question again next year, and say more than double, okay? We're working very hard, as I said, wherever we can, whenever we can.",52

I think second half guidance already seems to be better than what originally we were thinking that gross margin could drop in second half, but looks like it's actually going up. And it looks like a lot of the headwinds on gross margin is coming in this year. So how should we think about gross margin looking forward for TSMC? Are we going to get back to the high 50%, 60% gross margin that we saw in 2022, given that you got -- you're selling more of your value, you have some of the N3 tailwinds in terms of yield improvement coming through? Into that, I will also ask how should we think about impact of subsidies and ITC credits as you start ramping your overseas locations? How does that impact cost and gross margin? Because there's also some subsidies coming in and currently, TSMC is mostly talking about gross CapEx and gross spend.",161
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2024",2024-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4278.0,3191776.0,113887369.0,Answer,Jeff Su,,Executives,11,"Okay. So let me summarize Gokul's second question is around gross margin and profitability. He notes second half '24 gross margin seems to be better than the expectation. So his question is really, how should we think about gross margin in the next several years? He notes as we said, we will sell our value and the dilution of N3 will gradually reduce. So where can the gross margins go back to a high 50s or 60% that kind of level that we saw a few years ago in 2022. Maybe that's the first part of his second question. I'll stop here, then I'll get to the second.",108

Gokul, let me share with you some of the puts and takes on gross margin 2025 and a little bit beyond that. You already talked -- there are positives and there are negatives. You already mentioned a positive will be a decrease in dilution from N3. We're selling our value, and we continue to drive down our costs, increase the productivity. That is -- we are very good at that. On the other hand, let's use N5 conversion to N3 as an example. We are not ruling out the possibility of further converting more N5 to N3 because we're seeing very strong demand for N3 if we decided to do that, of course, there will be a negative impact on the year that we do that. But in the future years, that will be beneficial. 
We continue to face cost challenges, inflation cost challenges, including electricity prices, et cetera. And also, we are beginning the production overseas fab, 2 overseas fabs next year. the Phase 1 of Arizona fab and Phase 1 of the Kumamoto fab. We expect that the overseas fabs will dilute our gross margins by between 2 to 3 percentage points next year and in the next several years. So those are the puts and takes to give you the concept. However, we've taken all that into considerations with our efforts in managing cost fab especially between the overseas fab in Taiwan, we're repeating and confident to say that 53% and higher gross margin is achievable. So I think that's the first part of your question.",260

When this fab begins to production, the P&L impact will come in. So generally speaking, it's like that. Different government has different approach in providing the grants. So that's a different story. But you can look at our financial statements, there will be actual subsidy received in the period of previous quarter and previous year. For example, 2023, we received a total subsidies of slightly higher than USD 1.5 billion equivalent, and we received that mainly in Japan. Yes.",110

So Mr. Donald Trump talked about maybe a few years ago, right, Taiwan/TSMC took 100% chip business from U.S.. So congrats on the bounce back pretty high market share. However, the concern is growing, right, that the U.S. continues to depend on our Tainan, TSMC and the chip production. So our question is for shareholders, right, how TSMC is going to mitigate this potential geopolitical risk? For example, whether you are going to further expand your U.S. capacity or even share the ownership, right, with the U.S. government? And maybe a technical question to Wendell, for today, right, if we are shipping a chip to the U.S. customers, do we need to pay for the U.S. tariff?",133

Sorry. So Charlie's second question is around sort of overseas expansion and geopolitical risk. He notes the comments from former President Trump a few days ago that Taiwan semiconductor has taken 100% of the business. So his question is really how does TSMC plan to mitigate the geopolitical risk? Does this include expanding capacity overseas, particularly in the U.S.? Would we consider -- I think part of his question was some JV or joint investments, whether with government or whether with partners. And the last question, I think, was more for Wendell about the tax or the tariffs, so to speak.",102

I mean TSMC has been saying for selling your value for past couple of quarters without changing the margin target, i.e., most likely you are passing through all the costs. But please, I can recall in 2021, I mean, TSMC do raise the gross margin target by then because to support the future growth with more R&D, as the technology continues to be enhanced and more difficult and one of your customers and this is supportive that to suggest that you should charge even more. So my question is that why is that you don't raise your gross margin target when you are trying your -- when you try to sell your value, which we believe we deserve much higher value.",139

So thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's first question is about profitability and value. Bruce seems to agree that TSMC is providing value to our customers. He also notes in 2021, indeed, a few years ago, our gross margin target, long-term gross margin target was about 50%, and we're able to increase that to 53% and higher. So his question is really with everything that is going on today with the value of our technology, enabling our customers more and more, why doesn't TSMC increase or revise up our long-term gross margin target from the current 53% and higher? Is that the essence?",103

My next question is for advanced packaging. So management used to mention that Advanced Packaging margin was lower than the corporate average, but with higher ROEs. But given the recent progress for the CoWoS and everything, do we see a much better profitability for the CoWoS? And given that it's so difficult to expand the capacity, are you planning to work with more partners to increase your CoWoS supply, which will solve your current supply and demand issues?",79

Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question is around advanced packaging. Part of it is in terms of the profitability. He notes we used to say, which is true, it's lower than the corporate average profitability but can earn a similar return or ROE, but his question is now with more and more CoWoS demand and greater scale is the profitability of advanced packaging, I think, approaching or at or above the corporate average? And also, given the tight supply, would we consider to work with more partners to help increase the capacity for CoWoS to support our customers' growth.",101

Wei,,Executives,36,"You are right, for advanced packaging, the gross margin used to be much lower than the corporate average. Now it's approaching corporate average. We are improving it that's because of scale of the economics, and we put a lot of effort to reduce our cost. So gross margin is greatly improving in these 2 years. As for the working with OSAT partners, yes, we are doing it because of -- I just answered the question whether the CoWoS capacity is enough or not? Is not enough. And in great shortage, and that limited my customers' growth. So we are working with our OSAT partner and trying to give more capacity to my customer so that they can grow here. And so the TSMC's wafer can be sold here. Okay.",129

My question was really about your capacity plans for the next nodes at N2, including A16. We're hearing that AI chipmakers are looking to migrate more aggressively from N-1 to the leading edge, particularly due to backside power because they're trying to lower their power budgets going forward. So my question, can you support this move? And if so, should we be expecting N2, A16 to be structurally a much bigger node than we've seen in the past few nodes?",81

Brett, thank you. So Brett's first question is on capacity planning, particularly at the leading-edge N2 and A16. So he notes rightly that AI customers are migrating aggressively from N-1 in the past to the most leading node. He notes particularly A16 driven by the interest in backside power. So his question is can we support this move in terms of capacity to support the customers and also whether thus N2 and A16 will be a much bigger node than our notes in the past?",86

And so they are looking for the more advanced technology so that they can save power consumption. And so a lot of my customers want to move into N2, N2P, A16 quickly. We are working very hard to build the capacity to support them. Today, it's a little bit tight, not a little bit, actually, today is very tight. I hope in next year or the next 2 years, we can build enough capacity to support this kind of demand. Today, yes, we are working hard to support them. And enough?

Yes, that's great. My follow-up question was for Wendell. I wanted to just dig into the gross margin dilution from N3, where is that at today? And does the introduction of N3E structurally improve your N3 returns? I guess N3 is less capital intensive. There's less EUV layers, so I'm keen to understand that this drives better economics for TSMC, particularly as you start to ramp more N3 capacity in the second half of this year?",77

Thanks, Brett. So Brett's second question is on the gross margin dilution from N3. He notes that N3E uses less EUV layers, less capital intensity.

Wendell, I think I heard you talking about that potentially more imply to N3 conversion. Maybe beyond what you're trying to do right now, the conversion. I just want to understand the overall philosophy here because I think in the past, the TSMC does do this node-to-node conversion quite actively, let's say, 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer, and probably even earlier 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer. And I think you told us basically treat 10 and 7 as 1 large node, 20 and 16 as 1 large node. Should we start to really think about maybe 5 and 3 are just 1 big node and maybe more conversion -- we should think about more of the N3 capacity growth will come from conversion going forward less from the greenfield investment? That's the first question.",139

So Charles' first question is really look at our conversion strategy. He notes that we have always talked about building in tool commonality to provide us flexibility. We have done so in the past at certain nodes like 20 and 16, 10 and 7. So his question is really we have said that we potentially convert more N5 tools to support the strong demand for N3 capacity. So his question is should we, investors, analysts start to think about N5 and N3 as 1 big node.",88

You mentioned about 12 and 16, they are a big family. 7 and 10 are a big family. But 5 and 3 are not a big family in our definitions. At the same time, there are node-to-node tool commonality in TSMC is pretty high. So for 5 and 3, the commonality of tools is over 90%, and these 2 nodes are adjacent. They're all in Tainan Science Park. And so it's very easy to do the conversions. Did I answer your questions?",84

I think I heard C. C., you said maybe there's some technical difficulty on my side. I just want to clarify, maybe you may double the CoWoS capacity again in 2025. But a little bit more technical question I do want to better understand the technology constraints because your customers seems to be migrating from CoWoS-S to the more advanced version CoWoS-L, CoWoS-R and we learned that CoWoS L, R does not require TSV, does not require a large silicon interposer, does that help at least to some degree, the capacity constraints you're facing on overall CoWoS? And does that help maybe to achieve that goal of maybe getting to the supply/demand balance some point in 2025, 2026? That's a two-part question.",127

So Charles' question is really on CoWoS. First, he would like to clarify, we said that CoWoS capacity is more than doubling in 2024. He said, did we say, is he correct to understand, we said it will double again in 2025. That's the first clarification. And then he would like to know as customers migrate from CoWoS-S to CoWoS-L and CoWoS-R solution, a lot of technical challenges or benefits -- changes, sorry, not challenges. Does it help alleviate the capacity constraints? And would that allow CoWoS to reach supply/demand balance in 2025? So one to clarify and one on the different solutions.",105

Wei,,Executives,55,"Well, all right. Charles, you really know all the details of the technology. The CoWoS-R, CoWoS-S, CoWoS-L blah, blah, blah. All these kind of things because of our customers' requirement. So even the same customer, they have different approaches for their different products. When I say that we doubled the capacity, this is summing all the different version of the CoWoS together. Which portion is really double which portion is much more than the other one, I'm not going to share with you because this is related to my customers' demand. So from last year to this year, we have more than doubled. And as I said, from this year to next year, we want to double again or probably we want to more than double again. But still, I have to work with our OSAT partner to increase the overall supply to support my customer. Whether that this kind of different version of the CoWoS will give me some flexibility today, yes, and no, because different version has a different tool set. But in common, some of the tools can be used by all the CoWoS, okay, but different versions have like a different demand.",196

I remember C. C., you mentioned earlier that every clients are now engaged with you on the 2-nanometer's migration. So I'm just wondering that when we enter in maybe 2026, the third -- the second year, can we expect that the revenue contribution initially will be larger than what we had comparing to N3?

And also my second question is also on the packaging side. So we know that last time we also discussed an edge AI will also benefit for TSMC in terms of the advanced nodes, the dye areas. Just wondering that do you also see your edge AI device clients they are moving to 3DIC or SoIC anytime in the next 2 years? Or before that happening, can we expect more clients on the smartphone side, they will also adapt maybe info first.

So Laura's second question is very specific, but again, in regards to advanced packaging with more and more customers working on edge AI devices without -- well, being overly specific, but what does it mean or the implication for advanced packaging solutions that we expect in the next 2 years to see these edge AI customers start to use SoIC or 3DIC particularly smartphone? Will they still be using info? Or will they also consider these solutions as well. Is that correct, Laura? Okay.",85

So once you use your chiplets, you have to use in advanced packaging technologies. On the edge AI, for those kind of smartphone customer, as compared with the HPC customers, HPC is moving faster because of bandwidth concerns, latency of footprint or all those kind of thing.

And then for silicon content, recall a few years back when 5G just started to ramp you used to provide the silicon content expectations of 5G high-end and mid-end and low-end smartphones, so I wonder at this point of time, if you have any estimates for AI for smartphone going to next 2, 3 years?",130

Several parts to Sunny's first question. She's looking at smartphone and PC. So the first part is she wants to know in terms of unit in silicon content, what is our expectation for smartphone and PCs in the next few years? N5 and N3 supply is very tight in terms of the capacity. Can -- do we have enough capacity to support a potential unit or upgrade cycle? And last but not least, she's asking us to quantify the silicon content per device per segment from edge AI.",89

Wei,,Executives,67,"That's a very long question. But let me answer the content first. AI is so hard. So that's right now everybody -- all my customers want to put the AI functionality into the edge devices and so the dye size will be increased, okay? How much? I mean it's different from my customer-to-customers product. But basically, probably 5% to 10% dye size increase will be a general rule. Unit growth, not yet, okay? Because we did not see kind of unit growth suddenly increased, but we expect this AI functionality was stimulated some of the demand to stimulate the replacement to be shorter. So in terms of unit growth that in a few years later, probably 2 years later, you will start to see a big increase in the edge device that's a smartphone and the PC.",138

Wei,,Executives,69,"That's the one I tried to avoid the answer. It's very, very tight, and we are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support my customer from now all the way to next year to 2026.",39

If we look back in 2021 or early 2022, back then demand was also pretty high. Customers were very aggressive on the demand forecast. Now looking at GenAI, obviously, the technology has lots of great potential, but a new technology also have lots of volatilities where you start to ramp. And so how are we managing the volatilities of the demand? Why do you think this time around it is different versus COVID period? How do we get comfortable with our capacity planning?",98

Thank you, Sunny. So Sunny's second question, is goes back to TSMC capacity planning and CapEx framework. So she notes we -- today, generative AI-related demand is very strong, but she also noted a few years ago back in 2021 and '22, demand was also very strong. Many customers were also very positive or being on the future demand. And so today, with such strong generative AI demand, how does TSMC plan its capacity appropriately? How do we manage -- I think your word was volatility? How do we manage the risk? Basically, I guess, of not overbuilding capacity in this type of environment?",105
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2024",2024-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4278.0,3191776.0,113887430.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,72,"I thought I explained that our capacity premium process, right, and the investment, we have -- I put a wording of discipline. That means we are not going to repeat the same kind of mistake that we have in 2021, 2022. Now this time, again, we look at the overall very big demand forecast for my customer. And so I look at it into actually the whole company with many people now examining and study that really is AI is so used for will be used by a lot of people or not. And we test ourself first inside TSMC, we are using AI, we are using machine learning skill to improve our productivity, and we found out it's very useful. And so I also in the line to buy my customer's product, and we have to form in the line, like I cannot privilege here, I'm sorry, but it's useful. 
And so I believe that this time, AI's demand is more real than 2 or 3 years ago. At that timing it is because people were afraid of a shortage, and so automotive, everything, you name it, they are all in shortage. This time, AI alone only AI alone, it will be a very useful tool for the human being to improve all the productivity in our daily life, be it in medical industry or in any product, manufacturing industry or autonomous driving, everything you need AI. And so I believe it's more real. But even with that, we also have a top-down bottom-up approach and discuss with our customers and ask them to be more realistic. I don't want to repeat the same kind of mistake 2 or 3 years ago, and that's what we are doing right now.",291

Thank you. Operator, can we move on to the next participant from the line, please? Okay. If not, then maybe we'll take the last 2 questions from the floor or 1 or 2. Let's start here and then here. So we'll start with our third line from Arthur Lai from Macquarie.",52

I used to cover the downstream tech and especially data center before. And so I want to ask about the SPR because I think this is very important from the data center perspective. So when you bring the new technology, you can save around 20% power. Can we also think about you can save the total systems power consumption by another 20%. So is a big change. And from the customer you asked or you spoke to, is the -- they can also you said the total cost of our own operation. So it becomes the more you buy, the more you save. Yes.",108

So Arthur's first question, he would like to understand more about super power rail or our best-in-class backside power solution as it relates to data center demand. He knows as we said that it brings greater power efficiency from the chip level. His question without specific numbers, but what does it mean for the system level power consumption saving? What does it mean for our customers' ability in terms of total cost of ownership in terms of the power savings? And does it mean that the more you buy, the more you save?",94

Wei,,Executives,76,"The more you buy TSMC's wafer, the more you save. Yes. Sorry, I just want to -- I like my customer. Your question, Arthur, you say that 20% sales in the chips power consumption does that directly reply to indicate that the system power consumption was reduced by 20%. Probably not because of the whole system including the connection, including the networking, including the processes of power consumption. So unless every component save 20%, then you can achieve 20%. But again, the accelerator or the CPU is a big portion of the whole system's power consumption. So even it is not 20%, it's a significant portion of it. And so that's why all my customers want to using the leading edge, and they are very aggressive to move into the 2-nanometer technology.",133

So I also encourage the company to do the right thing. So energy efficiency computing is definitely our goal for human beings. And so I also, I would like to give more color about when you go into the A16 and when we expand the capacity, what do you think the biggest bottleneck would be?",57

The first one would be on the, during the compute test. We obviously have seen quite some big tech companies announced that they are going to accelerate the launch cadence. So what's the implication to TSMC? Should that give TSMC a better visibility on the pipeline and also the capacity planning? And on the other side, so what are the major challenges that you might face with this phase [indiscernible]?",74

So Brad's first question is that COMPUTEX recently, several companies announced their intention to accelerate their product cadence or product launches. So his question is, what does this mean implications to TSMC in terms of capacity planning in terms of supporting our customers, et cetera, et cetera. Is that right? Okay.",52

Wei,,Executives,83,"Okay. Well, we like this kind of a trend because of TSMC is very good at the leading-edge development. And so we -- actually, every product once they design it takes 1.5 years to 2 years. So we got this kind of message, but quite a long time ago. My customer announce it because they are so happy. And so we are happy also because they want us to see our value. So I take that otherwise. But Gokul last. Okay. So to answer your question, yes, we have been prepared. And not only because of in June, they announce it, we much earlier, we already discussed with them, and we prepare for these kind of changes.",117

So the second question will be on the -- well, obviously, we also see the bigger footprint of the AI chips. So while there are quite some activities about fan-out panel-level packaging. So do you think that, that solution will be mentioned in the mid- to long run? Or does TSMC have any plan to do the related investment?",73

So Brad, second question is that, again, with AI-related chips that they're larger and larger die sizes. So his question is in terms of advanced packaging and specifically fan-out panel-level packaging. Is this something that TSMC is looking at or exploring to do? Would this be something for TSMC in the mid- to long term?",56

Wei,,Executives,86,"Yes. we are looking at this as kind of a panel level fan-out technology. But the maturity today is not yet, so I -- personally, I will think it's about at least 3 years later, okay? In this, within these 3 years, we don't have any very solid solution for a dye size bigger than 10x of the radical size. Today, we support our customer all the way to 5x, 6x chip size. I'm talking about the [ fuel ] size, the big [indiscernible] size. 2 years later, I believe the panel fan-out will be -- start to be introduced and we are working on it.",106
