Good morning and good evening to everyone, welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This next week will be the Chinese New Year, before I start, I want to sent to you my best wishes for good year of the rabbit.
During today's call, I will start with the financial highlights in fourth quarter, followed by a recap of 2010, then we will move on to the outlook for the first quarter 2011. You may also refer to the quarterly financial summary slides on our website. All dollar figures are in NT dollars unless otherwise stated.
In the fourth quarter, the NT dollar appreciated more than we originally expected. The actual exchange rate reached NT$30.4 to US$1 compared with the planned NT$30.60 when we gave our guidance in the last conference. However, our fourth quarter revenue still exceeded our guidance with the profit margins reaching the high-end of our outlook.
Fourth quarter revenue was NT$110 billion, representing a 1.9% sequentially decline. However, in the U.S. dollar terms, the fourth quarter marked a 3% growth compared with the third quarter. Wafer shipments were 3.2 million 8-inch equivalent wafers, flat from the prior quarter and up 31.5% from a year ago quarter.
Gross margin was 49.8 %, down 0.2 percentage point from the third quarter, but up 1.3 percentage points from last year. Operating margin was 37.7%, down 0.7 percentage point sequentially, but up 1.2 percentage points compared with the year ago quarter. EPS in the fourth quarter was NT$1.57. ROE was 29.3%.
Now let's move on the income statement. The NT dollar appreciated roughly 5% in the fourth quarter and thus negatively impacted our margins. However, due to our continued cost improvement, our gross margin managed to stay at 49.8% slightly down 0.2 percentage point from the third quarter.
Operating expenses increased NT$205 million from the third quarter, primarily due to higher operating expenses. Opening expenses for Fab 14 and Fab 12, Phase V. Non-operating income decreased by NT$5 million from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of receipts of SMIC shares from the SMIC litigation settlement.
Meanwhile, in December, we acquired a partially constructed fab from Powerchip with NT$2.9 billion, including a steel plant will be disposed and rebuilt to our fab specification. Therefore, we recorded a net loss of NT$800 million in this quarter.
Net investment gain was NT$690 million compared with NT$900 million in the prior quarter with slightly lower profit from certain invested companies. Net margin was 37%, down 4.8 percentage points sequentially and up 1.5percentage points year-over-year.
Now, let's look at our revenue by applications. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see growth in communications and industrial-related applications, which grew 3% and 4% respectively. Computer declined 6% sequentially, while consumer was down 26% from the last quarter.
Revenue from communications-related applications represented 47% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, computer, consumer and industrial applications accounted for 24%, 11% and 18% of our wafer sales.
By technology, 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer continued to grow and represented 21% and 31% of our total wafer revenue respectively. These two nodes combined were 52% of our wafer sales, up from 46% in the last quarter. Meanwhile, revenue from 0.13-micron and below accounted for 73% of total wafer sales from 72% in third quarter of '10.
Now, since 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer combined represent more than half of our total wafer sales, starting from this quarter we redefined the terms of advanced technologies to 65-nanometer and below compared with 0.13-micron and below in the past.
Now, let me move on to the balance sheet. We concluded fourth quarter with NT$182 billion in cash and short-term investments, representing an increase of NT$14 billion from prior quarter mainly due to free cash flow generated during the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in short-term loans for hedging purpose.
Total current liabilities increased by NT$14 billion, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable to contractors and equipment suppliers. In sum, the current ratio in the fourth quarter was 2.1. Accounts receivable days came slightly down to 38 days. Inventory turnover days were 50 days, reflecting the increase in the mix of advanced technologies and the certain early orders from customers. Net fixed asset turnover was 1.2 times in the fourth quarter.
Now let's proceed to cash flow. Cash flow generated from operating activities totaled NT$70.6 billion, representing an increase of NT$6.6 billion from prior quarter mainly due to a decrease used in non-cash net working capital.
Capital expenditure was NP$46 billion in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, we repaid a portion of the short-term loans resulting a NT$6.7 billion outflow.
In sum, the ending cash balance was NT$148 billion, up NT$16 billion sequentially. Free cash flow was NT$24.6 billion in this quarter.
Now in terms of installed capacity, in the fourth quarter, total installed capacity was about 3.1 million wafer in the third quarter, representing a 4% sequential increase. For first quarter of 2011, we expect our overall capacity to remain flat, while with the 12-inch capacity will continue to expand by 3% Q-over-Q, 6 and 8-inch capacity will decrease slightly due to annual maintenance. 2010 managed capacity increased 14% year-over-year with 12-inch capacity up 37%, representing 50% of our total capacity.
With regards to capital expenditures, we stand at US$1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were US$5.94 billion.
Now, I have a few comments on cash flow and cash dividend. For the past few years, TSMC had a consistently generated and full operating cash flow to fund our capital expenditure. Now, TSMC is very well positioned to more aggressively pursue higher growth, while improving profitability. We plan to invest and expand our capacity at a much faster pace to capture that growth.
In the fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference, I said that our dividend payout ratio will be no less than 80% of the distributable earnings. However, in order to achieve the company's new growth objective, from now this statement has to change. We believe that our timely CapEx investment will allow the company's growth potential and bring greater rewards to our shareholders.
Meanwhile, I believe TSMC will be able to maintain at minimum NT$3 per share dividend in the future or consider to increase the cash dividend when our free cash flow increases. In addition to a divided yield that is already among the highest in the industry, TSMC aims to reward its shareholders even more with share price appreciation.
Next, let me give you a recap of our performance in 2010. 2010 was a record year for TSMC in revenue, gross profit dollars and net income dollars. We also achieved near historical high profit margins. To accommodate the strong demand from customers, we have been committed to providing most advanced technologies and ramping up capacities, while we managed to be fully loaded throughout the year.
2010 revenue grew 42% year-over-year in NT dollars, or 48% if measured in U.S. dollars. Gross margin reached 49.4% in 2010 with a 5.7 percentage point increase from 2009. Operating margin hit 37.9%, was certainly a 6.8% expansion from last year.
Earnings per share for 2010 was NT$6.23, up 81% from NT$3.44 in 2009. ROE of 30.2% was the highest in the past decade.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the first quarter 2011. Based on current basic expectations and a forecast exchange rate of NT$29.26, we expect our consolidated revenue in the first quarter to come in between NT$105 billion and NT$107 billion.
In terms of margins, we expect our first quarter gross margin to be between 47% and 49%, operating margin to be between 35% and 37%. For the first quarter of 2011, we expect total demand to be stronger than seasonal, communication to be better than seasonal, while computer and consumer applications to be weaker than seasonal.
We further expect semiconductor seasonal unit growth for the full year of 2011 to be as follows; PC, 12% growth year-over-year; handsets, 9% growth year-over-year, digital consumer electronics 6% growth year-over-year.
This concludes my remarks today. Now, I would like to turn the call to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,,95871.0,6657481.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,4,"We had a record year in 2010, both in revenue and in net income. We grew our revenue by 48% in US dollars. As a result, we believe our market share in the total foundry segment has increased from 43.9% in 2009 to 45.5% in 2010.
Our growth momentum is fueled by timely addition and fast ramp up of capacity wide adoption of our advanced technologies and a strong growth in specialty technology revenue.
TSMC's mission is to be the thrust to the technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. Because we have the technologies, we have effective capacity, and we have earned trust from customers. We believe that we will continue to gain market share.
For 2011, we expect the overall semiconductor market excluding memory to grow by about 7%. We expect the foundry market to grow by about 15%, and we believe TSMC will grow more than 20% in U.S. dollars.
The forecast demand from our customers for 2011 outpaces the supply under our current capacity plan. We expect to continue to fully utilize our capacity this year.
To support the strong growth, we plan to spend about US$7.8 billion for capital expenditures for 2011. 81% of the total budget is for 65-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 28-nanometer technologies. Of the 81%, there is 9% for R&D; and there, capital expenditures are for 20-nanometer and 14-nanometer.
With this CapEx, we are able to increase our total annual capacity by roughly 20% to about 13.6 million 8-inch equivalent wafers per month.
Now I would like to say a few words about our profitability in 2011. Exchange rate changes have been unfavorable in the last few months. Compared with the 2010 average exchange rate of NT$31.49 to US$1, the exchange rate assumption we are using for 2011 is NT$29.16 to US$1.
The 2011 assumed exchange rate is 7.4% down from 2010. As our CFO has pointed out in the past, each percent fluctuation in the exchange rate results in 0.4 percentage point change in operating profit margin. Therefore, between 2010 and 2011 we have a 3 point operating profit degradation due just to the exchange rate.
To address this significant challenge, we have taken various countermeasures including faster ramp-up of newer capacity, fuller utilization of existing capacity and greater cost reduction measures in order to make sure that we leave no money on the table.
Our strategic financial goal is to achieve compounded annual 10% profit before tax growth and minimum return on equity of 20% across cycle in the next five years. We are on track this year.
Now I would like to make a few comments on our technology highlights. First, TCMC's 28-nanometer is industry-first and ready for primetime. Customer products are already taped-out and in prototyping. We have superior performance, superior reliability and density, the density being 2x over 40-nanometer with our gate-last high-k metal gate process.
We have the 28 HPM technology that has gained enthusiastic adoption for tablets, smartphones and embedded SoC applications. The 28 HPM has 3-gigahertz ARM CPU for multi-core application processes. The 28 HPM has low SRAM standby leakage and VCCmin for several applications.
The second highlight is that the 28-nanometer lead-free bumping, which is eco-friendly, is also ready and is compatible with superior low-resistance ELK interconnect.
Third highlight: 800 volts high voltage technology is production-ready and is custom assembling.
Fourth, we plan to double R&D CapEx to over NT$700 million in 2011 and we plan to increase R&D budget by close to 20% to a total of over NT$1.1 billion.
Fifth, we've also applied a new R&D Fab site in Hsin-Chu Science Park for sub-40-nanometer R&D.
Sixth, I want to say a few words about the 450-millimeter wafer manufacturing. Our first 450-millimeter pilot line is planned at our Fab12 Phase VI, starting with 20-nanometer technology. The timing of pilot line will be around 2013, 2014. Our first 450-millimeter production line is planned in around 2015, 2016.
Lastly but not least, I want to talk about two recent developments, which TSMC stands to benefit form, in the future. The first recent development is that Microsoft has recently announced that it will put Windows 8 to ARM probably by next year.
Since many of our customers use ARM cores to design their products, the support from Microsoft will give our customers more opportunities to address new markets, such as mobile, computing and PC's. Since many of our customer's primary foundry will have the opportunity to grow with our customers.
The second parallel development along with the Microsoft announcement is that mobile computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets have gained wide acceptance, and have become very popular in our daily lives. We estimate smartphones will respond 20 million units in 2011 and the growth is estimated to be 45% year-over-year. We estimate tablets will be 40 million units this year. The growth is very fast, 170% this year, but the overall size is still small. There is still a lot of room for the tablets to grow.
We estimate that 61% of the Logic IC from the non-iPad, non-gPad, those are of course Apple and Samsung. 51% of Logic IC from the non-iPad, non-gPad tablets will be supplied by TSMC. These tablets the non-iPad demand will likely takeoff from the second half of 2011. For smartphones, many of its major IC contributors are TSMC's customers. And we currently supply 45% of the Logic IC to smartphones and we except our contribution to go beyond 50% in the near future.
As fabless companies can't participate more in the fast growing new market and design the new products, such as the mobile computing devices, that faster growth fuels TSMC's growth. The development and popularity of the mobile computing devices will speed up the technology migration of the leading nodes such as 40-nanometers, 28-nanometers, 20-nanometers in order to meet the processing speed and low power requirements as well as the need for high integration of different IPs.
TSM 28 HPM is very well positioned. We are the industry leading 3-gigahertz operating frequency and the best performance power ratio for low power processes. Customers are adopting our 28 HPM enthusiastically. We stand to benefit from the popularity of these mobile devices.
These are my prepared comments. We are now open for questions.

Another part of the question, the tape-outs volume ramping. The tape-outs of the 28-nanaometer, they will start to ramp in the second half, starting in the third quarter and then more in the fourth quarter. But the real momentum we believe will be in the next year.

Of course, both of us will be just speculating. But really I think that we are pretty much seeing new trends that we didn't see even as late as six months or a year ago. Back then we thought that 65 was going to be a very, very important node and 40 might be actually less important in terms of the ultimate volume than the 65. But I think that we are revising estimates now, because there is a migration from 65 to 40 and then there are new applications for the 40. And actually we now feel that 28 is going to be a very, very important node also. So all of these are pretty exciting.

But your gross profit margin is almost flat, only 28 basis points.

In fact, depreciation is up. So could you talk about profitability, what's going on in your business? I guess when I look at your mix, your ASPs are up, driven by 40-nanometer. So is this profitability effectively driven by your contribution from 40-nanometer, because again your margins are almost flat, while your utilization declined?

What we are seeing here is we use wafer move, because the bidding versus installed capacity has to do with industry fluctuation on the back-end among quarters.
What we are measuring based on the equivalent utilization is how many move we can do in every wafer fab that we can use every piece of equipment. So from that end, we are not doubtful as you expected. So if we can do a very good job, we can very well run above 100% utilizations, though we still have some room, also depending on the demand as well.

It did play a very important role in keeping our margin up. But you are looking at the whole company here now. You commented on the gross margin, the relatively level of gross margin percentage, you are looking at the whole company. And this had a lot of factors in play.
Yes, depreciation increased other factor, but there's a lot of cost. So there's a lot of variable cost that we have been able to reduce also. And then there's also this mix question. So I mean there are a lot of factors. I think it'll be oversimplifying it to just signal out one or two factors.
But as I said this afternoon, we do manage our margin through standard gross margin that literally hundreds of people work full time to try to maximize the standard gross margin. Well, I don't mean hundreds of pencil pushers and we don't have any pencil pushers I guess. But we have dozens of cost analysts and then their conclusions, their recommendations get passed along to actually thousands of engineers in operation, in purchasing, et cetera. And all of those work to bring the standard gross margin up.
Look, we haven't been the most profitable foundry for years for nothing, alright. So if you start looking at us as a complex machinery that's working well, I think that would be a good start, rather than a company that just looks on very simple issues. We spent years in building up organization. There is cost organization and the market forecast organization that I mentioned to you.

Looks like your CapEx cycle has gone up quite a bit. If I see the last 5 year's CapEx cycle excluding 2010, average CapEx was US$2.5 billion roughly. Now you are moving average CapEx more than US$5 billion on an annual basis. And if you bring the 450-millimeter fab tools by 2014, 2015, your CapEx cycle will be even high when you move to there.
So does it mean like your cash flow will have a little bit of constraint for next 5 to 10 years, because whatever cash you are going to get in, you have to keep on putting on the CapEx and that may lead to no upside for cash dividend?

Ltd., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,,126212.0,8303433.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good morning, and good evening to everyone. Welcome to our 2011 first quarter earnings conference call. During today’s call I will start with financial highlights in the first quarter, then we will move to the outlook for the second quarter. You may also refer to the quarterly financial summary slides on our website or dollar figures in NT dollars unless otherwise stated.
In the first quarter wafer demand was strong, stronger than seasonal, our revenue was only slightly down 0.7% in US dollar turn. However, an unfavorable impact from a 3.6% change in foreign exchange rate lead to a decline in NT dollar denoted sales, which was at the lower end of our guidance. However, we managed to achieve albeit our guidance in margin.
First quarter wafer shipments was 3.2 million inch equivalent wafer, down 1% from the prior quarter. Revenue was $105 billion, down 4.3% sequentially. Our growth margin was 49%, and operating margin was 37.2%. Earnings per share in the first quarter was $1.40, ROE was 24.6%.
Let me move into the income statement. Our gross margin was 49%, down 0.8 percentage points sequentially, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilizations and unfavorable foreign exchange rate partially offset by a more favorable product mix revenue and cost improvements.
Operating expense decreased $800 million from the fourth quarter primarily due to lower operating expense for Fab 14 and Fab 12. Non-operating income decreased by $50 million from the last quarter. Net investment gain declined by $170 million sequentially reflecting lower profit from certain invested companies.
Net margin was 34.4%, down 2.6 percentage points sequentially and declined 2 .1 percentage points year-over-year, mainly reflecting a higher tax rate and lower tax credit for investment compared with the last year.
Now let’s examine our revenue by applications. The first quarter wafer sales decreased sequentially in all major segments. Communication, computer and consumer related applications declined 3%, 9% and 6% respectively. Meanwhile, industrial and others declined 8% from the last quarter. Revenue from communications related applications represented 48% of our total wafer revenue in the first quarter. Computer, consumer and industrial applications accounted for 23%, 11% and 18% of our wafer sales respectively.
Now revenue by technology. Demand for advanced technologies continued to grow in first quarter combining contribution from 40 nanometer and 65 nanometer represented 64% of total wafer sales, up from 52% in the last quarter.
Now let’s move on to the balance sheet. We conclude the first quarter with 163 million - $163 billion in cash and short-term investments, representing a decrease of $18 million from the prior quarter. And due to a decrease in free cash flow resulting from higher capital expenditures. Total current liabilities increased by $4 billion, primarily due to a reclassification of corporate bonds from long-term liabilities and an increase in short-term loans to hedge our increased portion of U.S. dollar position.
In sum, current ratio in the first quarter was two times. Accounts receivable days increased one-day to 39 days. Inventory turnover days were 56 days, up six days sequentially mainly due to some customers, changing in delivery schedule. Daily orders from certain customers, and the increased safety stock in materials in response to the Japan earthquake. Net fixed asset turnover for the first quarter was 1 ton.
Now let’s take a look of cash flow. Cash flow generated from operating activities totaled $56 billion, representing a decrease of $14 billion for the fourth quarter last year, mainly due to the change in accounts payable, accounts receivable, payment of 2010 annual bonus and changing inventory level.
Cap expenditure was $81 billion in the first quarter. We also increased short term loan paged the company’s increased U.S. dollar position, resulting in a $3 billion increase in cash. In some, the ending cash balance was $129 billion, down $18 billion sequentially.
Free cash flow was a net outflow of $25 billion during the first quarter. Primarily due to an increase in capital expenditure. Nevertheless, we still anticipate a positive free cash flow for the whole year of 2011. In terms of our installed capacity, in the first quarter, total installed capacity was sequentially flat from the prior quarter with approximately 3.1 million equivalent wafer. An increase in total wafer capacity was offset by a decrease in six and eight inch capacity due to annual maintenance and fewer working days.
For the second quarter 2011, we expect our overall capacity to increase by 8% sequentially. 12-inch wafer capacity will increase 10%, while six and eight inch capacity will increase 6%. As we are expending capacity at TSMC Shanghai, China.
2011 managed capacity is expected to increase 19% year-over-year, with 12-inch capacity up 33% from 2010. Regarding capital expenditure, in order to support the customer demand for advanced technologies, we spend $2.77 billion U.S. dollar in the first quarter representing a 36% of our total 2010 budget. We expect 70% of the budget to be spent in the first half of 2011.
Now let’s turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Based on the current business expectations and the forecast extension rate of 29.03, we expect our consolidated revenue in the second quarter to come in between NT$109 and NT$111 billion. In terms of margin, we expect our second quarter gross margin to between 45.5% and 47.5%. Lastly, operating margin to be between 33.5% and 35.5%.
This concludes my remarks today. Now I would like to turn the call to Dr. Morris Chang for his remarks.

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,,126212.0,8303434.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,4,"Good morning, and good evening. I would like to make some comments on various topics of interest, Japan earthquake, world economy as they reflect our market, exchange rate and also our advanced technology development. And then I will also talk about the new Killer App, we have a smart phones and tablets. Then I will also cover more and more technologies that which have really transformed our mainstream technology business. Then I will talk about capital expenditures in capacity and then a few words about our new businesses namely solar and LED, and then lastly our strategic financial plan.
On Japan earthquake, we have had no interruption in supply stores. We have had no interruption in production line because of any shortage of supply to us, and we don’t expect any in the future. Now I think the Japan earthquake probably had some effect on our second quarter demand, because some of our customers and some of their customers perhaps have suffered some delay in their production. But that effect is probably rather modest and it’s only in the second quarter. I don’t - we expect any significant impact on the second half demand. In Japan earthquake thus impact Japanese and world economies. Now, a few words about world economy as the fact of our market. The outlook for world economy is a bit softer now than the outlook three or four months ago.
The outlook in Japan in southern Europe and in UK is a bit softer. There is also inflation fighting in China, India and other emerging countries, which has made the estimate of growth a bit less than a few months ago.
Now, how does that affect our market? Well, our market forecast model starts with world GDP. And as the world GDP got a little softer, this year, our forecasting model use a less, a smaller semiconductor market number. And that is indeed why a few weeks ago, I adjusted up the semiconductor EX memory market growth down to 4% from 7%.
Now on the effect of the exchange rate on our business. As you know, all our revenues in U.S. dollars and 80% of our cost are $80. Therefore, the U.S. dollar depreciation hits us two ways. First, it makes our revenue less, makes our NT revenue less. Back in the day, it hurts our profitability, our profit percent.
Basically I have said before, and I say it again, we lose 40 basis points of profitability for every 100 basis points of U.S. dollar depreciation. 40 basis points loss of profitability for every 100 basis points of U.S. dollar depreciation.
Now, at the current exchange rate of NT on a 28.9 to $1, U.S. depreciation - U.S. dollar depreciation is 8% from the 2010 average. And the exchange rate has stayed the same as the last year, we would make $26 billion NT more profit this year, which is equivalent to $1 a share, $1NT a share. And that’s a pretty big number, that is, if the exchange rate has stayed the same as last year.
Now I, let me talk about our advanced technologies. First, on 28 nanometers, we completed a very important milestone. We completed full technology qualifications for both oxynitrite, which is our 28 LP and high-k metal gate, which is our 28 HP. Now the significance of this milestone is that the way is not cleared to volume production on the 28 LP and 28 HP, both the oxynitrite and the high-k metal gate versions.
And furthermore, we have 89 customer product tables. We have one - everyone that we compete at the pool, that’s the 28 nanometers. On 20 nanometers development is on track for risk production in second half of next year. So that’s little more than a year away yet, but development is on track. And we already have many early customer engagement on the 20 nanometers.
Now on the more advanced technologies, 14, 10 and beyond, we have a significant efforts in (inaudible) and non-silicon channel structure. We will have been today pushed more slow to the further most. Now I would like to say a few words about smart phones and tablets. They are the new killer app for us. This like PCs in the 80s and 90s and cell phones in the 2000s. Smart phones and tablets will be (inaudible) was in the forthcoming decade.
Smart phones and tablets are the fastest growth segments in communication and computer products. They need more, they need most advanced technology for application processes because everybody wants a smart phone that’s fast and the low-power. And the fact that they need the most advanced technology is a definite advantage for TSMC, because we do lead in technology.
Almost all the smart phones and tablet application processors utilize ARM architecture. As you know, tablets companies are all use ARM or mostly use ARM architecture. And that is again TSMC sets the advantage because we have products with practically all the tablets companies in the world.
And then tablets companies will gain semiconductor market share in these smart phone and tablet segments. That again turns out to be a TSMC advantage, because as I said, tablets companies are our customers, our partners. And as they gain market share, we gain market share.
Now, TSMC value-added is three or four times in smart phones and tablets as it is on feature phones. Now, we gain greater value added as the smart phones and tablets markets expand very rapidly.
Now, I’d like to say a few words about more and more. More and more are specialty technologies, which we have developed and applying in mainly the older technologies, technologies that are greater than 90 pr 130 nanometers
And indeed we have been doing it for several - four years now, for of five years. And the increment of result has really transformed business in the older technologies. The combined specialty technologies revenue, we have been clouding the specialty technologies, Mr. ABCD and MRABCB, M stands for Men’s, R for RFIC, A stands for automotive and analog, B stands for BCB, C stands for C-loss imager, D stands for display driver, all MRABCB, those six kinds of specialty technologies combined yield a revenue of $3.1 billion US in 2011. And that’s a pretty significant percentage of our total revenue and in fact this is weightier than half of our revenue in the older technologies. So that’s why I said that the practice of more than more or specialty technologies has already transformed our older technologies business.
And as I said, the combined MIABCDs specialty technologies (inaudible) $3.1 billion of revenue this year, just the C-max imager alone is using $600 million to $700 million of revenue US in 2011. In addition, we are leaders in embedded flash, DSI sensor and also high voltage IC.
Now a few words about capital expenditure and capacity. We, in the last few months we have looked at this year capital expenditures pretty carefully. Now we in fact have had to operate adjustments higher capital expenditure, because of US dollar depreciation against the euro and the yen. Part of our capital expenditures is in euros and yens and as the US dollar have depreciated against those currencies, we have to adjust our capital expenditure upwards.
Now we have also adjusted them downwards because of some conversions that they were able to make. We have converted some 65-nanometer capacity to 40 nanometer, because it appears to be greater demand for 40, greater demand than we anticipated. And there appears to be less demand than we anticipated for the 65. So we have converted some 65-nanometer capacity to 40 . And we have also converted some 90 nanometer and 130-nanometer capacity to CMOS images.
As a result of both the upward adjustments due to currency exchange and the downward adjustments, because of capacity conversions actually we netted about zero. So capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $7.8 billion U.S.
And few words on the solar and LED businesses. We took a very important step, the Board took a very important step just yesterday in passing, approving the formation of two companies. One is TSMC Solar Ltd., and the second is SMC Solid State Lighting Ltd. We did those to encourage entrepreneurism and the independence of those companies. We believe it’s important. We believe that it is almost essential for a successful company like us to form new companies. So that a successful company can spawn new businesses, because the new business is indeed must stand on their own and must be an entrepreneurial and you cannot now keep them confined in the thinking, in the kind of thinking that has made the parent very successful.
And so we formed these two companies and Rick Tsai is the Chairman and CEO for both of those companies. And both those companies will plan to have IPO in a few years.
Now just a few words on our strategic financial plan. I announced some time ago that we have a five-year financial goal of 10% profit before tax, compounded annual growth rate and later RE go to 20% ROE or the five years between this year and 2015, and that goal is unchanged. In fact, I see now even more bullish about achieving that goal in the next five years than I did a year ago, when the formulated a goal. We will have good years and bad years. But I’m talking about now a five-year compounded annual growth average - growth rate of 10% of PBT. So in some of those years, we’ll probably grow less, but in some of those years we will grow more than 10% but overall, I plan to achieve it.
And in looking at 2011, actually it’s a good year except for exchange rate. The exchange rate has kind of only a one - in the works here and if you look at the original intent assumption, I would say that 2011 is a good year. Those are the comments, I have at this moment.

I wanted to ask about the subsidiary creation for the solar and LED business. Now that you may not move, what would the next step or what can the divisions do if they cannot do as a division within TSMC. And would you now fund those groups still out of the parent or would they need funding from external investors.

We are still - TSMC is still the 100% owner of those two companies. Now, you ask what can they do in the future that they cannot do as internal divisions. Well, first of all, the employees of those two companies will be, will subscribe to the shares - will subscribe to shares and of course the expectation is that the shares will be very valuable after the companies have gone public. So that’s one big difference that we have created a powerful incentive for the employees in the solar and LED businesses.
And also another difference is that, as I said, this is on the entrepreneurism side, and I think that the incentive needs to be there and the incentive is now the spark of those affiliate companies. Now, independents, I said I wanted to encourage more independents. Well, up to now, the new businesses do report to the board on a separate meeting, every board meeting and actually a pretty large percentage of the board meeting is taken up by the new companies report.
And that’s going to be very much reduced from now on to encourage independence. And as I said, Rick Tsai will be the Chairman and CEO of both those companies. And TSMC as the so owner so far of course as the employees start to subscribe shares, a part of the shares would be owned by the employees.
Now TSMC is the larger owner, still of course will maintain a very firm connection with the companies. And that connection will primarily be maintained through the Board members that TSMC will appoint to the two companies. But there will actually be only two Board members aside from Rick Tsai himself. Rick is the Chairman and there will be only two Board members.
In fact, one of them is F.C. Tseng, who is also the Vice Chairman of TSMC, and the other one is Dick Thurston, General Counsel of TSMC. And Lora, who is our CFO, Lora Ho, who is TSMC’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the Supervisor in both companies. This is Supervisor in that Taiwan definition, financial as well. So I can see that the connection will be there and the synergy will be there. And - but there will be more independent, and there will be more entrepreneurial.

Thanks for taking my question. Dr. Chang, I had a question on the forecast revision, which you talked about I think a couple of weeks ago going from the 7% growth to the non-memory semiconductor industry globally to 4%, now for 2011. As you look at that number, your target for TSMC is still shooting for about 20%. That’s a pretty wide disparity between your customer growth in TSM, I wonder if you could help me reconcile that, given the fabless portion of that non memory sector is by far the largest and that would be an unprecedented variance between your growth and the underlying growth of non-memory.</TAG>

On the bigger picture. You talked about these killer applications of PCs in 80s, 90s in the mobile phones. Yeah, I’m curious if today’s industry environment is in fact, I don’t know, even more killer if you will. Can you help me think about this - have we ever had such a big market, billions of units, if you will, moving from feature phones to smart phone, where you’re seeing three times plus the dollar increase in silicon. I just can’t think of a time where we’ve ever had such a big increase in any other types of devices for this large market. Am my right or is this kind of a similar playbook and the same kind of killer?

We offer technology leadership, and I don’t mean technology in technology leadership in every kind of technology. But we offer a technology leadership in the kind of technologies that the fabless companies need. We have a manufacturing leadership, which means much as lower cost to our sales, but that means extra cycle time, meaning shorter time to market for our customers. Also it means more reliable commitments, let’s say. And also it means, I was thinking about, yeah, capacity. We have I believe much more capacity available to our customers.
And then of course largely, but certainly, importantly, we have always worked with customers as partners. And I think that this partnership spirit and business model, in fact I may even call, I would even call it a part of our business model. Partnership is a part of business model I think is very important. So we offer those three things.

Good morning, and good evening to everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. During today’s call I will start with the financial highlights in the second quarter, then we will move on to the outlook for the third quarter. You may also refer to the quarterly financial summary slides on our website or dollar figures in NT dollars unless otherwise stated.
Looking at the highlights, our second quarter revenue had increased by 4.9% sequentially. Our gross margin was 46% and operating margin was 34.3%. The sequential decline in margin was mainly due to lower utilization in NT dollar appreciation. Second quarter wafer shipments were 3.3 million inch equivalent wafer, up 4% from the prior quarter.
Let me move to the income statement. Our operating expense increased by 3.9% from the previous quarter mainly due to higher R&D spending on 20 nanometer. The percentage of sales is 11.7% similar to the level in the first quarter. Overall, our second quarter net margin arrived at 32.5% down 1.9 percentage points from the first quarter and EPS was NT $1.39.
Now let’s take a look at our revenue by applications. In the second quarter communication related revenue decreased by 2% from the first quarter while Computer, Consumer, Industrial increased by 15%, 10%, and 6%. Revenue from communication related applications represents 45% of our total wafer revenue in this quarter. But our Computer, Consumer, and Industrial applications account for 25%, 11%, and 19% of our wafer sales respectively.
Now let's turn to revenue by technology, we continued to see strong demand for advanced technologies, 40 nanometer remains the strongest in all and it’s contributing to our total wafer sales, increased by 4 percentage points to 26% in the second quarter. Overall, combined contribution for 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer had increased by 1 percentage point to 55% of total wafer sales in the second quarter.
On balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with NT$159 billion in cash and short-term investments similar to the level in prior quarter. AS for liabilities almost all the increase was for dividend payables and dividends that had been paid down on July 20.
Our Inventory turnover days decreased by three days in the second quarter and we are expecting a larger scale of decline in the third quarter to be below 50 days.
Let's proceed with cash flows. Cash flows generated from operating activities totalled NT$63 billion, up NT$7 billion from the prior quarter mainly due to change in working capital.
Capital expenditure was NT$65 billion in the second quarter. As a result our free cash flow was a net outflow of NT$2 billion during the quarter, up from an outflow of NT$25 billion in the prior quarter, thanks to a less capital expenditure.
Next on capital expenditure, we decided to revise down 2011 full year capital expenditure to NT$7.4 billion from original plan of $7.8 billion as the weakened economic conditions that’s impacting our wafers in the second half of the year.
Our second quarter capital expenditure totalled $2.3 billion during the first half capital expenditure to two-thirds of our overall year’s budget. As a result of our capital expenditure adjustments, our total capacity in 2011 will be 2% lower than the previous plan. Under the current capacity plan, overall capacity is expected to increase 17% to 13.2 million inch equivalent wafers in 2011. 12-inch wafer capacity will increase by 30%.
Total installed capacity was above 3.3 million wafers in the second quarter representing an 8% growth from the prior quarter and we expect to grow by another 3% in the third quarter and keep flat in the fourth quarter.
Now, let's turn to the outlook for the third quarter. Based on current business expectations and a forecast exchange rate of NT$28.72 we expect our consolidated revenue in the third quarter to come in between NT$102 and NT$104 billion. The third quarter guidance reflects the consolidation of Global Unichip, which contribute around 1% of our consolidated revenue in the previous quarter. However, the change of (inaudible) will not impact our strategic relationship with Global Unichip.
In terms of margins, we expect our third quarter gross margin to be between 40.5% and 42.5%. Operating margin to be between 28% and 30%.
This concludes my remarks today. Now I will like to turn the call over to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.

Ltd., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,3098.0,147828.0,9489295.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,4,"Good evening and good morning. I like to talk about the world economy and the semiconductor market first, and then I like to comment on the supply chain inventories, demand, prices and foundry market, and then I like to say a few words about the third quarter gross margin, and then I like to report our progress in technology.
First, on world economy and semiconductor market, world economic growth this year is below earlier expectation. US growth is below earlier expectation and is mainly coupled by debt limit uncertainties. Europe has been troubled by debt problems of several countries. Japan's slow growth has been exacerbated by the March earthquake tsunami. China trying to control inflation.
We now forecast world GDP growth rate at 2.8% down from 3.8% at the beginning of the year. The lower revision of world GDP growth has impacted our semiconductor growth. We now expect semiconductor ex-memory, semiconductor ex-memory to grow at 4% this year, down from the 7% we expected earlier this year.
Now I want to make a few comments on supply chain inventory demand and the foundry market. The semiconductor foundry sector has been further impacted us by inventory adjustment follow. Earlier in the year, semiconductor supply chain anticipated a better second half of 2011 in spite of the building inventory. The March 11 earthquake in Japan further prompted us the supply chain to build more inventory for precautionary purposes.
Now that Japan supply its recovery has been better than expected, but the end demand has softened due to a slow economic growth. Many IC companies need to reduce their inventory levels. In our current estimate the supply chains days of inventory at the end of 2Q is about five days above seasonal and since all of the companies are managing inventory (inaudible) we believe the inventory adjustment will be mostly done by the end of third quarter. While the demand for PSMG wafers in 3Q has been negatively impacted by both the softening economy and the supply chain inventory management.
Prices have remained stable and because of our differentiated technologies and our customer partnerships, we expect that down. The prices will remain stable in the foreseeable future. We now expect the world foundry sector revenue to grow 7% versus the 15% growth that we expected in January.
Now I would like to make a few moments on the third quarter gross margin. If we compare 3Q ’11 gross margin guidances mid point, which is 41.5% with a year ago, 3Q 2010, when we had gross margin of 50% is an 8.5 percentage point decline. 360 basis points is attribute to foreign exchange rate change. The NT has risen 10% from 3Q 10 to 3Q 11. 1,150 basis points is attributed to lower utilization. Utilization was significantly above 100% in 3Q 10 and is now below 100%. So that's a total of 1,510 basis points.
Our cost reduction offsets approximately 660 basis points, making the difference now about 850 basis points. Beyond 3Q, we expect foreign exchange to be stable. We expect that inventory correction have run its course (inaudible) by the end of the third quarter. So our utilization should improve in the fourth quarter. The negative elements will be diminished, our cost reduction momentum is expected to continue, and therefore we are optimistic about our margin improvement from the third quarter on.
Now, I’d like to report on our technology progress specifically first on 28-nanometer. We reported earlier that we had tape outs for 89 individual products and the tape out of each of those is on schedule. The first silicon of every tape out was fully functional would consistently satisfactory. In fact density reduction is on plan. The ramp of 28-nanometer however is taking longer than expected due to the softening economy and the demand outlook of 2011.
Second item that I want to report on is that our close co-orporation ARM CPU core is allowing us to optimize our technology of ARM design. Recently in 28HP, which stands for 28 high-performance, we have delivered first industry silicon with higher speeds than any other computer using on. And in 28 HPM which tends to our 28 nanometer high-performance mobile we have enabled first tape out of even better performance.
The next item is our transistor, as a 40-nanometer node. We have demonstrated a high hide mobility p-channel, since that’s worth greater than 30% mobility gain over silicon channel for low voltage 40 nanometer SoC.
Next item is subsystem integration. We have demonstrated at floating functional subsystem having a larger chip silicon in disposal with both impassive components and bumps manufactured at TSMC. The entire component was assembled at TSMC. As we forge ahead with more slower NICB involvement, we’re also trying to realize the potential of system integration. This concept can be described in the following view graph. The silicon and disposal solution reduces packages from nine to one, reduces size of dollar and increases the memory bandwidth and the system speed.
The next item that I want to report on is bond on trace; BoT and we show the next view graph. This is the first time we have revealed this to the investing public. It is a TSMC invention protected by patents. We completed form reliability qualification of BoT process. This BoT process reduces substrate bond pitch from 140 microns to 100 microns with significant cost savings from using standard infrared result, eliminating paths and sort on less on substrates and potentially reducing net layers on sub streams. It also reduces form factor and also develop for mobile applications.
The last but not the least, I want to report the our CMOS image sensors we are ready to introduce, 1.1 micron pixel process early next year for 8 megapixel products. We have also demonstrated a 0.9 micron pixel for 16 Megapixel products to be released a year later. Both processes use our world leading (inaudible) elimination technology and are well-positioned for smartphone and tablet application. Thanks, these are my prepared comments.

Randy, second quarter margin was 46% and the mid-point of our third quarter guidance is 41.5%, so there is a 4.5 percentage point difference. The difference come from three parts, number one, is the utilization decrease in the third quarter. This cause accounts for a little bit over three percentage point of gross margin.
Number two, in third quarter, we will shift about three days of finished goods inventory, which was build in the second quarter. These three days of inventory has contributed to the second quarter productivity and the margin rate. Since these wafers are sold in this quarter, so we would need to reverse the favorable impact in this quarter. This accounts for about 1 percentage point of margin drop this quarter.
And lastly, there is foreign exchange rate during the quarter NT dollar has appreciate another 1.5%. This contributed to roughly 0.3 percentage point margin decrease. So if you add this three things together, 3 percentage point, that will be more than 1 percentage point more than once at any point another two or 3 percentage points, you get its 4.5 percentage point difference q-over-q. I hope I answered your question?

The delay of 28-nanometer is not due to their quality issue, actually we have regular tape out and it is unplanned. The July ramping is mainly because of softening economy for our customers, so customers delayed a tape out to us. So therefore, the 28-nanometer revenue contribution by the end of fourth quarter this year will be roughly above 1% of our total wafer revenue.

Thanks for taking my question. Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse. I was wondering if you could add a little bit of color on capital intensity and what it means for you. In the past I think you had talked equipment cost for 28-nanometer has been significantly more than 65. First part of my question is do you any changes in that trend as you continue to ramp 28-nanometer and move to 20-nanometer later on.
And the second part of my question is given the fact that the equivalent cost is higher at this smaller technology node, does that result in a higher yield threshold that is required in order to ramp the volume to keep the economics attractive for you and your customers? The reason I ask is I know you mentioned that 28-nanometer yields good from your perspective, but are they good enough to ramp given the higher cost of 28-nanometer outside the economic issues you mentioned?

First and what perhaps Lora may elaborate on my answer. The straight answer to the capital intensity of the smaller nodes is that yes, the equipment cost is higher; therefore it would take a higher margin to get the same return on - return on invested capital. And that can of course be achieved by slightly higher price and slightly more aggressive cost reduction and we are actually pursuing both avenues.

For every advance node we invest for and we have a return model to make decision on how we should invest. As Chairman Jeff mentioned about if you add two components, the first one being the gross margin and pricing and cost relationship, the other one is the asset turnover. The CapEx was the leading now giving more expenses using asset turnover will be slightly lower, therefore reached the higher margins and managing by the cost and price.
So you can you get a same returns on invested capital so that is how we think, the right model for our decision making on capital investment.

In this case, we think our fabulous customers current level is 69 days and the seasonal level is 65 days, and the IDM customers, the current level is 87 days and the seasonal levels 82 days, so that’s about 4 to 5 days up seasonal. But I also understand people calculated DOI a little bit differently. So this is a reality.

Good morning, and good evening to everyone. Welcome to our 2011 third quarter earnings conference call. I will start with the financial highlights in the third quarter, then we will move on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. All dollars presented are in NT dollars unless otherwise stated.
In the third quarter, our revenue was higher than the guidance provided on July 28 thanks to some rush orders in August and some -- and more favorable exchange rate. Third quarter revenue decreased 3.6% sequentially to NT$106.5 billion, and the wafer shipments decreased 3% to 3.2 million inch equivalent wafer. Our wafer demand was expected by a weakened slow growth economic conditions and customers’ inventory adjustment.
Computer and consumer-related revenue was more affected and decreased by 16% and 18%, respectively, whereas communication and industrial increase by 3% and 9% from the second quarter. Overall, communication accounted for 48% of our total wafer revenue in this quarter, while computer, consumer and industrial accounted for 21%, 10% and 41% of our wafer sales, respectively.
By technology, demand for 40-nanometer and below technologies jumped up relatively well and reached 27% of wafer revenue in the third quarter including 0.5% from 28-nanometer, and we expect our 28-nanometer RAM to accelerate in the next few quarter.
Combined contributing for 65-nanometer and below represented 54% of our total wafer sales in the third quarter, which is 1 percentage point lower than the second quarter as revenue from the 65 node decreased by two percentage points in the third quarter.
Gross margin was 42%, and operating margin was 49.7%. The sequential decline in margins was mainly due to lower utilization. Operating expense increased 1.4% on the previous quarter mainly due to higher R&D spending on 20-nanometer and higher patent filing fees. In the future, we will continue to increase R&D spending to expand our lead-in technology and keep SG&A tight at the same time.
Overall, our third quarter net margin arise at 28.5% EPS or NT $1.17. In line with what we said in the last conference, we have successfully reduced the inventory level during this quarter. Our inventory turnover days significantly reduced by 8 days to the company’s normal level of 45 days mainly reflecting lower inventory levels in finished goods and working process inventories.
Cash from operation totaled NT $55 billion. Free cash flow was NT $17 billion during the quarter, up from an outflow of NT $1.8 billion in the second quarter due to less capital expenditure. Combined with NT $78 billion cash dividend payment and NT$18 billion proceeds from a corporate bond issuance, our cash and short-term investment decreased NT $39 billion to NT $120 billion.
In light of weakened demand, we decided to further revise down 2011 capital expenditure to USD $7.3 billion. Total capital expenditure in the first 3 quarters reached USD $6.3 billion. As a result of the adjustment, our total capacity would be flat in the fourth quarter. Full year total capacity will increase 17% to 13.2 million 8-inch equivalent wafers, while 12-inch wafer capacity will increase by 29%.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Based on current business expectations and a forecast exchange rate of $38.3, we expect our consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter to come in between NT $103 billion and NT $105 billion. In terms of margins, we expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be between 43.5% and 45.5%, operating margin to be between 30% and 32%. 
The reason for the lower revenue guidance but higher margin guidance is due to the following reasons. Number one, in fourth quarter we have better cost control, so the cost savings contribute to margin improvement. Also, the fourth quarter utilization will be slightly higher than the third quarter. In addition to that, the exchange rate in fourth quarter is higher than third quarter, which is favorable to the company. The 3 favorable will be offset slightly by an unfavorable product mix due to the ramping of 28-nanometer. 
This concludes my remarks today. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.",692
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,3915.0,279482.0,13785718.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,3,"Hi, everyone. I'm Morris Chang, CEO of TSMC. I want first to talk about the world semiconductor market and foundry market this year. The weakening world economic outlook has impacted the demand for semiconductors. We now forecast this year’s world semiconductor growth at 1%. We had forecast 5% in January and 2% in April, and we now forecast only 1% growth for world semiconductor market this year. And we have also trimmed our forecast for semiconductor foundry revenue growth to 4% this year. We had forecasted about 7% as late as July. All these are in US dollars. Now TSMC’s growth this year in US dollars will be 9%. 
Now I want to talk about the supply chain inventory. In our last quarterly conference, we said that the excess inventory in the semiconductor supply chain will be mostly adjusted in 3Q and that the DOI will be at a seasonal level by end of 3Q. We also said that TSMC’s utilization rate will be higher in 4Q compared to 3Q. These statements hold true today.
The supply chain inventory is estimated to be 3 days below seasonal at the end of 3Q, and TSMC has reduced our old DOI by 8 days to 45 days in 3Q, which is about our normal level. However, the increasing uncertainty of future demand has continued to prompt IC vendors, namely our customers, to destock. We believe this effective supply chain DOI will be further reduced to several days below seasonal by the end of 4Q. We do expect our fourth quarter utilization level rate to be slightly higher than in 3Q.
Now I would like to talk about our competitive strengths. In these economic uncertain times, TSMC’s competitive position is stronger than ever. Our technology development is progressing well, and I will talk about a few of them here. 
First, 28-nanometer. Our 28-nanometer process is in volume production. More than 40,000 12-inch wafers will be shipped to customers in the next few months, and we anticipate the ramp next year will be fast. 3 out of 4 28-nanometer process operators are in volume production. They are 28HP, HPL and LP. The remaining version, 28 HPM will be ready for production by end of this year. Our 28-nanometer process has surpassed the previous generation’s production ramps at the same point in time, and product yield continues to improve and is on track. We expect 28-nanometer to be an important engine of our growth next year, since we are the only person, only foundry to volume produce 28-nanometer. We not only proved -- we not only demonstrated our leadership in technology but also provide arsenal for our customers for their design wins with competitive products.
Now a few words on 20-nanometer. Our 20-nanometer development is on track and demonstrated a fully functional SRAMs. Multiple customers have already engaged for more than a year with TSMC on the development of 20-nanometer. 
We plan 2 offerings for the 20-nanometer process. The 20G for high performance products such as CPU, GPU and server and 20 SoC or high performance and low leakage product such as mobile computing devices. Risk production for 20-nanometer G is scheduled for 3Q '12 next year, and risk production for 20-nanometer SoC will start in January of 2013.
We are the world’s first and only foundry to have complete the tape out of 20-nanometer ARM Cortex-A15 MP core processor, which is high performance for future mobile computing product. We have also started a development of 14-nanometer FinFET. The device tech finding has been ongoing for more than one year, and we plan to risk start our 14-nanometer process in 2014.
A few words on CoWoS, C-O-W-O-S. It stands for Chip on Wafer on Substrate. Last quarter, I showed you a framework for successful integration through silicon interposer. This time, I'm able to show you the picture of the actual test chips. Let’s view that one. The logic chip and the DRAM chips or cubes are placed on top of the silicon interposer, this is COW, chip on wafer, and then packaged on a substrate. This is CoWoS, Chip on Wafer on Substrate. We have received very good yields and obtained encouraging reliability on these test vehicles. 
The process flow for CoWoS is shown on the next view graph. The advantages of CoWoS indicate the resolution for wall pitch and the thin wafer issues. A clear ownership of the long process flow simplifies supply chain and shorter cycle time. The improvement on yield cost reduction and reliability can be continuous, efficient and effective.
With this CoWoS technology, our business model is such that we will provide service in one, top die logic wafer process, wafer slot and micro pumping; and two, integrated back-end assembly solution for interposer wafer, final assembly and final test. We do not plan to sell just the interposer.
A few words on embedded flash. Our business in embedded flash has grown by 30% to a level close to $800 million this year thanks to the strong growth in smartphones and tablet. Battery management IC as well as touch sense controllers enjoy the highest growth within the embedded flash segment. TSMC’s 0.18-micron embedded flash with complete platform solution saw a record level of new product tape outs this year. Our 90-nanometer embedded flash has started production ramp this year. 65-nanometer joint development programs and 90-nanometer phase in, in MCU have been established, and we expect to launch 40-nanometer embedded flash program in 4Q this year.
Now a few words about next year's semiconductor and TSMC outlook. We expect next year's semiconductor growth, semiconductor market to grow 3% to 5% over this year. TSMC, with 28 high ramp-up, constituting our important engine for growth, will grow several points higher than the semiconductor market. All these are costs in U.S. dollars.
Now a few words on capital expenditure, CapEx. We have 2 operative forces in action here. We have a relatively soft growth outlook in the semiconductor market, and yet, we are going to ramp up our 28-nanometer wafers next year. Now this year, we have already trimmed our 2011 capital spending to NT $7.3 billion as lower this project. It is $100 million less than we announced last quarter. For next year, we plan to reduce our 2012 capital spending. It will be at a lower lever than this year. 
Those are all the prepared comments I have.",1065

You're guiding for utilization rates that -- to increase, a little bit more of a tailwind from currency and total revenues to decline more on the 3% or so.

So if you talk about from the company-wide average ASP point of view is we will support it. It will go up because of 28-nanometer. Other than that, as I just described, the fourth quarter revenue declined just slightly with the support of FX, which is will be 4% appreciation. This is third quarter. So that will actually be translating to about 4% of revenue. Did I answer your question?",79

The reason I made the prediction -- and it has come true. The reason I made the prediction was that we reduced our own inventory in the third quarter. And while we were reducing the inventory, naturally, the utilization was held low. Now our own inventory reduction has been completed at the end of September and in the fourth quarter, and our utilization reflects a normal mode of operation. You see, when you are reducing inventory, you have to mix that stuff. Therefore, your utilization is low. Now after your inventory reduction has been completed, then you have to make it up slowly. Therefore, your utilization comes up. So that makes...",162

We are working with several customers on the development phase. The impact to us -- that will impact to us will be minimal even next year. So that 28 is going to run for quite a long time. So I do think that the CoWoS will start with 28, and I think that we are -- well, we are already working with a few customers also on the 20-nanometer CoWoS. So by the time 20-nanometer is at volume production, I think the impact on revenue will be reasonably significant. I can't really -- I can't quantify it beyond that.",128

The -- of course, the ideal situation financially is for the increase of depreciation to be below the increase of revenue. Now you have to keep in mind that depreciation is accounted in NT even though the expenditure is largely in U.S. dollars. But once we get the equipment, once we install the equipment, the depreciation phase is in NT. So the depreciation cost is in NT. Now the -- so on that basis, this year, our revenue increase in NT is not very great. What is it? It’s almost flat, isn't it? It's almost flat, and yet, we had a depreciation increase of 23%. That is certainly far from ideal. Now next year, I said earlier that I expect our U.S. dollar revenue growth will be several points more than 3% to 5%. So we certainly -- we'd like to that the NT revenue growth will be comparable, and that’s assuming the exchange rate does very well, very much. Now if the NT growth is in the -- NT revenue growth is in the, oh, let's say, whatever, 6% to 8% range, 6% to 8% range and the depreciation increase is less than 20%, then that’s a heck of a lot better situation then we have this year.

The 2.5% higher were higher for several factors: number one, the better cost in fourth quarter, this is the 1.2%; better utilization, this is the 0.7%; better foreign exchange rate, 1.7%; and less desirable product mix because we’re ramping 28.

With your revenue guidance to be down about 1 to 3% sequentially in 4Q and the NT dollar currency forecast to appreciate about 4%, that would mean your U.S. dollar-based decline is about 4% if we assume the midpoint of your guidance. Would the shipments be down about that much and thereby helping inventory digestion? Is that how we should think about this?",87

Okay. So you got a little bit of ASP decline, a bit, not much. Okay. And then I guess Dr. Chang -- and the follow-up on today’s -- my question on since that, because you did mention that TSMC contemplated deeply when to deploy since that -- whether it would be 14 or earlier, I'm wondering why TSM wouldn’t deploy this basically just as quickly as possible, particularly since you guys have done so much work over the years in this process and the benefit to -- the tower seems to be quite favorable. So I'm wondering what the thought process is. Could this be something that you would try to deploy sooner in this fiscal, why not?",121

Now however, we could try to catch up by accelerating FinFET and putting it on 20 and the alternative is what we chose. The alternative is to find a way that our planar 20 can compete what Intel’s FinFET 22 and the delay -- the use of FinFET to the 14-nanometer generation. We'll be more ready with FinFET when the 14 generation comes, and we chose that alternative. We believe our 20-nanometer planar in its ecosystem is competitive with Intel’s 22 FinFET in Intel’s ecosystem. We believe that.",117

So I just wanted to ask, just looking at the costs, Lora referred to the fact that cost down in Q4 will help the margin. Just wondered if you can elaborate on that or if there's anything particular in terms of the de-bottlenecking. Or is it general reduction in operating costs or manufacturing costs? And also, if we do a quick analysis of the non-depreciation costs per wafer in the third quarter, it did rise by about 6% or 7% q-over-q. So I'm just wondering specifically what drove that increase?",99

The cost improvement actually is -- what I'm talking about is mainly the material wafer costs that had some improvement.

So those non-depreciation fixed cost on a per-wafer basis would be higher. So that's why the manufacturing -- the so called non-depreciation manufacturing cost was higher in third quarter compared to the second quarter.",73

And a very quick follow-up question. Just if you draw the parallels with the challenging experience the industry went through in ’08 and ’09, what parallels are there at the moment in terms of what your customers are saying sentiment wise? I mean just your own gut feel. And I guess you're looking for the industry to essentially recover next year. To what extent -- how far are we into the bottoming process for the industry based on where we are today? And when does that inflection point come? I know this is being referred to earlier on in the call. Essentially, are we looking for the business and the industry to rebound into the second quarter?",119

But I -- in the ’08-‘09 situation, the depth of the plunge was much greater. And the plunge was just for 2 quarters: Fourth quarter of ‘08 and first quarter of ‘09. And then in the second quarter of ‘09, there was a surge. A surge began, and the surge was very strong, and it continued till the third quarter and then sort of stabilized a little bit from the fourth quarter on but continued to grow, actually. But the slope of the surge obviously became gentler from the fourth quarter -- from fourth quarter '09 on. So that was the experience. Now if you try to draw an exact analog here, I would think that in the first quarter of next year, we will start to get orders, strong orders, and revenue will probably begin to surge in the second quarter of next year. Again, I mean, as I said earlier that it’s problematic to draw conclusions, to draw predictions about the future from experience in the past.",191

So I guess the overall read is, for both your sales and many other companies in the sector, although things are maybe getting incrementally worse, so nowhere near a comparison with the 08’, '09 situation.

And semiconductor is a little different and -- semiconductor is a little different, because we -- I think we do have a killer at just the version. That’s the mobile product, so that’s our new killer app. And then I think TSMC is even a little more different than the semiconductor.
