380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2020",2020-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4842.0,1891053.0,74033456.0,Presenter Speech,Jen-Chau Huang,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2019. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2020. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 8.3% sequentially to TWD 317 billion, driven by high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and HPC-related applications using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology. 
Gross margin increased 2.6 percentage points sequentially to 50.2%, thanks to a higher level of capacity utilization and continuous cost improvement, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. 
Total operating expenses increased by TWD 3.6 billion, reflecting higher development activities for 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer as well as opening expenses in preparation for 5-nanometer ramp. 
Operating margin increased by 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 39.2%. 
Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached TWD 4.47 and ROE was 28.9%. 
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology continued to ramp strongly and accounted for 35% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter; 10-nanometer was 1%; and 16-nanometer was 20%. Advanced technologies, defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 56% of wafer revenue, up from 51% in the third quarter. 
On a full year basis, 7-nanometer contribution increased from 9% in 2018 to 27% of wafer revenue in 2019; 10-nanometer was 3%; and 16-nanometer was 20%. Advanced technologies accounted for 50% of total wafer revenue, up from 41% in 2018. 
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by platform. Our fourth quarter revenue growth was driven mainly by smartphone and HPC. Smartphone increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to account for 53% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC increased 6% to account for 29%. IoT decreased 4% to account for 8%. Automotive remained flat and accounted for 4%. 
On a full year basis, smartphone and IoT led the growth with 12% and 33%, respectively, while HPC, automotive and DCE decreased 8%, 7% and 8%, respectively. If we exclude cryptocurrency from both years, HPC would have grown mid-single digit in 2019. Overall, smartphone accounted for 49% of our 2019 revenue; HPC, 30%; and IoT, 8%. 
Moving onto the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 583 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 96 billion as we increased TWD 33 billion in short-term borrowings mainly for hedging purpose, TWD 51 billion in payables to suppliers and TWD 13 billion in dividends payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 10 days to 55 days due to higher wafer shipments during the quarter. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 203 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 170 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 52 billion for first quarter '19 cash dividend. We also increased 33 -- TWD 36 billion in short-term loans for hedging purpose. Overall, our cash balance slightly increased TWD 3 billion to TWD 455 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures reached USD 5.6 billion and totaled USD 14.9 billion for the full year. 
Now let's take a look at the recap of our performance in 2019. 2019 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry given the rising macroeconomic uncertainties and supply chain inventory correction, to name a few. However, we are able to grow our revenue by 1.3% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term and 3.7% in NT dollar term. 
Gross margin decreased 2.3 percentage points to 46% primarily because of lower capacity utilization in the first half of the year. Operating margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 34.8%. Overall, full year EPS slightly declined 1.7% to TWD 13.32. 
On cash flow, we spent TWD 460 billion in CapEx, while we generated TWD 615 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 155 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 259 billion in cash dividends, an increase of 25% from the previous year. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 10.2 billion and USD 10.3 billion, which represents a 1.4% sequential decrease at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 29.9, gross margin is expected to be between 48.5% and 50.5%; operating margin between 37.5% and 39.5%. 
Now I will look -- I would like to make one more comment on tax rate. In the past, we needed to accrue tax on undistributed earnings, which trigger a much higher tax rate in the second quarter. Now, due to the tax regulation changes, we can offset the tax with our capital investments and no longer need to incur the tax expense on undistributed earnings. 
Meanwhile, we are still subjected to the alternative minimum tax. As a result, we will still have a full year tax rate approximately 12%, and this will be equally applied to all 4 quarters of the year. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Let me follow by making a few comments about near-term demand in inventory and 2020 capital budget. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 317.2 billion or USD 10.4 billion, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to better demand from smartphone-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago. Concluding 2019, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory, declined 3%, while foundry was flat. TSMC's revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, outpacing both the semiconductor ex memory and foundry industry growth.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory continue to be digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to reduce to the seasonal level exiting 2019, setting up a healthier inventory base entering 2020. 
Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, our business is expected to be better than the seasonality in recent years, supported by continued ramp of 5G smartphones. 
Now I will talk about our capital budget in 2019 and 2020. We expect the ramp of 5G-related and HPC applications to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. In order to meet this increased demand and support of customers' capacity needs, we raised our 2019 CapEx guidance by $4 billion to $14 billion to $15 billion, and we ended up spending $14.9 billion. 
Our 2020 capital budget is expected to be between USD 15 billion and USD 16 billion. Out of the $15 billion to $16 billion CapEx for 2020, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies including 3-, 5- and 7-nanometers. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask-making and about 10% for specialty technologies. With this level of capital spending in 2020, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. 
Now let me turn the microphone to C.C.",1173
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2020",2020-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4842.0,1891053.0,74033457.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our 2020 full year outlook. 
For the full year of 2020, we forecast the overall semiconductor market growth excluding memory to be 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 17%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth by several percentage points in U.S. dollar term. Our 2020 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, where we see strong interest from all 4 growth platform which are mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive. 
Now let me talk about 5G and HPC as the major long-term growth driver for TSMC. We continue to see stronger deployment of 5G networks and smartphones in several major markets around the world. We reiterate mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphones of the total smartphone market in 2020. We also forecast a faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years while silicon content of 5G smartphone will be substantially higher than that of a 4G smartphone. 
In addition, the significant performance, bandwidth and latency improvement of 5G network will drive AI application and unlock new usage cases such as real-time response and control across many different types of connected end devices. We believe 5G is a multiyear megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the course of all 4 of our growth platform in the next several years. 
With 5G driving exponential network in the amount of big data being generated and continuous improvement in algorithm, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increase in computation power. Thus, HPC become another major long-term growth driver for TSMC. 
CPU, networking and AI accelerator will be the main growth area for our HPC platform. By working diligently to provide the foundry industry the most advanced technology and making it available to all the product innovators, TSMC can expand the pool of innovators who fuel the semiconductor industry growth. With the successful ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the upcoming ramp of N6, N5 and N3, we are able to widen our customer product portfolio and expand our addressable market. 
We also see growth in networking, thanks to 5G infrastructure deployment over the next few years. With 5G and HPC applications as a major growth driver, we now expect to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms. 
Now I'll talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6. As N7 enters its third year of ramp, we continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive applications. Our N7+ is entering its second year of ramp. N7+ is the industry's first high-volume production with EUV photolithography technology while paving the way for N6. 
Our N6 provides a clear migration path for the next wave N7 products as its design rule are fully compatible with N7 while providing 15% to 20% higher density, which improve power consumption when compared to N7. N6 is on track for risk production in fourth quarter this year and volume production before the end of this year. N6 will have 1 more EUV layer than N7+ and will further extend our N7 family way into the future. We expect our 7-nanometer family to continue to grow in its third year and contribute more than 30% of our wafer revenue in 2020. 
Now allow me to talk about our N5 volume production. Our N5 technology is a full node stride from our N7, with 80% logic density gain and about a 20% speed gain compared with 7-nanometer. N5 will adopt the EUV extensively and is well on track for volume production in first half this year and with good yield. We expect a very fast and smooth ramp of N5 in the second half of this year, driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We expect 5-nanometer to contribute about 10% of our wafer revenue in 2020. N5 will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. We will offer continuous enhancement to further improve the performance, power and density of our 5-nanometer technology solution into the future as well. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Finally, I'll talk about our N3 status. We are working with customers on N3's design, and the technology development progress is going well. We have many technology options in development and we carefully evaluate all the different approaches. Our decision is based on technology maturity, performance and cost. Our N3 will offer another full node scaling benefit in terms of performance, power and density as compared with our N5 technology. We expect our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. We will announce more details about our N3 technology at our TSMC North America Technology Symposium on April 29. 
Thank you for your attention.",852

I guess with the trade war eased a bit, there's still a couple of maybe political issues out there, so I wanted to just start with that. The first one, if you could give some color on TSMC's U.S. content and just if -- maybe the calculation, there's talk about the content threshold lowered to 10%, and if -- there's some talk the equipment may be excluded from that calculation. So if you could give a bit more color about that. 
And then second, with more of the geopolitical concerns about some of the military technology, you've talked in the past about not needing to or having more scale with the fabs in Taiwan, but if any new considerations on the fab location?",124
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2020",2020-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4842.0,1891053.0,74033461.0,Answer,Mark Liu,,Executives,6,"Yes. Happy New Year, everyone. On the possible further tightening up of export control from the U.S. government, I think this is -- they haven't really announced with the specifics about the rules. So everything I say here can only be a speculation. So -- and particularly, I don't want to comment on particular customers. But one thing for sure is our business profile is massive. We are everyone's foundry. And we will deal with each customer fairly and equally. 
Secondly is we have been and we will follow the law and regulation. So upon the regulation being effective, we will carefully study and evaluate, product by product, our eligibility in the export. And we really have a very sophisticated export control system. As you might know, every product is calculated automatically. Every product is different in terms of their content. So it's really difficult to describe to you generally what is the content percentages. But I can just tell you that whatever you read on the newspaper, it's not true, okay? So we are prepared to deal with this new export control regulation.",184

And thanks for clarifying especially that it's not a node by node, which some of the press was speculating. 
The second question, I just wanted to ask on the higher CapEx, where it came in the high end of guidance and a higher range of CapEx for 2020. If you could talk maybe the areas where the incremental increase both just from an investment, where that new spend is coming, and maybe what changed on the demand side versus a few months ago to lift the budget. 
And then the second part, because of this higher base, how you're looking at kind of the base over the -- say, the following year because now we have a 2-year higher elevated spend, if, say, some moderation from there.",128
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2020",2020-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4842.0,1891053.0,74033463.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,8,"Yes, we did increase substantial amount on the CapEx. Let me give you some color why we did that, okay? We expect -- actually, we expect the mobile phone and HPC, these 2 segments probably goes above 20% this year; and with another 2 segments, 2 platforms, automotive and IoT, probably in mid-teens. So put all together, we had to increase the capacity. We work with the customer to fulfill their demand and so that's a result of why we increase our capacity. 
Now your question about our growth?",89

And then the 2 -- maybe the follow-up I had was just the moderation of CapEx for -- if you expect that to maybe moderate from the very high level next year. In the back end, 10% would be $1.5 billion for CapEx. But I'm curious, maybe between back end and mask, if really over a $1 billion back end CapEx.",62

And second question is for the gross margin. For your first quarter revenue guidance, U.S. dollar's down slightly. However, apparently in first quarter, we have fewer working days. So it means that your utilization in first quarter definitely is going to be much higher than 4Q. And also for 7-nanometer, last quarter we said that we already -- gross margin has already reached corporate average. And also, I believe in first quarter, we probably won't have the inventory reevaluation. So all on this, so is your gross margin guidance, 48.5% to 50.5%, a little bit conservative?",97

You used to mention that the TSMC becomes more important in terms of geopolitic situations. So does that change your cost of your -- does that change your equation in terms of building out the fab, the cost structures? So in the past, we only care about the manufacturing cost as a main cost factor. But given the current situation, do you think that you have to put that into your consideration as well, i.e., you've built -- management keep on saying that building a factory outside of Taiwan is a lot more expensive than doing that in Taiwan. But with all the geographical risk, that building a factory outside of Taiwan becomes right. Do you see the increasing pressure on that? Do you want to -- do we expect any changes on that?",142

We continue to use 50% gross margin. We think it's still a very good target. Of all the 6 -- I just mentioned the 6 factors that will affect our profitability. One of them actually relates to the ramp of new nodes. So the ramp of every new node, we will see margin dilutions. This relates to your second question. And indeed, we are seeing a margin dilution in the second half of this year from the N5 ramp. Is it going to be better than before? Yes, but only slightly, okay? And the other factors that I just mentioned include the foreign exchange rate, which is really uncertain for anybody to guess.

However, we have reiterated saying that 28-nanometer's capacity, I think, overbuilt in this industry. So the utilization is still below our average in 28-nanometer. We expect it will be improved in next 1 to 2 years when we develop a new specialty technology for all our customers to utilize it. And we start to see the sign because of former new tapeouts.

So my follow-up question on that is smartphone, we understand. So if A brand, they lose share, B, C brands will pick up. But what about the infrastructure?

My second question is on the guidance that the company give this year, that the foundry industry is growing 17%; semis, excluding memory, is about 8%. I think if I look at that historically, the -- usually, I think the formula for TSMC's growth is usually the global GDP. And semi is about like 2, 3 percent point above that, foundry a little bit above that and TSMC is a little bit above that. So TSMC get a 5% to 10% of the CAGR. So I think that is a very simple formula. But has the formula changed? So I mean that historically, semiconductor is highly correlated with the global GDP growth to some extent. So if TSMC with the foundry industry growing faster, is it like the foundry/TSMC becomes the outlier or it's because also that you're implying that the whole economy is growing faster?",147

For example, TSMC always say 5% to 10% CAGR is that our goal. We certainly hope that we can exceed that. But this year, it's still too early to say. But we stay what we said.

This year, the formula does change a bit. We put it in the Korean -- captive Korean player foundry -- captive into the foundry, okay, which is they do that and constantly.

So -- but if we also look at -- I think the company also made a comment that you're seeing your 5-year CAGR to be higher, at the high end of the 5% to 10%. So it's not just 1 year, right, it's just a flash in the pan. So I think if you look at the longer time frame, which means I think there will be more -- I think the correlation with the global GDP, I think that makes more sense, more representative. So does that also mean that like semis and tech innovation is going to drive the global economy grow faster in the next couple of years? Or is it just because global GDP still grow as the growth at 2%, 3% but semis, foundries, TSMC become the outlier, that gap is getting bigger?",139

Wei,,Executives,102,"Oh, we don't want to say it's an outlier. We continue to forecast global GDP still in a normal situation, provided the trade tension between the 2 big countries did not deteriorate. But for semiconductor, I want to say that the content of the semiconductor in our life continue to increase, provided -- see that you can see the big example in the smartphone. You can see the big example in the automotive. And you can see that IoT is a big increase also. So now it's changing our world. And that all because of semiconductor content. It's not because of what GDP suddenly become grow faster. And it's not because of semiconductors is an outlier. It will continue to be this way.",123

Could you talk a little bit about why only high end of 5% to 10% when the CapEx increase seems to be 40% to 50% from the last kind of $10 billion to $12 billion -- $10 billion to $11 billion CapEx change over the last 5 years? Any reasons why we are a bit more cautious? Do we feel that the 5G cycle after a couple of years could start to kind of decelerate? Especially given this year, we are already starting off with a very strong 20% kind of growth. So just wanted to think about the puts and takes in terms of the high end of 5% to 10%, and why not stronger than that growth, given the big jump in CapEx and indication that CapEx could stay around these levels even going into the 3-nanometer era.",154

Gokul, let me try to summarize your question. Basically, Gokul was asking why our long-term growth target is only at the high end of 5% to 10% when our CapEx has increased 40% to 50% versus the $10 billion to $12 billion in the past. He is asking or wondering, is this because we take a more cautious view that 5G cycle may be strong this year and next year but may slow down after that? And so why do we still say at the high end of 5% to 10%?",92

But afterwards, when we see the ramp in 5G deployment, we increased the CapEx. And now we're looking at high end of the 5% to 10% range. So that is the difference. 
And also let me explain this from a capital intensity point of view. Last year, while we increased the CapEx, the capital intensity was over 40%. This year, we think it will be lower than 40%. And from next year on, although it's still pretty early, we think it will be somewhere between 30% or 35%, which is pretty similar to the old norm that we used to say before.",122

My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance for the current quarter.
First quarter revenue in NT decreased 2.1% sequentially, which is less than seasonality, due to the increase in HPC-related demand and the continued ramp of 5G smartphones. Gross margin increased 1.6 percentage points sequentially to 51.8%, thanks to a higher level of utilization, which was partially offset by an unfavorable exchange rate. Total operating expenses decreased by TWD 2.6 billion, mainly as 5-nanometer technology moved from R&D stage to mass production during the first quarter. Operating margin increased by 2.2 percentage points sequentially to 41.4%.
Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 4.51, and ROE was 28.4%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology contributed 35% of wafer revenue in the first quarter. 10-nanometer was 0.5% and 16-nanometer was 19%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 55% of wafer revenue.
Now move on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 9% quarter-over-quarter to account for 49% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 3% to account for 30%. IoT increased 8% to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 1% to account for 4%. Digital consumer electronics increased 44% to account for 5%.
Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 562 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities remained relatively flattish. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days was 42 days. Days of inventory decreased 2 days to 53 days with higher wafer shipment in the quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 203 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 193 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for second quarter '19 cash dividend. We also increased TWD 20 billion in short-term loans mainly for hedging purpose. Overall, our cash balance decreased TWD 25 billion to TWD 431 billion at the end of the quarter.
In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures reached USD 6.4 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 10.1 billion and USD 10.4 billion, which represent a 0.6% sequential decrease at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30, gross margin is expected to be between 50% and 52%, operating margin between 39% and 41%.
Now I will hand over the call to C.C. for his key message.",445

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Let me start with COVID-19 preventive measurement at TSMC. To prevent the epidemic of COVID-19, many of us around the world have had to change the way we live and work since mid-January. Let me start with by sharing something that -- what we take at TSMC. Our top priority is to protect the health and safety of all our employees at all times. At the outbreak of COVID-19, we immediately suspended all noncritical business travel and restricted visit on-site access with mandatory self-screening. All employees are required to do daily temperature checks with self-declaration, wear masks all the time and practice social distancing in the office. Since late March, we have taken further preventive actions such as having employee work from home where possible. We are physically separating on-site employees into red and blue teams to reduce the risk of community spread.
On March 18, we found one employee who tested positive for COVID-19 and immediately began receiving appropriate care. Today, this employee has recovered, is out of the hospital and is staying at home for additional quarantine. We were able to suitably trace all the other individuals who were in contact. The neighboring employees have all tested negative, while all other employees who were in contact has entered and completed the 14-day self-quarantine and now back to work. As a result of the strict preventive measures taken by TSMC, we have not seen any disruption of our fab operations so far.
Now I will talk about our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 310.6 billion or USD 10.3 billion. In line with our guidance given 3 months ago, our first quarter business declined about 1% sequentially, which is much less than seasonality, due to the increase in HPC-related demand and the continued ramp of 5G smartphone. Moving into second quarter 2020, we expect our revenue to be flattish, as weaker mobile product demand is expected to be balanced by continued 5G deployment and HPC-related product launches. While we have not seen significant order reduction from our customers, so far, we do observe supply chain dislocation and weaker end market demand from COVID-19 in the first half of this year. In the near term, we have observed weaker end demand in applications, such as consumer electronics and automotives. Meanwhile, we have also observed better demand from HPC, as compared to 3 months ago, driven by the trends such as work from home.
Looking ahead to the second half of this year. Due to the market uncertainty, we adopt a more conservative view as we expect COVID-19 to continue to bring some level of disruption to the end market demand. For the whole year of 2020, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory growth, to be flattish to slightly decline, while foundry industry growth is expect to be high single-digit to low-teens percentage. For TSMC, although this uncertainty exists, we believe we can do better and grow at mid- to high-teens percentage in 2020 in U.S. dollar term. All the above forecasts for semiconductor exclude memory market, foundries and TSMC are based upon the assumption of COVID-19 stabilizing in June of this year.
Now let me talk about the progress and development of 5G and HPC. With the recent disruption from COVID-19, we now expect global smartphone units to decline high single digit year-over-year in 2020. However, 5G network deployment continues and OEMs continue to prepare to launch 5G phones. We maintain our forecast for mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market in 2020. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphones, as compared to 4G, over the next several years, with substantially higher silicon content. Thus, we believe 5G as a multiyear megatrend is still strong and will fuel the growth of all 4 of our growth platforms in the next several years. HPC will be another major long-term growth driver for TSMC. In the next few years, a smarter and more intelligent world connected by 5G networks will require massive increase in computation power. CPU, networking and AI accelerators will be the main growth areas for our HPC platform. Thus, while near-term uncertainty exists, we will continue to invest in our R&D and technology capabilities to capture the future opportunities from the strong 5G-related and HPC megatrends.
We reaffirm our goal to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.
Now let me talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6.
In its third year of ramp, N7 continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive applications. Our N7+ is entering its second year of ramp using EUV lithography technology while paving the way for N6. Our N6 provides a clear migration path for next-wave N7 products, as the design rules are fully compatible with N7.
N6 has already entered its production and is on track for volume production before the end of this year. N6 will have one more EUV diode than N7+ and will further extend our 7-nanometer family well into the future. We expect our 7-nanometer family to continue to grow in its third year and reaffirm it will contribute more than 30% of our wafer revenue in 2020.
Now let me talk about our N5 status. N5 is already in volume production with good yield. Our N5 technology is a full node stride from our N7, with 80% logic density gain and about 20% speed gain compared with N7. N5 will adopt EUV extensively. We expect a very fast and smooth ramp of N5 in the second half of this year driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We'll reiterate 5-nanometer will contribute about 10% of our wafer revenue in 2020. N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with best PPA. We observed a higher number of tapeouts, as compared with N7 at the same period of time. We will offer continuous enhancements to further improve the performance, power and density of our 5-nanometer technology solution into the future as well. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about our N3 status. Our N3 technology development is on track, with risk production scheduled in 2021 and target volume production in second half of 2022. We have carefully evaluated all the different technology options for our N3 technology, and our decision is to continue to use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and costs. Our N3 technology will be another full node stride from our N5, with about a 70% larger density gain, 10 to 15 speed gain and 25% to 30% power improvement as compared with N5. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced and will further extend our leadership position well into the future.
Now let me turn the microphone over to our CFO.",1195

Let me start by making some comments on our second quarter and second half profitability outlook. We have just guided second quarter of 2020 gross margin to be similar to the first quarter. Looking ahead to second half, we expect the steep ramp-up of our 5-nanometer will dilute our second half gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points. In addition, our overall capacity utilization may be impacted by the uncertainty from COVID-19. Thus, our gross margin in the second half of this year may be several percentage points lower than in the first half. 
Looking at our other profitability factors. Our leadership in technology development and ramp-up remains strong. We continue to provide value to our customers and drive aggressive cost reduction. Thus, we believe our long-term gross margin target of about 50% is still a good target.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years. While the impact of COVID-19 virus brings near-term uncertainties, we expect the multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. Thus, we reaffirm our 2020 capital budget to be between USD 15 billion and USD 16 billion.
Now I will make some comments on our capital management and shareholder returns.
The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the capital -- the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable cash dividend to shareholders. With our solid financial performance, strong balance sheet and cash position and capacity to take on debt, we're able to aggressively invest in our future to enhance our technologies and capabilities. This enables us to continue to outgrow the semiconductor industry even in an extreme macroeconomic environment like this year. With our rigorous capital management, we remain committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. Meanwhile, with the semiconductor industry's highest credit rating, we're able to bolster our cash balance by issuing corporate bonds at a low interest rate.
That concludes my message.",363

As I state in the statement, that we saw some consumer electronics such as smartphone or those kind of things has been in the end market become much softer than we thought. However -- so we do the forecasts now based on the customers' orders because customer today, as I said, we did not see any significant reduction in our customer demand. But we do expect the end demand will have some impact in the following second half of this year. As a result, we changed our -- well, we modified our forecasts as compared with the January number. To be specific, except for the HPC -- the HPC has been very strong.

We are now aware about the recent development of U.S. trade rule changes. However, these rule changes have -- is still under draft. And they are information, but we know that the final rule is not yet finalized. And after the finalized draft, there will be another 30 days of grace period for the industry to respond. In general, we share the concerns, all the concerns of U.S. semiconductor communities such as voices from semi or from SIA. While the draft is not finished, we are -- we have studied the various scenarios. And yes, there may be some near-term impact. And we will take -- work with our customer dynamically, and we will take appropriate measures so that to minimize the impact to TSMC. However, for the mid- to long term, we think the underlying megatrend still holds. And some supply chain will be readjusted, and the balance will start. So we will be able to still capture our mid- to long-term growth opportunities. And therefore, the current long-term CapEx, we do not see this impacted by this change.",191

I think given that, if we look at the last 2, 3 times where we've had economic corrections, it seems like the industry has seen meaningful declines in revenues. Now we are looking at largely flattish for semi ex memory. So are we expecting that we get a pretty strong rebound into the second half of the year in terms of -- so I just wanted to go through TSMC's process of thinking about overall semiconductor industry growth and since we also expect small inventory correction happening in second half of the year. And I have a follow-up question as well.",118

Gokul, let me summarize your question. I think your question is asking, in the past when there's a severe economic correction, the semi industry also sees a large revenue decline, so why is semi ex memory this year kind of flattish?

Well, continue to ramp up. That's all I can answer you. So how many customer or how many tapeouts it is? Actually the customer come from everywhere. I mean that's a mobile phone, HPC-related and maybe some of them from the IoT and automotive. We don't know yet, but today we've got a lot of tapeout from mobile and HPC related. The cycle time, the yield today is quite good. Actually, it's ahead of our plan. And what is the cost? Cost is reasonable.

Okay. The second thing is that we have a lot of investor asking that, because of current situation, the end consumer, the demand is facing some correction. Why is that TSMC as a foundry supplier for anyone do not see a meaningful orders cut as of now? I mean why is that a cause to this kind of big time lag between the real end demand situation and production?",71

Let me just repeat your question, Bruce. Your question is when you – no, investors are asking, when you look at the end consumer, you can see a very big correction.

And we are ramping up the 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer, and that have been very popular and widely used by all the customer. And not every foundry offer this kind of a technology coverage, right? And so we are not -- we -- in our technology and our ramping up, we are not seeing any big effect yet. So that what’s some delay the end market to TSMC's business. But we do see that the end market is dropping, so we also expect some demand from TSMC's customer will be adjusted.

So historically when TSMC, if I’m still remembering this right, when TSMC -- every time when TSMC lower revenue guidance within a year, the CapEx will be adjusted lower accordingly. Even if just a 5% adjustment on the revenue, you also adjust the CapEx, sometimes even bigger [ than the revenue ]. This time -- it looks like this time, the revenue adjustment is as large as 8% or high single digit, but CapEx remained the same. So my question is, first, is it because like TSMC sees something very important, very big and very [ confirmed ] in the pipeline through the end of this year and to 2021 that you didn’t need to spend or no matter what? Or TSMC started moving on some flexibility here given that some equipment supplier or maybe one particular equipment supplier had a very long lead time and [ bargaining ] power, to some extent, and you are also fighting with the competitors starting to affect equipment visibility. So you don't want to cancel that at this point. Which one is more true?",190

Let me summarize your question to make sure we understand. Your question is on our CapEx. And your question is that, while we have our full year outlook, we have adjusted versus what we said in January, we are reaffirming our CapEx guidance of January. So you want to know why are we not adjusting our CapEx or because our full year outlook has been adjusted. And you propose 2 reasons. Is it because, a, we have confirmed customer demand profile that goes into 2021 and beyond so that's why we continue to invest? Or is it, b, that certain of our equipment suppliers may have a very strong bargaining power so we have no choice, so to speak, but to continue to spend because our equipment supplier has a strong position? Is that correct?",137

I think in your opening remarks you mentioned the COVID situation, the virus to peak in June, but there seems to be some signs of a second-wave outbreak globally. So in a change of the COVID scenario, what would be the -- TSMC's growth in 2020? And by the way, the second question is very simple on 3-nanometer.

Now the first one, we are talking about the impact of COVID-19 and we are giving our forecast based on the COVID-19 will be stabilized, the impact or the spread over will be stabilizing in June. What happens if it's longer than that? I don't know.

I think it's for down 3% revenue just backing out what you said about Q2 and what you delivered in Q1. Now you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen no major order cuts as yet. But if I just step back and look at your Q1, TSMC just posted smartphone sales growth up 50% year-on-year in smartphones when smartphone demand is negative. Your China business in Q1 is up almost 80% year-on-year. And your biggest customer in China, Huawei, has posted inventories up 75% in 2019. 
So just looking at all this, maybe fabless customers are not building inventory per se, but it's clear that the end customer, the OEMs, seem to be significantly stockpiling and they're not cutting orders yet. So given all this, I'm just wondering how big you think the stockpiling is at present further up the food chain and why it won't lead to a more material decline in your second half outlook than you're suggesting.",173

So in the past downturns, we've seen meaningful IDM outsourcing happen. I think if I think about GFC, we had multiple current customers of TSMC give up leading-edge and move to TSMC. How should we think about -- or how is TSMC thinking about the potential for further IDM outsourcing over the next 2 to 3 years as we get through this process, which will potentially put some pressure on some of the potential IDMs as well? 
And a related question is, I think Mark has answered in the past about potential M&A opportunities. Do we consider overseas fab acquisition as a right strategy for TSMC to -- if it comes with a meaningful customer attached to it? I know that TSMC has not really done any meaningful fab acquisitions for a long time, I think probably 2000 was the last meaningful one with [ WaferTech ]. Just wanted to understand how the management team thinks about fab acquisition as a potential strategy or any thoughts around that.",189

So Gokul, you have 2 questions. One is on the IDM outsourcing and then do we see the further potential for further IDM outsourcing under this environment in the next few years. 
And the second part of your question refers to our potential M&A. And your question is that in terms of an overseas fab acquisition, will we consider an overseas fab acquisition if meaningful customer business were to be attached to it?",74

Wei,,Executives,136,"Well, let me answer the IDM outsourcing question first. The current downturn might further accelerate the outsourcing for IDMs, but we don't know yet. However, in the long term, IDM outsourcing will continue as the foundry model has proven to be an economic win-win situation for both foundry and its customer. That, as we said, we expect this one continue to happen. This is a long-term strategy.",67

Let me answer the second question about the overseas fab acquisition. We do have continued scouting about the possible fab, but those are mostly only mature fabs, and we don't exclude the possibility, but it all depends on the investment and return. If it economically makes sense, then we go ahead. But it's also -- it's very challenging for the mature fab to be, again, financially viable so far we see. So we still continue evaluating. 
But overseas fab acquisition is unlikely to be a leading fab because our leading fab is a technology with very sophisticated complexity. And also, there is none of the fab can perform like a TSMC's fab with -- it's really a service body, technical service body. Instead of the structured facility or equipment, our fab really is a technical service body. That has to be built. And therefore, that challenged us to build -- to acquire a leading-edge fab overseas.",157

I also want to get some clarification because the recent research is showing China fab like SMIC is gaining share and I can see that makes some sense because China is pursuing localization. So what's the management forecast for your local market share in China? And what's your strategy for -- to protect your China market share?",93

So you have 2 questions, Charlie. One is what is our plans for a fab in the U.S. -- to build a fab in the U.S.? 
And then, secondly, you're asking about China, that SMIC is gaining market share. There's increased localization. So what is TSMC's share outlook for China and strategy to protect ourselves?",56

Let me answer the first question regarding U.S. fab. We are now actively evaluating the U.S. fab plain. And -- but as I told the investor before, there is a cost gap, which is hard to accept at this point. Of course, we have -- we are doing a lot of things to reduce that cost gap. One of the -- there are 2 obstacle currently is -- under actively evaluating is if we do a U.S. fab, it will have to be a leading-edge fab or at least close to leading-edge fab. And the supply chain for the leading-edge fab, at this point, it appears that we need to also establish at the same time. And currently, we are surveying our supply chain partners, whether they will be able to go along so that the quality of the material to support a leading-edge fab can be cost-effective in U.S. 
And secondly, of course, as I planning -- said earlier, this fab has to be engineering service body. It is -- in fact, Taiwan, all the fab are very highly technical people. In the fab, all master degree and above. And we try to duplicate that in the U.S., it takes a lot of planning and organization to be able to enable such a fab. So -- but there are -- as I said, there are opportunities for us in there. We tried -- hopefully, we can better tap the global talent for TSMC for the long term, expanding a new site in U.S.",255

Wei,,Executives,146,"Okay. I don't think that the SMIC is gaining share, to answer your question first. TSMC has been very competitive. In everywhere, we are -- everybody is a foundry. In every location, we offer the best technology, best service. We're working with customers closely. So we are pretty successful in gaining market share rather than just losing the market share, let me say that. 
And specifically, for China's foundry, we're also very competitive because of a lot of China customers have been working with TSMC. I know that SMIC has been very aggressive, but so far, we are competing very well. That's all I can say.",106

So if my note is correct, then in the year 1 manufacturing, the year 1 mass production for 7-, you have 30-plus tapeout on 7- and recent entry you have 50-plus and then you're going to like 100-something. So I think this year is year 1 for 5-. So we can say that you have 30-plus 5-nanometer tapeout at this point.",62

But I feel like -- I think this time TSMC, the company is addressing the questions very clearly although there is no official announcement yet and there's no official answer yet.

Second quarter revenue was flat sequentially, as the continued 5G infrastructure deployment and HPC-related product launches offset weaknesses in other platforms. Gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points sequentially to 53% mainly due to continuing high level of utilization and the absence of unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, partially offset by NT dollar appreciation in the second quarter. Total operating expenses increased by TWD 1.19 billion, mainly as TSMC supported a range of COVID-19 relief efforts. Operating margin increased by 0.8 percentage points sequentially to 42.2%.
Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 4.66, and ROE was 28.5%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 7-nano process technology contributed 36% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 16-nanometer contributed 18%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphones decreased 4% quarter-over-quarter, to account for 47% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 12%, to account for 33%. IoT decreased 5%, to account for 8%. Automotive decreased 13%, to account for 4%. Digital consumer electronics decreased 9%, to account for 5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 605 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 25 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 30 billion in short-term loans. On financial ratios, accounts receivables turnover days increased 2 days to 44 days. Days of inventory also increased 2 days to 55 days mainly due to N5 ramp and stronger N7 demand.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 170 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 127 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for third quarter cash dividend. We also increased TWD 30 billion in short-term loans and issued TWD 36 billion of corporate bonds. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 37 billion to TWD 468 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures amounted to $4.2 billion.
I've finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our third quarter guidance.
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 11.2 billion and USD 11.5 billion, which represents a 9.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 29.5, gross margin is expected to be between 50% and 52%, operating margin between 39% and 41%.
Now I will hand over the call to C.C. for his key messages.",442

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me start with our near-term demand outlook.
We concluded our second quarter with revenue of TWD 310.7 billion or USD 10.4 billion, in line with our guidance given 3 months ago. Our second quarter business increased slightly in U.S. dollar terms, as the continued 5G infrastructure deployment and HPC-related product launches offset weakness in other platforms. Moving into third quarter 2020, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies driven by 5G smartphone, HPC and IoT-related applications.
Looking at the second half of this year. COVID-19 continues to bring some level of disruption to the global economies, and uncertainty remain. We have observed weak consumer demand in the first half of this year and now expect global smartphone units to decline low-teens percentage year-over-year in 2020. However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we also observe the supply chain making effort to ensure supply chain security and actively preparing for new 5G smartphone launches. We raised our forecast for 5G smartphone penetration rate to high-teens percentage of the total smartphone market in 2020. For the full year of 2020, 5G and HPC-related applications will continue to drive semiconductor content enrichment. We now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory growth, to be flat to slightly increasing, while foundry industry growth is expected to increase to be mid- to high-teens percentage.
For TSMC, although COVID-19-related uncertainties remain, our technology leadership position enable us to outperform the foundry revenue growth. We believe we can grow above 20% in 2020 in U.S. dollar terms, including the impact from the new U.S. regulations, which I will discuss in the next session. Our 2020 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies and our specialty technology solutions, driven by customers of 5G smartphone-related product launches and expanding HPC-related opportunities.
Now let me talk about the impact of new U.S. regulations. On May 13, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a set of new export control regulations. As a global and law-abiding company, TSMC will follow all the rules and regulations fully, no doubt about it. While there may be some impact from the new U.S. regulations, TSMC's purpose to unleash innovation remain unchanged. Our leading position in the semiconductor industry [ as everyone's foundry ], technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customers' trust also remain unchanged. We will continue to build upon our trinity of strengths and conduct our business with integrity to ensure our value and contribute to the semiconductor industry. In the near term, we will work dynamically with our customer to minimize the impact to our business from new U.S. regulations.
In the mid- to long term, we believe the underlying megatrend of 5G-related and HPC applications remain intact, and supply chain can adjust and rebalance themselves. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the mid- to long-term growth opportunities. We reaffirm our goal to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our N5 ramp-up and N4 introduction.
N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in volume production with good yield, while we continue to improve the productivity and performance of the EUV tools. We are seeing robust demand for N5 and expect a strong ramp of N5 in the second half of this year driven by both 5G smartphones and HPC applications. As we observed some delays earlier this year in N5 toward deliveries due to COVID-19, we now expect 5-nanometer to contribute about 8% of our wafer revenue in 2020. We also introduced N4 as an extension of our 5-nanometer family. N4 will have compatible design rules and a highly competitive performance to cost advantages, as compared to N5, and we'll target next wave of the N5 products. Volume production is targeted for 2022. Thus, we are confident that our 5-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with about a 70% larger density gain, 10% to 15% speed gain and 25 to 30 power improvement, as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost. Our N3 technology development is on track, with good progress. N3 risk production is scheduled in 2021, and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. We have already demonstrated 256 megabit SRAM functionality. N3 logic test chip is fully functional, with yield ahead of plan. The device performance is also on track. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced, which will further extend our leadership position well into the future.
Finally, let me talk about our U.S. fab plan. On May 15, we announced our intention to build an advanced semiconductor fab in the U.S. We have received a commitment to support this project from both the U.S. federal government and the State of Arizona. We are working closely with them as well as our supply chain partners to build an effective supply chain and make up the cost gap. This fab will start with 5-nanometer technology with 20,000 wafer per month capacity. Production is targeted to begin in 2024. The U.S. fab will enable TSMC to expand our technology ecosystem and better service our customer and partners. At the same time, as TSMC global presence increases, it will allow us to better reach global talent to sustain our technology leadership.
Now let me turn the microphone over to our CFO.",963

Let me start by making some comments on our second half profitability outlook. We have just guided third quarter 2020 gross margin to decline by 2 percentage points sequentially to 51% at the midpoint primarily due to the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 5-nanometer technology in the third quarter and a less-favorable foreign exchange rate. As compared with our expectation 3 months ago, our third quarter gross margin midpoint is higher, mainly supported by a high level of overall capacity utilization despite the uncertainty from COVID-19. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the continuous steep ramp-up of our 5-nanometer to dilute our fourth quarter gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. While the impact of COVID-19 virus brings uncertainties in 2020, we have seen our business holding up well, so far, thanks to our technology leadership at 5- and 7-nanometer nodes. Looking ahead, the multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications are expected to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. In order to meet this demand and support our customers' capacity needs, we have decided to raise our full year 2020 CapEx to be between USD 16 billion to USD 17 billion. We also reiterate that TSMC is committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
That concludes my key messages.",263

Just a quick question on how we think about N3's development. Do we feel that N3 -- since we're talking about mass production in the second half of 2022, usually, the new nodes start sometime in Q2. I just wanted to understand. Are we thinking about a slightly slower ramp for N3 compared to what we've had in the first year for N5 as well as N7? That is my first question. 
My second question is when we think about leading edge, once the U.S. regulation starts to come in, how do we think about managing capacity? Do we feel that the capacity can get filled up relatively quickly once, one of our leading customers, you have to start shipment to them? Or do we feel that there could be a couple of -- there could be some time where there could be a little bit of underutilization?",154

And also on the inventory side, it looks like it's getting increasingly difficult to look at the inventory from a comprehensive perspective. Fabless DOI may not be enough because apparently there is a lot of the Chinese companies stockpile the inventory in fear of being sanctioned. And also, across the board globally, the whole supply chain has been raising the [ fixed store level ] inventory in the past few months in fear of supply chain disruption caused by COVID-19, so -- but those are not reflected in fabless DOI.

Let me answer your question. As C.C. just reported, we are complying fully with all the regulation. And we did not take any new orders or production starts from this customer since May 15. Although this regulation is just finished their public comment period, the BIS has not did a final ruling change at this point. And so it's very early, still early to confirm, but under this current status, we do not plan to ship wafers after September 14. And yes, there will be a challenge to work dynamically with other customers. That's currently we are working with them. And -- but as you heard, we made a -- C.C. just made of -- our 2020's guidance is above 20%. That tells you we are relatively progressing well in filling up the left -- capacity left open.",139

And I look at the first half depreciation, and it looks like depreciation costs were down year-on-year.

If you could give a view on '21, I know it's in early stage, but just factoring a full year, where you mentioned Huawei and also mentioned potential -- but you don't rule out an inventory correction. And it does seem like Samsung at least is discussing a bit about some graphics and high-end smartphone business. So I'm curious, I guess, with the CapEx raise. What's driving it? If there's certain drivers that maybe lifted on the 2021, how you're seeing that.

More recently, I think since last December, and -- I think the things is getting a turn. And we did get a positive encouragement from the U.S. administration and about the cost gap. Then actually, the U.S. administration and the State of Arizona combined, they do -- they seem to be able to close the cost gap we used to hold up against this decision with their commitment, and we are preparing for that. And how do they close the cost gap? As you have been reading, we -- the U.S. congress, both in Senate and House, are all driving for the incentive packages aimed at revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. And with that, I think they do have a way to fulfill that commitment to make up the cost gap. And that was the major decision turning point.",186

And in the beginning, TSMC was saying that semi excluding memory was going to grow by 8%. And now it's going to be flattish to slightly grow, which means, I think, overall demand including everything is lower than it was 6 months ago. The foundry growth in the year beginning was 17%, but now it's pretty much unchanged at mid- to high-teens growth. TSMC's growth in the year beginning was above the industry growth. Now it's above 20% growth. 
Okay, so my question is, over the last 6 months, TSMC, along with actually everyone in the world, particularly in tech, has experienced 2 difficult challenges, including, one, COVID-19; and two, Huawei issues. But it turns out that TSMC is doing even better than there was no 2 -- these issues. And so I wonder -- actually, I think the CEO already answered that the 5G absolute unit demand is going to be higher than you saw 6 months ago, which is one, I think, a key reason, but it looks to me that the 2 factors -- 2 negative factors are still huge. Actually, one -- either one of them is big, right, so -- but in terms of being greater than -- if there's no these 2 negative impacts. So how do we think about this? Earlier also, Chairman meant that...",263

I think, to -- in essence, what you're asking is, when you look at the industry framework that TSMC provided in the beginning of the year and you look at the framework now, you point out that the semi ex memory growth in January, we said plus 8%. Now we said flat to slightly up. Foundry growth in January, we said 17% increase year-on-year. Now we say mid- to high teens, but for TSMC, growth we're now saying greater than 20%.

We are running at 20-plus-percent growth this year. Any thoughts on -- I think we expect some of these negatives trends will pass. Any thoughts on why we aren't changing our long-term 5% to 10% target, especially given you're also spending more CapEx? So if ROIC is similar, then probably you need to be at a slightly higher growth rate. That's my first question. 
Second, I just wanted to understand what is management's view on how much of this year's outgrowth, compared with semiconductor industry, have been on some of those inventory builds that your customers have undertaken in terms -- over the last several years. And there are very good years that TSMC outgrows the semiconductor industry or the foundry industry by a significant margin. And this seems to be one of those years where even smartphone is not really growing. It's actually declining, while TSMC is growing more than 20%. So I just wanted to understand. Quite a bit of that is because real demand and market share gain in leading edge, but any thoughts on how much of that do you feel is some of these inventory and supply chain security inventory that your customers are building?",208

You just want to know management's view, the fact that TSMC's growth in 2020 is outpacing the foundry industry. Can we break down what is driving this? How much of it is from supply chain efforts to ensure supply chain security? How much of it is market share gains? How much of it is due to leading edge?",74

First one, I wanted to just go back with a clarification on Huawei, if you're factoring in sort of the future view and these potential shipments. I think one is the regulations seem to allow some ways to ship to Huawei. I know you comply by the rules, but it seems to allow some way to shift directly to OSATs.

It's actually more about the half-nodes. The 4-nanometer will be available. I think mass production early 2022. So with 3 coming out late in the year, if you're expecting that would be the steep ramp so we could see high volume. It also could allow you, I think, with the tool reuse, a bit lower spend. So I'm curious how you're thinking about that. And then also on the 6-nanometer, if you're still seeing most of the customers on 7 migrate to 6, where I think previously you expected majority could end up going to that half-node.",98

Your second question, Randy, is related to N4 and N3. And thus, were we -- with the timing differences of N4 and N3, will we see a lower spend as a result? Randy's view is that N4 will be early 2022. N3 will be late 2022. And then so with some conversion, will that result in lower spend? And he also wants to know for our N6. We've talked about it before.

Wei,,Executives,156,"Well, let me answer the second one first. On the N6, yes, we have been -- offer to our customer with a compatible -- actually, it's fully compatible to N7, so it will have a very good opportunity to catch the second wave of 7 nanometers product. With the same kind of strategy, we offer N4 to follow the N5. So we do expect that N5 is a product -- finally, a lot of -- a large portion of the N5 product will move to N4. So it's not the -- through mix that we say N3 is a progress or N3 is a ramp-up. N3 is another full node. It's not -- it's more advanced by nature as -- than N5. So N3 is N3. N4 is N4.",129

Third quarter revenue increased 14.7% sequentially in NT dollars or 16.9% in U.S. dollars, as we saw strong demand for our advanced technologies and special technology solutions driven by 5G smartphones, HPC and IoT-related applications. Gross margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 53.4%, mainly thanks to a much higher level of utilization, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and unfavorable exchange rate.
The operating expenses increased by TWD 7.4 billion, mainly attributable to a higher level of development activities for N4 and N3 technologies and onetime expenses to facilitate our expansion in Hsinchu. Therefore, operating margin slightly declined by 0.1 percentage points sequentially to 42.1%.
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 5.3, and ROE was 31.3%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 8% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 35% and 18%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 61% of wafer revenue.
In terms of revenue contribution by platform, smartphone increased 12% quarter-over-quarter, to account for 46% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 25%, to account for 37%. IoT increased 24%, to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 23%, to account for 2%. Digital consumer electronics decreased 24%, to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 742 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 27 billion mainly due to the decrease of short-term loans and the decrease of current portion of bonds payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 146 billion mainly as we raised TWD 145 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios. Accounts receivable turnover days decreased 4 days to 40 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 58 days primarily due to N5 ramp.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 190 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 99 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for fourth quarter '19 cash dividend. Short-term loan decreased by TWD 17 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 136 billion mainly due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 137 billion to TWD 604 billion at the end of the quarter.
In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.4 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 12.4 billion and USD 12.7 billion, representing a 3.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.75, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin between 40.5% and 42.5%.
Now I will hand over to -- the call to C.C. for his key messages.",491

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
Now let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of TWD 356.4 billion or USD 12.1 billion, which was above our guidance, mainly due to better demand across all our platforms than our forecast 3 months ago. Moving into fourth quarter 2020, we expect our sequential growth to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.
On the inventory front, we forecast our fabless customers' overall inventory to exit the year above the seasonal level as the supply chain continues to make efforts to ensure supply chain security and actively prepare for the new 5G smartphone launches. Looking ahead, we expect our customers' overall inventory to remain above the historical seasonal level for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply chain security amidst the lingering uncertainties.
For the full year of 2020, although COVID-19 continue to bring some level of impact to the global economies, we also observe that COVID-19 is accelerating digital transformation, while 5G and HPC-related applications continue to drive semiconductor content enrichment. We now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase mid-single-digit percentage, while foundry industry growth is expected to be close to 20% year-over-year. For TSMC, our technology leadership position enable us to capture the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC. We expect to outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by about 30% in 2020 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our N5 ramp-up and N4 progress.
TSMC's N5 is foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in volume production with good yield, while we continue to improve the productivity and performance of the EUV tools to further enhance our leadership in EUV technology. Due to the robust demand from 5G smartphones and HPC applications, we'll reaffirm N5 will contribute about 8% of our wafer revenue in 2020, and we expect even higher percentage in 2021.
N4. While leveraging the strong foundation of N5 to further extend our 5-nanometer family, N4 is a straightforward migration from N5 with compatible design rules while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next-wave 5-nanometer products. N4 risk production is targeted for 4Q 2021 and volume production in 2022. With our continuous technology enhancement, we expect our 5-nanometer family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction, as compared with N5. We have chosen FinFET transistor structure for our N3 technology to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. Hence, we will offer complete platform support for both mobile and HPC applications. Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3 nanometer will be a large -- another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC 3DFabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3D IC technology road map to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplets and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better, power-efficient and smaller-form-factor benefits for our customers while shortening their time to market. This technology is including chip-stacking solutions such as SoIC as well as advanced packaging solution such as InFO and CoWoS. We are consolidating this offering under one umbrella and naming it TSMC 3DFabric.
As industry continue to seek innovations to enhance system-level performance, 3DFabric will complement our advanced technology to unleash our customers' innovation. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which including both advanced packaging and testing, to grow at a rate slightly above the corporate average in the next few years.
Now let me turn the microphone over to Wendell.",700

Let me start by making some comments on our profitability.
Our third quarter gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, to reach 53.4%, mainly as we saw a much higher-than-expected overall capacity utilization rate in the third quarter. That helped to offset the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 5-nanometer technology. We have just guided fourth quarter gross margin to decline by 0.9 percentage points sequentially to 52.5% at the midpoint primarily due to the margin dilution from the continued steep ramp-up of our 5-nanometer and a less-favorable foreign exchange rate in the fourth quarter.
Looking to 2021, we expect the strong ramp of N5 to contribute a higher percentage of revenue, as compared to 2020. The yield rate of N5 continues to improve. Similar to prior nodes, we forecast N5's gross margin to take 7 or 8 quarters to reach the corporate average level. Thus, N5 is expected to dilute our gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points for the full year of 2021.
As a reminder, the following 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix as well as foreign exchange rate. Taking all these factors into consideration, we believe a long-term gross margin of above 50% is achievable.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Our business outlook is supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced technologies and specialty technology solutions, driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications. In order to meet this demand and support our customers' capacity needs, we now expect our full year 2020 CapEx to be about USD 17 billion.
Now I will make some comments on our corporate bond issuances and capital structure. The multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications are expected to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. Given the macroeconomic uncertainties this year, a current low interest rate environment and ability to diversify our funding sources, TSMC's Board of Directors has so far approved the issuance of TWD 120 billion in NT dollar-denominated corporate bonds and $4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds. Year-to-date, we have issued TWD 89.5 billion in NT dollar-denominated and $4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds with favorable pricing terms. With our solid financial performance, strong balance sheet and cash position and capacity to take on debt, we are able to aggressively invest in our future to enhance our technologies and capabilities. This enables us to continue to outgrow the semiconductor industry through the cycles. With our disciplined capital management, we remain committed to sustainable cash dividends on both annual and quarterly basis.",453

My first question is on CapEx and capital intensity. It looks like, this year, we will come in around 36%, 37% capital intensity. Could we talk a little bit about how we should think about capital intensity and absolute CapEx as well going -- looking forward, at least on a directional basis? It seems like the investment cycle is still going to be very much intact going into next year, also looking at some of the financial options in terms of bond rates and et cetera, that TSMC has undertaken. That is my first question.
My second question is on N5. I think in previous calls we have indicated that, while N5 will be a long and large node, it may not have the same number of tapeouts as N7 has had, which is probably historical high. Is our view changing on N5? Could we talk a little bit about will N5 exceed N7 in terms of wafer capacity as well as wafer revenue in the next 2 years or so?",175

You point out that -- with the guidance that our capital intensity this year, in your estimation, is probably around 36% to 37%. So your question is how should we think about CapEx and capital intensity in the next few years. If we cannot give a quantitative number directionally, how do we see CapEx and capital intensity? And how does this tie in with our recent things like -- such as bond issuances and fundraising? How does that factor in? That's the first question. Maybe CFO Wendell can address.",119

Randy, maybe I -- let me answer this like this. We have a very high gross margins in the third quarter, and we believe we will continue have a pretty high margin in the fourth quarter. And main reason is that we are enjoying a very high utilization across almost all the nodes at this moment, but the high -- very high utilization may not continue forever, so our long-term growth target or long-term growth goal for our gross margin continues to be above 50%. In terms of dilution from N5, we see the dilution of N5 for next year to be around 2 to 3 percentage point, similar to previous nodes. And remember that the N5 will account for a much bigger percentage of our revenue next year. So as we ramp up quickly, the dilution will continue to exist. However, we are still expecting that it will reach the corporate margin by -- in 7 to 8 quarters.",161

There could be a meaningful pickup even without auto but from a content.

Let me try the overbooking inventory question in another way again, if I may. So we understand the higher inventory is structural, led by COVID-19, but how about the higher inventory? Is that led by customers' fear of foundry capacity tightness, which is now undersupplied almost everywhere, from leading edge to cutting edge? Based on the past cycle's experience, the tighter the supply of any components, the higher the risk of supply chain overbooking. It happens. I'm curious whether TSMC is seeing any gap between customers' ordering volume and your internal forecasts on end demand. Or it's not a concern at all, as all the strong orders are just a reflection of the real demand.",121

So Sebastian's question is around the inventory. And while, his view, some of the inventory may be related to COVID-19 and more structural or linger for a while, he wants to know. Is there a concern? Does TSMC have a concern that -- because the foundry is tight, that therefore the customers are doing a lot of overbooking or so-called double booking? And also, therefore, does this create a concern for TSMC, when we look at our internal forecast for the end-demand market versus customers booking, that there is a large gap and risk of shortfall?",97

And so to -- yes, to -- basically that minimize the fear of overbooking because of they don't have to be afraid of the capacity shortage and then do the overbooking to TSMC, no. We work with them as a partner. And we -- both parties and all my customer work with TSMC and tell us their view on the market, and we share our view on the market with them also. So this one minimize all -- a lot of the possibility of overbooking. And that's way that TSMC working with our customers. They are all our partners. Did that answer your question, Sebastian?",124

Yes, yes. That's a very, very good answer. My second follow-up question is that we've seen the rising cross-trade relationship risk in recent months. So I wonder if TSMC -- or your customers are concerned or discuss with you about the potential risk in production operation, as most of your fabs are located in Taiwan, and if such heightened risk continue for longer than just months, whether TSMC will keep -- consider to keep most of that fab work in Taiwan or increase investment in the other regions.",89

Let me summarize your second question. Your question is regarding that you observed rising or growing risks in the cross-trade relationships.

And that you said that we had commented in the fourth quarter '19 earnings result January this year that our 28-nanometer utilization would improve in 1 to 2 years time. And so -- and to the corporate average. And now your question is does that statement still hold true.",51

On your N6 technology. It's with one more EUV layer insertion than 7+, but N4 is with reduced mask layers from N5. And it's with a simplified process. So can you elaborate your technology development logic between N6 and N4 and also the target market for N6 and N4? And how will N6 and N4 contribute to your business, respectively, going forward?",63

So your question is regards to N6 versus N4 positioning. You point out, technology-wise, N6 has one more EUV layer than 7+, but N4 may have reduced mass players versus N5 and with simplified process. So you really -- you're asking, does N4 serve the same group or target the same group of customers as N6? Or are they separate, well, markets or targeting separate customers and applications?",70

Wei,,Executives,182,"Roland, it's actually very hard to answer your question whether the N6 is the same kind of group of N4. Let me give you some kind of idea. N6 is kind of development, continued enhancement of the N7 or N7+. And so all the second wave of the customer will use N6 when they want to enter the 7-nanometer family and because of that offer the better density, better performance and better power consumption. Now the -- similar to N6, N4 is also -- will continue to improve the N5. And we also observe that, if we can reduce mask count, we can improve the defect density. We can improve the cycle time. And we also -- at the same time, we also offer the better density, better performance, et cetera, et cetera. And so are they the same group? I cannot answer this question, but it's the same purpose. We offer N6 to be the second wave of the N7's customer. We'll offer the N4 also to offer to the second wave of the customer of N5.",178

It's a little bit complicated, yes, because N4 -- does -- is there any performance enhancement to N5? Because it is with simplified process. And still there is -- I can understand at least the improvements on defect, on this product -- production cycle times, but how about from the performance point of view? Is there going to be an enhancement to N5?",72
