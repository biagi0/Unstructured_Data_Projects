Good afternoon and happy new year to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of our 2014 performance, followed by the guidance for the current quarter.
Fourth quarter was another record-breaking quarter for TSMC, with revenue, earnings per share and the cash balance, all reached historical high levels. Despite the moderate impact from supply chain inventory corrections, our revenue increased 6.4% sequentially to reach TWD 222.5 billion. This was mainly due to the strong demand for our 20-nanometer technologies.
On the profitability side, gross margin was 49.7%, down 0.8 percentage point from the third quarter. This was attributed to 20-nanometer margin dilution and the lower capacity utilization, while cost improvements and favorable foreign exchange rates offset some of the decline.
Operating margin was 39.6%, also down 0.6 -- 0.8 percentage point from the third quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was the TWD 3.08, increased 4.8% sequentially and 78.5% year-over-year.
Let's take a look at revenue by application. During the fourth quarter, the strong 20-nanometer ramp was mainly driven by communication-related applications. As a result, communication grew 18% sequentially and the revenue contribution increased from 59% in the third quarter to 65% in the fourth quarter. As for other applications, computer grew 7%, while consumer and industrial declined 21% and 11%, respectively. 
On a full year basis, communication increased 39% and it represented 59% of our revenue. The major contributing segments included baseband/application processors, image processors and the display drivers. Another fast-growing application in 2014 was industrial and standard, which grew 30% year-over-year. The growth was mainly driven by increasing usage of power management ICs, near field communication and audio codec within the mobile devices.
By technology, 20-nanometer revenue contribution started with a very small number in the second quarter, jumped to 9% in the third quarter and then reached 21% in the fourth quarter. Such unprecedented ramp cannot be achieved without seamless teamwork with our customer, the R&D and operation people in TSMC.
On a full year basis, 20-nanometer accounted for about 9% of our full year wafer revenue. Looking forward, we are confident the 20-nanometer will continue its momentum to contribute 20% of the revenue for the whole year 2015.
Meanwhile, customer demand for our 28-nanometer wafer remained strong. Accordingly, this 2 advanced technologies, 20-nanometer plus 28 nanometers, represented 51% for our fourth quarter total wafer revenue, a big increase from the 43% in the third quarter. 
Now let me move on to the balance sheet. On the asset side, cash and marketable securities increased TWD 147 billion to reach TWD 437 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher free cash flow generated from the fourth quarter and the receipt of the TWD 30 billion guarantee deposit. 
Total liabilities increased by TWD 56 billion, mainly due to increased in guarantee deposits, increased in the tax payable for the employee profit-sharing.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days was 47 days. Days of inventory increased by 2 days to 58 days, reflecting longer production cycle time for leading notes.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 153 billion cash from operations and invested TWD 52 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 101 billion in this quarter. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 132 billion to reach TWD 358 billion at the end of the quarter.
In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditure was USD 1.7 billion. This adds to the total of USD 9.5 billion of capital expenditure for 2014.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our total performance in 2014. TSMC set the records in terms of revenue and earnings in 2014. Our revenue grew 27.8% year-over-year to reach TWD 763 billion or USD 25 billion. 
On profitability, although the rising depreciation and the fast ramp of 20-nanometer has indeed put pressure on our margins, our gross margin actually improved 2.4 percentage points to reach 49.5%. This is because the capacity we invested were fully utilized, and we continue the productivity and cost improvement, and to a lesser degree, a favorable foreign exchange rate environment.
Our operating margin increased 3.7 percentage points to reach 38.8%. This demonstrated our ability to drive higher operating efficiency. The operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 12% in 2013 to 10.6% in 2014. As a result, our full-year earnings per share increased by 40% to reach the historical high level of TWD 10.18 per share. 
On cash flow, we spent TWD 289 billion in capital expenditure, which is about the same level as 2013. Meanwhile, our operating cash flow increased 21% to reach TWD 422 billion. Accordingly, our free cash flow more than doubled in 2014.
Overall, our ROE increased by 3.9 percentage points from last year to reach 27.9% in 2014, exceeded our long-term financial goal of equal or bigger than 20%.
I have finished my report on the financial part. Now let me turn to the first quarter outlook. We expect a slightly weaker demand in the first quarter due to seasonality. However, we also anticipate that the more favorable foreign exchange rate will moderate the seasonal weakness.
Based on current business expectation and a forecast exchange rate of TWD 31.80, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between TWD 221 billion and TWD 224 billion, representing a flattish quarter.
In terms of margins, we expect the first quarter gross margin to be between 48.5% and 50.5%. And we expect operating margin to be between 38.5% and 40.5%. 
This concludes my remarks. Thank you very much.",959

I'll start with the capital expenditure for this year. As we continue to expand our business in advanced technologies, we estimate our 2015 capital expenditure to be between USD 11.5 billion to USD 12 billion, which is about a 20% to 25% year-over-year increase.
In addition to the investments for 16-nanometer capacity, we also spent for 10-nanometer tools and facilities to be ready for customer product tape-out by end of this year. More than 80% of the planned CapEx is budgeted for advanced technologies, while 8-inch capacity, tools for specialty technologies and a back-end capacity investment constitute the rest of the 20% of 2015 budget.
I also like to make some comment on the Solid State Lighting selling. As you know, last Friday, January 9, upon TSMC's Board of Director's approval, we have signed a contract with Epistar to sell TSMC's entire holding shares, which is 94% of TSMC's Solid State Lighting to Epistar. And we will exit the LED industry.
Despite several years of dedication and hard work as a late entrant to the LED industry, TSMC's Solid State Lighting faced difficulties overcoming patent obstacles and the sales channels. Not seeing how the company will be able to reach profitability due to the oversupply exacerbated by massive expansions of LED companies worldwide, we have decided to transfer the ownership to Epistar, which is the world's largest manufacturer of LED epitaxial wafers and dies.
The share transfer is valued at TWD 1.46 per share, with a total proceed of TWD 825 million to TSMC. We have took TWD 740 million impairment loss in fourth quarter last year, with the minimal impact of EPS by about TWD 0.03.
The most important part of this deal is that no Solid State Lighting employees losses his job. Everybody has a job.
My last comment is about the ASML stock sale. As you know, in August 2012, we acquired about 21 million shares of ASML. Under its customer coinvestment program, the purchase price was EUR 39.91 per share, for a total of EUR 838 million. There was a lockup period of 2.5 years. 
In the last 2 years, TSMC has entered several hedging contracts that fully covered our position with an average hedge price of EUR 62.59 per share, resulting in a locking profit of EUR 483.5 million.  As the lockup period is to be expired in April this year, we will be able to book a total profit of about TWD 21 billion in 2015. This onetime non-op gain is expected to increase our EPS by TWD 0.61 in second quarter and TWD 0.13 in third quarter. And for the full year, will be about TWD 0.75. 
That concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to C.C. -- to Mark.",463
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5933.0,746613.0,32723121.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,4,"Okay. I will follow to give you key messages on the new term demand. We have just concluded a strong 2014 with a 27.8% revenue growth. In particular, the strong demand of our 20-SoC overcome the normal inventory adjustment pattern and enable a 6.4% quarter-to-quarter growth in the fourth quarter 2014.
The fabless company exited 2014 based on our estimates, with the days of inventory 2 days below seasonal. It was from a 4-days above in the third quarter. Now we see such inventory adjustment should come to a close. We estimate the days of inventory at the end of the first quarter of '15 should be one-day below seasonal level. So we see our near-term demand is quite healthy.
Since our fourth quarter last year set a high base, we guide a good quarter for the first quarter 2015, with essentially flat from fourth quarter '14. And clearly, better than our seasonal again.
Looking forward to 2015, it should be another upbeat year. We forecast the semiconductor industry revenue growth to be 5%. The foundry revenue growth is 12%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth by several percentage points in 2015.
Now I'll give you a few words on 10-nanometer development update. Our 10-nanometer technology development is progressing and our qualification schedule at the end of 2015, end of this year, remains the same. We are now working with customers for their product tape-outs. We expect its volume production in 2017.
On the new technology development in TSMC, I'll begin with beyond 10-nanometer I just talked about, we are now working on our future generation platform technology development. We separate dedicated R&D development teams. These technologies will be offered in the 2017 to 2019 period. We are committed to push forward our technology envelope along the silicon scaling pass.
In addition to the silicon's device scaling, we are also working on assistance scaling through advanced packaging to increase system bandwidth, to decrease power consumption and device form factors.
Our first-generation InFO technology has been qualified. Currently, we are quantifying customer InFO products with 16-nanometer technology, and it will be ready for volume ramp next year, 2016. We are now working on our second generation InFO technology to supplement the silicon scaling of 10-nanometer generation.
On the other side, in addition to the recently announced 55ULP, ultra low-power technology, 40ULP, 28ULP technologies, for ultra low-power application. Such as wearable and IoT, we are also working on 16ULP technology development. This 16ULP design kits will be available in June this year. You'll be just suitable for both high-performance and ultra low-power or ultra low voltage, less than 0.6 volts applications.
Now I turn the microphone to C.C.",452

Wei,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'll update you 28 2016 nanometer and the status of the InFO business. 
First, 28-nanometer. Since year 2011, we started to ramp up 28-nanometer production. Up to now, we have enjoyed a big success. In terms of good manufacturing results and the most importantly, the strong demand from our customer. This year, we expect the success will continue.
Let me give a little bit more detail. First, on the demand side. The demand continue to grow which are driven by the strong growth of mid- and low-end 4G smartphone as well as the technology migration for some second wave settlements such as radio frequency, hard disk drive, cross controller, connectivity and digital consumers.
Second, on the technology improvement, we continue our effort to enhance 28-nanometer technology by improving the speed performance while reducing the power consumption. 28 HPC, 28 ultra low-power technology are some examples.
So to conclude the 28-nanometer status, we believe we can defend our segment share well because of excellent performance and performance cost ratio and our superior deeper density results.
Next I'll talk about the 28 -- 20-SoC business status. After successful ramp up in high-volume last year, we expect to grow 20-nanometer business more than double this year due to high-end mobile device demand, which were generated by our customers' very competitive products. Our forecast of the 20-nanometer business, as Lora just pointed out, will contribute 20% of the total wafer revenue that remain unchanged.
Now on 16-nanometer ramp-up. We expect to have more than 50 product tape-outs this year on 16-nanometer. High-volume production was started in third quarter with a meaningful revenue contribution starting in fourth quarter this year. And I'd like to stress again that our chairman already mentioned that combining 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer, we expect to enjoy overwhelming market segment share.
Last, I will update on the InFO business. The traction on InFO is strong. We have engaged with many customers and a few of these customers I expect to ramp up in the second quarter next year. Right now, we are building a small pattern line in the new site to prepare for high-volume production next year. Also, we expect this InFO technology will contribute sizable revenue in 2016. 
And thank you for your attention.",382

Say 10 years ago that chart was much, much different with computer being the biggest. As we look at computer opportunities going forward, I think to some extent there's maybe a sense of a little bit of disappointment and that we don't see ARM necessarily in PCs yet. We haven't really necessarily seen that ecosystem come through in the server business. And big data being such an important trend going forward with compute growing about 15% per year. I'm wondering what TSMC is doing? Or what your view of that opportunity will be in the future as a potential growth driver?",128

And just don't forget that mobile actually we think has few more years to run yet. Really, the TSMC silicon content in the average phone is actually increasing, which is something that is not recognized by a lot of people because everybody says that the weight, the gravity is shifting to the middle-level, lower-level priced phones. But according to our data, and we have kept track of it for quite a long time, the average -- our TSMC silicon content in the average phone is actually increasing. So -- and look, we still look for -- I think the number we have is that by 2019, there'll be 2 billion phones manufactured. I think last year, it was what, 1.3 billion, I think, yes, 1.3 billion. 1.3 billion to 2 billion. And well, the average TSMC silicon content per phone is increasing. And the number of phones is going up. So that's, by no means, a -- I mean, it's still there. It's still a growth engine. And then the IoT, I think we talked about IoT before. And now we are certainly not oblivious to the server possibility. So why don't I ask Mark to talk more about the server and maybe C.C. will talk about the IoT.",213

Dan, just to respond to you on the server part. Chairman talked about the area we mostly focus on phone today and that will drive -- give us growth momentum in this next several years. On server, we work with the product innovators around the world and such a field definitely will not loose in our radar screen and theirs. And the TSMC has over the years developed our technology to suit for high-power computing. And from 65, 40, 28 to 16-nanometer, we continue to improve our transistor performance. And today, we believe our 16 FinFET plus transistor performance probably is the top of the -- is one of the top of the world that's well suitable, well capable in doing the computing task. And actually, before server and there are several supercomputer around the world in U.S. and in Japan already powered by the tower technology doing the weather forecasting, whether the geo exploration applications today. And on the server, we -- on ARM in particular, we have very close partnership with ARM in recent years. And ARM is a very innovative company. They produced CPU core and a new architecture every year. And we reached our leading edge technology very early with ARM and to design their leading edge CPU cores. And that is -- will continue and several of our customer are taking advantage of that. Yes, in the past, it's being getting to a slower as expected. That's because the software ecosystem is slower to come. And -- but actually a lot of the service companies, system companies continuing investing in this ecosystem. Linux-based ecosystem is coming very strong, too. So I think the trend will continue, and we will, with our customer, get into to these segments in the next -- in the near future, yes.",302

And the follow-up question on profitability. If you could give a flavor on structural profitability for 2015. And some of the flavor for 20, how quick that may get to corporate margins? And for 16, because it's an extension, whether that could be near corporate margins as that comes up.

Randy, you have remarkable question. I recall you asked about a structural profitability. That's your first question, right? From what we can see now, we are quite confident. We can maintain equal or slightly better structural profitability, standard gross margin versus 2014. For the 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer ramping, how would that effect our corporate margin? I has said in last July, it usually take 7 or 8 quarters for any new leading-edge technology get to close to the corporate average. So for 20-nanometer, it will take 8 quarters. So we believe -- so 20-nanometer is not to sell in second quarter '14. And we expect by first quarter '16, that's 8 quarters, you will be at corporate average level. For 16, we are going to mass produce this product. It will follow the similar trend. The 16-nanometer will be based on the feature of 20-nanometer. So the margin will start to be higher, but it will also follow the similar trend. It take 7 quarters to reach to corporate average. So say we plan to mass produce 16-FinFET in third quarter '15. So by first quarter '17, it will get close to corporate average. So before that, there will be still small dilutions. For this year, the dilution will be 2 to 3 percentage points. And the last year, the second half will be 3 to 4 percentage points and very low in 2016.",235

Okay, normally in the past, you have seen around 45 to 50 -- 45 being average. This increase of inventory is mainly because of 20-nanometer ramp. It has much longer cycle time, both in the wafer fab, also in the back end. So that's the main reason inventory is going up. So it will not continue to go up further. It will probably stay at the similar level, but it will not go down either.",86

Are we -- I want to answer the first question. Donald's question was I said -- actually, I looked up my statement at that time. July 16 of last year. I said on the subject of 16 and 20, 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer project, I said that I actually made 3 statements. The first statement was that because we started the 16 a little late, our market share in 2015 -- our 16-nanometer market share in 2015 will be smaller than our major, largest competitors. The second statement I made was that we started the 16 late because we wanted to do 20. And so if you combine 20 and 16, our major competitor, who will be slightly ahead of us this year on the 16, he has very little 20, almost no 20 at all. And we -- if we combine 20 and 16, our combined share in this year will be much higher than that competitors. The third statement I made is that, in 2016, we will have much larger share in just 16-nanometer than that competitor. All right? First, I want to say that I, at this time, stand on those statements. In fact, I now will add a couple of statements. The statements I will add are -- that's 4 statements now, okay? When we have a larger share on just 16 alone, in 2016, the 16 market will also be much larger than this year, 2015. So yes, we are slightly behind. We have a smaller market share in 2015 in a smaller market. Next year, we'll have a larger share, in fact, much larger share in a much larger market, 16 [indiscernible]. So and another statement I want to make is that, at this point, I'm very, very comfortable with all those statements that I have made on July 16 last year and the statements I have added today. I'm very comfortable. I don't know whether that answered your question or not, Donald?",335

So the conversion loss from 1 generation to another is normally in the low-single digit, low-middle-single digit. Now the second thing we try to do is -- and I think that we actually have been doing it perhaps even more successfully than the first thing. The first thing was to try to minimize the conversion loss. The second thing we try to do is we try to prolong the life of each generation and I was just saying just 5 minutes ago that I think that the life of 28-nanometer maybe longer than a lot of people think.

Your competitor, Intel, has kind of put out a very emphatic statement saying that until 7-nanometer, they are seeing that continuing at the same pace of before. But that has been a lot of nice from the fabless community in the last couple of years that a 20-nanometer or a 16-nanometer, there is potential slowdown. Could we have TSMC's version now that you're pretty much ready to start 10-nanometer and thinking already about 7? So that's my first question.",107

Let me repeat. Gokul, your question is mainly on the comments of cost per transistor. Some of the other player. I think you are referring to Intel who has made comments that they do see the cost per transistor to continue into 7-nanometer and so they can handle the economics of the Moore's Law whereas on the other hand, fabless companies begin to complain about not seeing [indiscernible] economics since starting with 20-nanometer.

Let me answer this question. The cost of transistor continues to go down. And by scaling [ph] mostly is -- everybody knows, nobody I think has refused that statement. We see the cost of transistor continue going down at a constant rate. And in going forward, cost of transistor going down probably at slightly slower rate. That's the arguments. But it really depends on companies and for some companies simply do not have the technology capabilities today, further going down the [indiscernible] technology development just a few. And as far as though -- whether those costs can -- is -- can get enough returns. And of course, that has to do with how much that technology bring values to the product whether it can command the price. And today, we see certain segments will continue to need it, that type of system performance to get enough return. So this is the reason that we committed to push the systems scaling.",161

As Lora pointed out, it takes about 8 quarters for the margin to get to the corporate level. But after that, it stays pretty constant. Well, it increases a little bit, in fact. In the increases particularly in the last few years, I think we have kind of pushed up the structural profitability. And, yes, I think that the added complexity or actually a lot of new things are happening on the mature nodes.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter and followed by the guidance for the second quarter.
First, let me summarize our first quarter performance. In first quarter, we have achieved TWD 222 billion in revenue, 49.3% gross margin, 39% operating margin and TWD 3.05 in EPS, which are all within our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter showed very strong growth versus last year. Our revenue increased 50%. Gross margin and operating margin went up by 1.8 percentage point and 3.6 percentage point, respectively. Net income and EPS both increased 65% versus the same period last year.
On a sequential basis, the wafer demand for the first quarter remained strong, but NT dollar was stronger than the assumption in our first quarter guidance by about 1%, which reduced our revenue by TWD 1.9 billion. Despite that, our first quarter revenue remained essentially flat versus fourth quarter last year.
On the profitability side, gross margin was slightly lower than fourth quarter, mainly due to lower capacity utilization; offset by cost improvement, favorable inventory variation adjustments and a favorable foreign exchange rate.
Let's take a look at revenue by applications. During the first quarter, Communication and Computer declined 9% and 10% sequentially; while Consumer and industrial increased 32% and 19%, respectively.
By technology, 20-nanometer revenue contribution decreased from 21% in the fourth quarter last year to 16% in the first quarter this year due to a key customer's product seasonality. Meanwhile, customers' demand for our 28-nanometer wafers remained solid and contributed 30% of wafer revenue. Accordingly, these 2 advanced technology, 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer, represented 46% of our first quarter wafer revenue, 5 percentage point lower than the fourth quarter last year.
Now let's move on to the balance sheet.
On the asset side, cash and marketable securities increased TWD 82 billion to a record level of TWD 519 billion at the end of the first quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 13 billion, as we paid down TWD 17 billion of short-term bank loan. As cash continue to increase, the tear ratio [ph] has came down from the 30% level in the past 2 years to 28% in the first quarter.
Working capital remained healthy. The accounts receivable turnover days decreased 3 days to 44 days. Days of inventory decreased by 1 day to 57 days.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated TWD 156 billion cash from operation and invested TWD 49 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, free cash flow reached a record level of TWD 107 billion. And cash balance increased to TWD 437 billion or about USD 14 billion at the end of the first quarter.
So I have finished my report on the financial part. Now let's turn to the second quarter outlook. In the second quarter, a combination of a key customer's business loss to a captive IDM; inventory adjustment, which will be explained in more detail by Mark; and less-favorable exchange rate, all three will negatively impact our business.
Based on our current business outlook and a forecast exchange rate of TWD 31.03, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between TWD 204 billion and TWD 207 billion, representing a 7% to 8% Q-over-Q decline; gross profit margin to be between 47.5% and 49.5%; and operating margin to be between 36.5% and 38.5%.
Here, I will give you a reminder about tax. As you know, in every second quarter, we will need to accrue a 10% tax on undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our quarterly tax rate in this second quarter will go up to 24%. I also want to inform you that the approximately TWD 15 billion gain from ASML share disposal is not a taxable item. After the second quarter, the tax rate will fall back to 11% in the third and fourth quarter, and our full year tax rate will be about 14%.
In addition to the second quarter guidance, I will also update you on our CapEx. Our 2015 full year CapEx will be reduced by USD 1 billion, so we now expect our CapEx this year will be between USD 10.5 billion and USD 11 billion. The reduction mainly came from 2 areas. The first areas, we have continue improve our capital efficiencies, which allow us to spend less but still achieve the same capacity. And we are migrating our 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer faster, which allow us to convert more of the 20-nanometer tools to be used for 16-nanometer at a lower CapEx. The USD 1 billion CapEx reduction will not affect our overall capacity buildup for the whole year. We will increase our existing capacity while decrease our 20-nanometer capacity.
Finally, despite of the lower second quarter, we expect revenue from the second half of the year will recover, and the full year will be double-digit growth over 2014.
This concludes my remarks. Thank you very much.",844

First, on the near-term demand. The demand of TSMC wafer remained strong in the first quarter. This led to our 1Q quarterly revenue to be essentially flat from fourth quarter last year. In the second quarter, some of our customer appeared too optimistic on their own market outlook. As a result, the inventory level of them appeared to be higher than they planned. Recently, we saw several mobile customers cut back their delivery schedule because their demand did not come to what they anticipated. Therefore, we forecast our second quarter demand will be below normal, and the quarterly revenue will decline by about 7% to 8% from first quarter.
Our near-term market demand will then be more moderate than we estimate in January. We now estimate fabless companies exit first quarter with inventory days higher than seasonal level. However, we think it will be back to normal towards the end of second quarter this year. So for forward looking for full year, we will be continuously working on a double-digit revenue growth year for 2015.
Next I want to comment a few on our long-term outlook.
TSMC target our long-term revenue CAGR, compound annual growth -- average growth rate, to be 10% in the next 5 years. We intend to maintain our structured profitability. And the net profit growth will be in line with revenue growth. The continuous demand of more functionality and integration in smartphone drives for more silicon content. We expect smartphone will continue drive our growth in the next several years.
In the meantime, we see IoT appears us -- present us new growth opportunities. The proliferation of IoT not only will bring us growth in the sensor, connectivity and advanced packaging areas. The associated application and services such as big data analytics will also further our growth in the computation space, including application processor, network processor, image processor, graphic processor, microcontroller and other various processors.
That was our long-term outlook. I will update on our 10-nanometer development progress.
Our 10-nanometer technology development is progressing well. Our technology qualification remains in Q4 this year. Recently, we have successfully achieved fully functional yields of our 256-megabit SRAM. Currently, we have more than 10 customers fully engaged with us on 10-nanometer. We still expect to have 10-nanometer volume ramp in fourth quarter of 2016 and to contribute billing in early 2017. This technology adopts our third-generation FinFET transistor and have scale in more than one generation. Its price is fully justified by its value for various applications, including application processor, baseband SoC, network processor, CPU and graphic processors. Its cost-and-price ratio will comply to our structured profitability considerations.
As for new technology development of TSMC, I'd like to start with -- to update you our 7-nanometer development. We have started our 7-nanometer technology development program early last year. We also have rolled out our 7-nanometer design and technology collaboration activity with several of our major customers. Our 7-nanometer technology development today are well in progress. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology will leverage most of the tools used in 10-nanometers; in the meantime, achieve a new generation of technology value to our customers. The 7-nanometer technology risk [ph] production date is targeted at early 2017.
Now I would like to give you an update on EUV. We have been making steady progress on EUV. Both our development tools, we have -- 2 NXE:3300 have been upgraded to the configuration of 80 watt of EUV power, with an average wafer throughput of a few-hundred wafers per day. We continue to work with ASML to improve tool stability and availability. We also are working with ASML and our partners on developing the infrastructure of EUV, such as masks and the resists.  Although today, the processor record of both 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer are on emerging tools, with innovative multiple patterning techniques, we will continue to look for opportunity to further reduce the wafer cost and simplify the process flow by inserting EUV layer in the process.
Now I'd like to give you an update of our recently announced ultra low-power technologies. We have offered the industry's most comprehensive ultra low-power technology portfolio, ranging from 55-nanometer ULP, 40-nanometer ULP, 28-nanometer ULP, to the recently announced 16FFC, a compact version of 16-FinFET plus, enable continued reduction of operating voltage and power consumption. Today, more than 30 product tape-outs planned in 2015 from more than 25 customers. These 55- and 40-nanometer ULP will be the most cost-effective solution for low- to mid-performance wearable and IoT devices. The 28ULP and the 16FFC will be the most power-efficient solution for high-performance IoT applications. In particular, our 16FFC offers the ultra low-power operation at a supply voltage of 0.55 volt, with higher performance than all of the FD-SOI technologies marketed today.
Lastly, I will give you an update of our recent IoT specialty technology development. We have developed the world's first 1.0-micron pixel size, 16-megapixel CMOS image sensor, with stacked image signal processor, which was announced in March by our customer for their next-generation smartphone.
Secondly, we continue drive the best low resistance in BCD technology road map, from 0.18-micron to 0.13-micron and from 8-inch to 12-inch production, for wireless charging and fast wired charging of mobile devices. We continue to extend our 0.13 BCD technology from consumer and industrial application to automotive-grade electrical system control applications.
Lastly, recently, we have started production of foundries' first 40-nanometer industrial embedded flash technology. Yes, that will start from November last year. And this technology recently passed automotive-grade qualification, that was in March, for engine control applications.
Above, it was my update of new technology. Now I hand the podium to C.C.",946

Wei,,Executives,4,"Okay, thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I will update you the 28-nanometer, 20 and 16-FinFET status and also InFO business.
First, 28-nanometer. This is the fifth year since TSMC's 28-nanometer entered mass production. 28-nanometer has been a very large and successful node for us. Our market segment share at this node has held up well. We only see in the mid-70s this year. We expect this to continue in year 2016. In comparison, this is better than what we had in the 40-nanometer node.
The demand for 28-nanometer, we expect to grow this year due to the course of mid- and low-end smartphone and as well as the second-wave segment, such as radio frequency circuit product and the fast controller, that migrate into this node. However, due to some customers' inventory adjustment, which we believe are only going to be for short term, the demand for 28-nanometer in the second quarter will be lower than our previous quarter, resulting in 28-nanometer capacity utilization rate to be in the high-80s range. But we expect the utilization rate of the 28-nanometer to recover soon and to be above 90% in the second half of this year.
While we are in the mass production, we also continue to improve the performance of our technology. And last year, we have introduced our 28HPC, which is a compact version of 28HPM. For the purpose of helping 64-bit CPU conversion for mid- to low-end market, this year, we further improve the 28HPC to 28HPC+. For comparison, 28HPC+ will have 18% power consumption -- lower power consumption at the same speed or 15% faster speed at the same kind of power.
As for the comparative position, we are confident that we will continue to lead in performance and yield. So far, we do not see there is a very much effective capacity in high-K metal gate at 28-nanometer outside TSMC. And since we have already shipped more than 3 million 12-inch 28-nanometer wafers, the learning curve has given us an absolute advantage in cost.
Now let me move to our 20-SoC. TSMC remain the sole solution provider in foundry industry for 20-nanometer process. Our yield has been consistently good after a very successful ramp last year, but recently, we have observed customers that planned a schedule for product migration from 20-nanometer to 16-FinFET started sooner than we forecast a few months ago. As a result, even we'll continue to grow our 20-nanometer sub-business in the second quarter of this year, our earlier forecast of 20-nanometer contributing above 20% of total wafer revenue this year has to be revised down by a few points to a level about mid-teens. That being the case, we still forecast that revenue from 20-nanometer will more than double that of year 2014's level.
Now 16-FinFET. The schedule for 16-FinFET high-volume production remains unchanged. We will begin ramping in the third quarter this year. And the run rate appear to be faster than we forecasted 3 months ago, thanks to the excellent yield learning that we can leverage our 20-nanometers' experience and also due to a faster migration from 20-nanometer to 16-FinFET. In addition to good yield, our 16-FinFET device performance was -- also met all product specs due to our very good transistor engineering. So we believe our 16-FinFET will be a very long-life node due to its good performance and the right cost. This is very similar to our 28-nanometer node.
We are highly confident that our 16-FinFET is very competitive. As we said repeatedly, combining 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer, we will have the largest foundry share in year 2015. And if we only look at 16-nanometer alone, we still can say TSMC will have the largest 16- or 14-nanometer foundry share in year 2016.
Now let me move to InFO business update. The schedule to ramp-up the InFO in second quarter next year remains unchanged. We expect the InFO will contribute more than USD 100 million to quarterly revenue by next year, fourth quarter next year, when it will be fully ramped. Right now, we are building a new facility in Longtan, that's a city very near to Hsinchu, where our headquarter are, for ramping up InFO. Today, a small pattern line [ph] is almost complete, and it's ready for early engineering experiment. This pattern line [ph] will be expanded to accommodate the high-volume ramp in year 2016.

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4408.0,789830.0,34415213.0,Question,Daniel Heyler,,Analysts,20,"So a couple of quick questions. Congratulations on the 16-nanometer success and faster yield ramp than previously unplanned. As you go to convert your 20 capacity to 16 due to those better yields, I guess, 2 parts to the question: Do you -- what's the implication on margin if your -- as you're converting a fab from -- I know you do this a lot, but this is a big transition with limited products, so as you're going from 20 to 16, what are the implications on margin? Can you -- do you take maybe 1-quarter hit on margin before you get back to trend?",105
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4408.0,789830.0,34415214.0,Answer,Lora Ho,,Executives,21,"Dan, I will firstly talk about the implication for CapEx. Probably, that's the more important which will lead to the margin in a later stage, yes. Conversions is -- cost less than adding new capacity. So when we see a node need to be converted, if we can do it faster, I mean, we can spend less CapEx, that's actually how this USD 1 billion reduction coming from here. In terms of margin, actually it has multiple factors, depreciation, of course, being number one. Other thing is how fast can you bring up your yield and how does economic scale get into play. So from what we have seen right now, we believe the 16-nanometer margin will begin better than our 20-nanometer margin because we have the basis of 20-nanometer. So well, as we have said many times, we don't want to separate 20 versus 16, and always -- you guys always ask 20 margin and 16 margin separately, so I will say, if we combine 16 and 20 margin, and it will be a pretty good progress. And we have seen 20 has progressed quite well, and 16 will be even better. So although this 20 plus 16 will still have some small dilution to TSMC in year -- in '15 and '16, for '15 may be 2 to 3 percentage points and '16 will be more 1 point -- 1 to 2 percentage point. But we are targeting to achieve corporate-level margin by year 2017, okay?",248

Does 20-nanometer still grow from its lower level in the first quarter sequentially? Will it -- in absolute dollar terms, can you maintain the current level throughout the year? I think you implied that in your guidance. If you can say -- I think you mid-single-digits, just to confirm that. And is that throughout the year? Does 20 stay at about 15% of revenue throughout the year?",77

And then my second question was relating to 20-nanometer. Here, you certainly have a lot of growth in 16 with customers taping out aggressively, especially next year. Given your high share of 28, how do you keep 28 full? You obviously have a lot of technology there. Customers will move forward, so I'm wondering, could you elaborate on new areas that are actually creating new demand in 28 such that you can continue to grow 28 next year? And do you think you can grow? I think, previously, you said maybe hold it at current levels even with 20 -- even with 16 growing. So just maybe revisit that question.",113

Wei,,Executives,29,"Okay, to answer the question: I think the highest smartphone will move to 16-FinFET. However, the mid- to -- and low-end smartphone will stay in the 28-nanometer because that's very cost effective. And mid- and low-end smartphones continue to grow significantly, so that will give a very strong demand on 28-nanometer. In addition, we still have a second wave product, like RF and fast controller, as I used in the -- as example, move in to 28-nanometer. So by -- summing it up, I think the 28-nanometer's demand continue to grow while we move into the 16-FinFET for high-end smartphone.",100

Because it's an old node, and all the old nodes face pricing pressure.

First one is for EUV. As Mark has highlighted, your EUV focus, does that imply you may consider using EUV in the second stage of the 16 -- 10-nanometer buildup potentially in 2018 or 2019?",37
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4408.0,789830.0,34415227.0,Answer,Mark Liu,,Executives,34,"Yes, we always look for opportunity to insert EUV in both 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. The EUV technology provide not only some cost benefit but also simplify the process. That means you can replace multiple layer with one layers. That helps your yield improvement, so there's opportunity both in quality and the costs, are -- always exist, so long as EUV's productivity come to the threshold point. And in -- as you noticed, on 10-nanometer, our capacity build were largely done in 16 and 17, so the 18 will be inserted; if inserted, will be combined with the some other tools upgrade, some to upgrade to 7, for example, and then replaced by the EUV tools. In that mode, it will not be a fresh capacity build with EUV at that time because that's a little bit late in schedule for the 10. 7-nanometer, of course, it will be higher probability adopting EUV. And the benefit will be bigger because the 7-nanometer has a lot of multiple layers, quadruple, even multiple patterning layers. That's EUV can be more effective in reducing the cost and improve the yield, for example. So that's the current status, but today, EUV is still in the engineering mode. The productivity, as you heard, will still have some gap for practical insertion of the technology. So we're still working on in that mode. And we have the -- although we have, 1 day, a performance up to 1,000 wafer per day, but I was talking about average, still a few hundreds. And we need to get to more than 1,000 to consider a schedule to put them into the production.",273

So to what extent do you see a speedup in the second half? And as you go to fourth quarter, how broad is the customer base? Is it a single key product? Or are you seeing broadening out of 16-FinFET as you ramp that in the fourth quarter?",76

But of course, there is one single customer impact the most, which is lost share to the captive IDMs. As for the second half, we think, first of all, the inventory adjustment, we will largely complete towards the end of second quarter. We think the end market of smartphone has still healthy growth this year. Therefore, the second half, we'll resume the growth. And more importantly, our 16-FinFET technology will start to ramp in the second half, so that will contribute a lot of growth, more than the 20-nanometer shipment reduction. So those 2 factors, okay?",122

And the follow-up question, and I'll ask on the 16, if that's multiple customers contributing this year or if it's a single key product. But the second question, I wanted to ask about the internalized silicon. One of the impact was the -- it's kind of well known now, the Samsung ramping up with more of its own silicon. If you could kind of talk about how much has that impact versus the broader kind of smartphone weakness in inventory. And as you look forward, do you see that risk staying with you, as far as Samsung, Intel internalizing silicon, versus ways if you can prevent that or mitigate that risk?",112

But that part, I think, we will recover. This is probably a competitive -- competition status in the -- for the period of time only, so -- but we know that we do not compete with our customers, so the relationship with us and our customer to build the best product to compete is still the best solution seen by many of our customers.

And also we are talking about we are also -- lower the CapEx spending by $1 billion by converting more 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer. And I think this is an estimate also to say -- also say this is a rising change to convert the N plus 1 [ph] nodes to minus 1 -- oh, minus 1 to N plus 1 [ph] going forward. So question is that, will this change continue, whether or not this year CapEx spending is picking up in the near term to TSMC, the overall CapEx spending? Because I think that Mark also said, for 7-nanometer, we probably will up, also going to use similar tool as 10-nanometer as well.

So system houses, I'm excluding memory, just the system house idea, the logic portion. And I think that might be slightly conservative. Now that's a pretty big change, and I'm wondering how you should think about that, how you should -- if you look at TSMC addressing the system houses versus the fabless customers; if you look at, for example, your market share; if you look at your margin for the system houses versus the fabless, how do you think about that?",141

I think we -- this is up to the -- our customer's product portfolio. We definitely know a lot of customer is looking at 28-nanometer to use -- to do as a low end, but the specification, the smartphone processor specification, changes constantly. So what portion of that product will move to 16-nanometer? We think, definitely, there are some portion, but how big a portion will -- really depends on their product strategy. On the 10-nanometer ramp, I wouldn't say it's bigger but at least a similar scale of our ramp in -- as we do in 16 and as we do in 20.",129

There's been a lot of talk in the industry about one of your larger customers planning to introduce a new application processor on both Samsung's 14-nanometer process as well as your 16-FinFET for the same chip later this year. And we haven't really seen a single chip get shipped out on 2 new processors at the same time before in the industry. So my question, how does this really work between the 2 foundries? Does it mean that, that one customer can adjust dynamically, month to month, how to allocate wafers between you and Samsung? Or might -- or how might this work?",110

And performance-wise, it's very good. For 16-FinFET, I think that people will start to move with their product trend. And some of the mid-end smartphone will move into 16-nanometer. That's for sure. In addition to that, we also see improving our 16-FinFET ultra low power Mark just mentioned. And that will have a lot of application on every product. Low power consumption is one of that advantage.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to join us today.
My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter, followed by the guidance for the third quarter.
So now let me summarize our second quarter financial performance. In the second quarter, we have achieved TWD 205 billion in revenue, 48.5% gross margin, 37.5% operating margin and TWD 3.06 in EPS, which were all within our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, our revenue increased 12.2%. Net income and EPS both increased 33% versus the last year, same quarter. On a sequential basis, our revenue decreased by 7.5% due to customers' cautious inventory management in the last favorable exchange rate. However, we were able to largely offset the negative impacts with our continuous cost-improvement efforts. Our gross margin decreased slightly to 48.5%.
For the nonoperating items, we have reported, again, of TWD 21.5 billion. This significant one-time gain mainly came from 2 transactions. First, the ASML share disposal would recognize TWD 17.6 billion in the second quarter, which contributed to TWD 0.60 to our EPS. Also, we sold 5% of Vanguard shares with a gain of TWD 2.3 billion, which contributed to TWD 0.08 of the second quarter EPS. The share disposal does not change our strategic relationship with ASML and Vanguard. We remain to be the largest shareholder of Vanguard, owning 28%. You may notice we incurred higher tax rate in the second quarter. The tax expense went up to 24% in the second quarter as we accrued the 10% retained earning. We expect the 2015 full year tax rate will be about 14%.
Now let's take a look of the revenue by application. During the second quarter, all major segments showed declines. Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard declined 3%, 24%, 21% and 1%, respectively.
In terms of revenue by technology, revenue contribution from 20-nanometer went up to 20% from 16% in the first quarter, while 28-nanometer contributed 27% of our wafer revenue this quarter. Accordingly, these 2 technologies, 20- and 28-nanometer, represented 47% of our second quarter wafer revenue, increased from the 46% from the first quarter.
Moving to balance sheet.
On the asset side, cash and marketable securities increased TWD 32 billion to reach TWD 550 billion at the end of the second quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased TWD 122 billion, which was due to the accrual of TWD 117 billion for cash dividend. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained flat at 44 days. Days of inventory increased by 5 days to 62 days, as we preview certain wafers in anticipation of the capacity conversion from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer. In addition, higher raw material and longer production cycle time for leading nodes also increased the DOI a bit.
Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx.
During the second quarter, we generated TWD 111 billion cash from operations and invested TWD 54 billion in capital expenditure. Additionally, we received TWD 39 billion from disposal of ASML shares and about TWD 4 billion from the sell-down of 5% Vanguard shares. On financing cash flow, we repaid TWD 13 billion for short-term debts. As a result, our cash balance reached TWD 529 billion at the end of the second quarter.
The above are my comments on the second quarter financial performance. Now let me turn to the third quarter outlook.
Due to the end-demand recovery is not as strong as we expected earlier, customers continue to remain cautious in inventory management. Combining this factor with customer's production -- product transition, demand for our third quarter is expected to recover only modestly. Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31, we expect third quarter revenues to be between TWD 207 billion and TWD 210 billion, translating into 1% to 2% sequential growth; gross profit margin to be between 47% and 49%; and operating margin to be between 36.5% and 38.5%.
As the remaining 20% ASML shares will be sold in the second half, we expect to recognize additional TWD 4 billion disposal gain in the second half, which will translate into TWD 0.12 and TWD 0.01 EPS contributions to the third quarter and fourth quarter, respectively.
This concludes my remarks. Let me turn the podium to co-CEO Mark Liu for his comments.",723

I'd like to deliver the several key messages to you, but first, I will cover the near-term demand and supply chain inventory.
Lora reported that our second quarter results were in line with guidance made in our last Investor Meeting, which shows a 12.2% year-to-year revenue growth. In the April Investor Conference, we have also noted that supply chain inventory was quite high at the end of first quarter, but it was expected to be brought down to a seasonal level at the end of Q2. However, during the second quarter, Q2, we saw demand for smartphones became weaker than we expected due to slower demand in emerging markets and in China for mid- and low-end smartphones. This weaker demand is probably due to a strong U.S. dollar to emerging market currencies and partly due to regional economic conditions. As a result, the excess inventory in supply chain has only been digested about half at the end of second quarter. The recent macro economy uncertainties in many parts of the world has further dampened supply chain's confidence in end-market demand and has caused customers to become even more cautious in managing their inventory. Slow demand in emerging markets and in China, more cautious inventory management by our customers and macroeconomic uncertainties in many parts of the world, those 3 reasons are behind our modest growth outlook in the third quarter.
That being said, we expect our customers' end-market demand will improve in the second half from the first half. Growth is expected to come from industrial and automotive segments, as well as from new iPhone launches and several launches of Android-based high-end phones. In addition, the continuing 4G migration in China and the demand recovery in emerging markets will further support the growth outlook of second half this year. But as the demand outlook has changed, we update our 2015 full year growth forecast as follows: semiconductor growth revised from 4% to 3%, foundry growth from 10% to 6%. For TSMC, we are still confident to outperform the foundry segment and still target double-digit growth rate this year.
Now the message on TSMC market segment share. Thanks to our strong leadership in advanced technologies, TSMC has been able to gain foundry market segment shares in recent years. This year, our market share will again be well-supported by the expansion of our advanced nodes, namely 16-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer.
For 16-nanometer, we are starting our volume shipment as we speak. The ramping of our 16-nanometer will be very steep, even steeper than our 20-nanometer, ramping profile -- similar ramping profile at similar early stage. Looking out to the future, with many more customers joining our 16-nanometer production, we are confident that we will achieve a far majority foundry share in 16-nanometer in 2016 and beyond.
For 20-nanometer, we remain the only foundry capable of volume supply in the second year of its ramp-up. For 28-nanometer, we'll continue to strengthen our technology offerings. Following our 28LP, 28HPL, 28HPM, we have 28LP RF, 28HPC and 28HPC+. Those new offerings will enable us to protect our 28-nanometer foundry segment share.
With all the above, we continue to gain market segment share in 2015.
Lastly, I'd like to have some comments, key messages on advanced technology development on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer.
The recent progress of our 10-nanometer technology development is very encouraging and on track with our plan. Technology risk start qualification is targeted at the end of this year. Followed by many customers' product qualifications, our volume production is planned to start from the end of 2016. Our 10-nanometer technology is designed with excellent transistor performance spec and very aggressive chip-scaling factors. Compared with TSMC's 16-FinFET plus, our 10-nanometer features have more than 15% speed gain at the same total power or more than 35% power reduction at the same speed and with gate density of 2.2x of that of 16-FinFET plus. Many first-wave technology adopters have signed up for tape-outs with our 10-nanometer. So far, planned tape-outs have already included mobile application processors, network processors and high-performance computing segments.
The development activity on our 7-nanometer is also ongoing with full steam. We have a parallel team working on that program. We target 7-nanometer technology qualification in the first quarter 2017, only 5 quarters after 10-nanometer With further transistor speed enhancement and chip-scaling from 10-nanometer, our customer can plan their tape-outs using the latest and the greatest technology available at the time when they launch their most competitive products. For 7-nanometer, similar to our 20- and 16-nanometer relationship, we are developing 7-nanometer to be able to leverage the process tool compatibility and maturity from 10-nanometer volume production.
That is my message. Now I turn the podium to C.C.",786

I will update the technology improvement, volume manufacturing and competitiveness on suite technology nodes; followed by an InFO business update.
First, on 28-nanometer. The demand outlook for TSMC's 28-nanometer remains strong. We continuously enhance our 28-nanometer technology, like Mark just mentioned, by improving the performance. In addition to the 28ULP, 28HPM, we have introduced 28HPC last year to enable our customers' conversion to 64-bit CPU for mid- to low-end market. Our 28HPC+ introduced this year can enable our customers to go after the market with smart-type core [ph], which is cellphone 4 to 8 to 10 [ph]; and advanced LTE such as LTE Categories 4 to 6.
In addition to addressing the demand for the mid- to low-end smartphone market, we have already seen demand for our 28-nanometer transceiver RF and the fast controller has begin increasing over time. Based on tape-out activities, we also anticipate a customer in WiFi wearables, digital TVs, set-top box and image signal process will also start ramping next year using our 28-nanometer. Ever since we introduced 28HPC and 28HPC+, we are met with customers' enthusiastic adoption. Almost all the new tape-outs are adopting either of these 2 processes. And the number of new tape-outs continue to increase and are reaching a record level.
Our 28-nanometer building utilization rate was in the high 80s in second quarter, which is due to customers' inventory management. We expect this building utilization to be recovered to above 90% in third quarter, the same as we mentioned in our last conference. We intend to keep our 28-nanometer utilization rate very high by providing the best and useful technology, such as our 28HPC and 28HPC+, to our customers so that their new products will grow nicely in the market, and that will translate to increasing demand and higher loading rate for us. Meanwhile, after having manufactured our 28-nanometer for more than 5 years, we can also use our learning curve or cost advantage to compete with good profit margins. To summarize, we will keep our utilization rate high, and we will use our technology and our cost advantage to compete effectively for 28-nanometer business.
Next, 20-nanometer. Since we have begun ramping of 20-nanometer in the middle of last year, we have obtained the best progress in the reduction of defect density, as compared to all previous nodes. We believe we will be able to leverage this record progress and enhance defect density reduction for our 16-nanometer.
The demand for our 20-nanometer this year is still good. We expect our revenue from 20-nanometer will at least double the level we had last year. And since a majority of our 20-nanometer business will migrate into 16-FinFET next year, we expect our 20-nanometer business will be lower than this year. However, we still expect 20-nanometer to be a long-life node.
We are converting right now part of 20-nanometer capacity into 16-FinFET to prepare for the ramp of 16-FinFET. So I move to 16-FinFET update.
We have begun volume production of 16-FinFET in second quarter. Shipment has started this month. The high-volume ramp in third quarter will mostly contribute to revenue in fourth quarter this year. Since 16-nanometer shares similar metal backend process with 20-nanometer, our 16-FinFET can benefit a lot from 20-nanometer's learning. We have already shipped more than 0.5 million wafer 20-SoC by now, so our 16-nanometer's yield in defect density has been excellent. And in fact, our 16-FinFET has set a new record for progress made in the defect density reduction. As for device performance, we believe our 16-FinFET plus has the best transistor performance among all foundries. For low-power applications, we have been developing 16FFC, which will be cost effective and will be important for future of IoT application as well.
Last, let me update on InFO business.
The schedule to ramp up InFO in second quarter next year remains unchanged. We have already begun moving manufacturing equipment into our new facility in Longtan, which is close to be completed now. We are also engaging with major customers for volume production in the second half next year. Our expectation of InFO contributing more than USD 100 million quarterly by 4Q next year remains unchanged.
TSMC's InFo technology does not need package substrate and also provides a high-density interconnect. This allows our solution to have benefit in form factor, that is, package in service and in electrical performance. We continue to work with major customers and developing the next-generation InFO for further improvement on device performance and package in service.
Thank you for your attention. Now let's turn the podium to Lora.",764
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6401.0,834199.0,36029989.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,4,"Now I will make comments on structural profitability, CapEx and long-term financial objectives. Let me start with structural profitability.
We employ 2 key indices to monitor our structural profitability. The first one is standard gross margin, referred to as SGM, meaning the gross margin at a given level of utilization. The second one is standard utilization, the utilization level that we strive to achieve or exceed. Over the past 5 years, we have seen consistent improvement in SGM, while our utilization has also been at a consistently high level. We plan to maintain or improve our structural profitability by maintaining or improving SGM and maintaining high utilization.
For advanced technologies, we are careful in peak capacity planning. For mature mainstream technologies, we are increasing our capabilities in various special technologies to ensure all the legacy capacity can be fully utilized. After 3 years of operating at a high capital intensity level, above 50% CapEx intensity, during the period from 2011 to 2013, our CapEx-to-sales has come down to about 40% last year, in 2014, and is expected to be at a similar level this year. Going forward, we estimate our capital intensity ratio will be at about mid-30s level for the next few years.
Regarding CapEx, there may be some adjustments, as we are evaluating the capacity conversion along with better productivity improvements. We are also increasing investments in specialty technologies, so for now, we keep our CapEx budget unchanged.
Let me move into long-term financial objectives. Over the 5-year target, meaning from 2015 to 2019, the 5-year target calls for a compound annual growth rate of 10% for both revenue and net income and bigger or equal 20% in ROE. The long-term growth rate of the overall semiconductor industry is expected to be growth about 4% to 6%,  at  mid-single-digit level. Foundry is expected to continue to outgrow the overall semiconductor market by a few points. We plan to achieve the 10% compound annual growth rate in revenue by carefully positioning ourselves with the right technology and build appropriate capacity to capture the business. With the right technologies and sufficient capacity, TSMC is well-positioned to continue gaining market segment share in the foundry segment.
Our current 5-year plan number is very close to the 10% revenue growth target. We believe we will grow double digit each year for the years 2015 and 2016, and we will continue to work on the 2017 to 2019 growth ahead of time.

Well, first, we expect some market share gain. As C.C. has said and as I said a year ago, we expect that our 16-nanometer market share will be much greater than our next competitors. And overall, we'll also see other areas where we will be expanding market share, for instance, in the IoT area where mature, more- or less-advantaged technologies are used. Some of our customers are doing very well, so I expect gains in market share. And I also expect that the foundry segment of the semiconductor market will do better next year than this year. It did very well last year, and so did we, of course. We grew 25% last year, and we had a record fourth quarter last year. And our customers, for the most part, did very well last year also. At the end of last year, it was a merry Christmas for a lot of people. And the expectations for this year were very high at that time. However, part of the big growth that we had last year went into supply chain inventory. And the supply chain inventory at the end of last year was indeed very high. Now this year, with a number of things happening that Mark already mentioned, the outlook for this year has continued to deteriorate. And so in retrospect, we should have averaged last year's growth rate with this year's growth rate. Last year, we grew 25%. And this year, we are still looking for double digits, but certainly it's considerably lower than last year's 25%. And so I do expect next year's organic growth rate, if you will, to be a little better than this year. And in addition to that, as I said, we expect market share gain.",300

It's extended for 2 quarters. Now are you expecting, as we go in the fourth quarter, potential for restocking? Or we traditionally go into a low season; we wait, say, until after Chinese New Year? And in with 16-nanometer ramping up, how much could that support fourth quarter being above seasonal? And then also, how do you see the 16-nanometer ramp in first half; if you expect to continue the steep ramp-up on '16, in the first half next year, or if it's more a second half event?",99

And for the 16-nanometer, it's all our new products. So at this point, we are ramping, but the inventory issue is not in the picture. We just keep the production ramp in the second half this year and getting to the first half of next year.

On the tool stability, we have criteria for the working team to reach a certain target, and that target is likely to reach by the end of this year. And then we will start development using EUV tools. As you can see in our 7-nanometer development schedule, that probably will not use EUV, but we are planning to exercise EUV using the 7-nanometer technology. And currently, we are planning to use EUV at 5-nanometer, but of course, it does depend on certain developmental milestones to be reached.

Now I think there was a related question that was pre-submitted. No, it wasn't pre-submitted. I saw it on Taiwan newspaper today. The related question, I am ready to answer that. So let me just answer. The related question appeared in the Commercial Times  -- the question was, with the inventory going down so slowly, what is the implication for the fourth quarter this year and first quarter next year? So I thought it was a pretty good question. So I got ready to answer that one, and maybe answering that one will also at least partially answer yours. Clearly, the slowly decreasing inventory is not a very good omen for the fourth quarter. The inventory is being depleted more slowly than what we expected. However, the impact on the first quarter is an entirely different story. We do expect that by the end of the fourth quarter, inventory will be back to the so-called seasonal level or even lower, and that bodes very well for the first quarter. But still, having said all of that, I still repeat to you another thing I said. For the entire year, we still think that we will have double-digit growth.",209

They have done a much better job in forecasting or planning in this bottom-up way than any top-down kind of thing. Top down, you make assumptions and so on, and your assumptions could be all wrong.

In fact, we have all along been making considerable capital investments in the mature nodes, some years more than other years. I think we have been telling you most years how much  of our capital CapEx is in the leading nodes and so on. And there is a pretty significant portion that's not leading-edge event [ph]. So that's the mature nodes. And usually, there is considerable investment, additional investment we need to make to adapt the equipment to -- it's not really changing the equipment.

It's months before we get the first finished wafer out, and some customers want us to do the  bumping and all that stuff. And that takes longer,  so it's a long time between first starting to ramp and the time you get even the first wafer out. So third quarter will be very little.",64

All right, there is a question coming to my Blackberry from Arete's analyst, Jaguar Bajwa. His question is this. How does the strategy of quicker node transitions and the reuse of tools, as we have seen in 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer, affect the depreciation for new process nodes? And does this tool transition allow you to offer better ASPs to your customers? So quicker nodes transition, reuse of tools, whether this translates to better ASP to customers and how that affects depreciation.",82

That is something making one generation's tools compatible with the next generation or vice versa. That has been a prime effort of TSMC R&D and TSMC operations in the last 3 or 4 years. That, of course, started because the complexity of the process has increased and because we have adopted the faster cadence of the technology. So now I think the prime effort, this very big focus on reducing what we call -- internally, we call it the conversion loss. Our effort in reducing the conversion loss has won a lot of fruit. And now in the ideal case, all the tools are compatible, but that's impossible now because when you advance, going from 16 to 10, you do need new equipment. That's, even now, still being developed by our equipment partners, such as supply materials and so on. However, we have been able to reduce the conversion loss to a very low level now. And I think from that, we can start calculating depreciation and whatnot. You want to add anything to what I said, yes?",187

Just like Chairman said, the operation and R&D people made a tremendous effort, trying to increase the migration rate. As far as we can see now from 20 to 16, 16 to 10, we can manage migration. More than 95% of the tool can be reusable.",55

Now there is another follow-up question sent over by Steven Pelayo at HSBC, and his question is this. Since TSMC learned a lot at 20-nanometer, will a steeper ramp of 16-nanometer this year not impact gross margin too much, i.e. not much of a dilution, or perhaps the faster learning will allow for higher starting 16-nanometer gross margin compared to 20-nanometer, whether 16-nanometer gross margin will be higher than 20-nanometer at the starting stage?",75

I think the answer is 16 -- we have learned a lot from 20-nanometer to benefit 16-nanometer. And therefore, as a result, we expect 16 to be more profitable than 20, and we expect a new learning curve to actually be a part of the 20-16 total learning curve, and I think that's actually one of the advantages of the faster cadence.",63

So I don't get it. I mean, for the HPC, my understanding is lower than average of the 28-nanometer process business.

I was talking about the high-end smartphone. TSMC revenue will go up. Actually, the number is -- this year is $17.80. Next year, $19.7, so it's $2 up. That's the high end.

In the third quarter, demand for TSMC's wafers was essentially flat with the second quarter, mainly reflecting customers' cautious inventory management. However, a stronger-than-forecasted U.S. dollar against the TWD dollar caused our third quarter revenue to exceed the high end of our guidance given in July. On a sequential basis, revenue increased by 3.4% to TWD 213 billion, and the gross margin decreased 0.3 percentage points to 48.2% as the benefit from higher capacity utilizations and the favorable exchange rate were outweighed by unfavorable inventory management and margin dilution from 16-nanometer. 
During this quarter, we ceased TSMC Solar operations and incurred a loss of TWD 2.8 billion. Among the total, about $400 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $2.4 billion in other operating expenses. The loss dragged down our operating margin by 1.3 percentage points and reduced our EPS by about $0.08. Operating margin in the third quarter decreased 0.6 percentage points to 36.9%. Without this onetime solar write-off, our operating margin would have been 38.2%. 
For nonoperating items, ASML shares disposal gains were $3.7 billion or $0.13 in EPS. For comparison, in the second quarter, we recorded $20 billion disposal gains on ASML and the Vanguard shares. With all these items, our third quarter EPS was $2.91.
Now let's take a look at revenue by application. During the third quarter, communication, computer, consumer and industrial increased 1%, 15%, 3% and 11%, respectively. These numbers reflect the change in variable foreign exchange rates already. In terms of revenue by technology, we are pleased to report the first quarter of 16-nanometer volume shipments. 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer combined contributed 21% of our total wafer revenue in the third quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 525 billion. Current liabilities decreased by $108 billion, mainly as we paid out $117 billion of cash dividend in July. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 42 days. Days of inventory decreased by 3 days to 59 days, as we now have lower days in work-in-process inventories and we shipped the 20-nanometer wafer we prebuilt last quarter.
Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on cash, cash flow and CapEx. 
During the third quarter, we generated TWD 118 billion cash from operations invested $70 billion in capital expenditure, and paid out $117 billion cash dividend. Additionally, we received about $15 billion from disposal of ASML shares and borrowed $28 billion in short-term loans for currency hedging purposes. As a result, our cash balance decreased $13 billion to TWD 516 billion at the end of the third quarter.
So I just finished the summary of the third quarter financial outcome. Now let me turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Due to the weaker-than-expected end-market demand, customers continue to manage inventory cautiously. Meanwhile, 16-nanometer will ramp strongly and contribute more significant revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 32.71, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between TWD 201 billion and TWD 204 billion, gross profit margin to be between 47.5% and 49.5% and operating margin to be between 36.5% and 38.5%. You may notice that the midpoint of gross margin guidance is slightly higher than third quarter gross margin despite a lower revenue. This is because we expect our cost improvement and a favorable inventory valuation adjustment to fully offset the impact from lower capacity utilization. In addition, the expiration of the remaining hedging contract of ASML will contribute about $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter, and that will be the end of the year total accounting treatment. 
This concludes my remarks. Now let me turn the podium to Co-CEO, Mark Liu, for his comments.",663

I would like to give you some remarks, some messages here. My message has 3 parts. First, I'll talk about near-term demand. I'll describe the background color. And I'll talk about TSMC's long-term growth drivers. Then the third part is leading-edge technology development update.
Now first, the near-term demand. This year, due to a weaker global economy, a stronger U.S. dollar environment, and a volatile financial market, the electronic device market has been negatively impacted, resulting in a lack of growth in the overall semiconductor market. In addition, we see the unexpected slowdown of the economy in China since Q1, resulting in a continued sluggish smartphone demand in China. This led to our relatively flat revenue growth in the third quarter. And we think the inventory level in the fabless industry will still be above seasonal normal by about 10 days at the end of the third quarter. 
Looking forward, we see the active inventory reduction actions in the fabless companies continue into the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, our accelerated ramp-up of 16-FinFET plus technology supporting the high-end smartphone market did uplift the otherwise weak wafer demand. Therefore, we forecast a moderate decline, about 4% to 5%, of revenue from the previous quarter. We estimate the fabless industry inventory will likely settle to a seasonal level towards the end of this year, albeit some uncertainty on this still exists. 
Given the fourth quarter guidance, TSMC should be able to deliver a double-digit growth at about 10% to 11% year-on-year in 2015, thanks partially to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our 2015 forecast of the growth of smartphone unit shipment is 10%; PC for the industry is minus 6%; tablet, minus 14%; digital consumer electronics, minus 6%. The semiconductor industry growth is about 0%, and our fabless industry growth is minus 5%.
The next part, I will talk about TSMC's long-term growth driver. In the past 3 to 4 years, the growth of the smartphone market has propelled TSMC's growth. Recently, we saw that the total unit growth of smartphone appears to be slowing. However, the silicon content in all segments of smartphone continues to increase. This silicon content increase particularly shows in the high-end smartphone. For example, the unit growth of high-end smartphone this year will be flat, but the silicon content of the high-end smartphone will still have a mid-teen percentage growth. 
We see the bifurcation of high-end and mid/low-end smartphone markets continue, and the high-end smartphones, which provide richer features, higher performance and lower power consumption, will continue to drive the demand of leading-edge technologies. We stand to benefit from this trend. Smartphone will continue to provide growth momentum for TSMC in the next 2 to 3 years.
TSMC holds our corporate mission of being the trusted technology and capacity supplier in the large semiconductor industry for years to come. We work closely with many of our partners and collaborate with them to produce the best product in many market segments, each with differentiations of its own. From that, we see several drivers of future demand growth. It is very encouraging. 
Three areas that we will soon add to the growth of TSMC in the coming years. First, computing market. In addition to the smartphone, we see faster growth of processor unit demand in many applications. With the Internet traffic near exponentially increasing, people are to extract intelligence out of the mountains of data. Extensive computation not only needs to be done at the data center, much must be done in a network as well as the distributed edge of the network. Image processor, CPU for automotive, CPU and GPU for augmented reality and virtual reality are examples.
Second, the fabless system company. We now see a new breed of fabless system companies coming to join the plate of semiconductor product innovation. With the enhanced SoC integration and system software and hardware integration, new usage models with brand-new markets are opening up for the semiconductor industry. We have been working with these fabless system companies for several years.
Third, Internet of Things. As billions of things are connected to the Internet, with sophisticated computing and analysis, they soon will become intelligent enough to create new user experiences and to improve the efficiency in many aspects of life, work and leisure. Recently, we saw fast innovation taking place in areas such as cars, drones, robots, wearables and smartphone devices. Working with innovators around the world, we continue to see the insatiable need of performance of leading-edge technologies. We also see the need of advanced packaging technology to increase the overall system performance. Thus, we will continue to increase the pace of our leading-edge technology development. Leading-edge technology will continue to be the major driver of TSMC's future growth.
The third part. I'd like to update you about our leading-edge technology development. Our 10-nanometer technology development is well on track. This technology has a logic density of 2.1x of its previous generation, that's 16-FinFET plus, with performance of 20% enhancement or a power consumption reduction of 40%. During this quarter, we will freeze the process and begin technology qualification for our 10-nanometer technology. Customer product tape-outs will soon begin next spring. 
TSMC's 7-nanometer technology will fully leverage our 10-nanometer EU learning. And the progress of our 7-nanometer is well on track as well. The migration from 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer provides substantial improvement in performance, power and density. We are very happy to inform you that fully functional SRAMs on our 7-nanometer have already been demonstrated.
On advanced packaging development, our InFO technology will enter high-volume production with our 16-nanometer technology next year. We are currently working on a second generation InFO technology for several projects of system integration on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. 
Above are my key messages. Thank you for your attention. I will turn the podium to C.C. Wei.",971
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2015",2015-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5398.0,877318.0,37619465.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,3,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I will update you on the status of our fab operations on the following topics. 
First one, 28-nanometer. Due to customers expediting their inventory management, as Mark just pointed out, the demand for our 28-nanometer has been reduced in the fourth quarter. As a result, 28-nanometer utilization rate came down from above 90% in the third quarter to a level below 80% in the fourth quarter. However, the outlook for 28-nanometer remains very promising, thanks to our newly developed 28HPC and 28HPC+ technologies. These 2 new technologies not only shoot for the mid- to low-end smartphone requirement, but are also highly useful for other applications such as Wi-Fi, digital TV, set-top box and image signal processor, et cetera. 
Overall, we expect we will ship a similar amount of 28-nanometer wafers this year as we did last year, and we expect to ship more 28-nanometer wafers next year. We have increased our market segment share in 28-nanometer this year. We believe our technology and cost advantage will enable us to compete well. Going forward, we expect to continue to protect our market segment share and gain a good profit.
Next, on 20-nanometer. Because of generally weaker demand, as Mark described, as several customers have accelerated their product migration to 16-FinFET plus, the demand for 20-nanometer this year fell somewhat short of our estimate made at the beginning of this year. This said, we continue to stand by our early prediction that revenue from 20-nanometer this year will be at least double the level we had last year. Given the demand outlook change and the high ratio of common tools, we will continue to convert 20-nanometer capacity into 16-nanometer. 
Now let me update you on the 16-nanometer. We began high-volume production of 16-nanometer in third quarter as planned and so revenue contribution from 16-nanometer became better than we expected earlier. 16-nanometer year improvement is progressing very well, setting a new record internally for ramping up a new technology node. In addition to 16-FinFET plus, we are developing 16-FinFET C for the low application, I'm sorry. Today, we have already completed the first phase of 16FFC and obtained good results. 
Between 16-FF plus and 16FFC, we will have 100 product tape-outs from about 40 customers before the end of 2016, with a very comprehensive portfolio including mobile networking, CPU, FPGA, consumer and the GPUs. 
We believe our 16-nanometer portfolio, including 16-FF plus and 16FFC, are very competitive. We anticipate continued ramp-up into 2016 as multiple customers in both mobile and consumer applications will drive the production in parallel. Similar to 28-nanometer, we believe 16-FinFET will become a long node supporting multiple high-volume market applications. TSMC's technology advantage should allow us to capture a large majority of this demand.
Now let me update InFO. We have completed the construction of the new facility in Longtan and are ready for InFO's volume production. The manufacturing equipment move-in is on schedule, and also we target volume ramp-up at second quarter next year. Compared to existing package scheme, TSMC's InFO can bring greater than 20% reduction in overall package thickness, 20% speed gain in performance and 10% better ensemble performance for power dissipation. So we are now InFo-technology capable and well positioned to enable next-generation mobile applications. So right now, we continue to work with major customers on completion of their product qualification. Meanwhile, we are developing the next-generation InFO process, as Mark just said, for the future application. Our expectation of InFO contributing more than USD 100 million quarterly revenue by 4Q '16 remain unchanged.
Now let me update on specialty and 8-inch fab. In order to meet our customers' requirements and more and more demand, we have developed specialty technology based on our logical processes. We have been doing this for more than 15 years by now. Applications, such as MEMS, power management, CMOS image sensor, high-resolution display driver and high-precision analog have been the main drivers for the specialty technologies. After these years of effort, demand for these specialty technologies has grown substantially and account for more than 70% of all the 8-inch fab sub-business. Some of the specialty applications have also moved to 12-inch fab, of course. We expect this trend will continue, and we are preparing sufficient capacity, both in 8-inch and 12-inch fabs, to address the need for specialty technologies. 
Thank you for your attention. Now I turn the podium to Lora.",736
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2015",2015-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5398.0,877318.0,37619466.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,4,"I have a few comments, so let me start with 2015 CapEx. 6 months ago, we gave our 2015 CapEx guidance in the range between USD 10.5 billion to USD 11 billion. Due to a combination of factors, including efficiency gains, capital investment program changes, capital deployment schedule changes and foreign exchange rate changes, we now expect our 2015 capital budget to be about USD 8 billion.
Of those changes, about 33% or 1/3 of the reduction of CapEx is due to operating efficiency gains that led us to spend less money but still have the same output. Another one, about 30% of the reduction is due to changes in the investment projects, including the conversion between 20-nanometer and the 16-nanometer. Another one, about 20% of the reduction is due to changes in capacity schedules. Lastly, the remainder, about 17% of the total reduction is due to the strengthened U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen and the NT dollar. We expect our 2016 capital budget will be higher than this year.
The next one is regarding our structural profitability. In the last few years, we have been able to maintain or improve our structural profitability despite making heavy capital investments. This is mainly due to 3 reasons: number one, operation innovations leading to productivity efficiency and better asset effectiveness; number two, very careful planning in the build-out of capacity; number three, fast EU learning when ramping new nodes. All of these 3 factors allow TSMC to enjoy a large cost advantage which leads to a better structural profitability. TSMC's cost reduction efforts are as intense as our R&D efforts. As a result of our cost reduction, we have been able to maintain our structural profitability in spite of price pressure, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
I'll talk about our solar operations. There have been a lot of changes in the world solar industry since we started our solar operations 6 years ago. Capacity overbuild in the solar marginal [ph] industry, coupled with the substantial price decline, has made TSMC Solar's future highly doubtful. Despite hard work at TSMC Solar throughout this 6-year period, we decided to terminate its operations at the end of August of this year. Owing to this change, we have evaluated the financial impact across all accounts. The total impact is about TWD 2.75 billion, which reduced our third quarter operating margin rate by about 1.3 percentage points and reduced our third quarter EPS by about $0.08. TSMC will continue to honor all product warranties that have been offered to existing customers, and we also extended employment offers to all employees working at TSMC Solar Taiwan at the time of the closing.
My last comment is regarding China investment. In the last several months, we have been actively evaluating the potential investment of a 12-inch fab in China. The considerations include the positive development of the semiconductor market in China and the large pool of engineering talent. On the other hand, the manufacturing costs will be higher in China than in Taiwan due to lack of economy of scale and many other reasons. So as of now, we are still evaluating the potential investments. 
This ends my remarks. Thank you.",541

I think TSMC has been supplying the processors, distributing processors in bigger shares, and more recently, we see the processors' growth increasing. And therefore, we think the computing market, we meant not just the data center but also the distributed processors, namely the application processor. If you look at the application processor unit growth, it's much faster than smartphone growth. Microprocessors, image processors that when you diagnose, absorb the images, you need to process on site, and we still fall quite short on the capability of an automated car, for example. And a network processor is also important. And of course, we include -- microprocessors and CPU definitely is one area. By CPU I mean the Chromebook, that type of distributed processors.

Sorry, my first question is about CapEx. So TSMC cut CapEx quite substantially in 3 months. Last time, we had the guidance back in mid-July. And I think there are 3 reasons; I think the efficiency gain and conversion. Those things don't seem like it's something you just found out in the last 3 months. Is there anything new that you realized that made you change CapEx so much? Or is that -- and also, I remember in the past, we always talked about the CapEx today is for production a year later. Did you become very cautious about something next year?",104

As you say, it's just come out in 1 month or 2 months, so we have seen a trend. But in the last quarter, I mentioned about the CapEx, we still hold the original number, but there may be some changes as things evolve and we continue the effort to drive the CapEx efficiency. And we have gained a lot of experience doing this in the company. So if you look at the reduction, actually, it's more than half. It's to -- through these efforts. Efficiency gain, of course, with some help from foreign exchange rate and some program change, including the migration and schedule change, that's a response to the market. Some of them will be shipped the next year.",127

When that starts moving to the next generation, maybe the second wave and the third wave aren't going to be as big as they used to be in comparison, right? And so maybe you convert more of 16 to 10 than you did historically where you kept all these old nodes for a long, long time. I wonder if you see that as a trend or what does that mean for your business model.",101

The second wave and the third wave, some of them may not catch up as fast as in the past. But we do this for the maximum effectiveness to provide our technology to our customer. Many of our customers have their products scheduled differently. So some of the customers will ride on, will have their product launched at different time than the other, and we pace our technology so that they can take the maximum benefit of a particular set of tools and with the most updated technology capability. And so that's our value to our customers. But the added burden for us is, of course, to manage the tool compatibility. And I think we are -- we have the profitability target in mind to ensure that we will keep that.",148

And now we are saying it's above 90% and 95%. That's the effort we made during this process. It's -- in many ways, you have to start from the design phases. You have to look at design. You make sure those tools get utilized in more than 1 generation, that's one thing. The other one is you need to know how to modify the tool so that you don't have to buy a new one. That's another reason. So there are many, many things happening in the factory, and we are giving an aggressive target on this and we measure that.",137

It's indeed, our revenue, more than 99% denominated in U.S. dollars. In terms of purchasing -- not so much on cost of sales, in terms of purchasing, I think we have about 50% in U.S. dollars and 20% in euro, 20% in TWD and the rest in Japanese yen.

It seems unusual that your customers' forecasts are still uncertain, especially after several quarters of working down inventories. Is that right to assume that this cycle, inventory correction cycle, is indeed different than the previous cycles, especially when we look at your cycle time averaging 2 months, and keep in mind that Chinese New Year in February is coming and your customers, even after several quarters of inventory digestion, are still not willing to refresh inventories? And I want to get more insight from you on this factor, and I have a follow-up.",103

So Mehdi, let me repeat your question. Basically, you're a little bit surprised by the length of time that our customers are going through the inventory digestion. As you said, that it has already been going on for several quarters. And then given the cycle timing is about average 2 months, why -- why does TSMC still have uncertainty about first quarter next year.",66

Let me answer about the inventory in -- for the whole year. For TSMC, as you recall, our first year -- first quarter is a pretty good quarter. It's flat, typically, in Q4; Q1 is a weaker quarter. Then we find out that, actually, the first quarter, the inventory actually is higher than the season normal by several days. And then we were thinking of how this inventory will work it down. But unfortunately, the demand in China turned sour during the first and going to the second quarter, coming down very fast. That surprises us. Therefore -- to our customers, too. Therefore, the inventory really didn't work down that well. As a matter of fact, it actually increases. So that puts everybody uncertain on the inventory. And we look at Q3, I think Q3 traditionally is a strong quarter, and the people and -- still didn't really cut down their inventory that boldly. And therefore, we see at the end of Q3, it still didn't come down too much. And -- however, from the current global economy and perspective, people really put a realistic view. And we looked at the Q4, indeed, people have actively adjusted their inventory. Just like several other years' end, they tried to reach the inventory towards the seasonal level, and that's what we see: a weaker -- a particularly weaker Q4, and that's the situation. So this year, it's very different than last few year, and I hope it's not going to replay next year.",252

You mentioned that 16 and 20 combined will definitely grow year-on-year. I'm just curious in terms of sequential trends. There's about 21% of revenues, does that grow every quarter when you look into Q4 and Q1?",44

Okay, fair enough. 3, 4 or 5 years ago, I think Chairman mentioned -- the one number that really summarized it quite cleanly and easily for us was that this move to smartphones, we were going to see a tripling of the silicon content per phone, and lo and behold, that's really what drove TSMC on top of some share gains and really now Intel in this mobile phone world. I guess as I'm thinking over the next 3, 4, 5 years, you guys are highlighting Internet traffic and yet, even that's only 11 million servers a year, not really that big. Cars are only 60 million, 70 million cars per year, I mean, so it's very difficult I think for us now to really something that could be as significant even with a sizable market and the silicon content increase potential. So I guess when you're thinking out over the next 3, 4 years or so, what do you think are the biggest drivers? What's that same driver that we saw 5 years ago, like we saw with smartphones, what excites you most, I guess? And can you quantify it a little bit to a simple sentence like that?",202

I mentioned all the trends of computing actually in IoT, mostly, growth will come from computing because the sensor and connectivity are more mature technologies. There is nothing -- killer apps, as the smartphone today. But as you know, all the computation demand, some of the usage models come and go. It wasn't successful, for example. We still have yet to know whether the watch will be becoming a usage -- people will get used to it or not. Drone or other things, home devices. So I just don't have a clear naming for those gadgets, okay? But I think what I can say is, just like 5 years ago, the connectivity on communication is a definitive trend. Therefore, we see the smartphone will come and indeed, it did. It does pay. However, going forward, how this computation comes into what form of gadgets, actually, I cannot clearly describe to you. But if you -- if people still talk about their -- the smartphone in their pocket is too hot or doesn't take enough -- long enough time and let alone any virtual reality or augmented reality can be fed through your smartphone, and your smartphone would die within 1 hour if you do that. Your entertainment, people would like to watch 3D TV, but really, the kids today are really looking at entertainment of a different form. They want to evolve into the virtual reality, and that could be the future form of entertainment. Do we call that movie theater? Maybe, but it could be a different name. So the gadgets is still upon the innovator of the product industry to come out. But I think looking at our customers, there are tons of innovators that are thinking they will come out with a new product that will become the next smartphone. But they produce their designs continuously. Let's see how that will pan out to be a particular gadget for a particular successful innovator.",335

And other areas like gaming for example, and -- it is produced by the system companies. And they will -- we will see other areas for the virtual reality, for example, some of that probably will be driven by the system companies. And cars, for example, the machine learning, that probably will also be driven by fabless and system companies together.
