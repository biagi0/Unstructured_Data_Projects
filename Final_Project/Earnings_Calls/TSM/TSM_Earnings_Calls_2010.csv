Good morning and good evening to everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I will start today’s conference call with a highlight of the second quarter, then I will give you the outlook of our third quarter. Please refer to the quarterly financial summary slides on our Website. All dollar figures are in NT dollars, unless otherwise stated.
Customers’ demands for TSMC wafers continued to be robust in the second quarter, which translated to revenue and shipment growth across all major segments, technologies and geographic areas.
Net sales reached NT$105 million, up 13.9% from the first quarter and up 41.4% from the year ago quarter. Wafer shipments were at NT$2.93 million 8-inch equivalent wafers increased 14.9% from the prior quarter and 48.5% on the same quarter last year.
Gross margin was 49.5%, representing a 1.6 percentage point increase from the first quarter and a 3.3 percentage increase from a second quarter level.
Operating margin of 38.6% was also up 1.6 percentage points sequentially, and up 4.7 percentage points compared with second quarter ‘09. EPS for the second quarter 2010 reached NT$1.55. ROE was 31.6%.
Now let’s take a look at income statement. Second quarter gross margin was 49.5% up by 1.6 percentage point from 47.9% in the first quarter. The increase was mainly due to a higher capacity utilization rate and a continued cost improvement, partially offset by an adverse inventory valuation adjustment and an increase in raw material costs.
Operating expenses increased NT$1.4 billion from the first quarter as we accelerated the development for the most advanced technologies and expanded business scale and activities to support future growth.
Non-operating income increased by NT$450 million from first quarter primarily due to the higher disposal gain from financial assets and the absence of earthquake scrap loss in first quarter.
Net investment gain was NT$529 million up NT$352 million from the prior quarter, mostly due to the business improvement among certain invested companies. Net margin was 38.4%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and up 5.5 percentage point year-over-year.
On page six, let’s now turn to revenue analysis. Revenue from all major segments increased sequentially. Consumer was the strongest with 26% sequential growth. Communication, Computer and Industrial applications grew 22%, 1% and 14% respectively.
Overall, revenue from Communications, Computer, Consumer and Industrial applications accounted for 41%, 29%, 15% and 15% respectively of our wafer sales in second quarter ‘10.
Trends in Consumer demand was also seen across all technologies. Rapid ramping of 40-nanometer continued to lead growth and it reached 16% of total wafer revenue in the second quarter.
The revenue mix of 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer remained stable at 27% and 16% of total wafer sales respectively. Revenue from 0.13-micron and below represented 72% of total wafer sales for this quarter.
Now, let’s move on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the second quarter with NT$207 billion in cash and short-term investments, representing an increase of NT$15 billion from the first quarter.
Total current liabilities increased by NT$88 billion, primarily due to the increase in cash dividends payable and an increase in short-term loans.
Accounts receivable days were 39 days. Inventory turnover days stayed flat at 45 days. Net fixed asset turnover was 1.3 times.
Cash generated from operating activities totaled NT$49 billion, representing an increase of $3 billion from the prior quarter, mainly due to the increase in net income.
Capital expenditure was NT$53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, we borrowed NT$18 billion in short-term loans. The purpose was to hedge a portion of our net position in the U.S. dollars.
Meanwhile, during the second quarter we also invested NT$1.6 billion or 21% ownership of Stion, a U.S. based solar company.
In sum, the ending cash balance was NT$172 billion, increased NT$12.7 billion sequentially. Free cash flow was a net outflow of NT$3.8 billion.
Now let’s turn to capacity and capital expenditure. For the full year 2010 in order to meet continuing strong demand for TSMC’s advanced technologies, we have accelerated our capacity expansion plan.
Under the current plan, overall capacity is expected to increase by 14% year-over-year compared with a 13% increase planned in the last quarter. 12-inch wafer capacity is expected to increase by 36% in 2010 under the current plan.
The total installed capacity was about 2.75 million wafers in the second quarter, representing a 7.1% increase from the prior quarter. We expect the capacity will continue to increase in third quarter by around 7% and further into the fourth quarter by around 3.5%.
In terms of capital expenditure, we spent $1.66 billion in the second quarter. Total capital expenditure in the first half of 2010 was $3.1 billion.
Now, let’s turn to the outlook for the third quarter of 2010. Based on the current business expectations and a forecast exchange rate of NT$31.87, we expect our consolidated revenue in third quarter to come in between NT$109 billion and NT$111 billion.
In terms of margins, we expect our third quarter growth margin to be between 48% and 50%., operating margin to be between 36% and 38%.
This concludes my remark today. Now, I will turn the call over to Dr. Morris Chang, our Chairman and CEO for his remarks.

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,,71079.0,5222167.0,Presenter Speech,Morris Chang,,Executives,4,"Hi everybody, I’d like to make a few comments on market outlook and then supply chain inventory, and then our technology and our payback and capacity plan, and finally a few comments about our new businesses.
First off, on market outlook; our 2010 annual growth forecast for the end semiconductor system markets remain essentially unchanged.
PC, we predict will be 17% year-over-year growth this year. Handsets, we predict will be about 13% year-over-year growth, and digital consumer electronics we predict will be 8% year-over-year, and that’s one point higher than we predicted earlier.
Now, on the semiconductor market, our forecast now is 30% growth this year, and that’s an upward revision from 22% that we made in April. The upward revision is, primarily due to our reassessment of the strength of inventory restocking in the semiconductor supply chain. At the same time, we also forecast that the 2010 foundry market will grow by about 40%, and that’s up from the 36% we forecasted in April.
Now, a few comments about supply chain inventories. Regarding supply chain inventories, based on the second quarter results reported so far, inventory dollar and BOI at most reported IC and the system companies have increased from first quarter.
We estimate that supply chain inventories in aggregate are still below seasonal levels at the end of second quarter, and in fact will still be below seasonal levels at the end of third quarter.
For fabless and IBM companies reported so far, inventory levels have increased at a rate close to the increase in sales. Aggregate BOI increased marginally, but are still lower than seasonal for second quarter.
We expect that chip companies’ inventory levels and BOI will increase slowly and reach close to seasonal levels by fourth quarter. In other words, the chip companies’ inventories run pretty much parallel to the supply chain inventories, perhaps a little better. They were lower than the total supply chain inventories.
Now on technology, TSMC’s 40-nanometer technology is progressing well. It has already accounted for 16% of our total wafer revenues in the second quarter with gross margins in the mid-40s.
We expect the margins of the 40-nanometer technology to further improve and we’ll be very close to the corporate overall level by fourth quarter this year.
On 28-nanometers, our offerings are rich. We have three high-k metal gate processes and one conventional silicon oxynitride process, covering a full range of solutions for customers from high performance to low power to cost-sensitive applications.
We have 28HP, which is high performance, high-k metal gate or high speed ASICs and multi-gigahertz processors. We have 28 HPM, which is the best high-k metal gate SoC technology with broadest range in speed, leakage best suited for smartbooks and other mobile Internet devices.
We have 28HPL, which is lowest standing-by power high-k metal gate technology for mobile and the consumer application. Then we have 28LP, which is low cost conventional CMOS for smartphones and consumer applications.
In the foundry market, we believe that we have the best 28-nanometer, high high-k metal gate SRAM yield and performance while providing two times gate density improvement over our industry leading 40-nanometer technology. Based on public data, TSMC’s gate-last process outperforms competitions gate-first process by a good margin in both the low power and to the high performance classes.
On 20-nanometer developments, we expect to roll out TSMC’s 20-nanometer technology in the second half of 2012.
Our 20-nanometer process will use planar bulk transistors not SOI, coupled with a 20-nanometer not 22-nanometer solution. It offers best value per cost for our customers.
Our 20-nanometers we have two times gate density over our 28-nanometers, with innovations in both immersion lithography and mobility enhancement techniques. TSMC’s 20-nanometer technology is expected to deliver better performance and produce savings on intrinsic wafer cost.
Other than the Moore’s Law progression, which I have talked about, we have spend a great deal of efforts in developing specialty technologies to capture the market trend of integrating more specialty features with CMOS logic and the trend of continually scaling down the geometries for cost and form factor advantages.
Our technology leadership in these specialty technologies improved both feature improvement and the ability to further shrink the geometries. We have already achieved some of very good results. For example, for automotive, we currently use 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer to deliver engine control processors.
For CMOS image sensors, we use 65-nanometer and backside illumination to achieve the best quantum efficiency. For embedded DRAM, we use 40-nanometers to deliver the fastest network processors. For embedded Flash we use 0.11-micron to enable ultra low leakage MCU, microcontroller units of one picoAmp per micron.
For MEMS, we use 0.18-micron to compete 3D CMOS MEMS integration. For power ICs, we use 0.18-micron to achieve the lowest turn-on resistance in the industry.
Our technology efforts including both Moore’s Laws progression and the More Than Moore technologies have attracted many customers to expand their engagement with TSMC.
I mentioned last time that our sales in China has overtaken our sales in Japan, but that was only true for last year. Now this year because of the expanded customer engagement we have in Japan, Japan sales are again raising ahead of Mainland China’s. Of course, Mainland China sales continue to grow at a very high rate, but we believe that Japan will also grow at a very high rate in the coming years.
Now, a few comments on our capacity plan. TSMC’s business model is very importantly partnership with our customers. In fact, virtually all of our major customers are our partners, and all important semiconductor houses are our major customers. We have a responsibility to them to do our utmost to respond to their demand.
Our customers demand for this year and their forecast demand for 2011have both risen since January. Therefore, we have also accelerated our capital spending.
We now forecast our 2010 capital expenditure for the foundry business to be approximately NT$5.8 billion and capital spending for new business to be approximately NT$100 million. Therefore, our total capital expenditure for 2010 is forecast to be approximately NT$5.9 billion.
I want to emphasize that TSMC builds capacity to customer’s demand. We do not build capacity on speculation. In other words, we don’t first build capacity and then look for customer’s businesses.
A major part of the capital spending this year is to ramp-up two of our existing 12-inch GigaFabs, Fab 12 Phase 5 and Fab 14 Phase 4. Each GigaFab when fully loaded has a monthly capacity of around 150,000 12-inch wafers which is three to four times the size of a regular wafer Fab.
Two weeks ago, we also broke ground for our third 12-inch GigaFabs. We call it Fab 15. It is in the Taichung Science Park. We expect to complete Fab construction by early next year and begin installing tools shortly after that.
We have also experienced, accelerated our sourcing by IBMs and growing presence of fabless customers in specialty technologies, such as CMOS image sensors, embedded memories, high voltage, automotive and power.
Therefore, a part of the capital spending will include capacity support for these More Than Moore special technologies. We will support these technologies with both 8-inch and 12-inch capacities in the next few years.
Let me give you a more detailed breakdown of this year’s capital spending for our foundry business, spending for capacity for 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer, and 65-nanometer technologies accounts for 79%; spending for capacity for More Than Moore technologies accounts for 13%; spending for tools and equipment for R&D accounts for 8%.
Now, we increased our capital expenditure forecast from NT$4.8 billion that we gave in January to NT$5.9 billion now. Among the NT$1.1 billion increase in CapEx, the breakdown is as follows, 20 and 28-nanometer capacity spending increased by about NT$315 million; 65-nanometer capacity spending increased by about NT$450 million; specialty technology spending increased by close to $300 million.
Now, I’d like to turn to new businesses. I want to make some remarks on TSMC’s initiatives in the solar and LED lighting market. As you may know, both markets have been growing fast and will continue their growth pattern for a long time due to their long-term economic values as well as the sustainable environmental benefits. However, technology advances together with efficient and large scale manufacturing are essential to reap those benefits.
Emerging these markets, TSMC aims to differentiate ourselves in technology and manufacturing as we have successfully done in the Silicon IC industry.
On the solar front, TSMC have made significant moves during the last year to ensure ourselves a competitive technology and accelerate our entry to the market.
Through the recent technology license and the investment agreement with Stion Corporation, we are transferring and developing together high conversion efficiency CIGS thin-film technology with a very low intrinsic cost structure, based on which both companies will aggressively build our manufacturing capacity to scale in the near future.
We strongly believe that CIGS technology will provide a long-term competitive solution to this high growth market. Earlier, strategic investment in Motech, which is a major crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic manufacturer has accelerated our learning curve and their solar cell support will enable our early entry in the solar market.
As to the LED lighting area, we’re establishing our proprietary capabilities utilizing TSMC’s own technology expertise in semiconductor processing and silicon-based packaging techniques. These intensive technology development activities are progressing well.
While our first LED lighting plant, broken ground in March, is expected to have equipment moving later in the year. In the meantime, we’re working with Taiwan’s very strong LED supply chain to design and develop LED lighting products so that we can go to market.
Longer term, we’ll build our technologies with low cost volume manufacturing and with innovative product design using these technology capabilities to provide various solutions for this very exciting market.
Thank you and these are all my prepared comments. I believe we are open for questions now.

Thanks for providing the additional detail on the additional CapEx split. Couple of follow-ups on that. On the NT$1.1 billion additional spending, I noticed 40-nanometer was absent from that. Does that imply that you’ve seen just more demand stay on 65 and you feel comfortable with 40, or is there anything to read into that? Second question on it, you talked this afternoon about capital intensity rising, do you have updated metrics on how much it’s costing to add 1,000 wafer per month capacity on 28-nanometer versus 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer?

Actually when we build this 4.8 CapEx forecast, the biggest amount was to go the 40-nanometer, so with that amount still remain high. So in this update we did not change the number, because we see very strong demand from 65-nanometer that’s why we increased capital expenditure. Also for 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer because we’re a little bit very early scale, so we can side with R&D and also (inaudible) earlier. So that’s why the CapEx for NT$1.1 billion mainly attribute to 65-nanometer and 28-nanometer.

Well, I also said this afternoon and I would say it again, we pay very close attention to controlling the costs, and we call intrinsic costs. I used the term in my prepared comment. So that costs is not yet stabilized. In other words, we are still trying very diligently and in fact quite successfully to reduce the costs. So far, the capital investment in 28-nanometer is still only in the initial stage. And as I said we are using the initial stage to build up capacity for the risk production phase, but we’re also using this experience to lower the capital intensity of the 28-nanometer. So I cannot give you a number right now.

This is Dan Heyler. I think I’m live already. So a quick question on margins, guys. On the second quarter outlook, you’ve exceeded your revenue guidance by NT$104.9 billion or NT$105 billion versus the upper end of your guidance which was NT$102 billion, and then GP margin was just slightly below the upper end and OP margin was slightly above the upper end, so I guess that’s the first observation.
The second observation is on the guidance, despite your revenue growth of about 4% to 6%, you’re guiding effectively a flat to similar margin range of 48% to 50%. So if you could elaborate and help us understand the margin dynamics here despite the rising revenue?

On the second quarter, we have exceeded guidance in terms of revenue but the margin stayed at the high end of guidance not exceeding the guidance. We have observed two things in second quarter. Number one is, there were increases in room wafer price. So that had some negative impact on second quarter margins. Also the inventory valuation have effect on our second quarter because we view inventory for third quarter, so that is the reason. A similar reason on wafer pricing also goes through the third quarter, so that will have continue impact on the margin.
Also as Chairman commented this afternoon, because we are under very severe supply constraint, so we have made our most effort to satisfy our customer, to get more output in second quarter and third quarter. So we do not optimize the margin per se, but we do maximize the profitability.

Thanks for bringing me back in. I guess to follow-up on the capital intensity question, maybe less specific to 28-nanometer, but if you could give metrics, say, on how expensive it’s been to add additional capacity even this year or last year relative to prior cycles, if you could give a feel for how much capital intensity is rising?

I will give you one example. Take 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer as an example. In TSMC, we believe the 20-nanometer capital per k is roughly about 20% to 25% having that of 65-nanometer.

I think you mentioned margin actually getting to the point it could be pretty close by year end. Its yields are actually also comparable. The second question I had was on the 2010 foundry growth, this afternoon where you said it was 40% for foundry industry. I think if we took TSMC in line with that and your 5% growth in third quarter, are you thinking about a fourth quarter, like a low single-digit type of decline for TSMC? Are you taking into consideration you think TSMC grows in line with foundries or could actually outgrow the foundry sector?

Last earnings call, you talked about it was doubtful that you thought there was much double bookings going on, but you also said that demand was 30% to 40% above what you could supply. Now, here we are 90 days later and we’ve seen some incremental soft lines in PCs and mobile phones and even LCD area. So I guess I’m curious if you could talk a little bit about have you seen anything up at your level? I think you said that the computing segment was soft in 2Q and it would remain soft in 3Q. Is that broad based or one customer? I guess the gist of the question is, if you can go through the segments and talk about any incremental softness you may have also felt since last earning season.

I know you don’t want to talk about 2011 capital spending, but at least we should have an idea for where do we think depreciation is going to be and what kind of run rate we are looking at for 2011 at this point.

You have seen our financial report. We have showed first quarter and second quarter numbers. So if you take the NT$89 billion and subtract those two numbers you can have idea of the second half numbers.

So that sounds like a very high number and increase in CapEx compared to increase wafer start per month relative your prior guidance and that’s what I am trying to get a sense of.

So this is very difficult for you just to look at these numbers into a conclusion, because there is indeed a dynamics of the product mix.
The second thing is even if we mention about the spending for the $1.1 billion, but some of the spending does not translates to capacity right away, so you cannot say all the spending are completely being reflected in the full quarter capacity that we have put out.
