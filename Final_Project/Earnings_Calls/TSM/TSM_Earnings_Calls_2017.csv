Do you hear me okay? Okay, thank you for joining us today.
My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of our 2016 performance, followed by the guidance of the current quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue rose 0.7 percentage -- rose 0.7% sequentially to TWD 262 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance given in October, due to stronger demand for TSMC's 16-nanometer technology and the more favorable foreign exchange rate than our original forecast. Gross margin increased by 1.6 percentage points for the overall quarter to 52.3%, mainly driven by continued cost-improvement efforts. Operating margin also increased at 1.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.9%, while R&D expense continued to grow, reflecting a higher level of 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer development activities.
Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached TWD 3.86, and ROE was 30% for the quarter.
Now let's take a look at the wafer revenue contribution by application. During the fourth quarter, Communication and Computer increased 11% and 7% on the prior quarter, respectively, while Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased by 43% and 6%, respectively. For a full year basis, all 4 segments experienced year-on-year growth. Communication increased 16% Y-o-Y and represented 62% of our total wafer revenue, while Computer increased 15%. Consumer grew 32%. Industrial/Standard rose 1%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. Combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer reached 33% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 31% in the third quarter, while 28-nanometer contribution remained strong at 24% of revenue. Advanced technology, meaning 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 57% of total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, the combined 16-, 20-nanometer contribution increased by 8 percentage points and reached 28% of total wafer revenue in 2016. Advanced technologies, 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of total wafer revenue, up from 48% in 2015.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 632 billion, an increase of TWD 115 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 61 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 3 days to 45 days, while inventory -- while our days of inventory decreased 3 days to 41 days, mainly driven by the reduction of work in process.
Now let me make a few comment on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 185 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 113 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 73 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 77 billion to reach TWD 541 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditure reached $3.5 billion, and the totaled year CapEx was USD 10.2 billion. This is a bit higher than our prior guidance of slightly above $9.5 billion, mainly due to accelerated delivery of advanced technology tools.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in 2016. 2016 was a good year for TSMC, as once again we set new records in terms of revenue and earning. Our revenue grew 12.4% year-over-year to reach TWD 948 billion or up 10.6% to USD 29.4 billion term, as we saw wafer shipments increase across nearly all technology nodes. Gross margin increased 1.4 percentage points to 50.1% in 2016 mainly due to continued cost-reduction efforts and, to a lesser extent, a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Our operating margin also increased 2 percentage points to reach 39.9%.
Our effective tax rate was 13.5% in 2016, same as in 2015. And full year earnings per share was TWD 12.89, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Excluding major one-off items, namely share disposal gains and the closure of our Solar operation in 2015 and a negative impact from earthquake in 2016, our EPS would have grown 17.4% year-over-year in 2016.
On cash flow, we spent TWD 328 billion in capital expenditure, while we generated TWD 540 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 212 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 156 billion in cash dividends, an increase of 33% from the 2015.
From a semiconductor industry standpoint, we estimate that the semiconductor market is likely to have a remained flat year-on-year. While fabless grow 5% and foundry rose 8%, the outperformance of foundry over the overall semiconductor industry was mainly driven by the strong demand from 4G+ smartphone in the China market, the replacement upgrade of gaming and emergence of artificial intelligence. Compared to foundry's 8% growth, TSMC's 11% growth in U.S. dollar underscore our further market segment share gain from 55% in 2015 to 56% in 2016, which is mainly propelled by our leadership in 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer. We estimated fabless days of inventory ended in '16 at slightly above seasonal level by about 2 days.
I have finished my remarks on the financial summary. Now let me turn on to the first quarter outlook. Moving on to the first quarter 2017, we forecast that demand is weaker than the prior quarter due to mobile product seasonality and slightly above seasonal supply chain inventory at the end of 2016. Based on our current forecast and exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32, we expect first quarter revenue to be between TWD 236 billion and TWD 239 billion, which represents 8.9% to 10% sequential decline; gross profit margin to be between 51.5% and 53.5%; and operating margin to be between 40.5% and 42.5%.
This concludes my remarks. Now I would like to turn the podium to Chairman for his comments.",941

And Lora has just given her report on the last quarter, and also she gave her outlook for the first quarter. I will just spend a few minutes to talk about 2017, the whole year.
For 2017, we expect smartphone unit growth of 6% from 1.47 billion units to 1.55 billion units. Of this smartphone growth, we expect the high-end smartphone will grow 3%, the mid-end will grow 5%, and the lower end will grow 8%. For 2017, we also expect that PC units will decline 5%. Tablets will decline 7%. DCE units will decline 5%, and IoT units will grow 34%.
Again for 2017, we expect semiconductor market to grow 4%, foundry revenue to grow 7%. We expect TSMC revenue to grow 5% to 10% in U.S. dollars. TSMC revenue, we expect to grow 5% to 10% in U.S. dollars. We believe that, in the first half of 2017, our growth over the same period last year will be close to 10%. And in the second half of 2017, our growth over the same period last year will be close to 5%.
We expect to continue to increase our R&D investments both in dollars and moderately in its percent of revenue. We also reaffirm our long-term growth projection which was made a couple of years ago. We think that, in the 2015-to-2020 time period, TSMC revenue and operating profit will grow at a compound annual average rate of 5% to 10%, 5% to 10%. And TSMC will maintain an ROE of above 20%.
That concludes my outlook for 2017. And I believe we are now open for questions.",289

Now as to why we are only -- why I projected just now that we are only going to grow the same rate as the foundry growth, well, first of all, we may well be conservative. It's really too early to say. Because I said just now in answer to this gentleman's question that -- well, I -- actually, I said that when I was giving the message, that the second half -- the first half year-over-year will be 10% -- about 10% growth and the second half will be only 5%. And well, the second half is further away, and that always makes it more difficult to predict. And so rather than erring on the high side, we would rather err on the low side. So that's the first reason. And there is another reason. That is, this year, I think, 2017, will be pretty strong. In terms of technology, it will be a pretty strong 16- or 14-FinFET year. And our market share in 16, while it was quite high, is not as high as I would like. It's -- actually, it's in the -- close to 70%, or 65% or 70%. Now that's not quite as high as our 28-nanometer, which even now we're at like almost 80%-some. And now 2017 is -- I think, is a pretty -- will be -- we think, will be a pretty strong year. And so we're running into a little air pocket here, if you recall, this same par [ph] with the rest of the foundry air pocket, because -- you recall that air pocket. And well, we're running into a little air pocket, but then the next step after is -- of course, is 10 and 7. And we see a clear sky. We see a clear sky, anyway, yes, there. So those 2 reasons. First, possible, a little conservatism. And second, there's a little concern that our 16 is not -- does not have as high a market share as I like, as I would like. And 2017 happens to be a very strong -- we think, a very strong 16-FinFET year. Now having said all of that, I will say that we certainly do not think we will lose market share. So when I said that foundry will grow at 7% and we are going to grow at between 5% and 10%, we'll just further clarify that statement by saying that we're going to grow. We're not going to grow less than foundry, yes.",452

And then the second question I had was on profitability. Margins are holding up quite well in the first quarter, where normally utilization droppage should fall a few points. So if you could talk about the factors holding it up; and then, as we move through the year, how the expectation from that level, factoring we're ramping 10-nanometer, if you expect margin to improve from that level.",89

So what will be TSMC's strategy to fit in this policy direction and ensure your own leadership?",50

And that report was written to President Obama. And there will be a new President in a few days, and whether any of that report will be adopted as policy by the new President is still unknown. But having said all that, I will say that Mr. Trump, President-elect Trump, has said many times that he wants to create jobs in the United States, and we highly applaud that. TSMC actually has created, we believe, hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States in the last 20, 30 years of our existence. We -- for all practical purposes, we have created an industry, the fabless industry in the United States, and we have grown it. And the fabless industry, I believe, employs hundreds of thousands of people in the United States. And we have done that by being here ourselves. Well, I think that we will continue to create more jobs in the United States by helping the fabless industry in the United States. And the IDMs, they use us. There are many IBMs [ph] in the United States. They use us. And by using us, they have grown faster. And they create jobs too. So now I -- as to -- I mean that's actually, of course, Mr. Trump's main policy, to create jobs. And of course, he has said a lot of things about other things, all right? And I'm not -- I don't want to comment on them right now. As far as that report is concerned, yes, in fact, I think that the report was preceded [ph] by the Commerce Secretary in the United States, Penny -- well, something -- I mean Penny (sic) [ Penny Pritzker ] -- yes. And I think that I agree with most of the things, but -- I agree with most of the things in the report. In fact, I agree with most of the things that Penny said, but just keep in mind that, that report was written to President Obama, yes. And actually, even if President Obama continues to be in office, I mean, the chance of his adopting the recommendations of a presidential task force are not very high. I mean this -- we have history to guide us. In fact, I'll just tell you an anecdote: In 2006, I met President Bush, then President of the United States. And at that time, the -- his, President Bush's, task force, advisory task force, on Iraq had just submitted a report. Basically it recommended the U.S. withdrawing from Iraq, and President Bush did not adopt that recommendation. He actually adopted the contrary, which to -- was to increase the troops in Iraq. And so I mean that's just an example that quickly came to my mind when somebody talks about, ""Report has been written,"" yes.",484

So my next question is to Lora because it's a more [indiscernible] financial question. So your first quarter gross margin guidance seems to be similar to your first quarter.

And 28-nanometer still accounts for a big part of our revenue this year, with very good profits. And we continue to do the cost reduction so we can maintain a pretty good margin in spite of decline in revenue in the first quarter. That's the reason. I -- your second question, you're asking about depreciation for the whole year. Okay, with the USD 10 billion CapEx in 2017, which will be slightly front-end loaded, by the way, so the depreciation year-over-year, we expect to grow about high teens this year versus last year. In terms of first quarter, since last year's CapEx was very much back-end loaded, so we expect a more than 10% depreciation increase quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter.",134

So those particular customers' demand fluctuation impacts our seasonal, I mean, our quarterly fluctuations. It's a great deal, great deal. And so seasonality to us doesn't mean very much anymore. Every year, seasonality is different from the next year's or last year's. Last year, we had a pretty low first quarter and a pretty strong second quarter. And then our third and fourth quarters are -- were even stronger, yes, I think, right? And this year, at least at this point, we see a somewhat different pattern. So yes, it's customer demand.

I do not rule it out, but I see a lot of sacrifices that we and our customers will have to make if we do that. Keep in mind that we earned our business in the United States not by lower labor costs in Taiwan. In fact, on the whole, our labor costs in Taiwan are not lower than in the United States. Now we earn our business by being good. Just to give you an example: Every year, we send thousands of engineers from one location to another. We have 3 locations in Taiwan: Taitung, Hsinchu and Tainan. Now Taitung and Hsinchu are within daily commuting distance. Tainan -- and you can even make a point that Tainan and Hsinchu and Tainan and Taitung are within daily commuting distance also, although it's a little hard. But I know of people in New York, Manhattan. I know people that commute 1.5 hours, 2 hours each way every day, and if you are willing to do that, you can certainly commute between Tainan and Taitung and/or Tainan and Hsinchu also. Now probably you have -- backing up a few steps, you don't want to do that. It takes too long and still within weekly commuting distance, all right? So every year, we send literally over 1,000, 2,000 engineers from one location to another, to be there for months. And that allows us to ramp up things quickly and to solve problems quickly also. When one location, when one fab, has got a problem, then another fab -- engineers from another fab can go ahead and help them, yes. And literally thousands, thousands, of engineer years do that every year. Now if we have a plant in the U.S., we wouldn't be able to do that anymore. Second point, we have thousands of vendor people here in -- well, in -- actually they're more in Hsinchu and -- well, in Hsinchu. And Tainan, some -- has them also, thousands of engineers from our partners located here. Well -- and these are things that are not low labor costs. These are things that we'll lose if we set up a plant in the U.S. And if we lose these things, our customers will lose too, all right? So yes, you clearly say earlier [ph] -- I don't know. Yes, I don't rule it out. And actually, I've never ruled it out, but year-to-year, time and again, we consider the subject. And we have not made the decision to go there. Well, except, of course, we -- early in our life, we did set up a wafer tech in the United (sic) [ United States ], and it's still going and has 1,500 employees -- about 1,500 employees. It's still going, but other than that -- and that was set up in 1996. After that, we consider the question every so often, and we have not made the decision to set up a plant in the United States.",500

Our 7-nanometer is under qualification now, and it will be qualified as according to plan around the end of first quarter. And we have already more than 20 customers designing on this 7-nanometers, and so -- and this year alone, we'll be -- we estimate we'll be 15, 20 tape-outs already. So this is our momentum built so far on 7-nanometer, and no other competitor is getting to this stage of this leading-edge technology. So we have -- we are to -- remember I mentioned last time we will have 5-nanometer 2 years from now. And forget about the name. And that will be a full node, a shrink, and that will sit competing well with any technology come out at that time, okay? Let me add some on 7-nanometer. We will maintain our 7-nanometer competitiveness, just like we do on 28 and 16. And we will have a technology currently planned at 7-nanometer but with the EUV insertion in the second year of a second -- 7-nanometer, just 1 year -- approximately 1 year after, and that can greatly simplify the process and without increase the cost. And that is, if customer can take advantage of minor design, it can further reduce their density -- increase their density, reduce their die cost. And that is all planned to maintain the competitiveness of 7-nanometer the year after. So we think 7-nanometer is a well-adopted node by all the customers, and we plan for the subsequent technology to shore up the demand continuously. And we hope to use this technology, I mean the second-year technology, to prepare for the EUV production experience for the full-fledged EUV technology on 5s. So then our customer can have a very, hopefully, smoothed getting-to from our 7- to our 5-nanometer technology. So that is how we maintain our technology competitiveness.",315

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to joining us today. My presentation, as usual, will start with financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance of the second quarter.
First quarter revenue decreased 10.8% sequentially but increased 14.9% year-over-year, the sequential decline reflecting mobile product seasonality and about 2% appreciation in NT dollars against the U.S. dollar. When we give our guidance in the first quarter, we were assuming USD 1 to TWD 32. However, the actual average exchange rate was TWD 31.16, which reduced our revenue by about TWD 6 billion. Without the NT dollars appreciation, our first quarter revenue would have been about TWD 240 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance. 
First quarter gross margin was 51.9%, slightly lower than the fourth quarter 2016, mainly due to lower level capacity utilization and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate, partly balanced by continued cost improvement.
Operating expense ratio rose to 11.1% as R&D -- as a percentage of revenue increased by 70 basis point, so operating margin decreased 1.1 percentage point sequentially to 40.8% in the first quarter. 
Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 3.38, and ROE was 24.6%.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the first quarter, Consumer and Computer increased 30% and 1%, respectively; while Communication and Industrial/Standard decreased 18% and 5%, respectively, due to mobile product seasonality.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. Combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer was 31% of total wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 28-nanometer represented 25% of total wafer revenue. Advanced technologies, which we define as 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 56% of total wafer revenue in the first quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 659 billion, an increase of TWD 27 billion from the fourth quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities slightly increased by TWD 3 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 2 days to 47 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 44 days.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and the CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 161 billion cash from operation and spent $103 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 58 billion. We also repaid $10 billion corporate bonds and net purchase of about $7 billion fixed income securities. Overall cash balance increased by TWD 23 billion to reach TWD 565 billion at the end of the first quarter.
In the U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditure was USD 3.3 billion. Full year capital budget remained at about USD 10 billion. 
I have just finished the financial summary for the first quarter. Now let me turn into the second quarter guidance. We expect second quarter demand will be weaker than the first quarter due to supply chain inventory management during the second quarter and mobile product seasonality. Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 30.5, we expect second quarter revenue to be between TWD 213 billion and TWD 216 billion, which represents 8% to 9% sequential decline; gross profit margin to be between 50.5% and 52.5%; and operating margin to be between 39% and 41%. The margin guidance reflects a higher utilization level for working process building to support a strong 10-nanometer shipment in the third quarter. 
Also, in the second quarter, we will again need to accrue the 10% tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be about 23%. The tax rate will then fall back to 10% to 11% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 13% and 14%. 
This concludes my remark, and I will turn the -- turn it over to Mark for his comments.",659

Let me start my message on the near-term demand and supply chain inventory. 
Since all our shipments are in U.S. dollars, allow me to just use the U.S. dollar to describe our demand. We just concluded our first quarter revenue to be above our January guidance in U.S. dollars. It gives us a minus 9% quarter-to-quarter in U.S. dollars, which is about plus 22% year-to-year growth. This quarter-to-quarter change in 1Q '17 was due to the seasonality of our major smartphone customer and a slower smartphone demand in China. 
We now forecast our second quarter revenue to decline about 6% quarter-to-quarter in U.S. dollars. Year-over-year, this is the increase of about 3% year-to-year in U.S. dollars. Together with the 1Q revenue, our first half 2017 revenue would grow about 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This is slightly higher than the 10% increase year-to-year we forecasted in our January investor conference. 
We now estimate fabless DOI is still high, high above seasonal exiting first quarter '17. Our second quarter revenue guidance does reflect a quite severe inventory adjustment by our customers, particularly in smartphone and PC markets. However, the overall end-market smartphone demand appears stable in second quarter '17. We estimate that fabless DOI should approach seasonal level at the end of second quarter of '17, and demand for our products will be poised for a strong growth in the third quarter. 
Given the very strong demand in the second half last year, we maintain our second half '17, this year, growth rate estimate of 5% year-over-year. And our [ full ] 2017 growth rate target remains to be 5% to 10% in U.S. dollars, as we previously stated. 
Now the forecast of overall semiconductor market growth rate compared to 3 months ago, we raised it to 7% from 4% due to a stronger memory market. Semiconductor, excluding memory, market growth rate remains at 7 -- at 4% this year. We also revised foundry revenue growth to 5% from 7% due to this elevated inventory in the supply chain. Our 5% to 10% full year growth forecast shows we will continue to increase our market share this year. 
Thank you. I'll hand the mic to C.C. Wei -- oh, I'm sorry, Lora.",373

As you may all know, NT dollars is the reporting currency for our -- all our financial statements due to the fact that nearly 100% of TSMC's revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and about 75% of our cost of goods sold and about 70% of our operating expenses are based in NT dollars. Therefore, the fluctuation in exchange rate between U.S. dollars and NT dollars will have a sizable impact to our reported revenue and gross margins. The sensitivity of revenue to U.S. dollar/NT dollar exchange rate is nearly 100%, that is if every 1% appreciation of NT dollars to U.S. dollar will reduce our reported revenue by about 1%. The sensitivity of both our gross margin and operating margin to the same 1% exchange rate change is about 40 basis point. That is if NT appreciates 1% against U.S. dollars, our gross margin and operating margin will both come down by about 40 basis point. 
Compared with the first quarter guidance made in January 12, the NT dollar has appreciated by an average about 2.6% sequentially, which negatively impact our first quarter revenue by about 2.6% and our gross profit margin about 100 basis point, gross margin and operating margin each. 
For 2017, the second quarter, we forecast the average NT dollars will further appreciate another 2.1% sequentially, which will negatively impact our second quarter revenue by 2.1% and then reduce our gross margin and operating margin by about 85 basis point. 
Should exchange rate have stayed at a fourth quarter '16 level, which was 31.77% in average, our first quarter '17 revenue would have been 1.9% better than the actual number reported here, and our second quarter revenue would have been 4% better than we just guided. 
Thank you. I will turn it to C.C. Wei then.",333

Wei,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with 10-nanometer ramp status. 
We have passed the reliability qualification on internal technology qualification vehicle and have also passed 500-hour reliability qualification on several customers' end product. N10 has been transferred from R&D to operation in both Fab 12 in Hsinchu and Fab 15 in Taichung and is ready for high volume production. Although N10 technology is very challenging, the yield and the progression has been the [ fastest ] as compared to the previous node such as the 20- and 16-nanometer. Our current N10 yield progress is slightly ahead schedule. The ramp of N10 will be very fast in the second half of this year. We expect the 10 nanometers will contributed about a 10% of our wafer revenue this year.
Now let's move to N7 and [ N7+ ]. TSMC N7 will enter risk production in second quarter this year. So far, we have more than 30 customers actively engaged in N7. And we expect about 15 tape-outs in this year with volume production [ expected ] in 2018. In just 1 year after our launch of N7, we plan to introduce [ N7+ ] in 2018. [ N7+ ] whatever is EUV technology [indiscernible] critical layers to sell more emerging layers. In addition to process simplification, our [ N7+ ] provides better transistor performance by about 10% and reduces the chip size by up to 10% when compared with the N7. High volume production of [ N7+ ] is expected in second half 2018 -- I'm sorry, in second half of 2019. Right now, our focus on EUV include power source stability, [ telecom ] for EUV mask and stability of the photoresist. We continue to work with ASML to improve the [ tool ] productivity so that it can be ready for mass production on schedule. 
Now N5. We have been working with major customers to define 5-nanometer specs and to develop technology to support customers and risk production schedule in second quarter 2019, with volume ramp in 2020. Functional SRAM in our test vehicle has already been established. We plan to use more layers of EUV in N5 as compared to [ N7+ ].
In addition to those leading-edge technology, we also continue to improve N16 and 28-nanometer, which are in mass production for many years. 
Now let me talk about N12. After we have developed 16-nanometer technologies from 16FF to 16FF+ and then to 16FFC, we further extend this technology to 12-nanometer, which will have about a 10% better performance at the same total power or 25% lower power consumption at the same speed and about 8 to 10 smaller die size compared with our 16FFC. Although 12-nanometer wire have smaller metal pitches as compared to 16FFC, we have worked with IP infrastructure partner to build a complete IP support to make sure our customers' 16-nanometer product can be successfully ported to 12-nanometer with minimal effort. 
We anticipate the completion of 12-nanometer development by middle of this year. So far, more than 10 customer has actively engaged with 7 tape-outs intended in 2017. The major applications were the mid- to low-end smartphones. With 12-nanometer having better cost structure and better performance than our already competitive 16-nanometer, we expect to maintain a high market segment share in this N16, N12 node. 
Now 22ULP. 22ULP is a hub node of our 28-nanometer technology. We developed this technology to address the market segment where low operating voltage are required. Applications in IoT, imaging signal processing, GPS, WiFi and 5G millimeter wave are examples that can find good use of this technology. Compared to our 28HPC+, our 22ULP offers 15% performance improvement or 35 power reduction. It also reduces the die size by up to 10%. 
In addition, the RF performance, the cut-off frequency was [indiscernible] much of our frequency, it also improved to 400 and the 370 gigahertz, which is used for the 5G application. We expect to begin 22ULP volume production in 2018. We've enhanced the features carried by this technology. We expect to maintain a high market share in these 28, 22 technology primarily.
Now let me talk about the specialty technology. Especially this time, I will cover ultra-low power, which is very important for all mobile products. We have offered the foundries of most comprehensive ultra-low power technology portfolio, including 55-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 28-nanometer, 16FFC and now 22ULP and 12ULP. All these technologies are targeting IoT, with low end smartphone, GPS, Bluetooth and other applications. Depending on each application's performance and the power requirement, the customer can choose their optimal solution from our portfolio. 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer ULP are in high volume production since early 2016.
So far, there have been more than 35 products running in the line. Meanwhile, 28ULP, 16FFC are also in high volume production. In addition to those technologies, we have also developed [ neo space ] low-voltage technology in 40-nanometer. This technology can achieve power consumption below 10 microampere per megahertz active power, which is 5x to 10x lower than industry's best product for today. We are working on the design enablement support for our 40-nanometer [ neo space ] low-voltage, which will be completed by third quarter this year. 
Now let me update on InFO. First, we expect InFO revenue in 2017 will be about USD 500 million. Now we are engaging with multiple customers to develop next-generation InFO technology for smartphone application for their 2018, 2019 models. We are also developing various InFO technologies to extend the application into high-performance computing area, such as InFO on substrate, and we call it [ InFO OS ]; and InFO with memory and substrate, [ InFO MS ]. These technologies will be ready by third quarter this year or first quarter next year. 
That's all my update. Thank you for your attention. Mark?",973

This is to share with you the recent development in the semiconductor industry and how TSMC positioned ourselves to ride on this trend. We are in a new era where billions of devices are connected at all times, and computing takes place at any time and any place. This is what we've referred to as ubiquitous computing. For smartphone, for example, in addition to the smartphone unit growth, more intelligent features, such as voice, image recognition and AI for decision-making, will further increase its computing power and silicon content. Given the vast established subscription base of smartphone today, it is the best launchpad for new consumer hardware and software innovation. 
For AI in high-performance computing, let me first define the HPC, high-performance computing, at the semiconductor used in data centers, servers, networking, storage and gaming. Artificial intelligence application and services and 5G infrastructures are the major driving force with leading-edge technology behind this HPC growth. For example, more than half of our customer product tape-outs with our 7-nanometer today we see are HPC products. 
Recently, we are also very encouraged by the support of a major AI service provider on ARM-based processor for data center in Open Compute Project Summit this year. Accelerators used in data center are also increasing, adopting the GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs. We expect HPC to become our major growth engine from 2020. 
The trend of ubiquitous AI also shows up in many IoT and consumer devices such as robot, drones, surveillance devices, smart TV and set-top box. Ubiquitous AI will also be widely used in a fast-developing autonomous car market. All these require very intensive, localized parallel computing capability which drive up the silicon content. 
At TSMC, we work with innovators around the world. TSMC's long-term growth engine ride on this industry trend from mobile computing to ubiquitous computing. The proliferation of AI demands insatiable computing capability from semiconductors. As C.C. just talked about our technology updates, we are developing various technologies and innovation platforms to satisfy this industry trend.

They can use their IP portfolio in 28-nanometer. The 10% die shrink is actually the optical [ direct ] shrink. So the customer does not have to do anything. They can easily port their existing product or the new product into 22ULP and take advantage of the higher performance, most important much lower power consumption, and then put their new product to compete in the market. So we think it is very, very competitive. Under 12ULP, we just shrink a little bit on the metal piece. But as I just mentioned, we also work with the IP infrastructure partner to go down -- to minimize their effort. So again, this one offers a very effective path -- a cost-effective path from 16-nanometer into 12-nanometer. So we expect for this kind of advantage we offer to our customer, we still can maintain a fairly high market share.",211

Yet, I believe it was C.C. that said, yes, they're increasing functionality there, so the die size doesn't really change too much there. Yet this year, as we go to 10-nanometer, we get a little bit more benefit from a stronger shrink. So I'm curious, what do you think of the impacts? Will a smaller die size thus require less wafers from you in the second half of the year? Or more importantly, is the ASP differential at 10-nanometer significantly more versus, let's say, 16-nanometer FFC that more than offsets any potential die strength? So could you comment a little bit about die sizes and maybe ASP differentials on 16-nanometer FFC versus 10-nanometer?",131

He's basically asking that our major customer this year will migrate from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer, and therefore, he assumes that it will be a smaller die. And since it's a smaller die, whether or not it will be fewer wafers. And if it's fewer wafers, whether or not the ASP increase can more than offset by the fewer wafers.",66

I have said maybe a couple of times in the few -- coming few years, we expect our capital intensity will be ranging from 30% to 35% still is our view, okay? In terms of how do we do it because capital is very expensive in the company, and that's utmost important decision in the company. So we spend a lot of effort trying to -- as the generation becomes shorter. So that makes the equipment reuse even more critical. So we have invented another way trying to increase the commonality from node to node. Either it's some idle or open tool or trying to utilize those idle open tool, okay? So either migration or [ nature ] of several fab take up each other. And a lot of innovation coming from operation people trying to reduce the CapEx we have to spend. And also, we are putting more focus on what's the peak capacity building. You cannot follow -- just follow what customer tell you the highest demand they need. You have to look at the cycle and find out what's the optimal peak capacity you build. And once you build it, you try and utilize the capacity as much as possible, including you have sometimes you have to move product among quarters just for the purpose to utilize capacity. So that are the several ways that we have been doing in the company to improve the capital efficiency.",256

All their nodes can also be driven by smartphones because of low cost or mid-end. HPC, if I use the current biggest IDM, which is probably the biggest HPC player right now, most of their capacity is leading edge and they probably have N and [ N-1 ], that's pretty much it. And they work on a very accelerated schedule in terms of capacity conversion. So when TSMC -- when HPC becomes the bigger driver for TSMC, how do you think about capacity planning? Are we going to have a lot more conversion from, let's say, 10 or 10 plus 7 to 5? Or are there enough second wave, third wave, even within that ambit of ubiquitous computing that could drive second or third wave for the fresh capacity that you put on?",153

Let me ponder this with you. TSMC is very different than this IDM company. We are in every segment in the market. Therefore, we attack the leading edge and we capture the HPC, doesn't mean this technology later on, when the technology move, it doesn't have the usage for all other segments, let alone you talk about HPC's volume.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will starting from the financial highlights for the second quarter, followed by the guidance for the third quarter.
Second quarter revenue decreased 8.6% quarter-over-quarter and 3.6% year-over-year. This sequential decline reflecting supply chain inventory management, mobile product seasonality and appreciation in NT dollar against the U.S. dollar. In U.S. dollar terms, second quarter revenue was USD 7.06 billion, about 5.9% decrease Q-over-Q but 3.2% increase year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 50.8%, 1.1 percentage lower than the first quarter, mainly due to the unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Operating expenses ratio rose to 11.9% as our revenue decreased more than the expense decrease.  Operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points sequentially to reach 38.9% in the second quarter. 
As I said in my last quarterly conference, the second quarter corporate tax rate would be 23% due to the accrual of 10% undistributed retained earnings tax. The tax rate will fall back to 10% and 11% level in the second half, and the full year tax rate will remain at 13% to 14%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was $2.56 and ROE was 19%.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the second quarter, Communication, Computer and Consumer decreased 10%, 14% and 7%, respectively, while Industrial/Standard increased 9%.
In terms of revenue by technology, 10-nanometer process technology contributed 1% of total wafer revenue during the second quarter, while the combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer accounted for 26% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, and 28-nanometer represented 27% of total wafer revenue. So advanced technology, defined as 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of our total wafer revenue in the second quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 659 billion, essentially flat from the first quarter. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 202 billion as we accrued about TWD 182 billion for cash dividends, which will be paid out this month.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 47 days, while days of inventory increased 8 days to 52 days, primarily due to the higher working process inventory for the 10-nanometer to support the production ramp in third quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 103 billion cash from operations. We spent TWD 105 billion in capital expenditure, so the free cash flow was an outflow of about TWD 2 billion. We also disposed TWD 5 billion of fixed income investment. As a result, overall, our cash balance increased by about TWD 6 billion to TWD 570 billion at the end of the second quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first half capital expenditure was USD 6.8 billion. Full year capital budget remained at about USD 10 billion. 
Before I conclude the financial summary, I would like to point out the impact of foreign exchange rate on our revenue. As I mentioned to you last time, nearly all TSMC's revenue is in U.S. dollar. The sensitivity of our revenue to U.S. dollar versus NT dollar exchange rate is nearly 100%. And the sensitivity of both our gross margin and operating margin to 100 basis points exchange rate fluctuation is about 40 basis points.
In the first quarter, NT dollars appreciated by 2% sequentially, followed by another 3% appreciation in the second quarter. Year-over-year, NT dollars appreciated 6% in first quarter and 6.6% in second quarter. Therefore, our first half 2017 revenue in NT dollars only went up by 5.3% compared to first half 2016, whereas in U.S. dollars, our revenue in the first half grew 12.2% from first half 2016. This is better than what we stated in the January investor conference that our first half 2017 revenue would grow by about 10% from first half 2016 in U.S. dollar terms.
Now let me turn into third quarter guidance. First of all, starting from this quarter, our quarterly revenue guidance will be given in U.S. dollar only. We make these changes because nearly of our revenue -- all our revenue are in U.S. dollars and that giving revenue guidance in U.S. dollar more truthfully reflects our business expectation.
So based on current business outlook, we expect third quarter revenue to be between USD 8.12 billion and USD 8.22 billion. Based on assumptions of TWD 30.30 to USD 1, our third quarter gross margin is expected to be between 48.5% and 50.5%. Our third quarter operating margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. 
Since we begin a significant ramp of our 10-nanometer production in third quarter, we expect the 10-nanometer ramp will impact our second half 2017 gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points. The impact on third quarter margins has already been reflected in our third quarter guidance, which I just provided.
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the microphone to Mark for his comments.",836
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 13, 2017",2017-07-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5337.0,1244736.0,50473741.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me continue to deliver my key messages. First, I want to talk about our near-term demand. Because again, all our customer orders are in U.S. dollar, I will here describe our near-term demand in terms of our revenue in U.S. dollar.
We now concluded our second quarter with revenue of minus 6% quarter-to-quarter and plus 3% year-to-year in U.S. dollar. As we forecasted in our previous conference, the second quarter was impacted by a quite severe inventory adjustment from fabless customers, and we saw fabless customer inventory quickly by adjusting during this period. Combining the first and the second quarters, our first half 2017 revenue will grow 12% year-to-year in U.S. dollar, higher than our guidance of 10% year-to-year growth we've estimated in our January conference. 
On the fabless inventory, with fabless companies revenue going through recovery and the above-mentioned inventory management, fabless DOI has substantially decreased but still slightly above seasonal exiting Q2. We estimate the fabless inventory will continuously reduce and will come to about seasonal level at the end of third quarter. 
Coming to the third quarter, we forecast our third quarter revenue will grow 15.7% quarter-to-quarter. This growth is driven by a fast ramp-up of 10-nanometer mobile customer products, but moderated by the continuous inventory adjustment. We expect China smartphone market, after a slow demand period in the first half, will start to recover with new models to launch in the third quarter 2017. Other than smartphone, we continue to see good momentum in industrial and automotive sectors.
So we raised this year's worldwide non-memory semiconductor growth rate from 4% to 6%. This is primarily due to a richer product mix in several markets, including computing, communication and automotive. We also increased this year's foundry growth forecast from 5% to 6%. For TSMC, we reiterate our full year 2017 growth will be in the range of 5% to 10% in U.S. dollar. 
Now my second key message is about 7-nanometer that include our N7 and N7+ and its outlook. TSMC's N7 has passed technology qualification in April, right on our schedule. N7 is widely adopted by our customers. We expect to have 13 new N7 product tape-outs this year. So far, N7 yield is ahead of our plan. We expect to have a very fast and smooth N7 ramp-up in 2018, with its yield learning even better than our 16-nanometer. 
Our N7+ technology is under development based on this robust N7 technology. We inserted several EUV layers in N7+ to take the most benefit from EUV technology with minimum risk. Our N7+ technology will be again the most advanced technology in the foundry industry in 2018 in terms of density, performance and power. This N7+ will ride on N7 learning to have a very steep yield learning curve. We also have enabled the design porting from N7 to N7+ to be very easy by carefully design rule arrangement and our strong EDA utility and IT support. We expect our 7-nanometer node, N7 and N7+, to be a major and long-life technology node. It will be used in mobile, high-performance computing and automotive markets. It will cover premium, mainstream as well as low-cost products in all those markets.
Then I will briefly talk about our advanced technology progress. I would like to update our EUV progress. Both our EUV tool development and the lithography process development have progressed very well in the past 6 months. We have worked closely with our tool partner, ASML, who has demonstrated 250-watt EUV source power in their labs. In TSMC, EUV lithography process development also went on very smoothly. We run several EUV layers with our N7 SRAM vehicle with the same yield level as non-EUV process. 
Lastly, our 5-nanometer. Our 5-nanometer technology development is well on track, already with SRAM functional yield. We will offer 5-nanometer in 1Q 2019.
Thank you for your attention. I turn the microphone to C.C.",656

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Now let me start with our 10-nanometer ramp stages. We are ramping up our 10-nanometer at full speed since last month. Currently, all the products are for mobile applications. The yield progress continue to be slightly ahead of schedule. We continue to expect 10-nanometer will contribute about 10% of our wafer revenue this year. 
Now let me talk about the 28-nanometer and 16 derivative. Our 28-nanometer business remains strong. In order to meet customer's demand, we have increased our 28-nanometer capacity this year, as I reported last time. In addition to the capacity increase, we further expanded and improved 28-nanometer technologies from 28HPC to 28HPC+ and now to 22-nanometer.
Let me state again what I mentioned the last time about our 22 nanometers. TSMC's 22ULP offers a 15% performance gain or 35% power reduction as compared with 28HPC+. This technology is suitable for applications in IoT, ISP, GPS, WiFi, RF and 5G millimeter wave. We already have many 22ULP tape-outs ongoing and expect volume production to begin next year. With this extension of 28-nanometer, we are confident that we will continue to enjoy a high market segment share at this node. 
For 16-nanometer, we also extend this technology into 12-nanometer, which will have about a 10% better performance or 25% lower power consumption as compared with a 16FFC. In addition to these benefits, our 12-nanometer customers can use almost the same IP ecosystem of 16-nanometer to design better products. This resulted in much lower development costs for our customers.
Now let me make a few comments on our competitive position, especially on those 16-nanometer, 28-nanometer and all the technology nodes. First of all, I want to point out that TSMC's policy is to achieve full utilization of our capacity in all nodes. We believe we can achieve this objective because we compete from a position of strength.
Our strengths include: one, we develop many derivative technology to satisfy all customers' requirements; two, we are a trusted foundry by our customer; and three, our manufacturing cost is very competitive. In fact, we believe we are the lowest cost producer. We can still strive when competitors start to lose money.
To summarize, we work closely with our customers to satisfy their technology and capacity requirement on both performance and cost. As a result, we are able to achieve full utilization and high market segment share. 
Now let me talk about the MRAM and RRAM. We have been developing emerging memories such as the MRAM, RRAM and others. The progress is to further reduce power consumption and processing cost as compared with conventional and better [ flash ] memory, which has been widely used in applications such as MPU and PMIC. Both the MRAM and RRAM can be used in derivative specialty technologies such as the 22ULP as well as the more advanced technologies such as the 16FFC and 12FFC.
In addition to wafer processing technology, we have been developing advanced packaging technologies to enhance customers' product performance. We started in 1999 with [indiscernible] bundling, and then moved on to copper bundling, and now we have wafer-level packaging such as InFO and CoWoS that delivered more integrated [ review ] to our customers. Both the InFO and CoWoS has been in mass production, and their applications include mobile and high-speed computing. We think our advanced packaging technology are a clear differentiator for TSMC and will find many ways into artificial intelligence-related applications. We continue to work with many customers for their new products which are planned for the next 2 years.
Thank you.",598

So it means for the revenue -- single month revenue point of it in 3Q probably will be lower than the monthly sales in June. So for me, actually, I'm thinking now we are ramping up 10-nanometer shipment sharply, so that is the 10-nanometer, like C.C. said, is going to contribute about 10% of total revenue in this year. But in first half, we only have 1% in second quarter. So that means that we're going to have very strong 10-nanometer revenue in 3Q and 4Q. However, in 3Q, our revenue guidance is still smaller than -- I just times June monthly sales by 3. So what is the weakness for the technology point of view for the revenue contribution in 3Q?",167

Just one other question on customer concentration. I think the customer concentration has been rising, I think, in the last 3, 4 years. I think it looks like this year also it will move up, given your biggest customer has a very strong product cycle. How should we think about customer concentration when we get to 7-nanometer and 7-nanometer plus? Given that the number of tape-outs seems to be much higher, do you anticipate the customer concentration to fall or is it still going to be relatively high? And maybe also try to be even maybe what is the importance of system customers within this, especially the larger leading-edge kind of process nodes? Are system customers becoming a bigger and bigger part of the customer base, especially for leading-edge?",130

And that number went up to 69%, as you can see from our annual report. This is mainly because there are consolidation among customer base. For this year, we expect the concentration will come down a little bit. But I want to say that people may feel customer concentration is not a good thing. But we feel the other way. It's not really a bad thing, because when you have a bigger customer, that means the dependency for them to change semis as the customer and for us to then as the supplier needs to be stronger, the relationship collaboration needs to be stronger, which is in favor of a foundry business model. So we view that as a positive thing.",130

Can you maybe just talk about this in more detail? And is this something you see being produced at like 16-nanometer? Is it part of the reason why you're adding 28-nanometer capacity or is it going to be 7-nanometer? So that's the first question. And the second one is ARM. ARM are talking about material challenges with thermals in smartphone chips and application processors. A lot of dark silicon issues, which is leading to bigger die sizes or certainly new architectures. Can you maybe just give us your perspective on leading-edge die sizes for smartphones?

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. My presentation, as usual, will start with financial highlights for the third quarter and followed by the guidance for the fourth quarter.Third quarter revenue increased 17.9% sequentially to TWD 252 billion. The strength of our third quarter revenue was driven mainly by major mobile product launches and a healthy demand environment, including cryptocurrency mining. However, this strength was partially dampened by our customers' continued inventory management.Gross margin declined 0.9 percentage point sequentially to 49.9%, mainly reflecting the 10-nanometer margin dilution, as I reported 3 months ago, but was somewhat balanced by an improved capacity utilization.Total operating expenses increased by TWD 2.2 billion. The increase was mainly for 5-nanometer development. However, thanks to operating leverages, total operating expense only represented 10.9% of revenue, so we were able to keep our operating margin flat sequentially at 38.9%.On tax expense, after a big jump in tax rate to 23% in the second quarter due to the accrual of retained earning tax, our effective tax rate fell back to 10.6% in the third quarter. Full year tax rate will remain between 13% and 14%. Overall, our third quarter EPS was $3.47 and ROE was 25.9%.Now, let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the third quarter, all four applications saw sequential growth. Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard increased 10%, 46%, 15% and 13% respectively.Now, let's look at revenue by technology. 10-nanometer process technology contributed 10% of total wafer revenue during the third quarter, up from only 1% in the second quarter. The combined revenue from 16 and 20-nanometer accounted for 24% and 28-nanometer was 23%. Advanced technologies, defined as 28-nanometer and more advanced, accounted for 57% of total wafer revenue, up from 54% in the second quarter.Moving on to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased 159 -- sorry, TWD 157 billion to TWD 502 billion, mainly as we distributed TWD 182 billion of cash dividend and repaid TWD 28 billion of corporate bonds. Correspondingly, current liability decreased by TWD 225 billion.On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 5 days to 42 days, while days of inventory slightly increased 1 day to 53 days.Now, let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 117 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 62 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow was an inflow of TWD 55 billion. After we paid out cash dividend and repaid corporate bonds, cash balance decreased by about TWD 162 billion to reach TWD 408 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditure was about USD 2.1 billion.Now, let's turn to the fourth quarter guidance. Based on current business outlook, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 9.1 billion and USD 9.2 billion, representing 10% Q-over-Q growth. Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.30, our fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be between 48% and 50%. Our fourth quarter operating margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%.As we highlighted 3 months ago, we expect that 10-nanometer ramp will impact our second half 2017 gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage point. In the third quarter, the 10-nanometer dilution was about 2 percentage point. We expect the dilution to be about 3 percentage point in the fourth quarter as the significant ramp-up of our 10-nanometer production will continue.Now, let me make some comments on our CapEx. On CapEx, we have spent USD 8.8 billion so far through the first 3 quarters of 2017. We now expect our 2017 budget to be USD 10.8 billion, up from previously guided USD 10 billion. The increase of about USD 800 million is mainly attributable to the accelerated buildup of 7-nanometer capacity. In order to support our 5% to 10% revenue growth target in the next few years, we anticipate that our CapEx in the next few years may be a few percentage points more than USD 10 billion.Let me make some comment on profitability. Over the past few years, we have been able to improve our structural profitability. We plan to maintain our structural profitability by continuing to create more value for our customers, increasing operating efficiencies and maintaining high utilization rate with careful planning of capacity. This is a challenge as every year we face a different market environment. However, with continuous innovations, our target is to maintain our gross margin at close to the 50% level.This is my remark. Now, I turn the microphone to Mark.",772

I want to deliver the following messages; the title is showing on the screen. And the first is the near-term demand and inventory. Again, I will talk about demand in U.S. dollars because almost all our shipment is paid by U.S. dollar.We had a good third quarter. We concluded our third quarter revenue with 18% quarter-to-quarter growth in U.S. dollar. This growth is strong, mainly driven by major mobile product launches using our 10-nanometer technology and InFO advanced packaging.Even though demand was slightly dampened by the supply chain inventory reduction, our customers' third quarter growth were largely healthy. We saw continued strength from automotive, IoT and high-performance computing, which includes a surge demand from cryptocurrency mining.As for fabless inventory, days of inventory stayed high exiting 2Q '17, largely due to the deferred annual product launch of Android smartphones, mainly from April -- from March-April to June-July. Moving into third quarter, we estimated fabless DOI continues to reduce, but still to be higher than seasonal. We expect decreases to close to seasonal level exiting 4Q '17.For the fourth quarter, we now forecast to have another strong revenue growth of 10% quarter-to-quarter. It is driven by the ramp-up of our 10-nanometer technology.We forecast world semiconductor growth of 16% year-to-year in 2017. In it, memory segment will grow 51% we estimate. The world semiconductor, excluding memory growth, is about 6% year-to-year. It is mainly supported by the increased silicon content and a richer product mix, especially in the high-end smartphone, AI and automotive related market.For the foundry market, we forecast revenue growth to be 7% in 2017. It is an increase from our previously 6% forecast last quarter. For TSMC, we forecast to have a revenue growth of 8.8% in U.S. dollar, near the high-end of 5% to 10% target of 2017.Now, I will talk about some major projects that are still in R&D. Later C. C. will talk about projects that are either in production or in near to production.For the project in R&D, first I will talk about N5 progress. TSMC N5 technology is scheduled for first half 2019 risk production and 2020 volume production. Its development progress is well on track. Development of both device performance and yield improvement are on schedule.Our N5 technology will provide the best power efficiency for mobile application in 2020. This N5 technology will also support high-speed standard cells featuring extreme low Vt transistor, low RC interconnect, high-density capacitor and high-performance computing interconnect design scheme.Those features are designed for applications in server, CPU, GPU, network processor and FPGA. TSMC N5 will use EUV extensively to get the full benefit of EUV. I'll talk more about EUV readiness.Our EUV technology development are progressing well for N7+ and N5 technologies. We have consistently produced equal or better yield on our N7 baseline using several EUV layers. The world's first NXE:3400 EUV scanner has been released to production in our fab and has produced the best CD control, overlay and SRAM yield on our N5 technology.We have run over 1,000 backend yield trial lots of N5 with EUV and its yield is better than N7 at the same stage of our development.At TSMC, our EUV infrastructure development on high sensitivity EUV photoresist, low defect mask blank, package quality and method of mask defect inspection are all on track for 2019 N7+ volume production and 2020 N5 volume production.The following, I will provide our outlook of smartphone and high-performance computing. Firstly, on smartphone. We forecast world smartphone long-term unit growth to be 6% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2021. On top of this unit growth, the insatiable need for higher display quality and camera performance on new smartphones will continue.New advanced technologies such as voice recognition, on-device AI, AR, VR, 4G to 5G, et cetera, are driving silicon content for smartphone to continue to increase. We also see those high-end features continuously proliferate to mid, low-end smartphones.On HPC, high-performance computing, we continue to believe AI and ubiquitous computing will be important drivers for long-term world semiconductor growth. The fast expansion of deep learning in data centers is driving performance requirement for our GPU, CPU, FPGA and ASIC customers.Meanwhile, AI will continue to proliferate from the cloud to broad based client devices such as smartphones and ADAS in cars, DTVs, set-top box, gaming, surveillance, robot and drone. Already started from voice AI, future AI will be much more sophisticated and intelligent, capable of real-time complex inferencing and local learning. All this requires intensive localized parallel computation.In addition to AI, the emerging blockchain applications seen in cryptocurrency mining recently may also fuel the future growth of high-performance computing. So we are more optimistic on the high-performance computing opportunity today versus last year. With our advanced wafer processing technologies and advanced packaging technologies, we will enable our customers to capture this trend.High performance computing wafer 10 in 2017 is about $11.5 billion and we expect it to have a double-digit CAGR, compound annual growth rate, in the next 5 years. We expect high-performance computing will become our major growth engine starting 2020.That is my message. Thank for attention. So I turn the microphone to C. C.",858

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our outlook for IoT and automotive. IoT will be one of the high core segment for TSMC in the next 5 years, with expected annual growth rate better than 20%.In 2017, we estimate the business contribution from IoT will be more than USD 1 billion. We believe the course of IoT market is mainly driven by the readiness of ubiquitous connectivity such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, narrow band and 5G.TSMC has been working with customers to develop technologies required for IoT products such as sensors and various mainly low power devices. In sensor technology, we have offered the foundries a first step to CMOS image sensors process down to 14-nanometer. We have also offered the first NIR product and the smallest of footprint main sensor, which has been widely used in smartphones and other applications.In low power, TSMC has developed a comprehensive and complete set of low power technologies to meet our IoT customers' requirements. In this category, our technology currently include 55-nanometer ULP, 40ULP, 22ULP and 12FFC.Now, let me move to automotive. In the automotive industry, we believe there are 3 mega trends that will lead to higher semiconductor content in future vehicles. They are the trend toward better safety such as ADAS; the trend towards smart vehicles, which is demonstrated in faster and wider connectivity and infotainment; and the trend toward greener vehicles such as electrical vehicle and the hybrid electrical vehicles.TSMC has developed advanced CMOS technologies with a complete automotive IC design ecosystem both in 16FFC and by next year N7. We are also working with all top 5 auto MCU companies to develop multiple embedded flash technologies for applications in many areas such as engine control, breaking system, infotainment and et cetera.TSMC's superior auto [ break ] manufacturing quality, sufficient capacity and long-term supply commitment are additional critical elements to fulfill the automotive supply chain requirement. We expect to double our automotive business in the next 5 years from about TWD 1.4 billion this year.Now, let me move to N7 and N7+. N7 been transferred from R&D to manufacturing in early third quarter this year. Right now, our efforts focus on defect reduction and fine-tuning device performance to prepare for mass production in the first half of 2018.We expect the yield learning in N7 to benefit greatly from N10 and our progress so far has been on schedule. The initial application for N7 are high-end application processors and high-performance computing. We are working with major customers for their products to be introduced in 2018. We expect more than 50 tape-outs by the end of 2018.We will also introduce N7+ in risk production in 2018. Compared to N7, N7+ will have 20% area reduction and larger density and about 10% speed improvement. We will start to use EUV in production at N7+ node. We have been working with ASML in developing EUV process for many years. Right now, as Mark just mentioned, we are using our own N7 test vehicle to practice EUV and have achieved same yield in SRAM circuit as without EUV.Now N10, TSMC N10 offers 2x logic density and 15% speed improvement as compared to our 16FFC. We are already in mass production with the major application in the high-end smartphones. The N10 yield has been better than our original plan and N10 has also set a new record in TSMC history in terms of ramping rate.We have achieved the planned peak output in a period less than 2 months as compared to 3 months for N20 and the N16. The cycle time is also better than planned and again sets another new record for ramping up a new technology. We expect N10 to contribute about 10% of our full year 2017 wafer revenue.Now, N16 and N12. This year we have introduced 12FFC technology to further improve upon our 16FFC with a faster speed by about 6% to 10% or reduction of power consumption by about 15% to 20%. In addition, 12FFC also has about a 20% smaller logic area as compared to 16FFC. As a result, we expect most of our customers will start to adopt 12FFC for their products in 2018 and after.The major application for this 16, 12FFC node are mobile applications processors, graphics chips, FPGA, RF and low power devices. Due to strong demand from the high-performance segment, we have reached a very high utilization rate in 16-nanometer recently and we expect this momentum will continue into 2018.Let me now comment on 28-nanometer. As we reported in our last Investor Conference, our 22-nanometer will offer a 10% chip area direct shrink and 13.5% speed improvement or 25% power reduction as compared to 28HPC+. This technology is suitable for applications such as image signal processor, 5G millimeter-wave transceiver, low cost application process and others.Through continuous technology improvement, we are confident that TSMC's 28, 22-nanometer node will remain very competitive in the market. In 2017, we have observed the highest number of new tape-outs in 28-nanometer as compared to previous years.After 6 years of high volume production and millions of 12-inch wafer shipped, we have achieved the lowest defect density and very competitive cost structure for 28-nanometer. We believe we are very well positioned to continue to maintain our high market segment share at this node. Thank you for your attention.",890

C. and we are constantly working together how to go through this transition. So by June next year, I think the role will be already pretty much defined in place.

And my next question is to Lora on some financial numbers implication. So I would assume next year CapEx to be flat, right, because this year it's at TWD 10.8 billion. Next year it's at a few percentage above TWD 10 billion, right? So given the CapEx is flat and you're targeting for like 5%, 10% return CAGR, is it fair to assume you already think your capital intensity will decline in coming years?",82

So I guess people ask about gross margin for 7-nanometer versus 10, HPC versus other application. But how about the EBITDA margin you're making from 7-nanometer versus 10-nanometer? Because I think that for 10-nanometer I guess the yield rate ramp was a little bit slow early this year. I would assume for 7-nanometer the yield rate ramp should be better and also you're converting some tools from 10-nanometer, right?

I think you can understand the first few years for any new node the EBITDA margin should be negative. But after it reach to the mass production, it will ramp up very fast. So for a period of the time it will be higher than corporate average EBITDA margin and then fall back to corporate level. So that's -- I think you can understand that.

Both kind of leading edge as well as mainstream, it seems there's a lot of Chinese capacity that's going up -- capacity in China that's going in with four or five different fabs that are going on. I'm curious, what do you think about the competitive landscape with the Chinese supply? Do you think that presents a risk out there of excess supply at some point? That's I think more in the mainstream kind of. And then it also seems like on the leading edge nodes, all 3 of your competitors, Intel, Samsung and Global Foundries, have made a lot of noise in the last 90 days or so trying to pitch their foundry offerings and claiming their execution has got better.

But in terms of growth and demand and also in terms of supply, if those guys build-up capacity and build-up technology, do you think there will be a real price bloodbath next year?",106
