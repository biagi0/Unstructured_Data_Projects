380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6880.0,919008.0,39163819.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to join us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of the whole year 2015, followed by the guidance of the current quarter.
In the fourth quarter, customers continued to carefully manage their inventory. And our revenue declined by 4.2% sequentially, which is in line with our guidance. Despite lower revenue, gross margin rose slightly to 48.6% as cost reduction efforts and a favorable foreign exchange rate more than helped to offset impact of lower utilization. Operating margin of 38.3% reached the higher end of our guidance, as we were able to keep a similar level of operating efficiency as the third quarter, despite a drop in revenue. In nonoperating items, we recognized TWD 724 million or $0.02 in EPS from ASML share disposal gains. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached $2.81.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the fourth quarter, communication remained flat sequentially. Consumer and industrial/standard decreased 23% and 12%, respectively, while computer increased 5%.
On a full year basis, revenue from communication increased 16% year-over-year, and it represented 61% of our total wafer revenue. Industrial and standard also saw 22% year-over-year growth, driven by increasing usage of MCU, Flash controller and the power management IC.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. As we have said before, we saw a strong ramp of 16-nanometer in the fourth quarter, and together, 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer contributed 24% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer accounted for 20% of our total wafer revenue in 2015, versus 9% in 2014. And we remain confident that the combined revenue contribution from these 2 technologies will continue to grow meaningfully in 2016. 28-nanometer also held up very well and accounted for 28% of our total wafer revenue in 2015.
Moving into the balance sheet. We ended fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 586 billion, an increase of TWD 61 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased TWD 11 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 41 days, while days of inventory increased by 3 days to 62 days, reflecting higher working process inventory at advanced nodes.
Now let me make a few comment on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 145 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 85 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 60 billion this quarter. And our overall cash balance increased TWD 47 billion to TWD 563 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter CapEx was USD 2.6 billion and reached USD 8.1 billion for the full year 2015.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in 2015. Despite a challenging year, as the inventory corrections of fabless customers occurred continuously, we managed to grow our revenue 10.6% year-over-year to reach TWD 844 billion or USD 26.6 billion. Gross margin saw an 80 basis point decline from 2014, as the decline in capacity utilization overweighed a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Despite a drop in actual gross margin, continued improvement in our manufacturing efficiency led to a structural improvement in profitability. 
Our operating margin also declined 0.9%, mainly due to higher R&D expense for 10-nanometer development as well as a TWD 2.3 billion impairment loss related to our Solar operations. 
In 2015, gains from share disposal totaled TWD 24.7 billion or $0.84 EPS, compared to TWD 2.4 billion or $0.08 EPS in 2014. Our effective tax rate in 2015 was 13.5%, and the full year earnings per share was TWD 11.82. On cash flow, we spent TWD 258 billion in capital expenditure, while we generated TWD 530 billion in operating cash flow. Accordingly, our free cash flow more than doubled in 2015 to TWD 272 billion, which is the second year in a row it has more than doubled. Our 2015 whole year ROE also came out to be 27%.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the outlook for the first quarter 2016. While the China smartphone market has shown some signal of recovery, customer remain cautious in general. Based on our current business outlook and the foreign exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 32.50, we expect first quarter revenue to be between TWD 198 billion and TWD 201 billion, which represents 1.3% to 2.7% sequential decline; gross profit margin to be between 47% and 49%; and operating margin to be between 36.5% and 38.5%.
This concludes my remarks. Now I would like to turn the podium to Mark Liu for his comments.",798
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6880.0,919008.0,39163820.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the demand outlook messages. As the semiconductor supply chain went through a very severe inventory reduction during the fourth quarter 2015, our fast 16-nanometer shipment ramp-up during that quarter somewhat mitigated the inventory management impact to our sales revenue. As Lora just reported, in the fourth quarter 2015, we finished our revenue with quarter-to-quarter of minus 4.2%. And TSMC concluded our 2015 full year with 10.6% revenue growth. 
This severe inventory reduction in the fabless industry during the fourth quarter brought fabless days of inventory to about or slightly below the seasonal level as we exited 2015. However, the strong U.S. dollar environment and a volatile financial market that dampened demand for overall semiconductor last year may continue for some time. Therefore, we expect our customers will likely remain cautious in their inventory control and keep inventory close to seasonal level.
For our first quarter 2016, this quarter, we see a reduction of high-end smartphone demand. On the other hand, demand for smartphones in China and other emerging markets show signs of recovery with an upward momentum. We, thus, forecast a mild revenue decline of minus 1.3% to minus 2.7% quarter-to-quarter for the first quarter 2016.
Beyond the first quarter 2016, we expect to be back to a growth trajectory. For 2016, we forecast the world smartphone shipment unit growth rate to be plus 8%; PC, minus 3%; tablet, minus 7%; and digital consumer electronics, minus 5%. Smartphones will continue to be a major driver for TSMC business in 2016. TSMC's silicon content in an average high-end and mid-end smartphone are increasing significantly, while TSMC's silicon content in an average low-end smartphone remains approximately the same. Therefore, TSMC will participate broadly in this overall 8% smartphone unit growth.
From the process technology perspective, we had a very successful ramp-up of 16-nanometer customer products, with yield performance ahead of our plan in 2015. This demand continue to be strong, and the ramp-up will continue through this year. Given this current macroeconomic environment, we now estimate the 2015 growth rate of world semiconductor to be about 2% year-on-year and 2016 growth rate of world foundries to be about 5% year-on-year. And TSMC growth rate is expected to be between 5% and 10%. 
Now I would like to give you -- deliver messages on our leading-edge technologies. Our 10-nanometer technology development is on track. We are currently in intensive yield learning mode in our technology development. Our 256-megabit SRAM is yielding well. We expect to complete the process and the product qualification and begin customer product tape-outs this quarter.
Our 7-nanometer technology development progress is on schedule as well. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology development leverage our 10-nanometer development very effectively. At the same time, TSMC's 7-nanometer offers a substantial density improvement, performance improvement and power reduction from 10-nanometer. These 2 technologies, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, will cover a very wide range of application, including application processors for smartphone, high-end networking, advanced graphics, field-programmable gate array, game console, wearables and other consumer products.
We see major product advancement in 3 major product sectors in the next 2 years from 2015 to 2017. First sector is high-end smartphone. We expect to see, between now and 2017, a more than 1.5x of transmission speed increase and greater than 2.2x of visual experience in high-end smartphones. Meanwhile, data sensing will move towards context awareness sensing. All those advances will be supported by TSMC's 10-nanometer and TSMC's 7-nanometer technologies.
Second sector is high-performance computing. We expect to have 2x of CPU cores in a processor unit to carry the needed data processing. The computing network infrastructure will need 1.6x bandwidth for higher data rate. Again, all those advances will be supported by our 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies.
Third sector is on emerging applications, such as virtual reality, gaming and automotives. For example, the advanced driver assistance system, ADAS, on cars can greatly enhance the safety on the road for the overall automotive industry. The processors typically will need 20x of computing power from today's level to serve that purpose. These application were also supported by TSMC's 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies, and we are looking forward to that.
I also would like to update you on the development progress beyond our 7-nanometer. We have a sizable third R&D team developing our 5-nanometer technology for more than a year. Several innovative features and capabilities on transistor, contact and interconnect have been demonstrated. Our 5-nanometer technology is planned about 2 years after our 7-nanometer. 
We made significant progress on EUV to prepare for its insertion, likely in 5-nanometer, for process simplification and cost-effective density scaling. At the present time, we are installing the third-generation EUV tools in TSMC fabs. 
We also have an extensive pipeline of technical innovation to extend the Moore's Law, including advanced patterning, high-mobility channel materials, new nanowire transistor structures, low-resistance and low-capacitance contact and wires. Our goal is to further double the data processing throughput for application processor, graphic processor, field-programmable gate array and other process at our every nodes.
These are my messages. Thank you very much. I'll turn the podium to C.C. Wei.",853
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,6880.0,919008.0,39163821.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I will update you the status of our 28-nanometer, 16-nanometer, InFO and followed by comment on our specialty technologies.
First, 28-nanometer. The iteration rate of our 28-nanometer has recovered to a level close to 90% in first quarter this year, and also, the wafer demand increases. We expect this utilization rate to remain above 90% for the remainder of this year. 
In addition to wafer demand increases, we also observed an increased number of tape-outs in 2015, and those tape-outs will mostly be produced in 2016. Most of the new tape-outs are on TSMC's latest addition to 28-nanometer family, namely 28HPC and 28HPC+. TSMC's 28HPC, 28HPC+ offers higher performance and lower power consumption as compared with previous solutions. It is suitable for application in smartphone, digital TV, consumer and networking products. 
In addition, due to the -- its low power characteristic, customer are able to design their product for low-voltage applications, which are very important for the IoT devices. In summary, TSMC 28-nanometer technologies are highly competitive in both technology and cost. We are confident that our 28-nanometer will contribute to -- significantly to 2016 revenue. And we expect to maintain or even expand our market segment share at this node.
Now 16-nanometer. We have successfully ramped up the production of 16-nanometer starting third quarter last year with very fast pace. Manufacturing indices, such as yield and cycle time, were achieved 3 to 4 months sooner than our 20-nanometer node and are ahead of plan. 
In addition to 16-FinFET plus, in fourth quarter last year, we have completed the development of 16FFC, the low-power and low-cost version for the 16-nanometer process. TSMC's 16FFC incorporate a process simplification and the optional -- optical screened [ph] for further die cost reduction. It also shares the same design rule with 16FF+ so customer can directly transfer their product to 16FFC. As a result, we expect 16FFC will enter volume production in this quarter. 
As customer accelerate their technology migration into 16-nanometer node, we anticipate a significant demand drop in 20-nanometer in 2016. However, we also expect a continual ramp-up of 16-nanometer this year, and expect it to contribute more than 20% of wafer revenue in 2016. We estimate our foundry market segment share of 16-, 14-nanometer node increases from about 50% in 2015 to above 70% in 2016, exceeding the previous prediction we made in mid-2014.
Now let me talk about the InFO. We have successfully completed InFO process installation in the new Longtan site and are in product qualification stage right now. We are on track to start InFO volume production in second quarter 2016. Because of the very custom nature of our current generation InFO technology, we do not expect adoption by a large number of customers. However, we do expect a few very large volume customers. 
The majority of InFO application are for mobile devices, including IoT products. While we are ready for the first generation InFO volume production, we are also developing next-generation InFO technologies for better performance and lower cost. In summary, we believe TSMC's InFO technology can enhance our customers' product and performance and lower their product's power consumption. Our expectation of InFO contributing more than USD 100 million quarterly revenue in 4Q this year remain unchanged.
Now let me talk about the specialty technology and IoT. We believe IoT-related application will be a important part of semiconductor for us in the future. In order to capture the opportunity of IoT business, TSMC has been developing technologies that fit the IoT product requirement, such as high-speed computation, just mentioned by Mark, ultra-low-power transistors, sensors in many kinds, connectivity and et cetera. 
Some example I would like to share with you here. First, we are developing process to meet automotive standard for smart cars. We also developed the most advanced CMOS image sensor with multimillion contact between the stack chips. We have delivered the smallest footprint main sensor for various application. We have developed the ultra-low-power Bluetooth solution for connectivities. 
Specialty technology are an important part to TSMC revenue. In 2015, more than 70% of TSMC's 8-inch wafer business was contributed by our specialty technologies. We have also observed the increase in amount of our 12-inch wafer business has been contributed by specialty technology as well. We expect the trend will continue in the future.
I thank you for your attention. Now I turn the podium to Lora.",739

Let me start with CapEx. Our CapEx for 2016 is expected to be between USD 9 billion to USD 10 billion, representing a 10% to 20% increase year-over-year. About 70% of the capital budget will be used for capacity buildup for the leading-edge technology, majorly 10-nanometer, and R&D CapEx. Of the USD 9 billion to USD 10 billion number, about 10% will be used for back-end, mainly InFO, and 5% for China fab. With this CapEx, our 2016 capacity will increase by about 10%.
We'll talk about TSMC's structure profitability. TSMC's structure profitability is measured by its standard gross margin rate, SGM, which refers to a gross margin calculated at 85% utilization rate. In the past few years, TSMC has been able to steadily increase our SGM from the mid-40s level to a high-40s level, despite higher CapEx, which led to a substantial increase in depreciation expenses. The improvement of our structure profitability is mainly due to the following: first, very careful planning and build-out of capacity; second, intensive cost-reduction through productivity improvement and a better asset effectiveness. We are confident that we will be able to continue increasing our SGM in 2016.
Now a few comments about China investment. On December 7 last year, we submitted the application to the Investment Commission of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs for an investment project to build a wholly owned, 12-inch wafer manufacturing facility and a design service center in Nanjing, China. The main purpose for this investment project is to enhance our access to business opportunities in China market. With the establishment of a 12-inch wafer fab and a design services center in China, TSMC will be able to provide closer support to our customer in China and to extend our ecosystem to that market. We will commence the investment project upon receiving the approval from the Investment Commission.
My last comment is about the dividend. As you remember, our dividend policy is sustainable and trending to increase cash dividend per share. With our healthy free cash flow, we are considering an increase of cash dividend in 2016.
This concludes my remark. Thank you.",360

The first question -- congratulations first on last year and also a good outlook for the coming year. The first quarter, it seems like it's holding up relatively well, factoring in some of the high-end smartphone weakness. I guess, if you can go through just what's driving the strength? How much is TSMC-specific as far as share gains? Or how much is coming from end markets -- or from other end markets outside of smartphone? And of this higher first quarter, what's your expectation for continued improvement in second quarter? Because last year first quarter held up well, but then we saw a slowdown after that. If you think there's any inventory build again in the first quarter this year?",121

You seem to be saying that it's holding up, while the market is not holding up. I really think that if we have gained any share in the first quarter -- if we gained any share in the first quarter, I think it will not be significant. I think that's the way the foundry market will be in the first quarter, at least as far as I can see now. I don't think we have any -- nor will we be losing any share. I suspect that we may be gaining a little share in the first quarter, but I don't think it's significant. As to what sectors, well, the same sectors that we do our business in. Communication, of course, is the big one. Mobile products, I think, is a big one. And then I think Lora has told you consumer. And then I don't see anything unusual. Well, actually, Mark has talked about the end of inventory, of surplus inventory. We think that at the end of the fourth quarter -- although the numbers are not out yet, but we think that the end of the fourth quarter, inventory is -- supply chain inventory is already, what, about 2 days below seasonal. So because of that, I really, for a while, expected the first quarter to be stronger than what we are forecasting now. But the way we are forecasting it now is pretty normal seasonally. If you look at our past couple, 3 years' record, I think the first quarter was always -- has always been a bit -- a few percentage points below the fourth quarter. I don't know. I -- as far as I can see, I think we are managing the company well, but I don't think that's unusual.",304

I'll ask the follow-up on 2 technologies. I think there is some change. 16FFC, which is a lower cost, I think you mentioned it's actually in production this quarter if I heard right. And if you could talk about how meaningful, because that will lower cost on 16 in getting customers to migrate from 28 to 16, if you see a more meaningful ramp of that node through this year? But the other side, InFO, it felt like last quarter, you were talking about more customers beyond the high-volume application.

That's a good answer, and let me try to answer it now. Did I say it's a good answer? Or did I say it's a good question? It's a good question. It's a good question. Let me try to answer it now. We set that target in late 2014, I believe. We said that we want to grow. We said that in the next 5 years, we want to grow profit -- actually, operating profit, not necessarily net income, operating profit, 10% a year. And that was more than 1.5 years ago, I believe. Much has happened since then. Last year was a difficult year. I said 10% compounded annual growth rate. Back when we set the target in late 2014, we were looking at a very good -- we thought we were looking at a very good 2015. Now 2015 turned out to be disappointing, as everyone knows. But we still managed to grow our operating profit by about 10%. And 2016 will also be -- it will be -- I think it will be better than 2015. So we are at least mildly optimistic about 2016. So we have now, as Mark said, identified our growth in 2016 as 5% to 10%. Now what he meant was revenue. But Lora also said that our structure profitability actually is still improving. So I'm saying now, while Mark meant revenue, I'm saying now that our operating profit will also grow 5% to 10% this year. Hopefully 10% or even hopefully -- even more hopefully more than 10%, okay. So all I -- what I'm saying is that we set the 10-year compounded annual growth rate 1.5 years ago when things looked much brighter. Much has happened, but we still managed for 1 year, and it appears now we'll manage for the second year of this 5 year, above 10%. But I'm not repeating my pledge -- my prediction that '17, '18, '19 will continue to grow at 10% a year. I think that the likelihood of -- well, we just looked at the semiconductor market, the prediction about the future semiconductor full market. It's 2%, 3% a year for the next 5 or 10 years. Well, we have a premium. We have a growth premium. Now 1.5 years ago, I thought our growth premium of revenue and profit -- growth premium was at least 5%. Because back then, the prediction of other semiconductor growth was better than it is now. Now I still think we have a premium of some magnitude, but you will hear from me sometime what our rolling 5-year projection is. The last time you heard it was 1.5 years ago, and so far, we have fulfilled it even though the circumstances were much more difficult than we thought they were going to be when we made the prediction, when we made the target.

I think you were up -- went to 45% to 50% of revenue for a few years and dominated 28-nanometer. Now this year at $8 billion -- last year at $8 billion, this year up only 10% or more is now I think in the 30%, 35% of revenue level. So this is what's generating the free cash flow and the potential for your higher dividends. But also what does it mean for your depreciation?

Yes, okay. And I really think that the key factors, why do we have a premium on -- over semiconductor market? Well, why do we have a premium, meaning that our growth rate, our revenue growth rate, top line growth rate is likely to be higher than the semiconductor market growth rate? It's because -- in 2 very simple words, it's because we are everyone's foundry. Being everyone's foundry has advantage of participating in the growth of whoever succeeds the best, whoever customer succeeds the best, we participated in it. And we have been everyone's foundry ever since, well, maybe not when we started up, but certainly for the last 10, 15 years, we have been virtually everybody's foundry. And we intend to remain that way. Being everyone's foundry, fulfilling our mission of being the trusted technology and capacity provider to the IC industry, it means that whoever in our customer -- among our customers succeed the best, we participate in their success. That's why I think that we have a premium of growth over the total IC market. Now let's talk about the bottom line. Now that's where structural profitability comes in as important. And we want to manage it such that the bottom line grows proportionately with the top line. And so just keep that in mind. And know we are improving it, actually. We're improving the structural profitability. We're improving what we call the standard gross margin, as Lora said. And we have improved it by several percentage points in the last few years. It depends on -- in fact, if I -- I usually look back to 6 years ago, and since then, we have improved by at least 5 -- by 500 basis points, and we expect it to improve. Now being everyone's foundry and maintaining or improving our structural profitability still further put us in the right place. And while I cannot answer you at this moment that '17, '18, '19 will still be 10 year a year -- 10% a year profit growth years, I cannot answer that. But I'm just saying that I have my -- I put my trust in our ability to be those 2 things, to maintain -- to do those 2 things. First, be everyone's foundry, and second, maintaining our structural profitability.",386

So if depreciation growth is slower, if you have higher-margin, faster ramp of 16-nanometer FinFET compact, if you have currency tailwinds as well, if you have rising utilization rates, are we going to see a few quarters above 50% gross margins this year?

I mean, that's very, very important. So anyway, that also explains why we are -- Lora said it, we are very careful in building out capacity -- in building up capacity. You don't want to rent a lot of -- a big hall for a restaurant and then not have enough customers. So that's why we are very careful in building capacity. And I have said that many times in the past.

Since you -- all of you mentioned compute as one of the biggest driver, high-performance computing. Now just wanted to understand that a little bit further. The traditional understanding of compute has been -- actually dissects into dominated market. So when you talk about compute growth, should we think about TSMC taking -- TSMC enabling some of your customers to take share from that market? Or is it completely greenfield areas where there's no standard, like automotive and stuff like that you mentioned? And since you mentioned this is a 2-year kind of thing, where you start seeing growth coming through, could we have some kind of quantification, if it's possible, in terms of what kind of growth could be coming from compute as a segment? Right now, I think what you define as compute is probably about 8% of revenues, 8% to 9% of revenues. That's my first question.",156

When you -- when we talk about computing, we're really not just including the data center and PC tablets, we also include the infrastructure as well as the edge computing devices. So our -- my definition of computing is -- actually for TSMC is more opportunity in the infrastructure and edge computing. Among the edge computing, I mentioned a couple of our innovative product advancement. One of them is, I mentioned, about cars. And that is an area of very active innovation we see. We work with our customers working on it. And how far that product will come up is everybody's guess. But if you want a paradigm, the semiconductor content of a car today is about 6x of the average smartphones. And because of the innovation in that electronics in cars, we see this 6x will increase to 10x by the year of 2020. So that is the promising we see. And also that is a very, very practical purpose is for that to be proliferated. Yes.",170

That's a tough question to answer. You know the data center and PC is stronghold of a major player already. It's the incumbent, very strong. And however, the industry, many other players, are looking for options at least. So we see -- our view is we see a lot of innovators, product innovators working in that area. And following that is only the industry estimates about how far the ARMs can move into the space. And for the easier one, I think it will happen first in the tablet and PC. And I see before 2020, range from 10% to 30%. It's in anybody's guess.

Our -- well, that estimate is actually -- is made on 2 bases. The first base is the semiconductor market growth and the foundry's growth, which Mark already mentioned. We estimate that semiconductor market growth will be 2% and foundry growth will be 5% this year. And we also have a few other relevant growth indices, such as fabless growth and our customers' collective growth. And well, I think those are the most relevant indicators. And so that's the first base. That's the first basis on which we estimate our growth this year. The second basis that we do -- we estimate, is from the field, from the regional, our own field sales estimates. Each region reports its own estimate of the growth in its region. Actually, we have a third estimate, but the third estimate is basically a synthesis and a reconciliation between the first 2. So I hope that answers your question.",155

Compare this year and last year, there is at least 2 major differences make -- lead us to make the current forecast. One is when we enter the beginning of last year, we did not know the inventory buildup is very, very high. I still remember 11 or 12 days, above seasonal. And then this year, however, we considered a drastic reduction of the inventory during the fourth quarter. We have a better estimate about the starting point of the year.

But as you start to migrate customers to 16-nanometer with the FFC, can 28-nanometer be migrated efficiently to FinFET or 10-nanometer? Or do you expect to keep that node at 28-nanometer? Can you migrate and reuse the 28-nanometer if demand starts to fall next couple years?",69

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start from financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance for the second quarter.
First quarter revenue came out slightly better than we had expected. Although the February 6 earthquake caused some delay in wafer shipments in the first quarter, we saw business upside resulting from demand increases in mid and low-end smartphone segments and customers' inventory restocking. Therefore, our first quarter revenue was essentially flat from the fourth quarter last year compared to about 2% decline we guided 3 months ago. Our first quarter gross margin was 44.9%, and operating margin was 34.8%. Both are 3.7 percentage points lower than fourth quarter last year due to lower utilization and the negative impact from the earthquake, which I will provide more detail later. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was $2.50.
Now let's take a look at the revenue contributed by applications.  During the first quarter, Communication and Consumer increased 4% and 15%, respectively, while Computer and Industrial/Standard decreased 7% and 9%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 16- and 20-nanometer contributed 23% of our total wafer revenue in the first quarter. In addition, 28-nanometer saw a nice rebound in demand and contributed 30% of our total wafer revenue. Together, these 3 advanced technologies accounted for 53% of total wafer revenue.
Now moving into the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 648 billion, an increase of TWD 62 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased TWD 24 billion. The increase included the reclassification of TWD 10 billion bonds payable from long-term to current. During the year of 2011 and 2013, TSMC issued corporate bonds totaling TWD 211 billion to support the capital expenditure. These bonds will gradually become due starting from this current quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remain at 41 days. Days of inventory decreased by 8 days to 54 days, reflecting more shipments from finished wafers and earthquake impact.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we end -- we generated about TWD 122 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 38 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 83 billion this quarter, and overall cash balance increased TWD 55 billion to reach TWD 618 billion at the end of the first quarter.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let me turn to the second quarter outlook. We expect our business in the second quarter will benefit from continued inventory restocking and the recovery of the delayed shipment from the earthquake. Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 32.30, we expect second quarter revenue to be between TWD 215 billion and TWD 218 billion, which represents 6% to 7% sequential increase; gross profit margin to be between 49% and 51%; and operating margin to be between 38.5% and 40.5%.
In the second quarter, we will begin -- we will again need to accrue the 10% tax on undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our quarterly tax rate will be about 24% in the second quarter. The tax rate will then fall back to 11% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be about 14%.
Now let me give you some comments about the earthquake's impact and this year's profitability and CapEx. On February 6 this year, an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude struck southern Taiwan and caused damages to certain parts of our tool in our manufacturing sites in Tainan, and that disrupted production. As a result of wafer shipment delays, we have pushed out delivery of about 90K 12-inch wafer from first quarter to second quarter. 
The financial impact of this earthquake to TSMC is as follows. First, it reduced our first quarter revenue by about TWD 7 billion and it lowered first quarter gross margin by 2.2 percentage points.  About 1.1 percentage point reduction is due to the losses associated with the property damage and the wafer scrapped, and net of insurance claims. Another 1.1 percentage point is contributed by the loss of productivity. The impact to our first quarter operating margin is about 2.4 percentage points. And the negative impact to first quarter operating income, in dollars, is about TWD 7 billion. 
Wafer shipments that are delayed to second quarter will benefit our second quarter revenue by about TWD 7 billion. And they contributed positively to second quarter gross margin by about 0.7 percentage points; to operating margin by about 0.9 percentage points; and the positive impact to second quarter operating income, in dollars, is about TWD 5 billion. On a full year basis, overall impact from the earthquake reduces our gross profit and operating profit margin by about 0.2 percentage points each and reduces our 2016 operating income by TWD 2 billion.
Now let me say a few words about 2016's profitability and capital expenditure. Regarding our structural profitability, as you may know, in the past 6 to 7 years, we increased our structural profitability by 4 to 5 percentage points to the upper 40% range. We are optimistic that we can maintain that level in 2016.
My last comment is about 2016 CapEx. In the last investor conference 3 months ago, we have stated our 2016 capital budget to be between USD 9 billion to USD 10 billion. We maintain the same guidance range today. This ends my remarks. 
Now I would like to turn the podium to our Co-CEO, Mark Liu.",942
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2016",2016-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5536.0,958724.0,40697540.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, everyone. Let me start to give you a report on our near-term demand and inventory outlook.
Our 1Q '16 revenue is essentially flat from 4Q '15; however, exceeding our February 17's revised guidance. This result was helped by an increase in smartphone demand with China and emerging markets, pull in from the second quarter, and faster recovery from the earthquake, which offset the weakness and seasonality in a high-end smartphone sector.
We estimate our fabless income days of inventory to increase from 2 days below seasonal exiting 4Q '15, to about seasonal level ending 1Q '16. Looking ahead for 2Q '16, we forecast a growth of 6% to 7% quarter-to-quarter in NT dollars or 8% to 9% in U.S. dollars. Most of our fabless customers may see an above-seasonal growth in 2Q '16, driven by OEM new product launches and inventory restocking in the supply chain. We estimate days of inventory will still be close to seasonal levels exiting 2Q '16. 
Due to the world macroeconomic uncertainties, we reduced our estimate of 2016 smartphone growth from 8% to 7%; PC, from minus 3% to minus 6%; tablet, from minus 7% to minus 9%; while maintaining digital consumer electronics growth rate at minus 5%. In spite of the reductions of these growth rates, there are still growth areas in smartphones, broadband network, wireless infrastructures and gaming. 
For smartphone growth, momentum comes from China's 4G+ deployment, through increases of operator subsidy, and the continued 3G to 4G upgrade in emerging markets. These factors will also drive the associate infrastructure growth. Recently, we also saw good demand from gaming's GPU and game console processor for VR applications. 
For the whole year of 2016, we estimate the growth of world semiconductor to be about 1%. We maintain our estimate for the foundry market growth of about 5% and TSMC revenue growth of 5% to 10% this year.
Now I move on to leading-edge technology. Let me give you a first on N10 update. We have received N10 customer product tape-out in 1Q '16. We are actively preparing for more customer product tape-outs in the following quarters. Most of our N10 users are for mobile products. We will put this technology in production in 2 of TSMC's 12-inch giga fabs. Those tape-outs will drive a sizable demand starting from 2Q '17 through 2018.
Our 7-nanometer technology, N7, the technology development is well on track. N7 is a further extension of N10 technology, with more than 60% in logic density gain and 30% to 40% reduction in power consumption. N7 fully leverages N10 yield learning and shares more than 95% of common tools. We have expanded our N7 design ecosystem development to include both mobile and high-performance computing to enable our customers to deliver their first-to-market products. Our N7 adoption is very strong, with customers ranging from mobile GPU, game console, FPGA, network processors and other consumer applications. We have more than 20 customers in intensive design engagement with us and expect to have 15 customer tape-outs in 2017. The volume production of N7 will start from first half '18.
Now on EUV, we have made good progress in the EUV development with ASML. Recently, EUV development gained quite good momentum across the industry. Tools source power of 60 to 80 watts is capable of becoming operational in fabs now. We are working on the tool reliability and their fab operating condition. EUV photoresist, mass fabrication, particle control and basic modules have all made good progress. We recently demonstrated a reasonable yield on our N7 yield vehicle, 128-megabit SRAM, using 1 EUV layer. Currently, development of a reliable EUV mask pellicle is another focus to enable a mass production operation.
Next, I want to give you an update on growth driver for our leading-edge technology, where the demand comes from for our leading-edge technologies. 
First, mobile. We see continuing technology advancement in baseband, application processor, RF transceiver and wireless connectivity to meet the demand of LTE advanced specifications. The growth of 4G data rate through carrier aggregation and high-frequency Wi-Fi drives the need for more complex and larger chips. All of the above drive the demand for our N10 and N7 technologies, which will enter production in 2017 to 2019.
The next emerging 5G standard also prompts our customers to develop state-of-the-art base station and baseband application processors to capture early business opportunity using our N10 and N7 technologies.
Second area is high-performance computing. We also work closely with our customers to address the opportunity in the high-performance computing market. We work with ARM to co-optimize its CPU cores with TSMC's solutions to enable our customer to deliver their products in the cloud computing market. Today, our customers have only a very small market share in cloud computing, mostly in networking and storage applications. With TSMC's high-performance computing technologies, we will support our customers to participate in this fast-growing cloud computing market.
Now last area is the VR/AR, ADAS and so forth. VR/AR, deep learning and artificial intelligence, artificial AI, are the emerging applications that will require leading-edge technologies. Consumer-oriented VR/AR products for immersed gaming and immersive video viewing experience have begun shipment in 1Q this year. The data transfer rate of VR/AR products in interactive design, remote training and multi-site conferencing must be -- still be -- must still be enhanced by 10x from today's level in order to enable quality viewing experience.  All these applications require low-power and high-speed GPU and CPU and, therefore, requires our leading-edge technologies.
We see increasing demand also both in enhanced safety and the improved infotainment system in automotive applications. The ADAS, Advanced Driver Assist Systems, include adaptive cruising control, emerging brake, collision avoidance, lane tracking and auto parking assistant. The advanced infotainment system includes both high-performance multimedia applications. Both automakers and the Tier 1 module suppliers are defining the specs and increasing their adoption for ADAS and advanced infotainment systems. This trend will certainly also speed up the adoption of TSMC's leading-edge technology. 
That's my report. Thank you. I'll turn the podium to C.C. Wei.",1009

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I will update you on the status of 16-nanometer, 28-nanometer, InFO and specialty technologies. I will also talk about their role as a growth driver.
First, on 16-nanometer. We continued to ramp 16-nanometer with yield and cycle time better than our targets. Applications in mobile processor, cellular baseband, video game player, and PC [indiscernible] will contribute significant to our 16-nanometer shipment this year. Meanwhile, we also begin shipment for other applications such as a Ethernet switch, CPU, networking processor, programmable logic device and others. We expect 16-nanometer will contribute above 20% wafer revenue this year.
As I reported here last quarter, we have completed the development of a low-power and low-cost version 16FFC. I can inform you today that 16FFC is now the most adopted solution by our 16-nanometer customers, and we have entered mass production since first quarter this year. 
In addition to 16FFC, we also developed an ultra-low-power solution with much lower operating voltage, down to a level below 0.5 volt without too much sacrifice of the circuit speed. We believe this is a superior solution compared to other technology approaches available in the low-power area today and is ideally suited for the mobile and IoT market. Both mobile and IoT will be the main growth driver in the future.
Now let me move on to 28-nanometer. Since our last conference, we have seen stronger demand for our 28-nanometer, coming mainly from the mid and low-end smartphone-related applications. As a result, the utilization rate of 28-nanometer has remained well above 90%. We think it will stay at a high level throughout this year. Key to this strong demand has been TSMC's 28HPC and 28HPC+. In addition to the mid, low-end smartphones, applications related to networking processor and consumer product also adopt our 28HPC, HPC+. 
Our 28-nanometer focus today is in the low-power area, and we developed a strong pay phone. Our 28ULP, ULP+ and 28HPC+ are very effective in addressing the need for low power consumption, which is critical for the IoT market. Again, we expect IoT-related applications will become the next demand driver for TSMC's 28-nanometer technology.  We are confident on the competitiveness of our 28-nanometer solutions and believe we will hold our strong market segment share over the next few years.
Now let me update on InFO. The equipment installation at our Longtan site for volume production is almost complete. We expect to complete customers and product qualifications shortly and will be ready for volume production in this quarter. Our expectation of InFO contributing more than USD 100 million per quarter in 4Q this year remains unchanged. In addition to high-volume preparation and product qualification, we are working on yield improvement and cost reduction.
Now let me make some comments on InFO technology. Compared to the conventional package, TSMC's InFO has advantage in form factor, such as a smaller area and [indiscernible] service and also in power efficiency, and it can reduce the power consumption by as much as 20%. Meanwhile, InFO supports higher memory bandwidth and, therefore, improves circuit performance.
With TSMC's InFO technology, our customers can integrate the multiple chip in the same package while reducing the overall cost. This advantage will enable InFO technology to play an important role in the chip partitioning, which can be one of the effective ways to reduce cost for products which utilize leading-edge technologies such as the 7-nanometer technology and beyond. As a result, we believe InFO will be a powerful technology to capture the growth opportunity in both the mobile and IoT market.
Now I will talk about the specialty technologies. Currently, specialty technologies at TSMC include Embedded Flash for MCU and automotive products. 
CMOS image sensors, image signal processors, data converter, display driver, touch controller, fingerprint and imaging for smartphone and also high-voltage for power management.  These specialty technologies have contributed increasingly to our revenue in recent years and now account for more than 1/4 of our total wafer revenue.
There are many exploratory efforts ongoing at TSMC, and I will first talk about the largest 3 sectors: the Embedded Flash, the CMOS image sensor and MEMS. 
We have completed 40-nanometer Embedded Flash development and have begun volume production. We are now developing 28-nanometer Embedded Flash for automotive-related applications while working on other nonvolatile memories for technologies beyond 28-nanometer.
For CMOS image sensors, we have completed a hybrid bond technology which will enhance the connection between chips. This technology will push the image sensor performance to a new level and will be used by future smartphone. In addition to the mobile phone application, we are developing other CMOS image sensor technology to improve the safety feature in auto mobile and for use in the medical area.
Now let me move to MEMS. MEMS has been widely used as a motion sensor in mobile phones. We are also developing MEMS technology for environmental and biosensors for smart health care and medical IoT applications. 
In summary, we believe both automotive, medical markets in IoT could present good growth opportunities for specialty technology in the next few years.

For second quarter, looks like somewhat mild growth, probably mid- to high single-digit growth. Just factoring in the earthquake, some shipments pushing out, smartphone launches and relatively lean inventory, could you talk about some headwinds you may be facing just to offset some of those positive drivers? And then if we look at the second half, what does that imply, factoring in the 16-nanometer and InFO starting in second half, how you feel about second half at this stage?",89

And then if I could ask, for the forward technology, you're doing a much faster move to 7-nanometer, where it's a new bump every 1 year, where some of the other foundries, like Intel, going to an optimized, is taking longer. And I'm curious on 2 fronts: one, if there's any trade-off or risk to your strategy moving faster; and the 7, your density shrink is about a 60%, so not a full shrink. If -- as we go through the note of competitors, could leapfrog with a full 7-nanometer or you can upgrade the process as you move through, so maybe talk about that strategy for what you're doing on 10 and 7.",115

So the application in software development also is progressing. So in those parts of the momentum we see increases. And for TSMC, of course, we will support our customers in that high-performance computing platform. For us mostly is the technology development; technology development, also including the interface circuit development with our customers, also including the packaging solutions for that -- for that application. So I think that compared with a couple of years ago, indeed, you must see a lot of reports. Now that momentum is collecting quite a bit recently.

So if we exclude the pressure -- pressure should be, the shipment pressure from first quarter, that should be about TWD 7 billion, right? So that actually is about a TWD 208 billion to TWD 211 billion. So that actually is a much smaller than [indiscernible] March monthly sales by 3, as TWD 219 billion.

I think C.C. just commented that you're packaging more chips and the costs will come down. And in what year -- which year do you think the InFO cost will be similar or even lower than the conventional packaging? And also, assuming it will happen in this 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer band, will TSMC expect your mobile market share to increase significantly at 7-nanometer versus 10-nanometer or 16-nanometer -- global market share?

He asked which year we will begin to see the cost on InFO lower than the cost from conventional packaging. And if we can apply this very useful technology on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, does that mean that our mobile market share will be higher at 7- and 10-nanometer compared to our mobile market share at 16-nanometer?

Wei,,Executives,67,"Okay, let me -- okay, let me answer the question. Actually, he asked the question whether this 28-nanometer strong demand can continue or not because of smartphone adopting the 16-nanometer technology quickly. Actually, in the smartphone, we have high-end smartphone, mid and low-end smartphone. For the high-end smartphone, moving to the 16-nanometer is a natural choice, and they're moving very fast, yes. But then the mid and low-end smartphone that demand increased, so a lot of them are adopting TSMC's 28-nanometer technology. That's where the very strong demand comes from. And we see that strong demand throughout this year. In addition to that, I just mentioned that we also have a networking processor consumer product. They are all adopting TSMC's 28 HPC, HPC+. Furthermore, in the future, we see that IoT mobile application for the low-power consumption is very important in TSMC over a very competitive platform in this area. So we believe that the 28-nanometer demand will continue to be strong. Thank you.",164

There's a lot of talk about the rising costs of developing chips at leading-edge. How much do you think it costs your customers to develop chips at 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer compared with 28? And I think you mentioned 20 customers are -- you're engaged with 20 customers on 7-nanometer.

Of course, each node development cost is higher and -- but on the other hand, the chip integration also increases. Where it used to be several chips, right now, it's being developed by -- in one chip. So secondly, actually, although we have, as mentioned, 15 tape-outs, typically the first tape-out incurs the highest cost, and the following tape-outs, that is -- it can be synergistic. So indeed, customers see the 7-nanometer is a long-standing long node.

And I guess, #2 is, would you consider possibly licensing InFO because we've certainly seen success stories in terms of licensing in semiconductors. I think that would help out your customers. I want to get your thoughts on that.",153

Wei,,Executives,95,"Okay. We developed InFO technology with much lower cost than the cohorts that we introduced earlier. And InFO gives us advantage, as I said in the presentation. We have mentioned that in the last quarter that we only focus -- right now, we only focus on the few high-volume customers because we start to ramp it up. And I also said in the presentation that we are working on the new improvement and the cost reduction. That means that today, we still have some improvement ongoing. And once we complete our high-volume production this year, we believe we will be very competitive. However, in every technology node we work with, we offset people to better serve our customer. For now, we also see the cooperation between TSMC and back-end people. But for this year, before we complete the volume production and are ready for other considerations this year, we will only focus on our own bringing up of this InFO volume production.",162

My second question was the one that Medhi just asked, but maybe I'll just follow-up. If it turns out that 10-nanometer turns out to be a little bit smaller than what you expected previously, but 7 turns out to be much bigger, and you only spent TWD 1 billion in the first quarter of this year versus your guidance for the year, TWD 9 billion to TWD 10 billion, is it a possibility that maybe the CapEx becomes very back-end loaded or some of it gets pushed out into 2017?",91

And my second question is regarding the EUV adoption. So it seems like it is already a done deal that you will adopt EUV at a 5-nanometer.  So the production timing is sometime like 2020. So from now to 2020, do you think the capital intensity will increase? I know the company gave guidance before that the new normal will be 30% to 35%. But in terms of the ratio, do you think that you will grow, especially when you mass produce 7-nanometer?",84

Yes, we plan to use EUV on our 5-nanometer, and we have already 3 EUV tools on the floor and the fourth is coming. So all these are being used actively for the development. So until 2020 when N5 is currently planning to go into production, yes, it will be adopted. But just to remind you that if you think about CapEx, don't think that everything will change the EUV, okay? There are 80 layers and only 10 -- there are about 50 to 60 if you discount the multiple patterning. Only 10 of them roughly, will use the EUV. So a lot of the tools will still be -- able to be common tools. So did that answer your question?",131

So just want to clarify because I thought quadruple patterning or multi-patterning will cause lots of CapEx. But also, you mentioned that you will use a common tool strategy to reduce the CapEx. So just net-net, in terms of CapEx, in terms of absolute dollars versus TWD 10 billion label or in terms of CapEx ratio versus 35%, in the coming 4 years, do you think that you will increase or decrease?

Then also, that we find out that our approaches can give benefit or advantage for the higher bandwidth which is important for the smartphone for all the applications also. So we believe, among all FinFet technologies, TSMC's InFO is the best. And when we ramp it up, that will be the highest volume of FinFET technology in the industry. But our main progress in to help our customer to again have their product into the market with very competitive performance and cost.",127

People are still cautious. So that's what we see in the cycle. How long will it last? I don't know, it depends on -- I just mentioned -- I addressed in my prepared message, even to the end of Q2 it appears the inventory will still be at about the seasonal level. It's a restocking, but at the -- about the seasonal level of -- at the end of Q2. So that will be 4 months into the building. But it will still be a cautious condition.",143

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter and followed by the guidance for the third quarter. 
We had a good second quarter. Our second quarter revenue increased 9% sequentially to TWD 222 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance given in April, due to a business upside resulting from the demand increases in mid- and low-end smartphones and customer inventory restocking. Gross margin was also ahead of expectation and increased by 6.6 percentage point Q-over-Q to a record high of 51.5%, mainly driven by improvement in utilization rate and cost-reduction efforts, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. 
Operating margin also increased by a similar magnitude to reach 41.2%. As we highlighted last quarter, we incurred a higher income tax in the second quarter. The corporate tax rate rose to 23% as we accrued the 10% on undistributed retained earnings, and we estimate the 2016 full year tax rate to be about 14%. Overall, our second quarter EPS reached $2.80, an 8.7% decline year-over-year, mainly due to a nonrecurring share disposal gain from ASML and Vanguard in the second quarter last year. Excluding the one-off items, second quarter EPS actually grew 17% year-over-year.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the second quarter, Communication was flat from the prior quarter, while Computer, Consumer and Industrial and Standard increased by 19%, 80% and 12%, respectively. 
Now how about revenue by technology? Combined revenue from 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer continued to grow and represented 23% of revenue in the second quarter, same as the first quarter. 28-nanometer contribution fell slightly to 28% versus 30% in the first quarter due to a higher revenue base in the second quarter, but absolute dollar revenue from 28-nanometer continued to increase Q-over-Q.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 668 billion, an increase of TWD 19 billion. On the liability side, current liability increased TWD 163 billion as we accrued about $156 billion for cash dividend, which will be paid out this month. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 2 days to 43 days, while days of inventory remained at 54 days, same as last quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 107 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 74 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 33 billion this quarter and then repaid TWD 11 billion of corporate bonds. Our overall cash balance increased TWD 4 billion to TWD 622 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditure spent in the first half of 2016 totaled USD 3.4 billion. The second half spending will be much more than the first half.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the third quarter outlook. We expect our business in the third quarter will benefit from a customer's new product launch and continued inventory restocking. Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 32.30, we expect third quarter revenue to be between TWD 254 billion and TWD 257 billion, which represents 14.5% to 15.9% sequential growth; gross profit margin to be between 50% and 52%; and operating margin to be between 39.5% and 41.5%.
This concludes my remarks.",581

Let me start with near-term outlook. 
Our second quarter result was helped by an increase in demand from China 4G+ smartphone ramping and continued 3G to 4G upgrade from emerging markets. Given a stronger than seasonal business for our fabless customers in the second quarter, we estimate our fabless customers' DOI exiting second quarter is about seasonal level. Looking ahead to third quarter '16, we forecast continuing inventory build by the smartphone-centric OEMs and fabless companies stimulated by subsidy provided to the telecommunication companies by the Chinese government. We estimate fabless DOI will remain flat with the second quarter, but will be above seasonal level by a few days exiting third quarter.
Fourth quarter is normally an inventory adjustment quarter, but the degree of adjustment will depending on market dynamics and sentiment. For now, we expect the supply chain inventory to go back to the seasonal level exiting fourth quarter. For the whole year of 2016, TSMC maintains our target of between 5% and 10% growth in both revenue and operating profit, both in U.S. dollar and in NT dollars term.
Now let me make a few comments on CapEx. Our 2016 CapEx forecast has risen from USD 9 billion to USD 10 billion to USD 9.5 billion to USD 10.5 billion. Because expectation for 2017 mobile markets, mobile products revenue has risen as well. 
TSMC's CapEx-to-sales ratio, known as capital intensity, has came down significantly in the last 2 years. Compared with the high-40s level seen in 2011 to 2013, our capital intensity has dropped to about 31% last year. Going forward, we estimate our capital intensity will remain at mid-30s level for the next few years. 
One major factor contributing to this moderate level of capital intensity is our effort made to minimize the conversion loss between 2 adjacent technology node. For example, between 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer, we closely manage one peak capacity so we can minimize conversion loss. Now we also closely manage 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer as one peak capacity to minimize the conversion loss.
In terms of profitability, in the past few years, despite the higher CapEx, which led to a substantial increase in depreciation expenses, we have been able to maintain and even improve our structural profitability. We expect to be able to maintain our gross margin at close to 50% level and operating margin at close to 39% level.
My last comment is about dividend. We anticipate a steadily improving free cash flow in the next few years. Therefore, we expect our dividend to steadily increase in the next few years as well. 
Thank you. Let me turn the microphone to Mark for his comments.",456
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5922.0,1006965.0,42424813.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,4,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to deliver you the message, firstly on leading-edge technology status, that include 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer. 
First, on 10-nanometer. Our 10-nanometer has been transferred from R&D to production. Our first 10-nanometer customer product has been produced with satisfactory functional yield. So far, 3 customer products have been taped out to us. More customer product tape-outs are expected later this year. Those product tape-outs will start a revenue stream starting first quarter 2017, which will ramp steeply throughout 2017. 
On 7-nanometer, our 7-nanometer technology development is well on track. Its 256-megabit SRAM yield improvement is ahead of our schedule. In addition, we believe our 7-nanometer PPA, that is power, performance and area density, with its schedule, is ahead of our competitors. This technology has been aggressively adopted not only by mobile customers, but also by high-performance computing customers. They all have aggressive product tape-out plan in first half 2017, with volume production planned in early 2018. 
On 5-nanometer, we have been executing our 5-nanometer development since the beginning of this year. TSMC's 5-nanometer will achieve 1.9x of logic density over our 7-nanometer. We plan to extensively use EUV lithography in 5-nanometer to improve density, simplify process complexity and reduce cost. The 5-nanometer risk production qualification in first half 2019 remain unchanged.
Secondly, on EUV status, we plan to adopt EUV extensively in our 5-nanometer technology. Today, EUV technology uses 7-nanometer as a development vehicle. We have good integration progress in EUV scanner, EUV mask and EUV photoresist. Same yield level has been repeatedly demonstrated using 2 EUV layers in 7-nanometer. 
Currently, we are running 4 state-of-the-art EUV scanner for EUV infrastructure development and for N7 and N5 technology development. We will move in another 2 EUV high-volume production tools, that is NXE:3400, in first quarter 2017, next year. Recently, we successfully implemented 125 watt EUV source in our EUV 3350 to improve productivity. In our in-house mask shop, we have developing unique EUV mask technologies on mask blank, material, inspection and repair, to seamlessly integrate our EUV lithography total solution. 
With all the encouraging development and progresses made at EUV, we estimate that EUV will be cost effective tool for high-volume manufacturing by 2020, in time for our 5-nanometer ramp. Should EUV become cost-effective earlier, say, around 2019, we believe we can still benefit from the earlier available of EUV for our 7-nanometer high-volume manufacturing.
Thirdly, on growth drivers. First, smartphone as a growth driver. We expect smartphone-related demand will support half of our growth in the next 5 years. It will come from unit growth as well as increasing silicon content. Despite a weak semiconductor industry growth this year, we estimate the smartphone unit growth rate will be about 5 -- about 6%, and the silicon content growth rate for smartphone will increase by a double digit for high- and mid-end and about flattish for the low-end. 
We estimate total semiconductor revenue, excluding memory in smartphone, will increase about 7% this year. Longer term, we believe the semiconductor -- the smartphone unit will continue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate and the silicon content will continue to increase. This silicon content increase is driven by the increasing adoption of innovative smartphone features such as dual camera, security sensing, augment reality, virtual reality and migration of 4G, 4G+ and to 5G. Most of the high-end smartphone features are also proliferating into lower-end smartphones. Because those innovative features usually require more advanced technologies, with our customers, we will gradually increase our market share in the smartphone market.
As to high-performance computing as a growth driver, as the digital trend develops in all industry worldwide today, silicon IC will need it to take up vast amount of computation load in the future. We estimate computing opportunities will support about 1/4 of our growth in the next 5 years. 
In TSMC, we work with IC innovators around the world. We see momentum building up in the computing space for our customers. In May this year, 7 companies announced that they are forming an interconnect consortium called CCIX to enable heterogeneous computing in data centers. 
In China, cloud leaders and technology company formed Green Computing Consortium, aiming to develop energy-efficient data centers. We also see increasing activities around machine learning where system companies differentiate down to the silicon level. 
TSMC, as a foundry player, focuses on enabling our customers' innovation through providing leading-edge technology. Other innovations in computing area are augment reality, virtual reality, gaming and ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. TSMC has been developing suitable process technologies and design enablements for all those innovations.
Above is my message. Thank you. I turn the microphone to C.C.",783
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5922.0,1006965.0,42424814.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our 16-nanometer status. We continue to ramp 16-nanometer with defect density and cycle time better than our 10 [ph]. Major applications this year include mobile processor, cellular baseband, graphic and video game. We are happy to report that we have been recognized by a major customer for our contribution to the success of a development chip using TSMC's 16FF+. We expect our 16-nanometer business will continue to increase in the second half of this year, with most of the products adopted our 16FFC, which is a low-power and low-cost version of the 16-nanometer process. We expect to generate more than 20% wafer revenue from 16-nanometer in this year.
Now 28-nanometer. Our 28-nanometer has entered its sixth year of volume production. TSMC's 28HPC and HPC+ have been widely adopted by most of the mobile application processor suppliers for the faster core in mid- to low-end smartphones and other applications such as WiFi, digital TV, set-top box, fast controller, et cetera. With our differentiated technology, stable yield, short cycle time and large capacity support, we expect stronger demand for our 28-nanometer will advance through this year.
Now let me touch a little bit on our competitiveness for those technologies which has been in volume production, namely 16-nanometer, 28-nanometer and so on. TSMC continues to improve our technologies and development and develop new varies [ph] even after this technology had entered mass production stage. For example, to meet the changing market requirement, we introduced a low-cost, low-power version 16FFC this year after 16-nanometer started volume production last year. We also lowered the operating voltage of our 16-nanometer process to 0.5 volt to meet the requirement for IoT applications. 
Similarly, at 28-nanometer node, we introduced 28HPC and 28HPC+ for the low-power solutions, while keeping the speed at almost the same level. For 40-nanometer, TSMC also introduced 40 low-power for low-power application. For 51-nanometer [ph] and older node, we apply similar approaches as well.
Since we are able to start volume production ahead of our competition, TSMC has enjoyed a substantial advantage in learning curve. We are able to accumulate enough experience faster than our foundry peers, and therefore, we can better improve our cost and device performance for each technology node. Because of the learning curve advantage, we believe we are highly competitive in both performance and cost.
Now let me talk about our another growth driver, which is IoT, in addition to mobile and high-speed computation market, which Mark just explained. Driven by innovative business model, we expect the diversified and fragmented IoT applications will become one of the most important growth driver for future semiconductor business. IoT applications require not only the collection of huge amount of data, but also the ability to analyze the data and utilize the data to improve our daily lives, such as security and health. 
In the near term, we can see smart band and smart watch for health care and smart meter for efficient energy and cost saving. Longer term, we expect ADAS and autonomous driving be widely adopted. Smart home, smart city, robot home [ph] are also progressing along. 
We believe TSMC's specialty technology development in CMOS image sensor, MEMS, RF, power management IC and emerging memory are well-positioned to capture the IoT opportunities.
Now let me talk about our advancement in technology, first on InFO. We are in volume production now. Our focus today is to continuing yield improvement and cost reduction. We expect InFO will contribute more than USD 100 million revenue in 4Q this year with moderate gross margin. 
At the same time, we are also developing the next-generation InFO technology for products planned for next year and beyond.
Now on CoWoS, we have seen strong momentum from high-memory bandwidth and high-performance-driven applications, such as networking development [ph] and artificial intelligence. While our CoWoS is still in small volume production for those very high-speed applications, we see the potential of demand increase as well.

You talk about the growth model, right? Okay. We do have a growth forecast within the company, but let me share you with the big picture. In our model, we -- semiconductor has been staying on 0% percent growth for the past 2 years. But next 5 years, we estimate about between, still about between 2%-plus [ph] to 3%. And the fabless company, because of the business model advantages and the leading-edge technology advantages, they will grow about 5% per year in the next 5 years. And semiconductor -- and TSMC, with this, not only the fabless company, but also the system company and IDM outsourcing, we estimate will grow -- our current estimate will be about between 5% to 10%, depending on the macroeconomics and the semiconductor events. This model is assuming that there is no killer application happen in the next 5 years, okay? And as to the background of this growth model we have -- we are focusing on 4 areas, as I presented to you earlier. First is the smartphone -- mobile devices, mostly smartphones, and that will drive about the growth 50% of that growth in the next 5 years. And the high-performance computing, that will include the learning, artificial intelligence, the machine learning, AI, gaming, that will grow -- that would drive about 1/4 of our driving growth in the next 5 years. And autonomous car and IoT and the rest will take up another 1/4 of the drive growth for the next 5 years. So this is largely our growth model, yes.",262

Are we expecting that smartphone units stay at this 5% to 6% kind of growth rate? Or could in most tech markets, once the saturation hits, we get down to probably GDP growth rate, which is like 2% or something like that. Are we anticipating that? And is the future growth in smartphones primarily coming from content growth, which is still pretty decent?",87

And actually -- but at the same time, the mid-end-sitting [ph] content is increasing very fast, and the unit number of the low end also increasing very fast. As far as the high end, we don't believe that trend for the last year drop will continue, okay? Innovation will surface to drive the momentum of the unit growth. So in total, we still estimate the growth rate will be about 5% in unit growth. Silicon content, I mentioned, is also about equally important. So that's the general model we have.",107

Could you talk a little bit about the take-off of the revenues, given that you're expecting tape-outs in first half next year? Typically, the end market that you serve in compute, especially the data center compute, takes a bit longer for qualification, if we look at server market, for example. Are we anticipating revenues coming in with 7-nanometer in 2018 itself for compute, or could you talk about your revenue model for the compute product side?",83

At this point, the -- we think, first of all, many of the low-end servers has -- some of our smaller customers has penetrated already, okay? But for the ballpark, the main portion of the server, I think it will wait for the 7-nanometer to get some share by our customers. But in the next -- at least in the next -- so 7-nanometer will happen in 2018 and afterwards. So you start from '19 and beyond. So it will -- for the data center, I think it will be a more hockey stick beyond probably really bigger portion beyond 2020. So in the next 5 years, mostly are the computing of the cloud edge devices, of course, including the networking, storage and other cloud edge devices that I just mentioned. Okay, thank you.",147

Just to get a feel for the base. The computing, should we think of computing now just that computer end market, that's 8% of revenue? Is that when you're thinking about computing driving 1/4 of the growth that's only 8% of revenue now? Like are we thinking the same definition? And within computing, how much are you banking on ARM and IBM-based servers versus some of the other things like the deep learning or if it's like the AR/VR graphics that you're banking on for most of that growth?",103

And for the growth, are you factoring most of that growth from the ARM, IBM-based servers or is most of it more from the VR/AR, AI type stuff?",63

When I talk about computing, it doesn't include a lot of PC or tablets or current computing. I'm more category the high-performance computing part. Of course, data center, network and storage, but mostly is, in the next 3 years, I think it will be mostly the machine learning, AI, augment reality, gaming, those are -- those computing devices, okay?

Second question, a 2-part question on the gross margin. For third quarter, if you could go into the factors. Sales are up 15%, but the gross margin's kind of flattish. If you could talk about the factors, say, from InFO or a ramp of 16-nanometer, what's driving kind of the factor you're not seeing the leverage from Q2 to Q3 in gross margin with the higher sales? And then the second part is as you ramp 10-nanometer next year, this year, you had the benefit of 16 being a more mature process, borrowing from 20. So would there be any margin impact on the first year of the 10-nanometer ramp in 2017?",114

As we are continually ramping 16-nanometer, so 6-nanometer will account for a bigger part of our revenue in third quarter versus the second quarter. This year is only the second year of the 16 ramp. So it still have some dilution to corporate average gross margin. So this is a negative for third quarter, yes.",64

ARM set on your 4-layer ARM-based CPU for server, 1 billion [ph] have a significant market share until 2020. At that time, they expect about a 35% of the share. So that means on your -- for this ARM-based CPU, in this high-performance computing, probably won't be very limited from now on to maybe 2018. And so that means for the application process point of view, I think that, actually, it won't be using our 16-nanometer and not even 10-nanometer because our 7-nanometer are in the less production from 2018. So my question is there any performance gap on the 16-nanometer or 10-nanometer in terms of this ARM-based CPU performance? So that's for people who cannot use [indiscernible] ARM-based CPU on the server or even on this high-performance computing quickly?",140

Indeed, the -- to the main bulk of the CPU, it would take -- we will have to work with our customer on 7-nanometer, and it's ongoing actively. Before that, I think there are customer working on 16 and even 28 to enter low-end server already also. But for the other high-performance computing application, really, the entry technology is spread quite wide. Just take the ADAS, for example. 28-nanometer is prevailing entry for the ADAS technology in many of the high-end cars already. For machine learning, 16-nanometer, what do you see mostly already, high volume is on 16-nanometer and entry to developed market already. The gaming is already also entry in the 16-nanometer soon. It just started on the 16-nanometer already. So for other high-performance computing, the application will happen much earlier already on 28 and 16 and 10 also. So that is different than the data center.",160

I think TSMC and Mark just commented that TSMC plans to insert EUV at 7-nanometer if it is mature enough before 2020 -- before 5-nanometer. My question is, if another foundry, let's say, starts 7-nanometer with [ph] EUV versus TSMC insert EUV at 7-nanometer, what's the implications on performance and product? For example, will TSMC's customers have to redesign the 7-nanometer when you insert EUV in the second year of the technology ramp? So that's my first question. The second question is on demand. I think -- what is the smartphone as a percent of revenues in the third quarter? Would this be, let's say, 60% revenue or less? And also, when you're saying in the next few years smartphone to be half of the growth, would you imply smartphone and non-smartphone grow at about the same pace?",145

On the first question on EUV, our 7-nanometer will be qualified first quarter next year. So it's only 3 quarters from now, definitely EUV will not be ready. And our customer product tape-out will happen in the first half next year, definitely we cannot put our customer at risk using EUV. So this is because we're very aggressive in delivering 7-nanometer. And indeed, adoption is very wide range. Our plans to aggressively using EUV will be in 5-nanometer, where the 5-nanometer will start -- will finish core [ph] in the first half of '19, and so we're already starting 5-nanometer development. And EUV, at this time, we cannot use that as a volume for R&D, because doing the R&D, a lot of activity, a lot of activity going on. So we choose that we aggressively getting into 7-nanometer without EUV, and we extensively target EUV on 5-nanometer. Yes, indeed, some of our customer -- one of our customer planned a EUV on their 7-nanometer, but that is only very -- schedule wise, it's very similar to our -- maybe a little bit ahead of our 5-nanometer, a few quarters. But our 5-nanometer is 2 steps down. The density is very aggressive using EUV, and learning after 7-nanometer will be very safe on the 5-nanometer. Had the EUV available before 2020, we consider using our 7-nanometer technology as a base to adopt EUV for the -- probably the second wave products. But as far as -- but we want to minimize these design changes so that all the customer are coming to our 7-nanometer will be easily adopt the -- what we can reap from the EUV on 7-nanometer. So that is our plan. I think we develop our technology at the best timing for our customers' products. So that is our current plan.",304

That's fine. The reason why I'm asking this question is really to talk a little bit about above 28-nanometer. Competitors like SMIC are growing very fast this year and they're capacity constrained, they don't really have any 28-nanometer really to speak of. So what's going on in the above 28-nanometer node? So above 28-nanometer, it seems like maybe TSMC's big share, is that right? That's just trying to influence -- how would you respond to that question?",79

You have been raising your dividend, yet you're generating more free cash flow every year, so you're growing your cash balance. I'm curious when does this become too much?

Our dividend policy has ruled it [ph] as a sustainability, and we have started to pay dividend since 2008 -- since 2004, actually. And there is a very long period of time we pay $3 every year for consecutive 8 years. And then we significantly increased the dividend to $4.50 a year ago and then to $6 today. So if I look at from today's forecast, and we have confidence we can continue to grow our free cash flow every year, that is why I say the dividend policy will kind of change from sustainable to sustainable and increasing.

A couple of years ago when you first started investing in 20-nanometer, there was a surge in CapEx as you were preparing 20. And now, it seems like 10 and 7 are pretty much comparable to 20 and 16. And back then, a couple of years ago, after significant spending in 20 then there was a period where your CapEx came in flat, or even last year, it declined. Should we assume the same kind of CapEx spending looking forward, especially since 10 and 7 are comparable to 20 and 16?",98

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the third quarter, followed by the guidance for the fourth quarter.
We have just finished another strong quarter despite a less favorable foreign exchange rate. Our third quarter revenue increased 17% sequentially to TWD 260 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance given in July, due to the strong demand in overall smartphone market. Gross margin declined 0.8 percentage point sequentially to 50.7%, mainly due to a unfavorable foreign exchange rate and the margin dilution from higher 16-nanometer contribution, partially balanced by a higher utilization rate and the cost improvement. R&D expense continued to increase, reflecting a higher level of development activities for 7-nanometer since our revenue grow faster than R&D expense. Total operating expense to revenue was 9.9%. Operating margin was 40.8% in the third quarter.  Overall, our third quarter earnings per share reached $3.73, a 33% increase Q-over-Q and a 28% year-over-year. And ROE for the third quarter was 31.2%.
Now let's take a look at the revenue contribution by application. Our third quarter business benefited from the new mobile product launches as well as the robust overall smartphone demand. Revenue increased across the board in all product segment. Communication and Industrial/Standard increased by 19% and 16% respectively, while Computer and Consumer also increased by 3% and 8%, respectively.  
In terms of revenue by technology. Combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer continued to grow and represented 31% of wafer revenue in the third quarter compared to 23% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, our 28-nanometer capacity remain fully utilized and represented 24% of our wafer revenue in the third quarter. 
Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 517 billion, which is TWD 151 billion lower than the second quarter. That was as a result of TWD 156 billion of cash dividend payment in July. Correspondingly, current liability decreased by TWD 141 billion. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased by 1 day to 42 days. Days of inventory decreased by 10 days to 44 days, mainly due to reduction in working process as a result of stronger wafer shipments and the improving cycle time on advanced nodes.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated TWD 126 billion from operations, spent TWD 104 billion in capital expenditure, paid out TWD 156 billion in cash dividend and repaid TWD 12 billion of corporate bonds. Our overall cash balance decreased TWD 158 billion to TWD 464 billion at the end of the third quarter. 
In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditure spend in the first 3 quarters of 2016 totaled USD 6.7 billion. Our full year CapEx budget is now expected to be slightly above $9.5 billion, which is at the low end of our guidance.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current business outlook and exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31.50, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between TWD 255 billion and TWD 258 billion, which represents 1% to 2% sequential decline; gross profit margin to be between 50.5% and 52.5%; and operating margin to be between 40% and 42%.
This concludes my remarks. Now I'd like to turn the podium to Mark for his comment.",575
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2016",2016-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4970.0,1055373.0,44226230.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Liu,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon. I would like to start delivering our key messages. Let me start from our near-term outlook. We concluded our third quarter with 17% quarter-to-quarter and 22% year-to-year revenue growth. This strong growth was driven by our major customers' new mobile product launch and a stronger-than-seasonal growth from our other customers.
In the third quarter, we gained our foundry market share across most technology nodes. With strong sell-through, we estimate fabless DOI exiting the third quarter will be only slightly above seasonal level. We saw the smartphone sales improving coming into second half this year. High-end smartphone demand today is better than we previously expected. The 4G+ deployment in China and the 4G upgrade in emerging markets also drive end demand. PC gaming and the TV gaming markets, driven by product refresh, are showing good growth. Also, deep learning is increasingly applied to many diversified areas. 
So we forecast our fourth quarter revenue to be about flat from the third quarter. The demand for high-end smartphone will continue to improve. We estimate the year-end inventory reduction will be relatively mild. So exiting 2016, the fabless DOI will be slightly higher than seasonal level by about 2 days. 
For the whole year of 2016, we forecast semiconductor market revenue, excluding memory, will have 1% growth. Foundry revenue will have 7% growth, and TSMC revenue will achieve 10% growth in US dollars and 11% to 12% in NT dollars.
Now I come to the leading-edge technology status and competition. First, on 7-nanometer. Our 7-nanometer technology development is well on track. The progress of yield improvement and devised performance development are both on schedule. We are confident our 7-nanometer technology to be ahead of our competitions'. Our plan of risk production qualification in 1Q '17 remains unchanged. Our 7-nanometer has been adopted not only by high-end mobile consumers -- customers, but also by high-performance computing customers for GPU, gaming, PC and tablet, virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive and networking applications. They all have aggressive product tape-out plans starting from early second quarter '17.  So we expect to work on silicon qualification of more than 15 customer product tape-outs in 2017.
Now on 5-nanometer. Since the beginning of this year, our 5-nanometer technology has graduated from pathfinding to enter technology development phase. Recently, our EUV technology development made good progress. The throughput and reliability of EUV scanners, the sensitivity of EUV photoresist and the quality of EUV mask blank and the pellicles all improved. Of course, there is still a way to go. We will use EUV lithography extensively in our 5-nanometer flow to improve density, simplify process steps and reduce cost. A plan of risk production qualification in first half 2019 remains unchanged.
Now I want to report to you about our growth platforms. I will report you 2 -- our first 2 growth platforms. The first is mobile platforms. 
We believe mobile will continue to be a growth driver for TSMC in the next few years. We forecast worldwide smartphone unit growth rate be at mid-single digit in the next 5 years. The silicon content of smartphone will continue to increase, driven by increasing smartphone features such as dual camera, security sensing, AR/VR and migration to 4G, 4G+ and 5G, particularly in high-end smartphones. Those high-end smartphone features will also proliferate to mid- and low-end smartphones. There are other smartphone features yet to be seen. For example, deep learning for AI inference will also increase smartphone silicon content in the next 5 years. More high-performance processor will be used for context-aware applications and provide new user experience. For this mobile platform, we will complete developing 7-nanometer in 2017, upgrade 7-nanometer in 2018 and complete developing 5-nanometer in 2019 to support smartphone and high-end mobile product on annual cadence. For mid- to low-end mobile and wearable products, we will continuously offer cost reduction technologies with 28HPC+, 16FFC and its derivative technologies. 
Included on our mobile platform, there are TSMC's highly innovative and differentiated InFO advanced packaging for low power and small form factor. We also offer our next-generation CIS technology, RF technology, SOI, RF Front End, power management IC, fingerprint, Near Field Communication and various MEMS sensor technologies in this mobile innovation platform. We believe we are in -- we are very well positioned to grow in this mobile market in the next few years.
Now I turn to high-performance computing platform. In addition to mobile, we have also identified high-performance computing as another area of growth. In the trend of digital world, more and more devices are connected, and more and more data are generated, collected, filtered, processed and analyzed at all levels, in local, in the network as well as in the cloud. This trend cause for more pervasive silicon processors for those computing loads.
Recently, deep learning market calls for new levels of parallelism and new levels of compute efficiency from our customers. This rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, allowing machine ability to see, hear and predict, has huge implication in many industry verticals, like health care, media, consumer, automotive and so forth. This silicon content to support AI applications, I think will be huge. We forecast that total wafer revenue opportunities, excluding memory, in this market segments could reach more than USD 15 billion in 5 years. To capture these opportunities, we offer optimized 7-nanometer in 2017 and optimized 5-nanometer in 2019 in TSMC's high-performance platform. These technology offers include high-performance standard cell library, optimized metal interconnect and optimized EDA design flows for high-performance computing design. Our advanced packaging side, we will continue to offer 2.5D- and 3D-IC integration solution in addition to the current CoWoS as part of our high-performance computing platform. They will support increased memory bandwidth for low-power, high-performance computation.
Thank you for your attention. I turn the microphone to C.C. Wei.",968

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with 10-nanometer status. We have transferred our 10-nanometer from R&D to production in third quarter this year. Our first 10-nanometer customer product has been produced with reasonable yield. Defect density and device performance continue to improve in much the same way as we did at the ramp-up stage of every leading-edge technology node. So far, we have received the 5 production tape-outs or high-end mobile products. We are preparing capacity for 10-nanometer production ramp-up by the end of this year, and expect shipment in first quarter next year.  Currently, there are about 200 -- 2,500 engineers and 1,200 technician are working in the fabs on 10-nanometer. Additional 1,000 engineer and 500 technicians will be added to our 10-nanometer production team by the end of this year for the preparation of volume ramp in 2017. As to our 16-nanometer FinFET, the defect density and cycle time continue to improve and are very competitive. In addition to mobile application processors, other applications such as cellular baseband, graphic processor for video game, AR/VR, deep learning and AI have strongly adopted our 16-nanometer solutions. As a result, our 16-nanometer business this year is expected to become more than fivefold of its level last -- compared to last year. 
In order to support the applications for mid- to low-end smartphone and wearable products, we continue to work with customer to further shrink the die size while improving the performance in 16FFC.
Now on 28-nanometer. The demand for our 28-nanometer technologies has continued to be strong as well to this year and is expect to last through many years. So we are judiciously adding some bottleneck tours [ph] to meet the strong demand.  Applications related to mid- and low-end smartphones as well as the WiFi, digital TV, set-top box plus controller and others has found TSMC's 28-nanometer a desirable solution. We saw differentiated technology, stable yield, shorter cycle time and large capacity.  We have been very competitive in this node and are confident to maintain our market segment share for this node.  
Other nodes on 28-nanometer all the way to 0.65-micron and even to 1- or 2-micron technology has been an important contributor to TSMC's profitability. We developed a broad portfolio of logic-based specialty technologies, such as the CMOS image sensor, Embedded Flash, power management IC, fingerprint sensor and MEMS to test field our legacy logic capacity, which is converted into these specialty technologies. And we continue to earn good margin from this business.  Today, we have more than 8 million 12-inch equivalent wafer in your capacity from these older nodes. We believe this is by far the industry's largest capacity on those older nodes.
Now let me talk about one of our growth platform, Automotive. There are many new applications being developed in automotive industry, such as ADAS, smart and green energy, electrical vehicles, et cetera. We believe those new applications will trigger or have triggered new opportunities and requirement on semiconductor industry. For example, inside a car there will be a lot of sensors to correct the environmental information, RF devices to connect with the outside world, more video displays, et cetera. A car also need a very powerful MCU or many powerful MCU to analyze data for better safety and functionality. TSMC has been working with customer to develop necessary technology to capture those opportunities. Today, we offer a broad range of technologies, including advanced logic, Embedded Flash, CMOS image sensor MEMS and BCD to sell customers in need. 
In addition to technology offer, we also put a lot of effort on quality and reliability for automotive platform. For example, in Q3 this year, we start to provide ISO 26262-compliant IPs for 16FFC for automotive ecosystem. 
With our manufacturing excellence, which has been demonstrated in a high volume production with stable yield and the broad range of technologies, we are ready to serve this growing market. We estimate the total market of automotive-related ICs measured in wafer value, excluding memories, was about 4 billion in 2015 and about 6 billion by 2020. We expect our wafer business from automotive-related ICs will more than double from 2015 to 2020.
Now let me talk about IoT. IoT is another growth area we have identified. This market is fragmented with diversified products. We estimate the total market of IoT-related ICs, again major in wafer value, excluding memory, was about 2 billion in 2015 and estimated to reach about 6 billion in 2020. For those IoT products, we have focused our effort on providing our total power technologies. For example, we offer 55-nanometer, 40-nanometer ultra-low power for low to mid performance IoT product and 28 ultra-low power and 16FFC for high-performance applications. Furthermore, we also integrate ultra-low power, RF, Embedded Flash as well as sensor solution such as a CMOS image sensor and MEMS, to enable machine-to-machine or human-to-machine interface. With our broad range of low-power technologies and specialty technologies, we believe we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunity in IoT market, and we expect to grow our IoT business at a fastest pace than overall IoT market in the next few years.
Now I will talk about InFO. TSMC's InFO has been in volume production since second quarter this year. Currently, there are more than 2,000 engineers and technicians working in our Longtan site for InFO production. While we are confident that InFO will contribute more than USD 100 million revenue towards fourth quarter this year, we continue our effort on cost reduction and yield improvement, also with good result. More customers have engaged in resource and InFO technologies for the purpose of enhancing their product performance. Major application is still in mobile product. We are now qualifying for the next-generation InFO technology. A few hundred or more engineers are expect to be added to our Longtan site when we begin our next-generation InFO production in year 2017.
Now let me talk about the Nanjing project. Our Nanjing project was announced last December. It includes a wholly owned 12-inch wafer manufacturing facility and a design service center for the purpose of providing closer support to our customer in China and to fully expand our business opportunities. We broke ground for the fab in early July. The production is expected to start in second half 2018 with 16-nanometer. We believe it will be the most advanced fab producing 16 products in China at the time. Our design service center in Nanjing has already started functioning, with more than 50 engineers now and expect to grow to about 100 by next year. We expect this design center will [indiscernible] help our customer in China to shorten their revenue cycle and speed up their new product introduction to the market.
Thank you for your attention. Now I turn the podium to Lora.",1136

So first, regarding CapEx. TSMC's 2016 capital budget is estimated to be slightly above TWD 9.5 billion, as I said earlier, which is closer to our low end of our guidance. We have guided TWD 9.5 billion to TWD 10.5 billion 3 months ago. It is mainly due to improving cycle time estimated for 10-nanometer. We are able to shorten the lead time for capacity installations, which leads to a reduction of our 2016 estimated CapEx. However, this reduction in 2016 will not change our planned capacity for 10-nanometer in 2017. Our estimate for the capital intensity going forward remains unchanged at around low to mid-30s level for the next few years.
I will talk about profitability. In the past few years, despite the higher CapEx, which leads to a substantial increase in depreciation expenses, we have been able to improve our structure profitability significantly. We plan to keep our structure profitability at high levels by continue working on price, cost and the utilization rate with careful planning of capacity. Going forward, we expect to be able to maintain our gross margin rate at close to 50% level.
My last comment is about the dividend. Given our target revenue growth rate for the 2016 to 2020 5-year period to be compounded annual growth of between 5% and 10% and our capital intensity to stay at low to mid-30s of our revenue, we anticipate an improving free cash flow after debt service in the next few years. Therefore, we also expect our dividend per share to increase in the next few years.
This conclude my remark.",279

That's why we can spend less money, but you get the same capacity investment, okay. Of course, cycle time helps you as well. So that means when you start to productions, and the yield can reach to optimal sooner, of course, that will help the margin as well, okay. You were talking about the 2017. In my prepared message, I was talking about our effort on structure profitability improvement, our confidence on maintaining 50% level, okay. Given this year's depreciation is only increased a little bit, and our CapEx is very much back-end loaded, as you can see, in the first half, only about 30%; in second half, maybe 70%.

We expect the 7-nanometer business will -- of course, will be larger than 28-nanometer. Capacity-wise, we don't -- it could be comparable, could be -- it really depends on the -- later on, when the customer's product launch, how successful they will be. But we are planning probably within -- it's comparable, within the range. There's no significantly drop, okay? It's the capacity-wise.

So it sounds like that customers' demand are very strong for 7-nanometer. And you just mentioned that the 10-nanometer cycle time is shorter than your expectation, so it -- is it possible you can bring in the measurable charge and [ph] timing of a 7-nanometer to so-called later 2017 if your risk production in 1Q next year is smooth?",67

And also on 7-nanometer.  So do you expect the customer's number -- or tape-out number to be more than 16-nanometer? I mean because the 7-nanometer costs could be much higher than 16-nanometer. So when you communicate with your customer, how will they justify the higher costs in terms of photomask, wafer price, IT costs and et cetera?",59
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2016",2016-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4970.0,1055373.0,44226302.0,Answer,Mark Liu,,Executives,74,"Right now, it's hard. When I cited that the customer number really is at this point, those customer are already working with us on 7-nanometer, okay? And by no means the total number of customers. As any know, when technology gets matured, there are many, many smaller customers, or more innovative, other new companies will come onboard. So if you look at the 16-nanometer, they have quite a bigger number than what I tell you on 7, but as time goes on, I believe 7-nanometer customer will continually increase. One is, in addition to the mobile application, I expect the high-performance application for VR, AR artificial intelligence application will come added to our customer -- product portfolio. That is the reason we see in one way the entry barrier is higher. So less customer can get into, but the application of that technology will be wider than before. So that is what I -- what we see.",157

So last, a very quick on the so-called revenue upside. I guess the question is to Lora. So I just want to clarify, do you think the revenue upside in third quarter are mainly coming from the 28-nanometer, or 16-nanometer? Because you mentioned that the margin erosion comes from 16-nanometer, so it seems to imply the upside coming from 16-nanometer in third quarter.",64

Maybe you can comment a little bit about what's going on in China, what you're seeing there and thoughts for the fourth quarter. And then the second clarificational question that I had was just on gross margins. You had said that around 50% for next year. I'm curious if that's more of a full year number. Or when I think about it on a quarterly basis -- I mean you've talked a little bit about seasonality in large customers driving depreciation. I know in the past you've smoothed it a little bit as well in the first half by starting wafers. I guess I'm worried a bit about first half next year gross margins.

Of course, some quarter depend on the seasonality and utilization. They may kind of swing a little bit.

Midway through the third quarter, one of your competitors now, Intel seems to have rebooted their foundry effort. TSMC's been under attack many times in -- over the years. And you guys have done a great job with your scale, your tech leadership, existing relationships, your kind of customer agnosticism, if you will.  But I'm just curious, is there anything different this time with some of the competitive threats out there? Are you hearing any differences from a customer perspective or even from just a competitive perspective on pricing or incentives or just a general spectrum-ship [ph] that's going on right now? Any thoughts on competitive landscape this time around?",120

And there was capacity conversion. Could you talk about the outlook for the 16 node, if you expect to backfill as some of the leading products move. Or you could see the same type of move of converting capacity from 16 down to 10 and 7. And is it efficient to make that capacity conversion?",69

Wei,,Executives,119,"We fuel our capacity according to the demand, of course. And so the next year, we expect the customer move, especially the high-end smartphone, the move from 16 to 10. And then we expect the second wave and third waves of customer to enter into 16-nanometer. So, so far, we will convert some of the 16-nanometers capacity into 10. We will if the demand is not as high as it this year, okay? And you are talking about the converting efficiency. Quite high.",83

And so -- and when you're saying -- so your base case is no conversion. It's only a -- only on a demand disappointment that you -- like, your base case is you can fill that capacity, okay. The second question, you used to disclose IDM business every quarter. It's no longer in the quarterly, but IDM last year grew from 15% to 18%, so it's actually a reversal that IDMs grew as a percent of sales. If you could talk about that bucket, which it seemed like it continued to come down relative to fabless, but with some of the mergers, like NXP-Freescale, are you seeing as a result of that any change in outsourcing? Or for your overall IDM business, any change?",125

I know your inventory is mainly from WIP and also finished goods. I have looked at these in 3Q. You have a 17% higher revenue compared to second quarter, but in your inventory there had been a decline about 10%. I agree, you said that you ship off as WIPs. However, at the end of -- in 3Q, you probably have much more wafer starts also. So that actually will be turned to the WIPs, yes. So I just want to understand, what is the percentage for your finished good in your inventory? Are you -- did you ship off these finished good to your customer in 3Q?",117

We have very low finished goods inventory. If you understand our business model, that's the way it should be.  So a majority part of our inventory is WIP, okay?

So I just have the chance [ph] last week in TSIA annual meeting. I spelled out our 3-nanometer status. And everybody is working on it, I believe. At least the top 3 or 4, and a few in the pathfinding mode. And how to do the transistor, I think everybody is still searching it. It is not obvious at this point, but that is what's the researching is about. So we intend to invest heavily in the much forward-looking R&D, anticipating all kinds, both in the Moore's law scaling as well as the 3D IC integration.
