380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2019",2019-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5356.0,1637895.0,64494478.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Elizabeth. First of all, Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights, as usual, for the fourth quarter and a recap of 2018 for the whole year. Then after that, I will provide a guidance for the first quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 11.3% sequentially to TWD 290 billion as our business benefited from the strong demand for our 7-nanometer technology, covering both mobile and high-performance computing applications. Gross margin increased 30 basis points sequentially to 47.7%, reflecting the absence of the virus incident that occurred in the third quarter and an improvement in back-end profitability, higher capacity utilization and the more favorable foreign exchange rate. These factors helped offset the unfavorable technology mix. Total operating expenses increased by TWD 2.7 billion, thanks to the operating leverage only represented 10.6% of the revenue versus 10.8% in the prior quarter. And operating margin increased by 40 basis points sequentially to 37%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached $3.86, and ROE was 24.6%. 
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology continued to ramp strongly and accounted for 23% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. 10-nanometer was 6%, and the combined 16/20-nanometer contribution accounted for 21%. Advanced technologies, 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue, up from 61% in the third quarter.
On a full year basis, 7-nanometer contribution reached 9% of wafer revenue in 2018. 10-nanometer was 11%. And the combined 6/20-nanometer (sic) [ 16/20-nanometer ] contributions was 23% of wafer revenue. Advanced technologies accounted for 63% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2017.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the fourth quarter, Communication increase 27%, while Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased 2%, 35% and 3%, respectively. On a full year basis, Computer, Communication and Industrial/Standard increased 61%, 1% and 3%, respectively, while Consumer decreased 17%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 695 billion, an increase of TWD 91 billion from the last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 19 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days was 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 6 day to 67 days due to stronger wafer shipment during the fourth quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 189 billion cash from operations and spent $114 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 75 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 89 billion to reach TWD 578 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In the U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditure reached USD 3.7 billion and a total USD 10.5 billion for the full year CapEx.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in 2018. 2018 was another growth year for TSMC as we continue to set new records in both revenue and earnings. Despite the weakening macroeconomic outlook and demand headwinds in certain end applications, our revenue grew 6.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term and 5.5% in NT dollar terms to reach about TWD 1 trillion. Main contributor was the strong demand for our 7- and 10-nanometer wafers. Gross margin decreased 2.3 percentage points to 48.3%, reflecting a lower level of capacity utilization, the unfavorable technology mix and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate during the year. Our operating margin decreased 2.2 percentage point to 37.2%, while we continue to increase investment in R&D for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Our effective tax rate was 11.7% in 2018, which was lower than 13.5% in 2017 due to lower retained earning tax. Full year earnings per share was $13.54. 
On cash flow, we generated TWD 574 billion in operating cash flow for the whole year, spent TWD 316 billion or USD 10.5 billion in capital expenditure, leaving $258 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 207 billion or $8 per share in cash dividend, which is an increase of 14% from the 2017 level.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the forecast first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect first quarter revenue to be between USD 7.3 billion and USD 7.4 billion, representing 22% sequential decline. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.6, our first quarter gross margin is expected to be between 43% and 45%. And operating margin is expected to be between 31% and 33%. 
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about the near-term demand and inventory, CapEx and profitability. 
Now on near-term demand and inventory, we conclude the fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 287.8 billion or USD 9.4 billion, in line with the guidance given 3 months ago. This result was mainly driven by the continued steep ramp of our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology. Concluding 2018, semiconductor, excluding memory, growth was 8%, while foundry grew 6%. TSMC's revenue grew 6.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, mainly due to strong demand for our 7-nanometer technology. 
Moving into first quarter '19, our business will be dampened by the overall weakening of the macroeconomic outlook, mobile product seasonality and the high level of inventory in the semiconductor supply chain. Due to the overall softening economic environment, semiconductor supply chain inventory exiting 2018 stayed at a much higher level than seasonal, we expect the excess inventory in the semiconductor supply chain will take a couple of quarters to digest. And the overall supply chain inventory will gradually approach to the seasonal level around the middle of this year.
Now let me make comments about the CapEx. As I have said it before, we believe USD 10 billion to USD 12 billion capital budget will be sufficient to support our average growth of 5% to 10% per annum in the next few years. Given the macroeconomic outlook in 2019, we are tightening this year's capital spending by several hundred million dollars to a level between USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion. That said, our commitment to support customers' product ramp remain unchanged. Out of this USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion CapEx for 2019, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, which includes 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. A little more than 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies. So this is about CapEx. 
Let me follow on by making some comments about our profitability. Okay, as I stated in our first quarter 2018 earnings call, I said TSMC's profitability is determined by the following 6 factors: number one is leadership technology development and ramp-up; and pricing; and cost reduction; and capacity utilization; and foreign exchange rate; and last one is technology mix. All these factors, except capacity utilization, determine our standard gross margin. 
I have just guided first quarter gross margin to decline by 3.7 percentage points sequentially, at the midpoint of the guidance. This is primarily attributable to a lower utilization due to the overall weakening macroeconomic environment and the mobile product seasonality and the high level of inventory in the supply chain.
Due to the recent changes in high-end smartphone business condition, our 7-nanometer capacity will see a substantial cutback on utilization rate in fourth quarter -- in first quarter and second quarter, which is expected to hit our gross margin by more than 4 percentage point each quarter. Going forward, to better manage our leading-edge utilization rate, we will be working closely with customers for more effective capacity planning. 
Looking at other profitability factors for 2019. Our 7-nanometer ramp-up remains very strong. We continue to provide value to customer and drive aggressive cost reduction. In the meantime, we are increasing our resource in specialty technologies development to backfill our mainstream technology capacity. With all the above factors, we expect our gross margin in the second half of this year will be better than first half. And we believe our long-term gross margin target of about 50% is still a good target.
Thank you for your listening. Now let me turn the podium to C.C. for his mark -- remark.",1387
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2019",2019-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5356.0,1637895.0,64494479.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
Let me start with our 2019 full year outlook. We forecast a slowdown in global GDP growth from 3.2% in 2018 to 2.6% in 2019 due to the weakening macroeconomic conditions leading to a dull growth for the semiconductor industry. For the full year of 2019, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow 1%, while foundry growth will be flat. 
For TSMC, we estimate our business will grow only slightly in 2019 given the slowing economic environment. Our 2019 business will be supported by the continuing demand for our 7-nanometer, where we see stronger interest from our customer in high-performance computing, mobile and automotive.
Even with a slow year like 2019, we firmly believe AI and 5G are the megatrends that will drive the future semiconductor growth. And we reaffirm our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR. 
Now I will talk about our 5-nanometer status. Our N5 technology development is well on track, with customer tapeout schedule for first half 2019 and volume production ramp in first half 2020. We are already in preparation for N5's ramp. All applications that are using 7-nanometer today will adopt 5-nanometer. In addition, we are expanding the customer product portfolio at N5 and see expanding addressable market opportunities. We expect more application in HPC to adopt N5. Thus, we are confident that N5 will also be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7 and N7+. Our 7-nanometer has been a very steep and successful ramp in second half 2018, and we expect continued ramp through 2019. Our customer portfolio is growing stronger while more applications such as HPC and automotive are coming to N7 as well. Customer tapeouts activity at N7 continue to be strong despite the cautious macro outlook. We are actually seeing increase in silicon content for AI and 5G-related product designs. We expect the 7-nanometer to contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in 2019.
Our N7+ yield rate is progressing well and comparable to N7. N7+ volume production is scheduled to begin in second quarter this year. As I have stated before, we are working with several customers on N7+ to support their second- and third-wave product designs. And we expect the N7+ contribution to the 7-nanometer family will grow increasingly larger over the next few years.
Now I will talk about TSMC's mature node strategy and our new 8-inch facility. For mature nodes, our strategy is that we do not increase larger capacity at mature nodes, but rather, we work with customers to develop specialty technologies that create differentiated and longer-lasting value to customers. Our recent plan for an extension at Fab 6 in Tainan is a part of this strategy. The extension is not an increase of wafer capacity per se, but the purpose is to increase the clean room space for more specialty tools. With successful execution of our mature node strategy, we believe we will be able to continually deliver good profitability in the future.
Finally, I will talk about our most important growth contributor in the next 5 year. As I just stated, we believe 5G and AI will be the megatrend underlying the ubiquitous computing which will drive the semiconductor growth in the future. With the successful ramp of 7-nanometer, we are able to expand our customer product portfolio and can add applications related to PC and tablets to the HPC platform. With this inclusion, we believe HPC will become the largest contributor to our business in terms of revenue growth in the next 5 years.
Thank you for your attention.",610

You're lowering sales outlook to just slight growth but only making a small change to CapEx. Could you talk about the assumptions you're making for further market share gains or demand recovery and also the assumptions for 5-nanometer and EUV to keep the CapEx intact?,61

Wei,,Executives,7,"You're asking about we'd only grow slightly, but CapEx did not decrease dramatically. Good question. We now become more conservative on CapEx. It's because of we forecast a slower -- a lower 5-nanometer's demand at the initial ramp. However, we still have to prepare enough capacity to support our customer. And we believe that today, with lower than a few hundred million U.S. dollar is to reflect the reality of expecting the high-end smartphone a little bit slower growth. But this year, this year is because of 7-nanometer's capacity has been good and that the demand -- actually, we forecast the number of the units of the smartphone, especially high-end smartphone, to be negative growth. Although we are -- I still want to say that for TSMC, the year-on-year from 2019 compared to 2018, the smartphone -- the mobile business, we still grow slightly on this year regardless of the unit is dropping, okay. And as a result, we expect -- as I just said, we expect the foundry business will be flat, but TSMC still grows slightly.",179
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2019",2019-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5356.0,1637895.0,64494485.0,Question,Randy Abrams,,Analysts,8,"Yes, one follow-up to that, and then I'll ask a second question. For that capital spending change you mentioned on EUV, could you talk now about kind of magnitude and steepness? Like what type of ramp we should expect next year for that node? And on the CapEx, are you making any consideration with the slower environment to reuse more equipment? So that's a follow-up to the first question.",69
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2019",2019-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5356.0,1637895.0,64494486.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,9,"Yes, we do expect that we, in the 5-nanometer, will use some of the 7-nanometer's equipment. To answer your question more correctly, actually, that why it's only dropped a little bit, a few hundred million U.S. dollar, because of an EUV tool, actually, we already buy a lot, all right? And we expect that one to continue to grow also. So the ramp-up of the 5-nanometer now definitely was slower than we expected, but we still think it's a long-lasting node because of all our customer who are using 7-nanometer today are engaged with TSMC today in their product design. So -- and in addition to that, we also increased our product portfolio, our customers' product portfolio. And that will be -- add something to HPC application. So look, it's not a blurry promise in this year, but we still have the confidence that 5% to 10% CAGR will be sustained.",151

I'll change -- the second question, but I'll follow up one more. For the 5-nanometer, if you could just talk a little bit more what's driving some of the change in consideration, if it's anything about the EUV readiness versus cost structure, mature 7 versus 5. Maybe if you can go into if now you expect a bigger 7 initially and what the factor for that is.",68

Wei,,Executives,11,"Let's talk about EUV's readiness. We are progressing really well. So that's why I said the 7+, which are using the EUV, was started -- will start the production in second quarter this year. And our 5-nanometer's technology development, a lot are based on the EUV's progress. And 5-nanometer's technology development is on track. So that's one thing. And why we draw down our CapEx is because of we expect the high-end smartphones' growth will not be as strong as we used to project before, okay? We're already down a little bit, but still, we still see that the high-end smartphone will grow is because of 5G and AI's application.",111

The second thing is 5G, it is here that increased a lot and frequency band, and so that will add the silicon content inside. I'll give you a kind of feeling that the smartphone unit will drop a few percentage, but TSMC will still grow the smartphone business.

And so if you look at the CapEx trend versus the depreciation trend, is there a different linearity because all of a sudden the tools you buy, I don't know, 10, 15 tools, need to be depreciated?",87

We start depreciated the tool when it gets into the productions. The depreciation pattern versus the CapEx changes is not linear, also because the -- whether the CapEx is front-end loaded, back-end loaded, also will impact the whole year depreciation. But I can tell you based on the USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion CapEx for this year, we expect the depreciation will increase by mid-single digit, which is versus last year was double digit, yes.

Wei,,Executives,81,"Well, I think the main reason is because of high-end smartphone seasonality. So that's -- and typically, Q1 is a low season for the high-end smartphone.

Next question I had was on N5, so just building on some of the other questions as well. So it is -- for many customers, it's going to be the first node with significant EUV insertion. So could you help us understand what is the feedback you're getting from customers? Are customers planning to stay on at N7 longer, given N7 has been a successfully proven node and as you mentioned a lot more customers are coming through there? Or do we expect to see the same number of tapeouts, like 50 tapeouts that you had by end of 2017? Are we going to be at similar kind of levels as we get into end of this year? Can you give us some idea about how that progress from our breadth of customer base is progressing in N5?",139

And you say that whether our customer are worried or have concern on EUV's readiness or the stability or those kind of things, no, they are happy with us. We worked with supplier, we worked with the customer on both side and our progress is so far, so good. Now whether that they want to move into N5 or stay in the 7, all I say is all the customer who are working with us on N7 are engaging with us at N5. The product, when they want to introduce into the market, that to our customer's judgment. Because N5 did offer very good performance per se as compared with N7. So some of the high-speed computing, some of the high-end smartphone, they still need to go into N5. So you would expect those customer will adopt the N5 immediately that when it is available, okay. So number of the tapeouts, I cannot tell you right now. But I already told you that all the customers are engaging with us.",190

You talked about fab location, right, it is -- as you know, we have -- when we build fab, we -- nowadays we only build the leading-edge fabs, that is we build -- we are doing 5-nanometer fabs preparation and we're building 3-nanometer. And the decision was made to building Tainan, okay, and of course, with across-the-board support from the local and administration here. Upon the trade tension, I think they appears that we will -- at this point, it seems that they have nudged that, ""Hey, is it good to build a fab in Taiwan?"" But actually, we have almost none request from our customer to change the plan we have. We -- but however, we do constantly assessing and deliberation about what's the pro and the cons of that plan and whether there are other options. But so far, we haven't changed our plan. The prime reason is this. When we ramp the leading-edge fabs, as you know, those are the, really, for the high-performance computing or smartphone launch, the ramp is very tight. Time-to-market is critical. And to have a leading-edge fab ramp, not only this fab has to be closely coupled with an R&D fab, which is in Hsinchu, the 2 teams almost work as 1 team, also this fab has to collaborate with other fabs in TSMC. As our founder mentioned, there are thousands of engineer transported from fab to fab to cope with the sudden ramp of those resources needed. So those are the background of those leading-edge fab. When we open book with our customers, this is the best sure way to ensure their product announcement and product launch, and the request conversation will take them back. But we're constantly watching this bigger geopolitical change, of course, but at this present time, we do not have plan to change that.",308

This is -- we, over the years -- I mean, right now probably is the -- in terms of technology portfolio, TSMC has built both leading edge and specialty. I think this is the strongest position at present time. You agree? And also about the customer engagement or customer portfolio, this time is about the widest customer portfolio we ever have. And C.C. is talking about getting into high-performance computings even to CPUs, including data center CPU, accelerators and the client CPUs. It's probably the widest addressable market we ever have. So we're going to continue this 3 thrusts. We're going to invest further on the R&D and we're going to continue to engage with our customers' design, closely build it as a team. Actually, we sent people to our customers to build the design of 5-nanometer, some of them on 3-nanometer discussion.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance of the second quarter.
First quarter revenue decreased 24.5% quarter-over-quarter as our business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand, also customers' inventory corrections and high-end smartphone seasonality and the photoresist defect material incident.
Due to lower level of capacity utilization and the negative impact from a photoresist defect material incident, gross margin decreased 6.4 percentage points sequentially to 41.3%. Total operating expenses decreased by about TWD 4.8 billion and they represented 11.9% of total net revenue in the first quarter. So operating margin decreased by 7.6 percentage points sequentially to 29.4%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was $2.37 and ROE for the first quarter was 14.4%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer technology accounted for 22% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, 10-nanometer was 4% and 16-nanometer was 16%. Advanced technologies, which we now define as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 42% of wafer revenue.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the first quarter, Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased 27%, 31%, 10% and 16%, respectively.
Now this is the last time we provide a revenue breakdown by application. From this quarter on, we will report revenue breakdown by platform as we believe this change will better represent the company's results.
Now let me explain how to read the table. The table shows the -- between the 4 application and 6 platforms how do they relate to each other. In general, within computer application, almost all revenue is from HPC. Within Communication, about 2/3 is from smartphone. HPC is about 1/5, and other platforms are single digit each. Consumer is mainly distributed between HPC and the digital consumer electronics whereas Industrial/Standard spread across all platforms, with smartphone and HPC each representing above 30%.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by platform for the first quarter. Smartphone decreased 33% to accounted for 47% of our first quarter revenue. HPC decreased 26% to accounted for 29%, while IoT, automotive, digital, consumer electronics and others accounted for 5% to 7% each.
Now I would like to move on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 760 billion, an increase of TWD 65 billion from the last quarter. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 38 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 8 days to 49 days, a sales decrease faster than average accounts receivable. Days of inventory increased 12 days to 79 days, reflecting 7-nanometer wafer prebuild and an increase in raw wafers.
Now let me take a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 153 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 76 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $77 billion and our overall cash balance increased $88 billion to reach $646 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditure was $2.46 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let me provide the second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be between USD 7.55 billion and USD 7.65 billion, which is a 7.1% sequential increase at mid point. Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.85, our first quarter gross margin is expected to be between 43% and 45%. Our first quarter operating margin is expected to be between 31% and 33%.
Also, in the second quarter, we will again need to accrue the 10% retained -- 10% tax on undisputed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be about 18%. The tax rate will then fall back to 10% level in the third and fourth quarter and the full year tax rate will be about 12%.
This concludes my remark. Let me follow by making a few comments about the profitability, CapEx and cash dividend.
First, let me talk about the profitability in the first and second quarter. Our first quarter gross margin declined by 6.4 percentage points sequentially as our 7-nanometer saw a substantial cutback in utilization in first quarter due to high-end smartphone seasonality, which impacted our gross margin by close to 4 percentage points. In addition, the photo material -- photoresist material incident impact our gross margin by about 2.6 percentage points as we indicated in our press release in February.
I have just guided second quarter gross margin to improve by 2.7 percentage points sequentially at the midpoint. Since most of the wafer scrapped in first quarter due to the photoresist incident will be made up in second quarter, gross margin can improve by about 1.5 percentage point in this quarter. In addition, the 7-nanometer dilution in second quarter, as compared to fourth quarter '18, will be close to 3 percentage point, which is about 1 percentage points improvement from the first quarter in terms of dilution. And we also expect a slight improvement in other nodes' utilization rate.
Our gross margin in first and second quarter are primarily impacted by a lower capacity utilization rate. As our business and utilization rate improves in the second half of this year, we believe about 50% is still a target for our gross margin going forward.
Now I will talk about the CapEx outlook. We reiterate our 2019 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion. About 80% of the CapEx budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies. As I have stated before, we see our CapEx forecast between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion to support our average growth rate of 5% to 10% per annum in the next few years.
My last comment is about the cash dividend distribution. In the future, TSMC intend to return about 70% of free cash flow to shareholder every year by distributing quarterly dividends. TSMC also remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
In June, TSMC will hold the annual shareholder meeting to approve the Board's proposed TWD 8 cash dividend per share for the full year of 2018. And the shareholder meeting will also approve the revision of the articles of incorporation to adopt quarterly dividends. Subject to the approval by the annual shareholder meeting, the Board plans to approve TWD 2 cash dividend per share for the first quarter 2019 and to be paid in the fourth quarter 2019. Therefore, TSMC's shareholder will receive a total of TWD 10 per share cash dividend in 2019. That also means, in 2020, shareholders will receive at least TWD 10 per share cash dividend for the whole year.
That concludes my remark. Let me turn the podium to C.C.",1184
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5061.0,1701980.0,66930565.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 280.7 billion or USD 7.1 billion, in line with our revised guidance. Our business in the first quarter was impacted by 3 factors: first, the overall global economic condition, which dampened the end market demand; second, customers are ongoing inventory adjustment; and third, the high-end mobile product seasonality. Meanwhile, the net effect from the photoresist defect material incident also impact our first quarter revenue by about 3.5%.
Moving into second quarter this year. While the economic factor and mobile product seasonality still linger, we believe we may have passed the pattern of the cycle of our business as we are seeing customers' demand stabilizing.
Based upon customer indications for their business and wafer loading in second quarter, we also expect our customers' overall inventory to be substantially reduced and approach the seasonal level around the middle of this year.
In the second half of this year, TSMC's business will be supported by this year's inventory base as well as strong demand from our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology, which support high-end smartphone new product launches, initial 5G deployment and HPC-related applications. For the whole year of 2019, we forecast the overall semiconductor market is good in memory as well as foundry growth to both be flattish. For TSMC, we reiterate that we expect to grow slightly in 2019.
Now let me update the photoresist material incident. On February 15, in order to ensure quality of wafer delivery, TSMC announced it will scrap a large number of wafers as a result of a batch of bad photoresist material from a chemical supplier. This batch of photoresist contain a foreign polymer that created a desirable -- undesirable effect and resulted in yield deviation on 12- and 16-nanometer wafers at Fab 14B.
We have since taken corrective action to enhance our defenses and minimize future risk. Our actions including the following: improved TSMC's own in-house incoming material, conforming test and controls; upgrade control and methodology with all suppliers for incoming material quality certification; establish robust in-line and off-line monitoring process to prevent defect escape.
Now I'll talk about our N5 status. Our N5 technology development is well on track. N5 has entered risk production in first quarter, and we expect customer tape-outs starting this quarter and volume production ramp in first half of 2020. With 1.8X logic density and 15% speed gain and an ARM A72 core compared with 7-nanometer, we believe our N5 technology is the most competitive in the industry. With the best density performance, power and the best transistor technology, we expect most of our customers who are using 7-nanometer today will adopt 5-nanometer. With N5, we are expanding our customer product portfolio and increasing our addressable market. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will also be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I'll talk about the ramp-up of N7 and N7+ and introduction of N6. We are seeing strong tape-out activity at N7, which include HPC, IoT and automotive. Meanwhile, our N7+, which adopts EUV for few critical areas, has already started volume production now. The yield rate is comparable to N7. We'll reaffirm N7 and N7+ will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in year 2019.
As we continue to improve our 7-nanometer technology and by leveraging the EUV landing form, N7+, we now introduce N6 process. N6 has 3 major advantage. First, N6 have 100% compatible design rules with N7, which allows customer to directly migrate from N7-based design, which substantially shorten the time-to-market. Second, N6 can deliver 18% higher logical density as compared to N7 and provide customer with a highly competitive performance-to-cost advantage. Third, N6 will offer shortened cycle time and better defect density. Risk production of N6 is scheduled to begin in first quarter year 2020 with volume production starting before the end of 2020.
Now let me talk about our advanced packaging technology. TSMC's advanced packaging strategy focuses on providing advanced wafer level system integration technologies to meet customers' product needs. Currently, we have offered InFO and CoWoS for several generation and recently introduced SoIC. We believe heterogenous integration and package endeavor has become a clear trend for many applications. All our advanced packaging platforms and our efficient system level integration, and will continue to do so.
Our fourth generation InFO solutions provide a final interconnected line with anticipation to enable both mobile and HPC products.
CoWoS continue to see good growth momentum in demand from HPC and the AI applications as we continue to expand beyond the radical size. We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which is an industry-leading 3D-IC packaging solution. We target to start production in 2021 time frame.
The traction of our advanced packaging solution has been strong in mobile and HPC segment and we have seen inquiry from automotive segment as well. We therefore believe our advanced packaging solutions will contribute to our business growth for years to come.
Finally, I will talk about the HPC as our most important growth driver in the next 5 years. CPU, AI accelerator and networking will be the main growth area for our HPC platform. With the successful ramp of N7, N7+ and the upcoming N6 and N5, we are able to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market to support applications such as data center, PC and tablets. Meanwhile, we also see networking querying thanks to 5G infrastructure deployment over the next few years. We are truly excited about our growth opportunities in HPC.
Thank you for your attention.",945

I think in the last conference call, C.C., you mentioned that TSMC will be initially building a few percentage points or some lower capacity on 5-nanometer in 2020 compared to 7-nanometer. Now that you have more visibility into your customers' plans, could you let us know what does that mean? Is it 30% lower, 10% lower? What does it mean? And why is that? Is it because customer is a little bit hesitant to go to 5-nanometer and has other options? Or you just believe that, like you previously mentioned, the only reason is that high-end smartphone demand expectation, you're taking a more cautious view on that? That's my first question.",119

Wei,,Executives,20,"Actually, Gokul, I like your last sentence, you say that's more cautiously. Let me repeat again that we say N5's the initial ramp, it might be slower than the N7. First, we learned a lesson from the N7's wafer loading. Look at this year, so first quarter and second quarter right now, it's actually very low so we learned a lesson. So we are working with the customer to be more cautiously and effectively manage the capacity ramping, so that's what I said that it will be a little bit slow. But that being said, the N5's business, I want to reassure everybody that N5 as a business will grow bigger than N7 because our expanding the product portfolio, and you know what I mean. In the HPC, we have very good opportunities and on the smartphone we are gaining the market share. So I will believe that N5 initial ramp probably a little bit more cautiously slower than the N7, but it will pick up quickly.",167

Got it. My second question is on the technology leadership. I think TSMC clearly now seems to be ahead of even IDMs in terms of technology leadership. How should we think about how that translates in a financial basis? What we've seen in semiconductor industry in the last several years is when one player becomes the dominant player, typically, margins go up. How should we think about this? What is TSMC's philosophy in terms of utilizing this technology leadership? Are we looking for higher than market revenue growth or we should expect structurally higher margins in the future years now that we are kind of getting through the smartphone saturation period and getting into HPC?",116

Wei,,Executives,28,"Well, that's a good question. We did some calculation by ourselves. We still think that cost per transistor is still decreasing, but not as fast as it used to be. That's one thing. As you mentioned about the EUV, today, we put the EUV into mass production already, and we learned some kind of experience so that we can introduce N6. But is EUV productivity is very good already? Not yet. We expect it to continue to improve every year, just as we did for the emerging photolithography. So we expect in the future that EUV will offer a best tool in terms of cost, in terms of technologies moving forward, but not today yet. There's still a lot of process complexity, so we're using the EUV to replace some of the very critical areas and the cost are probably equal today. And in the future, we hope it will improve. Once it improve, the cost per transistor will decrease faster.",161

N6 compared with the N7 is only 18. So you can see there's a big difference in that logic density and transistor performance also. And so as a result, the total power consumption in the chip is lower in the N5. And also that -- there's a lot of benefit if you move into N5. But nevertheless, N5 is one of the node, full node, and it takes time for the customer to design their new product. The beauty of the N6 is they're already designing N7. They spend a way minimal effort. They can move into the N6 and gain some benefit. And so some of the customer that depend on their product as characteristic in their market, they are define which one go to N6, which one go to N5.",165

Okay. Rick, the 79 is really high, but there's a good reason for that. Because we anticipated 7-nanometer capacity will be very tight in the second half. It's not so tight. It's very empty in first half. So we're trying to preview some of the inventory for our customer in work in process. So they will not be constrained by our second half capacity. So by doing so, that work in process value will certainly go up, right? So when we move in the second half, when we digest those inventory and demand start to pick up, our days of inventory will come down in the second half.",109

And management also guided previously that the next couple of years, smartphone growth will be mid-single digit. Again, it's also higher than the smartphone shipment growth in our view.

The reason I try to dig down a bit further is that if the content growth which means that, that will be at expense of the smartphone cost structures. So you have higher content growth, which means that semi content in terms of cost structure is higher, which at the end of the day will dampen the smartphone shipment as price elastic. So how do you -- we've foreseen very, very strong content growth, which means that the cost structure for your customer will be much higher at the end of the day. So there will be certain trade-off at the end of the day.",107

My second question is more for Lora. So can you somehow help us to quantify the margin impact in 2020 as we can expect like very high -- very quick ramp-up for the 5-nanometer, which naturally, in the first year, there will be the negative margin impact. And we will come into this third year of 7-nanometer, so the margin negative impact should be less, but you have new margin negative 0.5. So how do we -- can we get some color on it?",85

Number one, introduction of new technology as you just mentioned. Usually, in the first year, there's a dilution to corporate gross margin. The other factor is utilization on each technology node, particularly the advanced technology node is more sensitive to utilization. So if we look at a corporate margin, have to take consideration of both. But if we just talk about the leading-edge introductions, N5 will be like N7. It will have some dilution next year. And so we have indicated before, it takes 7 or 8 quarters to reach to corporate level. We believe N5 will follow same pattern.",107

Wei,,Executives,85,"Right. The question is about N6. Looks like N6 is behind the N5 in terms of schedule. So what is application? Well, again, I want to reiterate that N6 is coming from the N7, N7+ experience, learning. And so the N6, if you -- a lot of customer are already entering N7 with a lot of tapeout. So N6 provide them a very good task that they can easily put in their current product into N6. So gain the benefit of either the performance, the tie area and also the shortened cycle time. N5 is a totally new node. So you enter into a very new area. If you start to design the N5 today as compared with you want to enter the N6 with the N7 already in your pocket, I think the N6 will be much easier. I cannot say that N5 is very difficult, but TSMC will help you to move into N5, of course. But you look at the effort that you view the ecosystem. Ecosystem is the one that's very important for all the product company want to design their new product. N7's ecosystem has been very complete. We even offer to the automotive grid, okay? And not to mention about mobile HPC, everything. The ecosystem are ready and equally mature with N6. Because we're 100% compatible. Of course, you still have to do some modification. If you want to shrink your dye, you had to rerun your timing, closure, those kind of things. But still much easier from N7 go to N6 rather than N7 go to N5.

Wei,,Executives,103,"Well, I would like to say that probably below seasonal level, but we -- it's too early for us. We don't have enough data to do all the analysis and too early for us to forecast accurately, say, how many days or below or above, all right? But we make our own judgment from the wafer loading and the past histories data. So we make our own calculation, so we observe that their inventory is greatly reduced in the second quarter. We are confident actually that in the middle of this year, we will be very close to the seasonal level.",101

I remember it was slight growth without crypto. Now it is high single digit, so also about 5 percent point higher.

I think last time, we mentioned N7+ could be about $1 billion or slightly higher than that of revenue in 2019. Are we still seeing that or customers are still staying on N7 for this year?",43
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5061.0,1701980.0,66930681.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,118,"We are ramping up N7+ right now, but the revenue for this year is still a little bit less than $1 billion. And as I just mentioned, next year is that one we try to look at it. I will believe most of the customers will adopt the N6 because that's much easier for them to move into. And the benefit almost the same as N7+. So I will say N7+ this year, a little bit below $1 billion. Next year, it probably won't grow, but N6 will start to pick up.",92

That's very clear. My second question, Dr. Wei, could you explain a little bit more on what you encompass when you talk about heterogeneous integration? I think some of your customers have talked about packaging multiple process technologies in the same package. I think some of the customers' forward-running researchers even talked about multiple process in the same wafer. Could you talk a little bit about what is TSMC's vision when we -- when it comes to heterogeneous integration maybe in the next couple of years since you're starting to showcase the technology and potentially going to production?",99
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5061.0,1701980.0,66930683.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,120,"Oh, that -- it very complex question to be answered. Actually, while working with the customer and -- the different customer has a different need, but the trend on the heterogeneous integration is what we believe that what we -- the few -- the future that a lot of customer will adopt. But because of the benefit that when the circuit at some speed now is limited by the connection from the chip to chip, connection chip to chip is communication. So that has to be shortened and -- to gain the benefit of your single chip as high performance. So you want to put them together. You better to reserve your signal's integrity. You better has a very minimal capacitance, minimal inductance, minimal loss in the resistance. So we -- that's what I say heterogeneous integration become important because we are using the InFO. We are using the CoWoS to help our customer to integrate all of them together with the most efficient way to connect all the chip together and also extending if you need high bandwidth module, that would be one of the benefits that using TSMC's CoWoS or InFO. And -- so if you ask me what is the application in the future, HPC will be the one that adopt this kind of process. That's the first one to go into. But of course, today, mobile smartphone already adopted the InFO technology as you knew already. And more and more of the high-end smartphone and more and more of the HPC's customer will adopt TSMC's advanced packaging method, including heterogeneous integration.",265

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon.  My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter and followed by the guidance of the third quarter.
Our second quarter revenue increased 10.2% quarter-over-quarter as we already passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and began to see demand increases. Gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points sequentially to 43% mainly due to the absence of photoresist defect material incident and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate. Total operating expenses represented 11.2% of net revenue, lower than 11.9% in the first quarter. Operating margin increased by 2.3 percentage points sequentially to 31.7%. Overall, our second quarter's EPS was $2.57, and ROE was 16.2%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology accounted for 21% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, 10-nanometer was 3%, and 16-nanometer was 23%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 47% of wafer revenue, up from 42% in the first quarter.
Now let's talk about the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to accounted for 45% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 23% to accounted for 32%. IoT increased 15% to accounted for 8%. Automotive increased 3% to accounted for 5%. Digital consumer electronics and others went down slightly, accounted for 8% (sic) [ 6% ] or 4% each of our wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 765 billion, an increase of TWD 4 billion from the last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by 220 -- TWD 244 billion as we accrued about TWD 259 billion for 2018 and for first quarter 2019. 2018 cash dividend of TWD 8 per share will be paid today. And the first quarter 2019 dividend of TWD 2 per share will be paid out in October. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivables turnover days decreased 7 days to 42 days. Days of inventory decreased 3 days to 76 days primarily due to lower days in work-in-progress inventories and finished goods, both of which resulted from higher shipments out of inventories built in first quarter '19.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 118 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 116 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 1.4 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 4 billion to TWD 650 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditure was USD 3.75 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect third quarter revenue to be between USD 9.1 billion and USD 9.2 billion, which is an 18% sequential increase at the midpoint.  Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31.0, gross margin is expected to be between 46% and 48%. Operating margin is expected to be between 35% and 37%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about profitability, CapEx and the cash dividend.
First, about profitability. Let me make some comments on our second quarter and third quarter and our overall profitability outlook. Our second quarter '19 gross margin improved by 1.7 percentage points sequentially mainly due to the absence of the photoresist material incident from first quarter and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate. The reason second quarter revenue is slightly above the high end of our guidance but gross margin is at the low end is because the pace of cost improvement at N7 did not meet our plan in second quarter. But we expect costs to gradually improve towards the plan starting from the third quarter. We have just guided third quarter '19 gross margin to improve by 4 percentage points sequentially at the midpoint mainly as we expect a higher level of overall capacity utilization.
Our gross margin in first half '19 was primarily impacted by a low capacity utilization rate. But as our business and utilization rate improved in the second half of this year, we believe about 50% is still a good target for our gross margin going forward.
Now regarding 2019 CapEx planning. At the end -- at the beginning of this year, we have guided our 2019 CapEx budget to be between USD 10 billion and USD 11 billion. However, over the last 3 months, we have seen an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. We believe this will lead to an increase in demand for our 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies beyond the level we forecasted 3 months ago. We are, therefore, working closely with our customers on the most effective capacity planning for our N5 and N7. We expect our 2019 CapEx is likely to exceed the high end of our guidance range. We are currently evaluating our 2019 CapEx plans and expect to provide you a more detailed update during our October earnings conference.
The last comment is about the cash dividend distribution. We have communicated our dividend policy earlier this year. We will have sustainable cash dividend per share on both an annual and a quarterly basis. In addition, as our free cash flow increase, we will distribute about 70% of our free cash flow as cash dividend. TSMC's AGM in June approved the Board's approval of TWD 8 cash dividend per share and full year -- for full year 2018 and the revision of the Article of Incorporation to adapt quarterly dividends. The Board then approved TWD 2 per share dividend for the first quarter 2019 which will be distributed in October 2019. Therefore, TSMC's shareholder will receive a total of TWD 10 cash dividend per share this year. That also means shareholder will receive at least TWD 10 per share cash dividend for 2020. Going forward, TSMC has set the payment months for the quarterly dividend as January, April, July and October of each year.
This concludes my remarks. Now I would like to turn to C.C. Wei for his comments.",1036

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
Let me start with the near-term demand and inventory. We conclude our second quarter with revenue of TWD 241 billion or USD 7.75 billion, slightly above our guidance due to a higher demand from HPC and IoT applications as compared to the time when we gave guidance. Although our business continue to be impacted by the softer overall global economic condition, customer inventory management and high-end mobile product seasonality, we have also passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and began to see demand increasing.
Moving into third quarter this year. TSMC's business will be driven by new product launches of premium smartphones, the acceleration of 5G development and the increasing adoption of our industry-leading 7-nanometer node by high-performance computing applications.
Now let's talk about the inventory. Our fabless customers' overall inventory is being gradually digested throughout second quarter. We expect it to reduce to several days above seasonal level exceeding the second quarter, leading to an improved inventory environment for the second half of this year. Although a soft global economic condition and trade uncertainties remain, we expect our business to be much stronger in the second half as compared with the first half of this year due to the strong demand for our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology solutions.
The progress of our advanced technologies were on track, and we are very confident in our technology leadership. Over the last 3 months, we have seen an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This would speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network and smartphones in several major markets around the world. We expect this to lead to an increase in demand for our 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies. And we are working closely with our customers to carefully plan out capacity to meet their demand, as our CFO just said.
Now I will talk about the N5 status and N3 development. Our N5 technology has already entered risk production in first quarter. Customer tapeout activity are underway, and volume production is scheduled in first half of the year 2020 with 80% logic density gain, 8-0 percent, and 15% speed compared with the 7-nanometer, we believe our N5 technology is the most advanced in the foundry industry with the best density performance, power and transistor technology. Our 5-nanometer technology solution will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution until our 3-nanometers arrives. We are confident that our 5-nanometer will have a strong ramp and be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
On N3, the technology development progress is going well, and we are already engaging with the early customers and the technology definition. We expect our 3-nanometer technology to further extend our leadership position well into the future.
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the progress of N6. We have seen very strong demand at N7 across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC and IoT applications. Meanwhile, our N7+, which adapts EUV for a few critical layers, has already entered volume production. We expect our customers' end products using N7+ will be in the market in high volume this quarter. We expect strong demand to continue into next year.
N6 provide a clear migration path for second-wave N7 products as its design are 100% compatible with N7 while providing 18% logic density gain and performance to cost advantage. N6 will use more EUV layer than N7+. N6 risk production is scheduled to begin in first quarter year 2020 with customer product tapeouts in second half 2020. The volume production starts before the end of year 2020. 
We reaffirm N7, N7+ will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in this year. And we expect even higher percentage in next year on N7, N7+ and N6 because development of 5G accelerates and demand from HPC, mobile and other applications continue to grow.
Now let me talk about TSMC's competitiveness. The foundry business model has proven to be the most efficient model in the semiconductor industry. As a pure-play dedicated foundry, we collaborate and work closely together with our customers to unleash their innovation to the market and enable their success. We do not have any internal products, and we do not compete with customers.
Within foundry, TSMC competes on technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customers' trust. Our trinity of strength enables us to be everyone's foundry. We have the most useful and robust technology offering across both advanced and specialty technologies. We work diligently to protect our customers' technology, extend our leadership and accelerate our technology differentiation. We are the world's largest entrusted provider of logic capacity with an excellent manufacturing track record. We will continue to unleash innovations for all our customers for years to come.
Finally, I'll talk about our CFO transition. After serving very well as TSMC's CFO for the past 16 years, Lora Ho will take on a new challenge as Head of Europe and Asia sales. Subject to the Board of Directors' approval, Wendell Huang will become TSMC's new CFO effective September 1. Wendell have been with TSMC for 20 years and have served as TSMC's Deputy CFO and Head of Finance Division. He brings a wealth of experience and knowledge of TSMC, and I am confident he will continue the strong tradition of TSMC's finance organization. I'm excited about both appointments and look forward to continue to work closely with both Lora and Wendell in their new roles. 
Thank you for your attention.",916

On the gross margin, if you can elaborate just a bit more on what were the triggers for the slower progress on gross margin. As it seems uncharacteristic for TSMC at least recently to have a bit of impact on process ramp-up. And then looking forward on the 50%, if you still expect that target toward the end of this year and if looking into next year, as you ramp up 5 and normally have a 2- to 3-point impact, if you still expect 50% reasonable for next year?",109

There's a lot of new tapeout. So in second quarter, we have set a goal, but we did not achieve the goal. That is why, as I've explained earlier, the margin fall into the low end of the guidance. As I said earlier, we have -- back on track to gradually improve productivity and with the volume continue to come in third and fourth quarter. And we are still confident we can achieve our cost reduction and productivity target. As to the 50% gross margin, I think for the whole year, I think the main reason is the lower utilization particularly in the first half of the year. As I've said, if we can maintain the high utilizations, which we believe we can, the 50% is still a good target going forward.",161

IoT is very strong although it's very small as a basis. And we also see automotive coming up to grow. It was kind of low in the first half of the year, okay?

Wei,,Executives,25,"All right. The effect of Huawei being the Entity List and impact to TSMC, we do see some impact but not direct business between Huawei and TSMC and to the HiSilicon and TSMC because we are -- we already announced that we continue our shipping practice. Because we follow the law, so we continue to ship. The infrastructure -- actually, the 5G's development actually accelerate, and we see a very strong demand from that. And as I said in my statement, in many countries, that they speed up the 5G deployment, and we see the increase of the demand at our leading-edge 7-nanometer.",103

So yes, it seems that, for example, being in the Entity List,  Huawei still has some discretion to update, for example, Google's mobile service. And that has impact their overseas smartphone demand. And according to your breakdown, the smartphone business still can see single-digit Y-o-Y growth, right? So I'm wondering, have you discount the potential downside risk if that Entity List issue is going to last longer.",68

Of course, the second half, there are still a lot of uncertainties, right, the geopolitical part, trade policy changes still go with the time. But I think the second half, the biggest growth momentum comes from the new smartphone launches. On Huawei's factors, yes, we think we did the discount. But Huawei -- since Huawei's been, many things happens, too. The downside is generally the smartphone market becoming uncertain in addition to Huawei themselves. So the whole Huawei -- whole smartphone market is suppressed, I think. And secondly is the trade barrier. Trade uncertainties still prevail in all sectors. So from all sectors, particularly the industrial and the consumer, I think that we will still see the momentum still coming -- not coming back. And -- but of course, the 5G momentum picking up, that is also new for the world globally, in U.S., in China, in Korea, in Japan and so forth. So those all factors combined, we think we try to make the best judgment and think that's the conclusion C.C. just delivered.",182

That's very helpful. And my next question is to Lora. It's going to be a tough question before you transfer to another role. So a follow-up in this -- Randy's question, right? So compare your third quarter revenue scale versus the revenue scale in the first quarter 2018, that quarter you made 50% gross margin, right? So that means you have a higher scale, but the gross margin, I think, is 3 percentage point or 4 percentage points than that quarter, right? So I'm asking you whether there's any structural issue. And also, more specifically, your 7-nanometer is in the second year, right? So supposedly, it shouldn't cause the -- any margin dilution anymore, especially you are saying that 7-nanometer fab is quite busy, right? So can you explain why revenue scale is higher, fab is busy, second year of the new nodes, but gross margin's low a few quarters ago.",152

Of course, there is still some dilution for N7, but this dilution will start diminishing as we have much strong demand in the second half, okay? Another thing is there's a little bit of a product mix issue. You do have -- we have portfolio of product mix. We have talked about this. There's certain technology is not -- surprisingly, is low. For example, 28-nanometer, that has some impact on our overall corporate margin. So those are the things I can think of that related to the margin changes, okay?",103

Could you, C.C., talk a little bit about a road map on 5-nanometer and especially your 3-nanometer? One of your competitors is looking to introduce a new infrastructure like gate-all-around. Is this going to stick with the FinFET and 3-nanometer as well? Or if it's also likely to move to a nanosheet or gate-all-around structure? That's my first question. 
Secondly, could we talk a little bit about what is the activity level TSMC is seeing at 5-nanometer capacity? I think previously, you've mentioned that 5-nano is seeing -- you're building the 5-nanometer capacity for next year. And could we also talk a little bit about how our customers are thinking in terms of choosing for 6-nanometer versus 5-nanometer especially the customers who are on 7-nanometer today?",144

Gokul, it seems -- I guess because you have a flu, so we didn't -- we can't really hear you quite well. But let me try to see if I understand your questions. First, your question is with regard to the competition within foundry. You asked whether we can compare our technology road map of 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer versus that of the competitors. And your second question is with respect to 5-nanometer where you asked that we seem to be a little bit more conservative about 5-nanometer capacity build plan some time ago, and now we are a bit more aggressive. And so you are asking us if we have seen any difference we see in customers' demand for 5-nanometer.",122

And what is the risk production right now and the volume production in the first half in the next year, these continue to be the same situation. And about the 3-nanometer, let me tell you about it a bit. We have evaluated all the possible options and come with a very good solution for our customer.

So I think there are some changes in terms of customer behavior. Typically, we somehow synchronize their production together with their sales. So if they have some problem in terms of the sales so they somehow change their production plan. There may be some time lag. But the last couple of months, we saw the feedback that customer is willing to be piling up more inventory, is willing to -- there are some disruption in terms of their sales in plan. But in terms of production plan, you don't really see a lot of meaningful changes at least for TSMC. So how do we forecast this kind of thing moving forward? It seems to me that the microenvironment seems so dynamic, but we have -- as analyst, we have a lot of difficulties, right? We can't just follow the tweets.

Carriers refer to a commercial end market or commercial after the 5G as more meaningful than consumer and handset. On the other hand, your customers'  companies highlight the opportunities in the smartphone. So as you plan for your capacity -- leading-edge capacity plans, it's a very long lead time. How do you think about 5G and its impact on consumer, which is more of a handset or smartphone versus a commercial aspect, which could have an impact on your HPC or other segment?",120

Wei,,Executives,86,"Well, actually, let me answer the question because 5G, what we expect is not only on the consumer products like a smartphone, per se. I do think that 5G will affect to every area in our platform. For example, without 5G, the autonomous driving will not be possible. So it's very important for automotive also. It's very important for the high-performance computing also because that's one of the networking process where everything is connected. 
It's also important for the IoT because that's where you connect all the data. And with -- the 5G is a multichannel with a voice [ latency ] with very high-speed and with the -- and all the data collection need to be analyzed. So I think in terms of 5G, the effect on the business and also on TSMC's capacity plan is enormous.

My first question is again on 7-nanometers. If I go back and look at TSMC for 28-nanometers, that was TSMC's most successful node of all time, and that coincided with the big smartphone ramp.

The majority, as I said, will be going to 6. As for 5, 5 would be adopted by a lot of platform, that's including the smartphone, the mobile, including the high performance computing. And let me see, what else? IoT, no, no. We do not see IoT yet. At the beginning, it will be mobile and HPC.",162

However, if you want to answer how can we solve the concern, it's not that simple. It's not building a fab outside Taiwan or any other country can solve that problem, yes? However, we are always open to build a fab in overseas, provided we can provide the same cost structure to our customers and to our investors. So far, in the U.S, we have talked to the industry and to see whether that is a viable approach, is a good approach to our customers, given the cost differences and if given by the -- in addition to the local subsidies. But still, it's -- current supply from Taiwan is still the best solution for our customers. So we are open to that, but we are not in a hurry to make a decision. Of course, we also see some unproductive facility overseas. We don't want to increase the excess capacity for the industry. Therefore, the possible -- in addition, the approach of building a greenfield fab acquisition is probably -- is better for the industry. That's our current consideration.

So first of all, it's about the smartphone sili content increase. Can you give us some color how much is that for this year? And also when 5G comes next year, because your remark was just very bullish about the 5G smartphone contribution next year. How would the 5G smartphone to help on your sili content growth in the smartphones?",76
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5338.0,1775174.0,69474108.0,Answer,C.C. Wei,,Executives,182,"Okay. That's a good question, but it's very hard to identify what is the percentage of the silicon content increase. But let me give you some color a bit, all right? The first one is -- look at your smartphone today. It's 3-camera or 2-camera or even 4-camera. Look at that. And look at the pixel size, right? You might hear some of the pixel is a 48-megapixel. Lots of cameras come with silicon with it. So that's the silicon content, the first one. Actually, just some other minor things, so for example, power management IC. Now the power consumption is very important. So now every major component inside need the power management IC to come with it. One is screen driver. You need power management. The application process, you need power management. Just a lot of things. 
And furthermore, let me give you in terms of 5G. You have a lot of different channels. So now even the RF transceiver or RF Front End, the die size is bigger. That's why I say -- that's why silicon content is increasing. Did I answer your question? 
But how many percentage, actually, I cannot identify it.",195

That's fine. So next question, switching gears back to the gross margin, right? So we -- so my question is that for your leading-edge investment, do you feel like the payback period of those leading-edge investments are getting longer or shorter, right? Because I still want to find out some explanation why gross margin kind of declined year-over-year. So it could the leading-edge investments getting heavier, or there's a true price competition from your competitors. So I just want to get some thoughts from you on this topic.",89

I looked -- actually, personally, I don't a payback year means much. If you look at the various technologies -- actually, I checked this question. They look very much the same. We all know the payback year are very much the same. However, I think the ramp profile is very different and the sensitivity of utilization to margin is different. The more leading-edge is more sensitive to margin. So leading edge needs to have very high utilization to secure the margin. That's the key, and we are working on it, okay?",92

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the third quarter followed by the guidance for the current quarter. 
Third quarter revenue increased 21.6% quarter-over-quarter to TWD 293 billion, driven by new product launches, both in premium cellphone and high-performance computing applications using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology. 
Gross margin increased by 4.6 percentage points sequentially to 47.6%, mainly due to a solid improvement in capacity utilization. 
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.7% of net revenue compared to 11.2% in the second quarter due to better operating leverage. 
Operating margin increased by 5.1 percentage points sequentially to 36.8%. 
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 3.9 and ROE was 25.7%. 
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer technology saw very strong demand and accounted for 27% of wafer revenue in the third quarter. 10-nanometer was 2% and 16-nanometer was 22%. 
Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter. 
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by platform. All 4 of our growth platforms saw demand increases in the third quarter. Smartphone increased 33% quarter-over-quarter to account for 49% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 10% to account for 29%. IoT increased 35% to account for 9%. And automotive increased 20% to account for 4%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 585 billion, a decrease of TWD 180 billion from the second quarter, mainly as we distributed TWD 207 billion of cash dividends for 2018. 
On the liabilities side. Current liabilities decreased by TWD 127 billion quarter-over-quarter as we distributed 2018 cash dividend and accrued another TWD 65 billion or TWD 2.5 per share for the second quarter 2019 cash dividend and that will be paid in January of next year. 
On financial ratios. Accounts receivables turnover days decreased 1 day to 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 11 days to 65 days, reflecting higher wafer shipments during the quarter. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 142 billion of cash from operations, spent TWD 98 billion in capital expenditures and distributed TWD 207 billion of cash dividend. As a result, our overall cash balance decreased by TWD 197 billion to TWD 452 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures was $3.14 billion. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 10.2 billion and USD 10.3 billion, which is a 9% sequential increase at the midpoint. 
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.6, gross margin is expected to be between 48% and 50%. Operating margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. 
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about 2019 capital expenditures and TSMC's long-term financial objectives. 
I will first talk about our capital budget for this year. In TSMC, we build capacity according to our customers' demand. To forecast such demand, we take into consideration, not only from each individual customer's indication, but also our own forecast based on macro as well as market segment outlook. Given the stronger outlook for 5G deployment next year, the demand for our 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer has increased significantly in the last few months. 
We have, therefore, decided to raise our full year 2019 CapEx by USD 4 billion to meet this increased demand. We now expect our 2019 CapEx to be between USD 14 billion and USD 15 billion. About USD 1.5 billion of the USD 4 billion CapEx increase is for 7-nanometer capacity and $2.5 billion is for 5-nanometer capacity. 
Although we're not able to give you a formal guidance for our next year's CapEx until next January, we currently plan next year's CapEx to be somewhat similar to our revised 2019 CapEx. 
Now let me state our long-term financial objectives. As the company's new CFO, I'm happy to tell you that TSMC's long-term financial objectives remain the same. Our goal is to achieve revenue and net income CAGR in the next few years to be between 5% and 10% in U.S. dollar terms, gross margin to be about 50%, operating margin to be [ about ] 39% and ROE to be above 20%.
Regarding our cash dividend policy. We reiterate that we will distribute about 70% of free cash flow as cash dividend. More importantly, TSMC is committed to a sustainable cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis. 
Now I will turn the microphone to C.C.",807

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. 
We conclude our third quarter, just reported by CFO, with revenue of TWD 293 billion or USD 9.4 billion, that is slightly above our guidance due to better demand from smartphone-related applications in our forecast 3 months ago. 
Moving into fourth quarter this year, we expect demand from both smartphone and high-performance computing-related applications will continue to increase, thanks to our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology that powers these applications. 
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory is being gradually [ digested ] throughout the third quarter. We now expect it will reduce to a few days above seasonal level exceeding third quarter and approach seasonal level by the end of this year. 
For the full year of 2019, we forecast both the overall semiconductor market [ excluding ] memory and the foundry segment to decline by a low single-digit from the year 2018 level. However, we continue to expect TSMC to do better and achieve a slight annual growth. 
Now let me talk about the progress and development of 5G. 5G will drive AI applications and bring many benefits to the market. Performance will be greatly improved with data transmission speed up to 10x faster as compared to 4G network. In addition, 5G latency will have about a 90% reduction as compared to 4G, allowing for real-time response and control. The benefit from 5G will unlock new use cases such as AR, VR, real-time translation and high-quality gaming, to name a few. We believe smartphone OEMs will come out with many more innovative application to take advantage of the 5G infrastructure. 
Since the middle of this year, we have been seeing an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This will speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network and smartphone in several major market around the world, which leads to the increase of our CapEx for this year. We expect a faster ramp of 5G smartphones as compared to 4G with the penetration rate of 5G smartphones to reach mid-teens percentage of the total smartphone market in 2020. 
Meanwhile, we expect the silicon content of 5G smartphones will be substantially higher than that of 4G smartphones. That is due to increasing functionalities and additional ICs for more camera, RF circuit, modem, power management IC, et cetera. 
Power efficient, speed and ability to incorporate additional functionality are critically important to 5G smartphones, which require TSMC's leading-edge technology and will continue to fuel our growth for the next several years. 
Now I will talk about our N5 and N3 status. Our N5 technology has already entered risk production with good yield. The N5 will adopt the EUV extensively and is well on track for volume production in the first half of next year. With 80%, 8-0, logic density gain and about a 20% speed gain compared with the 7-nanometer, our N5 technology is a true full node [ straight ] from our N7. We believe it will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best density, performance and power until our 3-nanometer arrives. 
With N5, we are further expanding our customer product portfolio and increasing our addressable market. The initial ramp will be driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We are confident that 5-nanometer will have a strong ramp and be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Now I will talk about the N3. We are working with customers on N3 and the technology development progress is going well. Our N3 will be another full node from our N5 with speedier gain similar to the gain from N7 to N5. We expect our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. 
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6. Today, we are completing our second year ramp of N7. We continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile HPC and IoT applications. Our N7+ is industry's first commercially available EUV lithography technology. 
N7+ provides 15% to 20% higher density with improved power consumption when compared to N7 and is already in high volume production with yields similar to N7. We expect the strong demand for N7+ continue into next year and are increasing CapEx to meet this demand for multiple customers. 
Now N6. Our N6 provides a clear migration path for the second-wave N7 product [ activities ] and rollout 100% compatible with N7 while providing 18% logic density gain with performance-to-cost advantage. The N6 uses 1 more EUV layer than N7+. N6 risk production is scheduled to begin in first quarter next year with volume production starting before the end of 2020. 
We reaffirm that 7-nanometer will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in 2019 and we expect even higher percentage in 2020 due to worldwide development of 5G accelerates while demand from HPC, mobile and other applications continue to grow. 
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's advanced packaging business. Our advanced packaging solutions and network system integration with wafer network process allowing seamless integration of front-end wafer process and back-end chip packaging. The solution consists of CoWoS, InFO, System on Integrated Chips or SoIC and the Wafer on Wafer or WoW. We are seeing strong momentum for CoWoS and InFO for HPC applications as we continue to enlarge the integrated chip area to about -- to above 2 reticle size in 1 module. 
We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which is an industry-leading 3D-IC packaging solution. SoIC enables 3D integration of multiple chips in close proximity to deliver the best possible performance, power and form factor.

Wanted to ask the first question given the high CapEx for this year and next year, if you could talk about the capital requirements for 5-nanometer in EUV. Maybe how the equation with EUV coming in, how does that affect the capital intensity, or say, the CapEx per 1,000 wafers? And how do you see this node in terms of pricing and maintaining the same level of profitability on prior nodes?",75

If you're getting some benefits that it's actually lowering that. But given that CapEx is still the same, you're seeing the higher CapEx per 1,000? And then how does that translate into profitability? How you expect 5 to compare to, say, some of the prior nodes?",58

But definitely, CapEx per 1,000 for 5 is certainly higher than previous nodes. However, if we combined everything together, as we stated at the beginning, we're still seeing our profit -- structure profitability remains the same.",44

I'll ask one follow-up to that and then a second question. I guess this year, like second half strong demand, leading-edge [ type ], the gross margin guidance for fourth quarter is still -- it's a good margin, but it's 48% to 50%, and I think the target's going to hit 50%. So maybe if there's still a little bit of drag on the margin? 
And with next year bringing in a new node 5, if you think you can get to that 50% for next year. That's just a follow-up.",92

For the fourth quarter, it's just like we stated all along for our structural profitability. When we reach 90% of utilization, we target to reach 50% of gross margins. 
For next year, it's still early to say, but structural profitability -- profitability or margins may be affected by the ramp in a 5-nanometer as at the beginning of ramping of every nano -- technology nodes, it will somehow be affected. However, if the utilization is good, then we're still expecting to see that structural profitability continues.",87

The second question I wanted to ask, because you had a strong third quarter recovery, guiding another good fourth quarter, as you look to maybe an early look at next year, how should we think about seasonality? There's some concerns before 5G ramps we have a correction on 4G. And then we have if the tariffs hit, we might have had some [ prebuild ]. So how do you see kind of early year risk of, say, a correction? And can you pull in some demand, say if capacity's tight, to maybe mitigate the magnitude of correction early in the year?",102

Wei,,Executives,12,"You're talking about the seasonality of smartphone, that we observe almost every year, and so I don't expect next year to be dramatically different. However, we did see some of the 5G smartphones, the gross momentum is higher than we expected. So I would expect next year's seasonality is not so strong as we observed for this year.

So just wanted to kind of narrow down a little bit on the 5% to 10% growth, which is still kind of -- the kind of growth that we were expecting when we were spending TWD 10 billion to TWD 11 billion. So could you give a little bit more details or maybe narrow down the forecast a little bit more for us? Because if we say a TWD 14 billion to TWD 15 billion range of CapEx, that's closer to the high 30s, 40% CapEx [ in the vicinity ], higher than our previous range.",125

Wei,,Executives,15,"Gokul, let me answer the question carefully. Let's say that TSMC always build capacity, working closely with customer and to meet their demand. That's our number one, okay? We discuss with the customer on their demand, we make our judgment also. Now we are increasing the CapEx quite a lot, no doubt about it. But then, that's due to some of the reasons I can foresee for the future. First, the 5G's ramp-up is much faster than 4G as we expected. Second, TSMC actually is expanding our customer portfolio, and in the same time, we're also expanding our product portfolio. And so put all the factors together, we have a good reason that we increase our CapEx this year and probably next year.",123

So that basically suggests that 5% to 10% is not the growth for the next couple of years. But maybe just given the higher growth in 5G and accelerated build-out, could you talk a little bit about going into next year, do you expect 5G and smartphone to be the main growth driver? Or do you feel that HPC momentum is going to be even faster than smartphone given that some of your customers are starting to take a lot of market share?",84

So just a follow-up question. I think at the beginning of the year, we had a more conservative view on 5-nanometer build-out. Obviously, that view has changed. So just to calibrate, should we expect now that 5-nanometer revenues next year are likely to be higher than, let's say, 7-nanometer last year, first year of ramp of 7-nanometer?",58

But let me say that now we have more optimistic than 6 months ago. 6 months ago, I believed what I said is that we will be very careful and a little bit conservative in building the 5-nanometer capacity.

Wei,,Executives,32,"We do have some assessment, to be frank with you, because we know the die size, we know that the number of the chips inside. I give you some of the [ feed-in ]. We are using the more advanced technologies so the die size increase and the leading edge is not so much, but it did increase because of more functionality, you can expect that people put the AI application inside or those kind of thing. 
More important, as the last time I believe I already mentioned that camera, for one example, now you can see more and more camera in smartphone, especially the high-end smartphone. And also the more resolution, the other one was [ silicon's real estate to ] -- from 12, what is that, 20 megapixel to 40 megapixel. So more camera, higher resolution, more pixel. And then also you need a lot of power management IC to control the power consumption because of 5G, they consume a lot of power. So your power management IC has to be more advanced, so you put more power management IC inside. 
And then you are talking about more channel in the communication, so the RF front end, the transceiver, everything, you have not only the die size for an increase actually to adopt the more channel. So it's even -- move into that higher leading-edge technology also.",229

Second question is on the gross profit margin. I recall that a couple of quarters or 2 quarters ago in the first half this year when TSMC [ powered a ] table saying that we are past the bottom, we are seeing the strong rebound in second half this year and also expect the gross margin will go back to 50% level second half. And indeed, now we see the utilization rate coming at -- coming back, revenue coming back in second half as expected. But it looks like the gross margin is lagging a little bit compared to if you -- yes, compared to the revenue direction. So can you explain what's these factors that's driving gross margin recovery behind the revenue recovery?",125

Whenever there's a big jump up in utilization quarter-over-quarter, there will be a negative hit on gross margins. It's called the inventory revaluation. I think -- I believe we mentioned about this some time ago. So yes, as you can imagine, the utilization in the third quarter is much higher than that in the second quarter. And therefore, there is a element of negative inventory valuation happen in the third quarter. The amount is slightly over 1 percentage point, okay? Now if utilization remains at similar level, that factor will not happen.",103

The wafer's revenues gross rate, it stays the same, okay? Still that statement is still valid. 
The gross margin, that's another consideration. The gross margin of the back-end business actually is lower today, still lower than the wafer margin. And -- but we look at it whether it's a good business to go or not on 2 factors. One, we really want to support our customer to improve their system performance. So we have to do it because of TSMC is the only one company right now who can support customers' advanced packaging. Second actually is the CapEx intensity on the back end, and that's the advanced packaging business is smaller. And so the [ handset ] turnover is better. So put all in all together, we still think it's a very good business to pursue.",158

And maybe just a follow-up on 5-nanometer specifically. I guess maybe you can talk about whether you think the ramp of 5-nanometer will be similar to prior nodes [ in virtual ] terms or revenue. How should we think about the ramp-up, particularly as you get through into the second half of 2020? 
And on your CapEx increase, I think you've said in the past you want to -- you plan to grow -- you've been quite consistent, you want to grow your top line 5% to 10%, but your capital intensity to support that growth would be around about 30 or maybe low 40s as a percent of sales.

The second question is related to the substantial increase in the CapEx. Because in the past, TSMC has indeed said that we could have $10 billion to $12 billion CapEx to support a 5% to 10% CAGR. Now our CapEx is substantially higher than the $10 billion to $12 billion. And therefore, does that mean that it's going to support a much higher CAGR on the revenue growth?",96

And hopefully, because we spend big money, hopefully, that it will ramp up much in terms of revenue, be much faster than 7-nanometer. In next January, we are going to talk about it more. 
And so that also answers the second question, that we spend -- we increased the CapEx quite a lot, of course, from $10 billion to $11 billion to about $14 billion to $15 billion. With that money, we spend to buy the tools to prepare everything. We do expect that, of course, this will go beyond 5% to 10%.

I want to ask because you kind of hinted the utilization still below 90%. So to get to 50%, you need to get utilization up. Could you talk about the 28-node prospects, how you see that? And then also 16 and 12, some of the applications, like we move on, some of the mobile and graphics. So your view on utilization and backfill to hold up that technology node.",70

Wei,,Executives,152,"Let me answer that question. On 28-nanometers, this technology node right now, I believe, in the industry is overcapacity. And so the utilization is very low, not to TSMC's expectation. So we prepare a lot of derivative technologies -- specialty technology, let me say that. And we expect 2 years later from now, at the -- again in the high utilization, but not today. It takes time to work with a customer and to utilize that capacity. 
For 16 and 12-node, today we are still in a very healthy utilization, but we are prepared. And if our competitor is -- continue to increase the capacity just by a 28-nanometer's node, we expect a couple of years later, something like that, you have the overcapacity again. So right now, we are prepared all the specialty technology like RF, like even some of the ISP or something like that. So it won't happen to TSMC.",153

If you look at the foundry industry historically, what we typically see is a big node followed by a smaller node, right? And now essentially what you're saying is a big 7 and a big 5. Can you maybe just discuss what you're seeing that is different now versus before? Clearly, TSMC is addressing new markets. I think the demand drivers are different now versus before. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing that is different now.",79

Wei,,Executives,159,"You mentioned, yes, big and then followed by a small node. I don't really catch what you mean. But let me say that TSMC introduced a 16-nanometer and then 12 and then 10 and then 7 and then 5. 
Now let's talk about 7 and 5. We are looking at the new market in the 5G because the 5G's requirement on the speed and the power consumption reduction is quite a lot. It's not the same experience that we have before. And so that after the 7-nanometer, all the customer asked us to develop the technology to meet their requirement with higher speed, lower power consumption. So it will be a full node kind of improvement. It's not, say, that's a 10% improvement will be good enough.
Now look at our 7-nanometer. We have a 7-nanometer, we have 5 and then we have a 6-nanometer. The 6-nanometer being introduced as kind of for second wave product. But the leading wave of a product are always at a full node and marching ahead with about a 2 years cadence than we expect.",181

Wei,,Executives,162,"Well, compared with 6 months ago, we are a little bit kind of conservative at the time because of our 7-nanometer's utilization is quite low. So we become conservative. But then in these 6 months, a lot of things changed. Let me say that, first, the 5G's momentum is larger than we expected. The second one is we also at the same time, because of our technology offer to the customer, we expand our customers' portfolio. And because of the performance, again, we also expand to new product portfolio. And so now we look at the future, we are more optimistic than 6 months ago, much more.",107

Quickly on the breadth of customers on N5. I think around this time 1 year or 9 months before N7 ramp-up, you were talking about roughly I think 50 to 100 tape-outs on N7.

C.C., you mentioned that there are lots of benefit from power consumption from [ performers ] from 5-nanometer, et cetera. So how about the per transistor cost, right? I remember some of your customers talking about they don't see the benefit from the transistor cost-saving going forward. Do you think that is a true statement?",70

Wei,,Executives,173,"I still believe the per transistor cost is decreasing because right now, geometry is smaller and smaller. Although for TSMC, we more pay attention to what customer need, right? Because if they need speed, we give them speed. If they need the power -- lower power consumption, we give them the lower power consumption. But higher density is always the one that we are moving into the next-generation technology. So transistor-wise, I did not do the very detailed calculation, but I still think the transistor as a cost is low.",90

Wei,,Executives,175,"Not really. I mean that depend on their product. Your last question about transistor as a cost, let me give you some kind of a taste. We improved the logic density by 80%, but I did not charge my customer 80% more. So you know that the transistor is lower. And again, in the market, I will say that a product to be successful is more important than you really calculate this improvement, this cost, that cost. Product has to be competitive in the market and so that people will give them the price that they deserve, okay? So now the small customer cannot afford it. Actually some of the small customer, they are working on the CPU kind of a performance. They need a very high performance technology that they are working with TSMC.",135

My second question is that on the -- it looks like there's a CapEx step-up this year and next year. And when you think about that the -- in 28-nanometer also saw very strong demand, we continue to build the capacity, but then a couple of years later it turns into the underutilization, overcapacity, although there's some factors that because of the competition and laggards catching up. But how do you see this risk going forward for 7 and 5? And have you considered that whether there will be strong enough second wave or third wave of a demand to backfill this capacity when your current customers migrate into 3 or 2 or whatever it is 3 years from now?",121

Wei,,Executives,184,"To answer your second question first, we do have confidence that a lot of product will fill up TSMC's capacity. Now a few years later, if you compare with the 28-nanometer to 7 to 5, it's not a good comparison because of 7 and 5 with the EUV, that technology barrier is much, much, much higher than you can expect to form the high-K metal gate. And so they are -- anyway, I don't want to comment on my competitor.",80

Okay. Just last one. It's the last one, I promise, the last one. The -- when we look at the CapEx step-up this time, it looks like the company has been staying around like $10 billion on the CapEx, plus/minus $1 billion to $2 billion for a few years right now. If we go back to look at in 2010, when we walked out of the downturn in 2009 and also we -- there's a huge step-up of your CapEx from 2010 to -- or 2009 to 2010, and then we know what happened to TSMC, it's a golden year for TSMC for a couple of years. So now we have another step-up out of the semi-downturn in the past 12 months. Do you think there's similarity now or there's been and when you make this bold CapEx decision this time?",142
