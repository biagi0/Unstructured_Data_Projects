Back in July, we planted the flag for our businesses, and we pointed to an improved trajectory in the second half. Now as we look back on the year, we did, in fact, significantly improve the trajectory in our revenue and our gross margin performance. We did this by ramping our cloud and as-a-service offerings, by continuing to reinvent our systems brands, by driving a higher level of software transactional revenue and by improving consulting performance.
In the fourth quarter, we returned to revenue growth. Our revenue of $22.5 billion is up about 3.5% and up 1% without the currency tailwind. We also grew our operating net income and our operating earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, our operating net income and EPS exclude a one-time charge associated with the enactment of tax reform because of the unique nature and to provide comparability to the operating expectations we've been providing for 2017. For the year, we delivered $79 billion of revenue, $13.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $13 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year.
Looking at some of the revenue dynamics of the fourth quarter. Our systems results were terrific across IBM Z, Power and storage. This was our first full quarter with the z14. And with pervasive encryption and the ability to address new technologies like blockchain, we're adding new clients and new workloads to the platform. In Cognitive Solutions, we had good growth in several areas, including security, IoT and our industry-based solutions like Watson Health and Watson Financial Services, though we were disappointed by the performance in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings. And in Services, we had our second consecutive growth in consulting, led by digital offerings. Performance in our outsourcing businesses across GTS and GBS was pretty consistent with the last few quarters.
From a geographic perspective, we had growth in many countries, including our 2 largest: the U.S. and Japan. Across all of our businesses, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 17% or 14% at constant currency as we embed cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer. For all of 2017, Strategic Imperatives revenue was up 11% to $36.5 billion, which is 46% of our revenue. I should mention that we'll continue to focus on constant currency revenue growth rates throughout, but any way you look at it, this was a strong finish to the year.
We introduced the Strategic Imperatives framework back in 2015 as a way to show how we're moving our clients to the future. As you know, these aren't separate businesses but the revenue from our offerings that address opportunities in analytics, cloud, security and mobile. This quarter, the 14% growth in Strategic Imperatives revenue was led by cloud and by security. Let me give you a little more on each.
Our cloud revenue was up 27% as we help our clients to implement hybrid environments, integrating public and private and traditional IT. For the year, our cloud revenue was $17 billion, and we're exiting 2017 with a run rate in our as-a-service offerings of over $10 billion. To put that $17 billion in perspective, it's up from $7 billion just 3 years ago. As you know, we play an important role in running our clients' most critical processes. And now with the IBM Cloud, which is built for the enterprise, each of the 10 largest global banks, 9 of the top 10 retailers and 8 of the top 10 airlines are cloud-as-a-service clients. We can help clients with their hybrid environments as well. With introduction of IBM Cloud Private, we provide clients with the attributes of a cloud behind their own firewall and give them increased portability of workloads across any cloud environment. This is really important for enterprise work.
And then in security, revenue across our security offerings more than doubled. This reflects the strong demand for our pervasive encryption in IBM Z as we reinvent that platform for the most contemporary workloads. We also had good performance in managed security services within our GTS business and in our security software. Over the last several years, we've been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into more of what we offer and building new solutions and modernizing existing ones. These investments not only drive our Strategic Imperatives revenue performance today but will also extend our innovation leadership into the future. I'll give you a few examples.
In the third quarter, we formed a partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI Lab. Through this partnership, we're mobilizing the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to carry out fundamental AI research and drive scientific breakthroughs that unlock the potential of AI. In Quantum, we now have a 20-cubit IBM Q system available for all to use, and we have the first working 50-cubit processor, and we launched the Q Network, which is a collaboration of leading Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions and national research labs that can access IBM Q systems through the IBM Cloud as they explore the practical applications to advance quantum computing. And you saw just last week, we announced that IBM led the U.S. in patents in 2017, marking our 25th consecutive year at #1. Nearly half of the more than 9,000 patents in 2017 are for advancements in AI, cloud computing, cyber security, blockchain and quantum computing.
So now let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $22.5 billion, which, as I said, is up year-to-year. Like last quarter, our performance is pretty much all organic. I'll go into the highlights by brand in the segment discussions, so let me comment here on the geographic performance.
Revenue from the Americas was up 4%, with growth across the U.S., Canada and Brazil. This is a significant sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance, 6 points compared to the third quarter, driven by systems and infrastructure services. Our EMEA revenue was down about 1.5%, which is consistent with last quarter's performance. As always, the performance varied within the geography. This quarter, we had growth in France, Spain and the Middle East and Africa region, offset by weakness in the U.K., Germany and Italy. You'll remember that the U.K. and Germany were impacted by the contract dynamics at the end of 2016, and we've now wrapped on those. In Asia Pacific, we had strong growth again in Japan, which was up 4%. Impacting overall Asia Pacific performance was China where you'll remember we had double-digit growth last year from some large rollouts in China banks.
Looking at our margin performance. Our operating gross margin was down a little over a point year-to-year and up nearly 2 points sequentially. This is about 0.5 point behind what we talked about last quarter, with some of the differences due to mix and the rest due to a delay in the yield from some of our productivity actions in our Services business.
Our operating expense was up 6%. And with revenue up 4%, our E to R increased nearly 70 basis points year-to-year. Now keep in mind, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line, not just because of translation but because that's where the majority of the hedges are reported. We mentioned this back in October. And so in the fourth quarter, currency, between translation and the year-to-year impact from hedges, drove 4 of the 6 points of expense growth. We also had a lower level of IP income in the fourth quarter, about $175 million year-to-year, and it was down for the full year about the same amount. At the beginning of the year, we said we weren't counting on IP income being flat year-to-year, though we had the opportunity pool to do so. And as we went through the year, we're delighted with the new IP partnerships we signed. You can see they contributed to the $300 million of IP income in each of the last 3 quarters, and we weren't going to do anything unnatural to drive flat performance year-to-year in this line item.
Without the effect of currency and IP, our E to R improved modestly, reflecting the continued efficiency we're driving in our underlying spend base while maintaining a high level of investment, together with the benefit of growing revenue.
Looking at operating taxes. Again, this excludes the one-time charge. We provided a range for our ongoing tax rate at the beginning of the year, and we finished at the bottom end of the range. And so our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 12% for the year. You'll recall, we had some discrete items in both the first and the second quarter, which took our full year operating tax rate down to 7%. We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1%. And with share reduction of about 2.5%, our operating EPS of $5.18 was better by 3.5%. We generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13 billion for the year. Now when you look at our realization of GAAP net income, that's over 200%. But when you normalize for the one-time tax charge, it's about 115% for the year. For your awareness, as we show realization of GAAP net income going forward, we'll be using that adjusted view on our charts. Our free cash flow supports both a high level of investment and shareholder returns. And in 2017, we returned 3/4 of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So now let me move on to the segments. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue was flat. Within solutions software, our annuity content, which represents 80% of revenue on an annual basis, was up 3% year-to-year, which is over a point better than last quarter's growth. We had double-digit growth in our SaaS offerings again this quarter as we continue to invest to build scale in our as-a-service businesses. The transactional revenue within solutions was down, driven by weakness this quarter in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management. As you know, because of the larger mix of transactional content in the fourth quarter, it has an outsized impact on the overall software performance.
Within our solutions software portfolio, we continue to focus on building out our industry verticals, and we had strong performance in those areas, including Watson Health, Watson Financial Services and Watson IoT offerings. In Watson Health, we continue to deliver strong growth, driven by state and local government agencies as well as life sciences and oncology. Watson Health is scaling. We've reached 115,000 people with our cognitive offerings, and oncology is now in over 150 hospitals and health organizations and trained on 13 cancers, compared to 4 cancers just over a year ago. Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter as clients look to evolve their financial systems. Growth here was led by our RegTech and commercial payments offerings.
Also, within analytics this quarter, we had good growth in areas that provide data management in hybrid environments like our new unified data system, which leverages DB2 technology built on IBM Power, and in our software-as-a-service business intelligence offerings, including Cognos analytics. As I said earlier, security contributed to growth again this quarter. We had good performance, particularly in the areas of data security, with GDPR as a key driver as well as fraud detection. We saw increased interest and uptake in our software-as-a-service offerings, particularly with QRadar on cloud and Resilient on cloud. We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. Remember that for us, blockchain is a set of technologies that allow our clients to simplify complex, end-to-end processes in a way that couldn't have been done before. It requires the attributes of immutability, permissioning and scalability, and we're already performing thousands of transactions per second. And we offer some of the most advanced cryptography available to verify transactions. So by running on z, we provide industry-leading technology to help improve security and performance for our clients' blockchain networks.
We have engaged in blockchain projects with hundreds of clients, and since the release of our IBM Blockchain platform in the third quarter, we've collaborated on 35 active networks with clients such as CLS, Everledger, KBank, London Stock Exchange and Mizuho. These reflect a wide variety of use cases like cross-border payments in financial services, supply chains in retail, valuable goods authentication in industrials and digital identification for governments. This quarter, we extended our food safety initiative with Walmart into China. And just this week, we announced the creation of a joint venture with Maersk to provide more efficient, secure global trade using blockchain technology.
Turning to transaction processing software. We had another good quarter with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients' long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. Growth was driven by middleware as our clients continue to invest and grow their high-value, mission-critical workloads on the z platform.
Turning to profit for Cognitive Solutions. PTI margin declined year-to-year, driven by ongoing investment into strategic areas and mix of business into lower-margin offerings, including the shift towards SaaS. Our SaaS margins continue to expand, though we're still not at scale.
Moving on to Services. Global Business Services generated $4.2 billion of revenue this quarter, up 1% at actual rates and down 1.5% at constant currency. We had modest growth in GBS signings, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of signings growth. And our GBS revenue was up in several regions, including Asia Pacific and Latin America. We have good momentum in Consulting but continue to see declines in Application Management, particularly in North America and Europe.
Consulting revenue grew 1% again this quarter. We've said for some time that the path to revenue growth starts with signings, which then translates to backlog growth. Our Consulting backlog was essentially flat in the second quarter and was up starting in the third. And we've now driven 2 consecutive quarters of Consulting revenue growth. 
Revenue in our Digital Strategy and iX business grew about 40%. And we're also seeing good growth in the new practices we've built around our innovative technologies like AI and Blockchain. The reason we're able to lead in these emerging areas is because of the technology as well as our ability to implement these platforms into our clients' workflows. So GBS plays a critical role in our leadership in these areas. This doesn't apply just to our own technology. We're also building ecosystems and partnerships around other platforms. We've talked in the past about Salesforce and Workday. And now in December, we announced a partnership with Blue Prism that will combine their robotics processing automation software with IBM services to deliver digital workforce solutions that increase productivity and enable automation at scale. Application Management was down 3% this quarter, driven by declines in traditional ERP managed services and the successful completion of some large contracts. Within Application Management, we grew in our offerings that help clients modernize their critical application suites by implementing cloud-centric architectures and microservices.
Turning to profit. GBS gross margin was down about 2 points year-to-year. Half of this was due to currency dynamics this quarter, and it impact margin by about a point. We're also continuing to invest in our skills and transform our GBS business. As Mark Foster talked about at our investor briefing, our strategy is focused around digital, cognitive and cloud growth platforms, and we've streamlined our practice model to ensure the right skills enablement for practitioners. We're investing to further develop our long-term client relationships with the leading organizations around the world, both with more dedicated senior account leadership and the reinforcement of delivery excellence through methods, automation and widespread re- of our practitioners. We're also bringing in new skills through acquisitions. We closed on the acquisition of Vivant this quarter in Australia, which is the seventh acquisition we've done in GBS over the last 2 years. And in some of the more traditional areas in Application Management, we continue to see some price and profit pressure.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $9.2 billion of revenue this quarter. Our Strategic Imperatives grew at a double-digit rate, and the as-a-service exit run rate for this segment was nearly $7 billion. The IBM Cloud is optimized for cognitive workloads and provides clients with the ability to integrate public, private and managed environments through a single architecture. Infrastructure services was down 4%, which is similar to the trajectory we've seen in recent quarters. As we've talked about, this quarter, we had a more difficult year-to-year compare because of some of the large contract items a year ago. We've now wrapped on those dynamics. Clients are looking to cloud to drive efficiency and agility in their infrastructure and help them create new business models, but they need help getting there and they need someone to manage it for them, given the complexity of their data, environments and industry.
When you look at the composition of our infrastructure services signings this year, about 45% was cloud content, which is ahead of the market mix.
Integration software was down 5%. Our SaaS revenue was again up at a strong double-digit rate across the portfolio, and we continue to have momentum in our hybrid integration tools that are important to enterprise cloud deployments, but it was not enough to offset the decline in our on-premise tools as more of that portfolio shifts to the cloud.
I mentioned earlier this quarter, we announced IBM Cloud Private, a platform to help clients unlock their significant IT investment in core data and applications and extend cloud native tools across public and private clouds. The new platform was built on an open-source container architecture and supports both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry. This facilitates integration and portability of workloads as they evolve to any cloud environment. IBM Cloud Private was developed in response to our clients who want more control of their data and processes while leveraging cloud capabilities. The need is obvious in regulated industries, but every client has data residency requirements and is concerned with the security and performance of pure public clouds. This platform will help everyone to better implement cloud infrastructure that aligns with whatever business model they have. Since the announcement of IBM Cloud Private, we've already brought 120 enterprise clients onto the platform.
Technical Support Services was up 1% at actual rates and down 2% at constant currency. We grew in our multivendor support offerings, where we drive productivity and scale for our clients with integrated and wall-to-wall support solutions across any platform.
Turning to profit. Gross margin for the segment was down about 2 points year-to-year. Some of the large contract dynamics that we've talked about are impacting margins. There were also new large contracts that came into the portfolio at lower margins as we invest ahead to optimize our clients' environments. We continue to invest to scale our cloud platforms and more of the software content in this segment shifts to as-a-service. We're scaling the IBM Services Platform with Watson, where we've already added over 1,000 clients to the platform in 2017. Additionally, we've wrapped on the benefit from our workforce transformation actions that we took in 2016. We did improve our spending here, but as I mentioned, the yield from some of our productivity actions is delayed.
In Systems, we had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. All 3 brands, IBM Z, Power and Storage, grew. We continue to deliver innovation in our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. Now roughly half of our Systems revenue in 2017 addressed workloads in the areas of our strategic imperatives.
This quarter, IBM Z revenue was up 71% year-to-year with the highest shipped MIPS in history. The results reflect our first full quarter of z14 and demonstrate the strong client demand for this platform. Our mainframe is an enduring franchise. In fact, it's an enduring and growing franchise. Our MIPS installed base is up 2.5x over the last 10 years. And as long as we continue to innovate and modernize, this platform will continue to be the leading enterprise platform in the world. More than 10 years ago, it was Linux. 5 years ago, it was mobile. And now, it's pervasive encryption.
The z14 adoption was again broad-based across many countries and industries. We added 14 new clients to the platform across 10 countries this quarter, and we saw especially strong performance in North America where clients continue to leverage traditional IT infrastructure together with the cloud. We're continuing to address emerging workloads across the Z platform like blockchain, machine learning, DevOps and payments. We closed 10 instant payments deals this quarter across several markets. And in the emerging blockchain space, the Beijing Institute of Technology selected the IBM LinuxONE platform to run their blockchain solution. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver high-value, secure and scalable platform that's critical in managing our clients' complex environments.
Power revenue grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth in our high- and low-end portfolio, with our cloud-enabled offerings serving new clients in deep learning and the HANA markets. We continue to shift into the growing Linux market. And our Linux on Power revenue grew again and gained share. For 2017, this now represents 1/4 of our Power portfolio. We also delivered the first installment of our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy, with more to come later in 2018. There are 3 labs of this type, and we won 2 of the 3, which is the most any provider is allowed to win. In this quarter, in our low-end Linux portfolio, we released our next-gen Power system with our new POWER9 processor. These POWER9 systems bring unprecedented speed to AI workloads and enable our clients to compete and win in the data-intensive AI era.
Storage hardware was up 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth so, obviously, we've got some momentum here. We gained share in a very competitive market while holding margins stable. We had double-digit growth in our high-end hardware products for the quarter, which reflects the demand for flash as well as the capacity increase linked to mainframe demand.
Our all-flash array offerings once again grew at a strong double-digit rate and faster than the high-growth all-flash market. In our storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions and a major contributor to our storage business, had strong revenue from our cloud object storage offerings.
Looking at profit for Systems. Our margin was down slightly year-to-year and up sequentially, consistent with product cycle dynamics.
And so now I'll go quickly through cash on the balance sheet, and Jim will wrap up with the segments in the context of 2018. We generated $7.8 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. We invested nearly $1 billion in capital expenditures and generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we generated $16.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding financing receivables. We invested $3.3 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in cloud, in support of our services business. And so we generated free cash flow of $13 billion. And as I mentioned, our cash realization was strong at 116%. That's up 17 points from last year.
You'll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year. At $13 billion, we're up $1.3 billion year-to-year so, obviously, we delivered a much stronger number. Relative to what we expected, we were more efficient in the deployment of capital expenditures, which was down about $400 million year-to-year. Additionally, because of the mix of business and the strong working capital performance at the end of the year across collections and our factoring program, we drove better cash performance. With that free cash flow performance, we've returned almost $10 billion shareholders, including dividends of $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 27 million shares, reducing our average share count by just over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Now looking at the balance sheet. We clearly have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.6 billion, higher than a year ago as the bulk of our 2018 debt maturities will occur earlier in the year. Total debt was $46.8 billion, of which 2/3 was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 53% investment-grade, a point better than both September and last December. Given that this is the year-end call, I wanted to give you a quick update on our pension plans.
Our U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and we've been remixing our asset base toward a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of 2017, in aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 100%, up a couple of points from a year ago, so our plans are in really good shape. We provided information on the performance of our retirement-related plans and year-end 2017 assumptions in the supplemental charts.
So now let me turn it back to Jim.",4241
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796428.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Martin. Let me take a couple of minutes to wrap up. We've been doing a lot of work to reposition our business, to help move our clients to the future, investing, shifting skills and reallocating capital. In short, a lot of heavy lifting. And our results for 2017 reflect that, with an improvement in revenue and our gross profit trajectory in the second half.
Let me make a few comments on 2017 by business and how it positions us for 2018. In Cognitive Solutions, we're driving good results across most of our solutions portfolio, including our Watson and security offerings. Most of these new areas have a software-as-a-service delivery model. And so for 2018, we'll continue to build scale in these as-a-service businesses.
In our Services segments, we've got some momentum in Consulting, driven by our digital offerings and strong growth in our cloud content as we help our clients to build out hybrid environments. As you know, the majority of Services revenue in any given year comes out of the opening backlog. As we enter 2018, the projected revenue from the current backlog points to an improved revenue trajectory in 2018 versus 2017, and that's in both GTS and GBS.
In Systems, we had a great year. Looking to 2018, we have a strong start to our new z14 and are introducing POWER9 systems and have the most competitive storage offerings in some time.
And then across our businesses, our Strategic Imperatives revenue was up at a double-digit rate to $36.5 billion for the year, which is now 46% of our revenue.
So when you take all of this together, we're entering 2018 with a stronger revenue profile than a year ago. In 2018, we'll maintain a high level of investment. This is important as we continue to build out capabilities in AI, in cloud, in security and in blockchain, just to name a few. As always, we'll look for more productivity in our spend base, especially in our Services business, where we'll continue to remix our skills to new opportunities.
And then let me comment on tax. Tax reform provides additional flexibility over the longer term. Our 2018 rate will reflect the implementation of tax reform, which includes a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by the broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization. This translates to an ongoing operating rate for 2018 of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, which is a 4-point headwind year-to-year. This, as always, excludes any discrete items we will have. Putting it all together, we expect to deliver operating earnings per share of at least $13.80.
I want to briefly comment on 2 other items with respect to our earnings per share expectations. First, regarding the skew of our business. We expect to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year expectation of at least $13.80 in the first quarter, which is consistent with the average over the last 5 years. You'll recall, the last couple of years, we've had a benefit from a discrete item in the first quarter. We anticipate a potential benefit again this year. And as in the past, we will likely take actions that will offset some portion of the benefit. This is reflected in the first quarter skew. And then second, there are 2 accounting changes that will be effective in 2018 that will affect our results and are included in our expectations. One helps operating earnings per share, and the other hurts. And they essentially offset each other within the $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.
Now looking at cash flow. We had a very strong end to 2017. Martin mentioned a couple of the drivers, which provide some context to our 2018 expectations. We were more efficient last year in the deployment of capital and, in 2018, we're allowing for some growth in CapEx. In addition, we had a strong finish in receivables performance in the fourth quarter, primarily because of the mix of business that creates a year-to-year headwind in 2018. And we also expect a headwind from cash tax payments in 2018. At this point, it looks to be about $600 million year-to-year. Put all of that together, and we expect free cash flow of about $12 billion in 2018, which results in free cash flow realization well over 100%.
So we're building momentum across our business but, as always, more work to do. And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.",751

Jim, your guidance calls for some revenue growth and margin stability here in 2018. And I was hoping you can share some color on the key puts and takes here as it pertains to your EPS guide. Looks like tax is going to be a big headwind, and if you could quantify sort of that in relation to the operational improvement. And if I could, Martin, could you just comment on what drove the decline in Strategic Imperatives and the Cognitive Solutions segment in 4Q, that would be helpful as well.",103

I appreciate the opening question, and thanks for the comment on the job movement. As you can imagine, when we enter any year, there are multiple scenarios around how we position the full year guidance. And in this year, especially given the improvement that we've seen in the second half of 2017, and taking into account that trajectory of our business and all other operational indices, all of this supports our guidance of at least $13.80. Now as I stated in my prepared remarks, let me first start with tax. Our 2018 operating tax rate of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, incorporates the new tax law. This is a 4-point headwind year-to-year compared to our 2017 operating tax rate of 12%. Both of these are before any discretes. In terms of discretes, like we've had in recent history, we do anticipate some potential benefits from tax discretes. And as in the past, we will likely take action to offset some of those benefits as we always look to position our business for the long term. Taking all of this into account, tax will be a headwind in 2018 year-to-year. Now in terms of the other drivers as you asked. Given our trajectory exiting 2017 and the confidence we have in our portfolio and how we've repositioned it, we do expect revenue growth at current spot rates for 2018. We see stabilization of our margins on a year-to-year basis, driven by the continued scale-out of our cloud business as we drive efficiency, and we're also going to get yield from our services productivity improvements. And this will start in first quarter. And looking at expense, there are many different dynamics here. And I want to make sure we get this right. We're going to continue to invest at a high level to drive the strategic growth areas while we will continue to deliver our base productivity. And as you saw in fourth quarter, we'll continue to see an expense headwind due to currency hedges. And in terms of IP, we're not planning on any year-to-year profit contribution. We continue to have a strong opportunity pipeline. We believe in this model, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in leveraging the monetization of our IP over the long term. Now let me just conclude on a little bit of color on first quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Martin. In first quarter, as I said, we expect our earnings per share skew to be between 17% and 18%. That is on average of the last 5 years, and it's above the last 2 years. We're maintaining our momentum, as I talked about, but we do see revenue growth, both at actual rate and constant currency, and constant currency similar to fourth quarter. And the annual effective tax rate, as we talked about, we anticipate a potential tax discrete benefit in our first quarter. And similar to last couple of years, we are evaluating potential actions that will offset some of these, and both of these are included in our guidance overall. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, and I'll turn it over to Martin.",530

So let me give you a little color on Cognitive Solutions for last year. So keep in mind that the majority of our business in Cognitive is annuity-based. And that includes, by the way, the SaaS offerings, which are growing quite well. Where we saw weakness, as we noted in the prepared remarks, was in a couple of traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management where we either have to go spend some more time getting those offerings better developed, and we did come out with some new ones at the end of the year, but it wasn't soon enough to have an effect in the year, or we're shifting some of those license models to as-a-service. So we don't see a difference in the secular trends, we still believe Cognitive Solutions is going to be driven by the shift to analytics, the shift to cloud, the shift to security. We see that continuing. We just have a couple of offerings here that either we're shifting aggressively or we have to see how the new offerings perform in the marketplace.",185

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796435.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,11,"I'd like to just clarify the guidance, please. You keep talking about a tax rate in 2017 of 12% but, with discretes, it was actually under 7%. And so are you saying you believe that your actual reported tax rate can go from 7% to 16% in 2018 and you can deliver $13.80 in earnings? Or do you know now that you have significant discretes and that your real tax rate that will be reported will be dramatically lower? Because it's very difficult to get the bridge, I think, with the tax rate that's really, in effect, almost 1,000 basis points steeper. And then separately, I'm wondering if you can just comment on the erosion in operating profit margins in both GBS and in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. The margin erosion there was actually the worst we've seen in history on a pretax basis. That did not appear to be an improvement as you expected. I think, if you back out the tax rate, you actually missed your guided EPS by $0.40 relative to a 15% tax rate. And it all seemed to come from the margin erosion in those businesses. Perhaps, you could address that a little more directly, please.",203
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796436.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Sure, Toni. It's Martin. I'll give you a couple of points. One, when we gave guidance at the beginning already of last year, we said our tax rate on an annual effective basis would be 12% to 18%, and we came in at the bottom on an annual effective rate. And as you point out, we had a couple of discretes already in the first half, nothing additional in the second, so the printed rate was lower than that, but I don't think that's news. We're trying to be clear, by the way, on tax for next year, so I'm glad you said we're -- you're not quite there yet, so we should spend some more time on it. The annual effective rate going from 12% to 16% is what the headwind that Jim noted. And we do see discretes as we always do. I don't think we've ever had a year where we don't have a discrete in the year. So I would expect there to be discretes. And Jim noted already that we'll have one in the first, which will largely be offset. So the math that we're talking about from a modeling perspective is 12 to 16. In any case, by the way, the year-to-year headwind in tax is real. We see a headwind in tax. We don't expect at this point at the $13.80 that we'll print a number that we did this year. And again, the 12 to 16 is a good way to do it. The erosion in operating profit, I guess, my view, one, we were looking for a sequential improvement in gross profit. We said both in July, when we said first half to second half, we'd get better; and also, when we talked about it back in January, we said sequentially we'll continue to improve margins. When we got to the fourth, we were up about 2 points. And quite frankly, we thought we could have probably gone to about 2.5 points. And the shortfall there was really driven by 2 things. One is mix. We had a terrific, terrific Systems quarter. And our Systems business is high-margin, but it's not high -- as high a margin as our Software business, so that had an impact on mix. And then some of the productivity we were looking for out of Services got pushed out. Now that wasn't a huge, huge surprise that the revenue performance in TS & CP to us because we talked about the contracts already. And GBS, we said, as we get consistent, signings growth will get to backlog growth, will get to revenue growth, and we saw a nominal improvement in the revenue trajectory but not enough yet to drive overall revenue growth. But as Jim noted, as we go into 2018, we have a much better backlog.",471

I wonder if you can provide some clarity as well on margin stabilization for 2018. Is that stabilization for the full year? And how would you think the first half versus second half looks like as it relates to year-on-year margin trends?,62
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796440.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,16,"Yes. Thank you, Katy. This is Jim. So I'll take that. As I stated in my prepared remarks, the skew is 17%, 18% of the full year on EPS, which is on the average over the last 5 years, but it's also above the last couple of years. Embedded in that, we do see the stabilization of margin on a year-to-year basis starting immediately in the first quarter. We entered the first quarter with some good strength, and we feel very good about our portfolio lineup, strength in our transactional businesses coming out of mainframe where we're ahead of the product cycle in the first 2 quarters, we have enclosed the highest fourth quarter shipped MIPS in history, and it's evident that the market has capacity demands and continues to see the value of that platform. So we see very good performance in our Systems lineup. By the way, Power grew, storage grew. So we had pervasive growth in the fourth quarter, and we feel very strong coming into first quarter. Second, we do see software having growth in the first quarter, and that's just due to the mix between annuity and transactional. As Martin indicated during the prepared remarks, we continue to drive high renewal rates, and we continue to drive the annuity content of our business. And just given the dynamics there, that will give us growth in the first quarter, and it's going to give us mix and margin benefit in the first quarter overall. And then finally, Services, as I stated, we do see revenue from opening backlog, which, in the first quarter, given it's right in front of us, is almost about 90% of the first quarter revenue needed. And it does show improved trajectory throughout 2018. And I'll remind you, throughout '17, we talked about the headwinds we faced in our TS & CP business around some large contract conclusions that was delayed in 2017. We didn't realize it until the very end. We are going to start off 2018 in a much better position on margin, and we see overall stabilization beginning immediately.",350

I know you've talked about margin stabilization, but it would be helpful if you just talk about how do you see gross margins in 2018. And then what are the levers that you think can enable a gross margin expansion environment in '18 for you guys, given the fact you are talking about revenue growth?",80

And we continue to drive -- that's going to come from a couple of areas: one, continued scale of our cloud business; two, improvement in yield of our services productivity as we wrap around some of those completed contracts I talked about; and three, just getting operating leverage from returning this business and portfolio back to growth. So we're going to continue making the strategic investments that are required to position us to win in key growth areas and position this company for the long term. And we're going to drive the base productivity, and we're going to get scale out of our as-a-service business as we move forward. And we saw great instantiation and proof points in the second half of last year overall. So if you play that out across our portfolio, I would tell you we'll get mix contribution from our Cognitive Solutions business segment, just driven based on the product lineup and the strength we have in our Watson offerings, in security and in our industry verticals. We're going to get margin and productivity benefit out of our services businesses, GBS and GTS. And we're going to get scale efficiencies out of our as-a-service and cloud-based businesses in our TS & CP overall segment. Martin, if you want to add a few comments.",238

The other thing I'd add, kind of the way I think about it, in addition to what Jim went through, one, the margins in our Strategic Imperatives remain higher than the margins in the rest of our business. And remember, the whole business, by the way, has high margins, right? We're a high-margin -- we're a high-value model with high margins, we're 49% -- between 49% and 50% margin. So we're building the businesses. The places we're moving to -- and you saw a great performance out of Strategic Imperatives, the places we're going to offer higher margins than the places we're coming from, and the reweighting alone gets us some content. And as Jim pointed out, in any scale business, the worst is behind us because we're building scale every day.",133

So thank you, Mark, for the question. So yes, a couple of questions. Let me start with the first one around revenue growth. We did state that based on the trajectory in the second half and how we made significant improvement, and the confidence we have in our portfolio and the strength in winning in key market segments, that we see revenue growth for the full year at current spot rates. I also said that starting in the first quarter, we see revenue growth both at actual rates and current spot rates. Now I will tell you, one, we've got a lot of momentum that we built up through the second half. But 2018, there's a lot of work to get done. We have best visibility of what the quarter we're in right now with the 90 days and all of the operational indices around what the profile of our business looks like, and we're very confident that we will grow at both constant currency and at actual rates. And we got a lot of work to do the rest of the year, and we fully expect that we're going to continue that momentum, and we'll update you as we go through the year on that.",207

In terms of scale, I guess, one way to think about it, because of the backlog of business we have, which it's north of $120 billion of Services business, that business is moving on to the IBM Cloud. That's the process we're going through now. So not only are we building and moving new SaaS properties into the cloud, which have great margins, not only are we building the Platform-as-a-Service and building ecosystems around that, we have 120 -- north of $120 billion backlog in our services business that we're in the process of moving to the cloud. We've got some progress, but we are not through the majority of this yet. We got a long way to go. So when we talk scale, we're moving our whole services platform on to the IBM Cloud, and that's going to give us the scale we need, not just for that infrastructure layer but it's going to give us the scale we need to manage applications, it's going to give us to scale we need to deliver SaaS as effectively as possible and efficiently as possible, so we got a lot of scale coming our way.",203

One would be to provide a bridge, an earnings bridge, which some companies do, and we're obviously all trying to get at that. But it'd be helpful if, at some point, maybe you guys would put one together for us. But a couple of points I wanted to touch on. One would be currency in terms of a bridge, I assume that's positive to EPS. Another is investments. It's very hard to understand. Are your investments increasing year-over-year at a slower rate than they've been? Are they actually declining year-over-year? And then charges. So you're kind of suggesting there's going to be charges that maybe offset some of the discretes on tax. Can you give us a sense of what charges for the year might be like?

And it's been a dramatic drain on our portfolio overall just given the dynamics of how much business we do outside U.S. dollar-denominated. But currency is finally a tailwind to the IBM company of a 2.7 points here in the fourth quarter, which was about a $600 million help on the top line. And that's driven from a variety of FX rates across different countries. But as you know quite well, we constantly build a financial discipline in our model, and we hedge those currencies to protect the volatility of our business from the bottom line. And so I would tell you, bottom line currency overall in the period, was de minimis. It was a couple of pennies at most. But what happens is, over the long run, it allows you flexibility to change your pricing, change your sourcing, change your business dynamics.

I know you got a lot of questions around the stable margin outlook. How much of that is coming from expected productivity versus mix and changes in investments? And the second one, just to better understand the tax point here. Just is your capital allocation going to change at all? I heard a little bit about the CapEx, which makes sense, but just wanted to make sure, any change in assumption around capital deployment posttax?",88
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796462.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,38,"Okay, thank you, Tien-tsin. This is Jim. Let me address the margin piece. As we've been talking throughout the call, obviously, we've got a lot of focus on, one, returning this business back to revenue growth; and two, stabilizing these margins year-over-year. And we firmly believe and are confident that we got the plans in place overall. But when you look at it, I tend to look at margin in a couple of different buckets, as I stated earlier. Number one, we will continue to drive base productivity out of this business. It's instrumental to our financial model, and it's what our clients require as we continue to help our clients move and apply technology and expertise to help enable their businesses to move from one era to the other. And that will be probably about 0.5 point improvement in our margins overall. On the flip side, we're going to continue to invest in our business to position us strategically, to win in key growth segments. I talked about AI, I talked about cloud, I talked about security in new eras -- areas, excuse me, like blockchain, which you saw a couple of days ago our latest announcement with Maersk around global trade distribution and how we're building and scaling that platform overall. So we're going to continue making investments. And then the third part of the equation is the mix equation. And that's going to come off of driving revenue growth in high profitable areas around our Cognitive Solutions area, and that will drive operating leverage to the IBM company overall. So Martin, you want to address the tax side?",271
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796463.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,39,"Sure. So a couple of things, Tien-tsin. First, we've been supporters of, proponents of and pushing for fundamental tax reform for a long, long time. We think it's the right thing to go. So we're delighted, absolutely delighted, that we got tax reform. Now in the short term, we took a charge, this toll charge, right, to recognize a shift from one system to the territorial that we've all been supportive of. So we'll pay the toll charge. And as Jim noted, within our cash flow guidance, we have a cash headwind, which is all captured -- cash tax headwind, all of which is captured in the guidance. But for us, it's a long-term benefit because we now have freedom of capital movement. It's not really a near-term capital allocation issue for us. So we have -- well, as you know, we have $12 billion of cash around the world. We don't have big cash pile stock -- cash stockpiled outside the U.S. We've always had a really good access to our cash. And we got tax reform done, or they got tax reform done in a period where it wasn't an issue for us, so no capital allocation changes for us. The reason we're able to grow the dividend over time, the reason we're able to reduce the share count is because we've always had good cash flow, we've had enough to reinvest in the business. But tax reform by itself -- well, again, not -- we are huge supporters, we're glad it happened, not a near-term capital event for us.",262

I'll ask a question just on Systems, but maybe, as everybody else, a multipart. I just want to look at Systems. Obviously, nice that you have the mainframe cycle. Could you give us an idea how long that could last, in that usually, you get at least 2 nice quarters of it, maybe even 3? And then also on the storage front, obviously, you've been doing very well there. Is your mix more over -- well over 50% or 60% all-flash, so we could expect a good year from that? And then finally, you came out with an AI chip, POWER9. Does that fall into the systems sector? And do you have any traction with that yet, given there's obviously a lot of discussion about AI?",128

I appreciate the question. And believe me, we are very pleased with our overall Systems performance here in the fourth quarter, and that goes well beyond mainframe. But let me start with mainframe. Very pleased, as I said, with the performance as it instantiates how we continually modernize and build an enduring platform. Strong value proposition, it's definitely resonating in the marketplace, and we continue to handle mission-critical workloads and also, very, very important, open up new profit pools with our pervasive encryption capabilities, getting strong resonation in the market, our new workloads around Linux and HANA and also emerging workloads like Blockchain. So mainframe, with the second quarter, and we had a couple of weeks here in September, we delivered 71% revenue growth at constant currency, and we had the largest shipped MIPS in any quarter in its history. And now our MIPS installed base has grown double digits year-to-year, and it's 2.5x the last 10 years. So this performance is, right now, above the prior cycle and consistent with z12 a few years ago. And while we've got many scenarios -- as I said earlier, we gave a guidance of at least $13.80, we got many scenarios and many people working tirelessly to continue to drive innovation into this platform so we can do much better than just the typical cycle. Our guidance is not counting on any material change to that. Now I'm glad you brought up Power and storage because we were very pleased in the fourth quarter. Power grew 15%. We started shipping the first POWER9 architecture with the Cora win. I think we won 2 of the 3. We're only able to win 2 of the 3, by the way. So a strong start to POWER9 architecture, and we'll roll the rest of that out, our low-end, starting later in the first half and early in the second half. So we look for continued momentum in our Power portfolio overall. And then finally, on storage, this is the first year in a long time, for 4 quarters in a row, we've grown storage. And that's been based on the great work our storage team has done about repositioning their portfolio, leveraging and growing share in flash, but it's also about software-defined and also, more importantly, as we move forward, object storage that will continue to look for growth. So we're very pleased with our system portfolio, and we look for that to continue. Martin, do you want to say a few words?",421

I guess, since it's only about Systems, it doesn't count as multipart. But we get questions, as I'm sure you do, this idea, what's cyclical, what's secular. And when we go back to why we started talking about the Strategic Imperatives, those are the secular changes in the enterprise IT world. They're all about cloud, they're all about security, they're all about analytics, they're all about mobile. And while what you asked about was a product view, remember that the secular trend that these are tied into continues. And so the demand for mainframe is driven by the secular trend for security. It is not so much about, like, there's a new mainframe, so I have to buy one. It's not so much in POWER9 that, ""Oh, there's a new POWER9. I have to buy it."" All of these machines -- and we kind of shorthand it to say they're built for the most contemporary workloads. But we introduced those shifts and those secular ideas through the Strategic Imperatives, and all of these offerings are riding that secular trend. Mainframe and security is a good example. Power and analytics -- POWER9 and analytics is a good example. And quite frankly, and Jim mentioned this, storage, as it moves to the cloud, needs object store. And our object store offerings in storage are doing terrifically well. So the cyclical versus secular is not as simple as some want to portray it, it really is, are these offerings tied into those long-term secular trends, and our Systems business is absolutely tied to those.",268

I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on a constant currency basis for the revenue outlook, and which of the segments' constant currency you would expect to be up versus any that you expect to be down?",49
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2018",2018-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4329.0,1371569.0,54796470.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,46,"Okay, thank you, Jim, for the question. As I stated before, our full year guidance of at least $13.80 is predicated on us delivering revenue growth at current spot rates. I said that earlier because we got a lot of work to do. And while we've got great momentum that we built out in the second half, and we feel very confident about our portfolio across the board, the best line of sight that we have right now is first quarter. And in first quarter, we will deliver revenue growth, both at actual rates and at constant currency. And let me just give you a little color underneath that. If you start with Cognitive Solutions, as Martin said earlier in one of the Q&As, we have repositioned through strategic investments in many different areas that portfolio and have been generating tremendous penetration in our annuity content. Today, in Cognitive Solutions, annuity is about 80% of that portfolio. And underneath that, it's being driven by a strong acceleration in Software-as-a-Service in the mix. Over the last 12 months, our Software-as-a-Service is up 30% overall. So we see, just based on the annuity versus transactional seasonality of first quarter, we will grow Cognitive Solutions at a constant currency level. In both of our services areas, which, as we talked about earlier, pretty consistent performance throughout the second half, we are actually opening up our backlog with a runout that is showing improvement year-to-year from where we were opening last year. So while our total backlog at $121 billion is up 2% overall, down 3% at constant currency, that backlog and the composition of that backlog gives us much more better confidence and will make sequential improvement in our revenue growth trends as we move throughout the year. And then Systems, coming off of a phenomenal fourth quarter of 28% growth, growth across all 3 platforms, we expect growth to continue, albeit probably not at that rate, but it will continue as we continue to leverage the value of our mainframe proposition and start scaling our Power and the continuation of performance in our storage area.",353

But just to be clear, obviously, the services is pretty important to your '18 outlook. And while both segments continue to face headwinds, the growth dynamic underlining the tech services in cloud is probably more opaque. So can you just talk about -- or you had talked about customer losses in the first half of '17, and you just mentioned the backlog and that opening up as we migrate into the first half of next year. So with that said, other than typical execution risk, is there any reason to believe that the growth rate of that business should not reaccelerate as the year progresses and maybe even get to some kind of [ slope ] dynamic as we anniversary the tough compares in the back half of the year?",139

I appreciate the question. So as I -- as you indicated -- let me give you a little bit more color around our Services and, in particular, about our Services backlog runout. If you take our GBS business, our GBS business enters the year with a backlog that should yield in fiscal year of about 2/3 of its revenue. Still has about 1/3 of the revenue that we need to go do sell and bill and translate that backlog into revenue yield throughout the year, but that 2/3 of that backlog shows a significant improvement versus where we were beginning 2017. And that shows sequential improvement as we move throughout the year. Now the focus in GBS, we've already transformed our Consulting business. As Martin talked throughout the year, signings lead to backlog, lead to revenue growth. We've now gotten 2 quarters in a row of Consulting growth in revenue. And we finished the year, I'll remind you, growing GBS signings 4 quarters in a row. The area of focus that we need now is around our AMS business. And that is around an area where we're helping our clients migrate to the cloud and also how we need to capitalize on leveraging the incumbency value of AMS overall. So I definitely see GBS improving its trajectory as we move throughout the year. And if we execute on the pipelines we got in place, I definitely see that we can grow by the end of the year in our GBS business. In GTS, which has much longer durations, the GTS business, the opening backlog is somewhere around 75% to 80% or maybe a little bit higher as you enter the year. So again, similar, we still got about 20% of work to do in the year to go get that revenue yield, but that 80% backlog is actually in a much better shape than what it was at the beginning of 2017, as we spoke about all year long, with some ending -- contract conclusions.
So with that, let me wrap up the call in by saying again, we're very pleased with the work we have done over the last year to reposition our business. And I hope what you took away from today's call is that we're entering with a stronger revenue and margin profile. Now as always, there's more work to do, and I look forward to sharing our progress and continuing this dialogue as we move through 2018. Thank you all for joining the call.",421

As we wrapped up 2017 and in our investor briefing webcast in early March, we talked about the work we've done to reposition our business to lead in the high-value segments of IT, our differentiated value proposition and how our financial strategy and model is built to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders over the long term.
We made progress in our financial performance in the second half of last year, and now our first quarter results demonstrate further progress toward our model, so we're clearly moving in the right direction.
In the quarter, we delivered $19.1 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating net income and $2.45 of operating earnings per share. And with this start to the year, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.
Our revenue in the quarter was up 5% year-to-year. Without currency tailwind, our revenue was up modestly, though you'll see on the chart, constant currency rounds to flat.
Now turning to profit. Our operating gross profit was up 3% with broad-based improvement in our year-to-year gross margin performance versus last quarter. Our operating net income was up 2%, and earnings per share was up 4%. Those are inclusive of a year-to-year headwind from the actions we took in the first quarter to continue better positioning our business for the long term. I'll expand on this in a minute, but what you'll see in the underlying operating dynamics is that we improved our gross margin trajectory, expanded our PTI margin and had solid growth in earnings per share.
Looking at the year-to-year dynamics. Let me start with revenue. As I said, we're up 5% at actual rates with 6% growth in Cognitive Solutions, 4% in Global Business Services, 5% in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms and 8% in Systems. Let me add some color by segment. And from here on, I'll focus primarily on constant currency performance.
Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2% year-to-year, with continued strength in security software and industry platforms and a return to growth in our analytics revenue. These cognitive results contributed to growth in our total software revenue for this quarter with strong transactional performance and continued growth in SaaS. In our Services businesses, we had an improvement in our revenue trajectory from last quarter, driven by revenue from the runout of our backlog. In addition, both segments grew signings this quarter, contributing to double-digit growth in total Services signings, driven by cloud content.
Our Systems revenue was up 4%, with very strong revenue growth again in IBM Z and our second consecutive quarter of growth in Power. Our storage hardware revenue declined this quarter. We were disappointed in our storage performance, and it contributed to a modest shortfall to our own expectations of IBM's revenue growth in the quarter.
Our first quarter results reflect much of the work we've done to reposition our portfolio and our skills to address the secular trends in the market led by the phenomenon of data. We've been building new platforms and solutions while modernizing existing ones, embedding cloud and AI into more of what we offer. And so IBM is now a Cognitive Solutions and cloud platform company focused on the high-value areas of IT.
Our strategic imperatives revenue is an indication of our success in addressing these secular trends. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives revenue of $37.7 billion represents 47% of revenue. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the first quarter was up 15% at actual rates or 10% at constant currency led by security, which was up 60%, and cloud. 
Our cloud revenue is now $17.7 billion over the last year, which is up 22% as reported. Cloud growth in the quarter was driven by our as-a-service offerings, and we're exiting the first quarter with an annual run rate of $10.7 billion, which is up 20% at constant currency. Our cloud success reflects our ability to help our clients run hybrid environments with our one-cloud architecture across public, private and multiclouds. 
The continued scaling of our strategic imperatives, together with focus on efficiency and productivity, is contributing to our improved margin trajectory. So bringing it all together, we grew revenue, operating net income and operating earnings per share and improved our year-to-year gross margin trajectory as compared to the fourth quarter.
Before moving to our key financial metrics, we have a few significant items in our results this quarter, so I want to take a minute to walk through these. And I'll start by reminding you of what we said 90 days ago in our discussion of our 2018 expectations.
We said we expected to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year earnings per share expectation in the first quarter. Our first quarter operating earnings per share of $2.45 is 17.8% of $13.80, so consistent with the range we provided. We said we expected an ongoing tax rate of 16% for the year, plus or minus 2 points, and that's excluding discrete items. We also said that just like in each of the last 2 years, we anticipated discrete tax benefits in the first quarter, and we'd likely take actions that would offset some portion of the benefit.
In the quarter, we took actions to continue the transformation of our business. These actions drove pretax charges of about $610 million, with the majority of this in SG&A and some in costs. First, with the repositioning of our portfolio, we have emerged as a leader in the high-value segments of the enterprise IT industry. This requires revitalization of our skill base. And this quarter, we took actions to further align our skills to these high-value areas. And then second, we took actions that will better position our systems cost structure over the long term. In addition, we settled a number of U.S. and foreign tax audits, which drove discrete noncash tax benefits of $810 million in the quarter. Let me remind you that this benefit reverses charges that were reflected in prior years. As always, we've included these charges and benefits in our operating results. 
Today, we laid out a year-to-year bridge of our operating earnings per share, isolating what I'll call these significant items, so that you can better see the underlying dynamics of our business.
Looking at the drivers of our $2.45 of operating earnings per share on a year-to-year basis. We had contribution from revenue growth at constant margin as well as from operating leverage. The operating leverage was driven by pretax margin expansion mitigated by a higher underlying tax rate year-to-year. A lower share count contributed to growth. And then you could see the year-to-year impact of the significant actions, which was a headwind to our earnings per share growth. 
So this is a good start to the year and, as I said earlier, our underlying operating dynamics show an improved gross margin trajectory, expansion of our pretax margin and solid growth in our operating earnings per share.
I want to mention one other item that we discussed in the context of our 2018 expectations. In January, we implemented 2 new accounting standards: revenue recognition and the presentation of pension costs. The net effect of the 2 was a modest reduction in our operating earnings per share in the first quarter with effectively no impact year-to-year.
Regarding the implications to revenue. Adoption of the new revenue standard had a de minimis benefit to our revenue in the first quarter, and we expect any full year contribution to be immaterial.
So now let me talk about the key financial metrics for our operating performance and show you the impact these significant items have on our results. As I've said, our revenue was $19.1 billion, and the year-to-year performance is essentially all organic. From a geography perspective, revenue in the Americas was flat year-to-year. A decline in the U.S. was offset by solid growth in Canada and Latin America, which was led by Brazil. Asia Pacific was also flat. This is a 2-point improvement over the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter. Our Europe revenue trajectory also improved and, in fact, returned to growth. We had strong growth in France and Spain. And while Germany and the U.K. declined, they had marked improvement in their year-to-year trajectory.
Looking at our margin performance globally. Our operating gross margin was down 70 basis points, though that includes a 40 basis point impact associated with the significant item I just mentioned to improve our long-term systems cost structure. This is good improvement in our year-to-year margin dynamics, driven by mix and productivity led by services.
Our operating expense was up 9%, driven by currency and the actions to continue repositioning of our business. Without these, our expense was better by 1%, reflecting a high level of investment and our continued focus on productivity. As we discussed in the past, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line due to both translation and the impact of hedging losses. And so in the first quarter, currency drove 5 of the 9 points of expense growth. And then a higher level of workforce transformation activity drove another 6 points of expense growth.
I will also mention that we had a lower level of IP income, which drove 2 points of expense growth. Our operating tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 16% as well as the discrete tax benefits of $810 million. The 16% is in line with the range we discussed in January and is up over 1 point year-to-year. The operating net income was up 2%, and operating earnings per share of $2.45 was better by 4%. And those include the year-to-year impact of the significant items.
Looking at the cash metrics. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13.3 billion over the last 12 months. That's nearly 120% of GAAP net income. I'll come back to the drivers of our cash performance after I walk through each of the segments.
Now turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2% as we continue to scale our new platforms and solutions and grow our SaaS offerings. Solutions software revenue also grew 2% led by offerings in analytics and security. Within analytics, growth this quarter was driven by strong transactional performance. We saw broad-based growth across both our on-prem analytics platforms and our SaaS offerings as clients look to use their data for competitive advantage. 
And so from a portfolio perspective, we had continued growth in offerings that allow our clients to better manage their data in hybrid environments like our integrated analytics systems. We also had strong growth in our data science offerings where we introduced new capabilities that allow data developers to leverage open source tools in a secure, collaborative environment. 
You'll remember, last quarter, we talked about the weakness in the data integration space due to new offerings introduced very late in the quarter. These new offerings are resonating with our clients and contributed to growth this quarter. Also within analytics, we continue to scale our industry platforms. Let me focus this quarter on financial services.
Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter led by Promontory's risk and regulatory business as well as our financial crimes portfolio. We are seeing a real synergy opportunity in combining Promontory's industry expertise with our AI technologies. Watson remains the AI platform for business with continued strong demand for our offerings, particularly around virtual assistance where conversation service usage increased triple digits year-to-year.
In the first quarter, we introduced several new offerings to accelerate client journeys to AI such as the enhanced Watson Assistant, with conversational offerings tailored to specific industries like automotive and hospitality. Orange Bank and Autodesk are 2 examples of early adopters of our latest technology. And just last week, Forrester recognized IBM Watson Assistant as the only leader in its New Wave report on conversational computing platforms.
Security had great growth this quarter, and we continue to gain share. We are well positioned in this market with our extensive security portfolio, which is enhanced with AI to address the needs of our clients. There is obviously a lot of demand here, given the importance of cybersecurity risk and data privacy concerns, especially in an environment where security talent is at a premium.
We had good performance in areas like data security with GDPR as a driver, endpoint management and orchestration. And we had strong revenue growth in our SaaS offerings in security as we continue to increase our AI capabilities across the portfolio. We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. We've grown to over 50 active blockchain networks since the release of our IBM Blockchain platform in the third quarter last year. And last month, we announced the beta version of our IBM Blockchain platform, Starter Plan designed for startups, developers and companies of any size that want to quickly stand up a blockchain network. In the first 2 weeks, we had over 750 networks provisioned.
Turning to transaction processing software. Revenue was up 1%, so another good quarter. Growth was driven by Z middleware as our clients continue to invest and grow their high-value mission-critical workloads on the Z platform.
Looking at profit. This quarter, pretax income from the segment grew 5%, and pretax margin was roughly flat year-to-year even with a nearly 2-point impact from workforce actions. Margins were driven by strong transactional performance in high-value areas, offset by ongoing investment into strategic areas and business mix.
Moving on to services. Global Business Services revenue was down 1% at constant currency, which is a modest improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter, and we again grew signings. Our strategic imperatives revenue reflects the ongoing shift to areas of higher client value, with growth across multiple areas like cloud and analytics.
Turning to the lines of businesses. Consulting revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter, and our backlog was up year-to-year. Revenue growth was led by strong double-digit growth in our Digital Strategy and iX business, which implements end-to-end digital transformation strategies for our clients. GBS is uniquely positioned to bring together IBM's first-mover advantage in the most promising emerging technologies like blockchain with their industry expertise to develop solutions, which help clients unlock value.
Looking at Application Management. Our revenue was down 2% this quarter, a 1-point sequential improvement from fourth quarter. Application Management signings grew at a double-digit rate as we leverage our incumbency to help clients modernize their critical applications and migrate to the cloud.
Turning to profit. GBS gross margin stabilized this quarter, a 2-point improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter. This includes about 0.5 point impact from currency. The improvement was driven by productivity, revenue mix and pricing improvements.
Pretax margin was down 3.5 points year-to-year, including an impact of nearly 2 points from the workforce rebalancing charges. This reflects our ongoing investments in the next generation of offerings, skills and enablement and the reshaping of our pyramids for each of our core service lines, which will drive operating leverage in the long term.
Turning to Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. We had good execution this quarter with trajectory improvement in revenue and profit and strong double-digit growth in signings. Revenue of $8.6 billion this quarter was down 1%, representing a 3-point improvement in year-to-year performance compared to last quarter. Signings grew double digits as clients continue to recognize the long-term value of our offerings and capabilities. At this level of signings growth, the TS&CP backlog trajectory improved 2 points with approximately 40% of that backlog now in key strategic workloads. 
Across the segment, the strategic imperatives revenue grew double digits, and the as-a-service exit run rate for this segment is now $7.4 billion.
We got a lot of momentum in our enterprise cloud value prop. And this quarter, our cloud signings in infrastructure services grew over 40% year-to-year. 
Infrastructure services revenue was flat, which is nearly a 5-point improvement from the fourth quarter rate. This was driven by improved revenue from backlog realization as expected.
We are helping clients drive efficiencies and gain agility in their IT environments through hybrid cloud. Our clients entrust us with their mission-critical foundational systems and rely on us to navigate the complexities of a disparate IT environment, along with data and regulatory frameworks as they move to the cloud.
Technical Support Services revenue declined 4% due in part to the dynamics of our hardware product cycle. Within TSS, our core multivendor support offerings continue to grow.
Integration software grew 1% with continued strong growth in SaaS across the portfolio and the adoption of the new IBM Cloud Private offering, where we now have over 200 clients using the platform. The integration software portfolio remains essential to clients as they connect multiple environments through a single architecture.
Turning to profit. Gross profit margin for this segment was down 60 basis points year-to-year, a 140 basis point sequential improvement from fourth quarter, driven by services where we had productivity and scale improvements and a better mix within integration software.
Pretax income margin was down 3 points year-to-year where, similar to GBS, workforce rebalancing charges had a 2-point impact. Adjusting for this, the pretax income margin dynamics were consistent with our gross margin dynamics.
In Systems, revenue grew again this quarter, as we modernize our systems for the most contemporary workloads. Performance was driven by both strong z14 momentum and growth in Power, mitigated by the decline in storage. This quarter, IBM Z revenue grew 54% year-to-year, a more than 100% growth in shipped MIPS, and margins expanded. The z14 adoption was again broad-based. We added new clients to the platform across several countries this quarter, including a services provider in Thailand who chose our LinuxONE for its blockchain solutions.
So we're continuing to address the emerging workloads across the Z platform like blockchain but also machine learning, DevOps and payments, with new workloads MIPS growing 4x as fast as our traditional MIPS. And last week, we announced the new z14 design specifically for cloud environments. Its industry-standard, single-frame design allows for easy placement into public cloud data centers and private cloud deployments. These latest systems bring the power of IBM Z to an even broader set of clients. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients' complex environments.
Power grew for the second consecutive quarter with revenue up 3%, driven by our entry-level portfolio and our cloud-enabled offerings. Power remains vital to many workloads, including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, UNIX and Linux, and we grew in all 4 this quarter.
We started transitioning to POWER9 in the fourth quarter, with the first installment of our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy. And late this quarter, we started shipping our POWER9 entry systems designed for AIX, IBM i and Linux workloads. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive AI workloads.
Storage hardware was down after 4 consecutive quarters of growth, driven by an increasingly competitive environment and continued pricing pressures, though we expanded margins. We also had some sales execution challenges, which impacted performance. Remember, what we are talking about here is just the hardware element of storage. Clearly, we've seen some of the value shift to software. In this quarter, we had strong growth in software-defined storage and cloud object storage, which are reported in transaction processing software.
Looking at profit for systems. Gross margin was down about 4 points year-to-year, including nearly a 5-point impact for the charge I referenced earlier in systems cost. Without that, gross margins expanded due to the relative strength in our higher-margin business and cost-efficiency actions.
Pretax margin was roughly flat year-to-year even with the impact associated with the significant items in cost and expense. So in our underlying performance, we expanded margins while successfully delivering innovation in support of our clients' evolving workload needs.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had another strong quarter. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. And after investing another $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year.
Our cash realization remains very strong at nearly 120% over the last 12 months. This performance puts us on track to achieve our full year expectation of free cash flow of approximately $12 billion.
Our results in the quarter were driven by performance in working capital, partially mitigated by higher cash taxes and higher CapEx, both headwinds we talked about back in January.
Looking at uses of cash in the quarter. We returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.4 billion in dividends. We bought back almost 5 million shares and had $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter.
On the balance sheet highlights, you can see we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in cash, and total debt was $46.4 billion. About 2/3 of our total debt was in support of our financing business. Our financing leverage remains at 9:1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables is strong at 53% investment-grade. That's consistent with December and 1 point better than a year ago. So our balance sheet is strong. We got flexibility we need. And with a strong quarter and the cash flow, we are on track for the year.
So let me make a few summary comments on the quarter and the year before we go to Q&A. We've been building and transforming our portfolio, our skills, our operating model to address what our enterprise clients need and what they value. Our results over the last few quarters reinforce that our clients value the integration of our innovative technologies, together with our industry expertise to help them in their journey to AI, their journey to cloud. And they value our approach to the protection of their data and their privacy.
In the first quarter, we built on the progress we made in the second half of last year. We improved our year-to-year revenue trajectory in Cognitive Solutions, in GBS, in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, and we continue to grow our Systems revenue. We improved our year-to-year trajectory and operating gross margins. It's better by 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter performance and better by 110 basis points when you adjust for the actions we took. 
The margin trajectory improvement was broad-based, with operating leverage coming from mix and from improved productivity. We continued our investments in our one-cloud architecture in emerging areas like blockchain and, more broadly, in skills and talent development. All together, we grew our revenue, operating net income, operating earnings per share and free cash flow. With this performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share, with about 40% of that in the first half. To put that in perspective, that's about 1 point ahead of our first half skew in 2017.
And so this was a good start to the year, and going forward, we're focused on delivering consistent operational performance.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia to kick off the Q&A.",3886

Thank you for the questions. So we'll go in 2 parts, let me address storage first. As I stated in the prepared remarks, we were disappointed in our storage performance. Especially after 4 quarters of growth, our 1Q fell below our own expectations. But I'll tell you, we have a great team with a proven track record. This is the same team that has proven that they've revitalized the portfolio in the past, took market share for 4 consecutive quarters, and now we had an impact in the first quarter predominantly just due to execution of transactions at the end of the quarter. This market in storage is -- continue to be very competitive and very aggressive. It is a battle right now on market share, but we feel comfortable that we've got new portfolio offerings that are coming out later in the year as we get through the latter half of the second quarter and then to third quarter and fourth quarter, and we've already taken significant actions on how our routes to market and our economic equation with all of our channel partners are put in place. And with that great team that has executed in the past, we have all the confidence in the world that we can get our storage business back to where it needs to be as we move forward in the second half of 2018. Now let me talk about your second question because, as you stated, there are a lot of dynamics that have played out this quarter, many of which we talked about 90 days ago. And so let me spend a couple of minutes to unpack this because I think we should spend our time on the fundamental underlying business performance when you take a look at our significant items that I talked about. So in January, during our guidance, we talked about we would have tax discretes. And in this quarter, as I stated, it was $810 million. As I stated, the largest driver of this was the conclusion of the 2013 and 2014 U.S. IRS audit. And I'll remind you, this reverses provisions previously taken in our tax rate in prior years, and it's noncash. So in addition to that, we took actions around continuing to reposition our business to revitalize our skill base to higher-value areas and also to better position our systems cost structure over the long term as we continue to look for ways to make a more variabilized model versus fixed-cost model. So as always, we included the charges and the benefits in our operating results. But in order to understand the underlying dynamics, and some of you have given me very good advice, we put in place a year-to-year bridge of our operating earnings per share to show you the implication of the net effect of those 2 events on a year-to-year basis. And as you saw in the chart, it was a headwind to us of $0.05 that we had overcome. So without those impacts, we improved the trajectory of our gross margin. Our gross margin was down 30 basis points. And in my books, that's stabilization. We expanded our pretax margin. We had solid earnings per share growth and free cash flow growth, and we delivered what we said in the quarter. Now in terms of savings, just wrapping it up, as you see, we took about a $610 million action to continue repositioning our business. We expect that to deliver 2x the investment and maybe a little bit more on an annualized basis. And we expect about half of that to be driven in second half of 2013. So I'd tell you, when you cut through it and you look at that operating earnings per share bridge year-to-year, we are focused on delivering consistent operational performance in this business to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders as we move forward.",654

You highlighted storage. Was that really the only area of disappointment in where you thought you were 90 days ago? And if we kind of look forward, I suppose critics could say the IT spending environment's very robust. You're benefiting from a mainframe cycle. Comparisons are relatively easy. Isn't this about as good as it gets? And when we look forward, should we be thinking about the high watermark for revenue growth being this quarter? Or what might change that?",104
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2018",2018-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4242.0,1491055.0,59070960.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question. A pretty long question, I'll try to make sure I can answer each component. First of all, as you stated, we did post revenue growth, $19.1 billion, up 5% at actual rates, up modestly at constant currency, which, as you saw in the chart, rounds to flat. And as I stated upfront, being transparent, we fell short to our own expectations. And I talked about storage already, and I'm not going to repeat that. We have confidence in the team, we have confidence in the portfolio and we know we're going to get back on the field and turn that business back to growth as we get into second half. But let's just play out a little of the dynamics of our first quarter in the profile of our revenue. We had strong growth, and let's start with the strategic imperatives, which are the signposts of us capturing the value and the secular shift so we can lead in the high-value IT segments moving forward, which are instrumental to our overall financial model. Our strategic imperatives were up 15% at actual rates and up 10% at constant currency. And on a trailing 12 months, we're at $37.7 billion, 47% of IBM. That trajectory, if you just play that out, says we will deliver our $40 billion signpost before the end of 2018. Now unpacking that strategic imperative, let's talk about the fundamental drivers of that. One, our cloud business. Our enterprise cloud continues to resonate from a strategy value prop, and we're continuing to gain momentum. Over the last 12 months, $17.7 billion of revenue, up 22% at actual rates. Our as-a-service component underneath that, $10.7 billion. That's up $400 million on an annualized exit run rate just from 3 months ago, and it's up 20% overall. In security, we have a leadership market share position. We're taking share. We're up 66%, $3.4 billion. So I would tell you the underlying dynamics of how we changed our portfolio, we are capitalizing on those secular shifts, and we're gaining market share overall. Now with regards to IBM's model, as we talked about a month ago when I spent time with you in Las Vegas at our website -- our investor webcast, our model is 1% to 3% low single-digit. We have a composition of our portfolio that delivers revenue contribution, operating leverage to deliver that investment thesis of being a high-value based company, delivering profit at mid-single-digit and high single-digit earnings per share and delivering free cash flow to deliver 70% to 80% back to our shareholders. So we feel confident that we've got the right portfolio lineup. We're well on pace to deliver that $40 billion earlier than 2018 (sic) [ 2019 ], and we've got the right team in place to go execute. Now just concluding, you asked about disappointments. Obviously, when you look at our performance, we said what we were going to go do. We returned Cognitive Solutions back to growth coming off of fourth quarter flat. It grew 2% at constant currency, and we had a great software quarter, returning analytics back to growth after last quarter, we talked about 90 days ago, we were disappointed. So great work on that team, and we continue to have momentum with regards to our security business and our industry verticals. Our Services business, we talked about 90 days ago, an improved backlog trajectory runout. And I -- you could see in our first quarter, that has played out, great improvement. TS&CP went from down 4 points at constant currency to down 80 points at constant currency. And we're making very good progress. We delivered double-digit signings growth. And our backlog improved in TS&CP. GBS, we made modest improvement. And that would be the second area that we got to pick up the rate and pace in addition to storage. We did improve the trajectory from down 2 to down 1. We improved our backlog by growing signings again. But our backlog's still down 5%, but our backlog trajectory runout still points to improving trajectory throughout the year, it would -- should enable us to get to revenue growth in the second half of the year if we continue to drive the required signings that fuel the backlog, that fuel the revenue. So there was a lot packed in there, but I appreciate the question, Toni. Thank you.",735

Can you give us some color on, in the underlying businesses, where you saw the most underlying improvement in PTI trends, if you ex out these significant items, some color on the confidence that you expect that they should improve materially from 2Q through the end of the year? And if I could just ask a clarifying question as well. What specifically where the significant items that impacted cognitive PTI margins? It seemed that you called out the skill-based trends were the high-value areas and systems cost structure but not quite sure what specifically impacted cognitives.",126
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2018",2018-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4242.0,1491055.0,59070963.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,12,"Sure. Thank you, Wamsi, and thank you for the compliment upfront. We are pleased with our performance here in the first quarter in its first instantiation as we make continued progress in delivering that consistency of operational performance I talked about in 2018. So let me first talk about the clarification question with regards to the significant items. As we talked about, we have repositioned our portfolio over the last couple of years, you know quite well. We continue to create new offerings to address new value in the market from a client perspective, and we'll continue to adapt that overall. And we -- to compete in that line of business, we got to continuously revitalize our skill base. And within parts of our Cognitive Solutions portfolio, in particular around areas of talent, collaboration and commerce, we are modernizing our set of offerings to address shifts in client value and address shifts in consumption models. And we need to revitalize our skills to compete in that area. So in Cognitive Solutions, that was predominantly a workforce remixing revitalization charge that was taken to SG&A. Now let's go to your overarching question and talk about what we see with regards to the fundamental trajectory of our business. And you asked the question in terms of pretax margins and how it's distorted. And that's why I'm glad Katy asked that question upfront because I think we got to get clarity on the underlying dynamics and the fundamentals of our business exiting first quarter. So let me just take a minute by each segment because I think each segment should be looked at a little differently. From a gross profit margin perspective, it is very appropriate to look at your services base of businesses just given the overarching cost structure on how you drive utilization and return on investment in a cost-of-service delivery model. So in services, I'll talk gross margin, but I'll start with Cognitive Solutions. Cognitive Solutions, our model is a model that looks at PTI margin expansion because our model is to deliver single-digit or mid-single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit pretax growth, i.e. no operating leverage. And when you take a look at our first quarter performance, all-in printed charges, we delivered revenue growth at actual rates at 6%, 2% at constant currency, and we delivered pretax income at 5%. So we are generated on that constant currency operating leverage. And at actual rates, we delivered our model. Now that's with all the charges in. Excluding the charges, we delivered 12% pretax income growth, so 2x the revenue growth, as we continue to generate significant value out of our high-value based offerings and making great progress from where we were 90 days ago. Now let's look at our services business, one in GBS. GBS, we improved the trajectory of our gross margin quarter-to-quarter by 200 basis points, and that is all the great work the GBS teams are doing all around the world around driving mix and value out of a whole new set of offerings. Our SI business has greater margins than our core business. And you know almost 2/3 of our in GBS business is now in SI as we continue to generate momentum with double-digit growth. But also, we are seeing price margins in our signings every quarter going up 2 to 3 points. Now we got a lot of work to do, and we're driving that work around workforce optimization productivity. Mark talked about refining our skill pyramid and getting the utilization and infusing AI and automation to improve delivery to go realize those margins. And we're starting to see some improvement, and we fully expect that trajectory to continue as we move into second half. Now TS&CP. TS&CP improved their gross margin, which is the right way of looking at that business as we invest in our cloud to build out our leadership capability, and we continue to drive the effective utilization of our GTS business. We improved our margins almost 150 basis points from fourth quarter. We printed down 60 basis points. So we made substantial trajectory improvement. That is being driven based on continued scale efficiencies with our cloud momentum and our as-a-service momentum, but it's also being driven by the tough work in redesigning our delivery models, infusing automation. The IBM Service Platform with Watson now covers over 1,250 clients, and we're scaling that every single day. And we're driving actions around our workforce optimization and structure. So great trajectory improvement in our GBS and our GTS, and we fully expect that to continue to move forward in second half. And we expect our services margins to be accretive in the second half, not just talking about trajectory improvements. And then finally, in Systems. Our systems, we repositioned our portfolio through continuous reinvention of our platforms and capitalizing on secular shifts in new workloads. We had good growth in the quarter. Our margins were down, but that was driven based on the charge we took to better position the long-term structure of our Systems business. Ex that charge, our margins were up, and they were up in almost every segment of that to business. So thanks, Wamsi, for the question.",868

As we discussed 90 days ago, we said that we would expect in 2018 that our ongoing underlying operating tax rate will be in the range of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, before discretes. I would tell you that, that still remains today. We executed on what we disclosed 90 days ago about expecting tax discretes in the first quarter. But as you know, these tax discretes, by definition, they're unknown in timing and in scope. And we're continuing to drive the tax optimization as you would expect of us because it's a critical element of our underlying operating leverage in our company and our financial strategy. But right now, I would fully expect 16%, plus or minus 2%, as we move forward. And one last thing, consistent with what I said 90 days ago is that on a full year basis, all-in, we still expect tax to be a headwind.",158

Just with the signings, that was encouraging, right? It was -- it sounds like signings were double-digit in some key areas, including app maintenance. It sounds like -- you mentioned price margin was also up, Jim. So I'm just trying to reconcile the signings commentary with the actions to reposition, the workforce rebalancing, which I presume will include services headcount. So are you going to see any negative revenue impact from the actions on the services side? Again, just trying to reconcile the actions and the potential revenue loss with the strong signings and what it means for the outlook, if that makes sense.",113

Yes, we were definitely pleased with our signings performance in the quarter. As I indicated, we delivered over $9 billion of signings, up double digits and up across each of our businesses. And that has positioned our backlog now at $120 billion, and that's up 4%. I would argue, 4% at actual rates is the right way of looking at backlog because that's what's going to play out as time goes on at current spot rates. So we're pleased with that overall. But the underpinnings, when you get underneath signings and backlog, in GTS, we grew signings 20% year-over-year, with over 40% in cloud. And then our Infrastructure Services or our outsourcing business backlog is now about 1 point better where it was a quarter ago. And we improved our overarching GTS backlog quarter-to-quarter. And as I talked about on March 8 at the Investor Day webcast, remember, we've kind of held our outsourcing backlog pretty consistent over a decade. And now we've changed and capitalized on the secular shifts, and about 40% of that underlying backlog now sits in strategic imperative areas of which cloud makes up the biggest piece. And the other important point around signings I will talk about is when you look at the good growth in signings we had in the first quarter, over 40% of that was driven by cloud-based signings. So we are capitalizing or winning, and we're improving the trajectory of our business. Now let me talk a little bit about margin because I spent on the last answer the trajectory improvement, substantial trajectory improvement we saw quarter-over-quarter, 200 basis points in GBS and 150 basis points in TS&CP. The way I like to look at these margins as we spent in the last 2 earnings calls, I look at the fundamental drivers of how you operate that business, both from a human capital base perspective. You got to drive scale efficiency, you got to drive mix through value and price, you got to drive productivity, your fundamental human capital. And then as you get operating leverage -- you should be able to get growth through operating leverage. So those 4 buckets, and we -- and you look at our first quarter performance, we made progress across the board. Now we got work to do going forward. But based on the trajectory and the actions we took to reposition our business, that makes me comfortable stating that in the second half, our services margins will be accretive.",421

Could you just walk me through what you think are the top 2, 3 things, levers, that can help you go from gross margins declining in Q1? Just since you assumed the stabilization for calendar '18, which has implied margins that lets you go up for the next 3 quarters, including Q3 where I think compares get tougher? So just what are the 2, 3 things that give you confidence margins could improve for the remainder of the year?",106
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2018",2018-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4242.0,1491055.0,59070972.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Yes. So let's talk about this. So I gave guidance of maintaining at least the $13.80. And as we talked about, there's always many scenarios. The team, we drive them like crazy here in a very short period of time to get ready for this call. But we look at the trajectory of our business, we look at all of our operational indices. And that positions how we can triangulate around the guidance that we give externally across our financial model strategy we talked about in Investor Day: revenue contribution, that is growth, mix, scale; and around operating leverage, that is productivity. And that is, as we get that growth, what's that operating leverage we're going to get on human capital. So it positions both top line and overall margins. So let me just give you a perspective of what we see underpinning the $13.80 in terms of gross margin. 1Q, as you talked about, we printed, all-in, down 70 basis points. If you exclude the significant items so that you can understand the underlying trajectory of our business going forward, our margins were down 30 basis points. That's coming off of fourth quarter being down 140. In my book, that's stabilization, and that's what we guided to in first quarter, and that's what we delivered. Now with that trajectory improvement that we saw, and it being pervasive across continuing to get scale, continuing to get improvements in productivity, which we missed, by the way, if you remember our discussions 90 days ago, and around mix, we do see that trajectory improvement to move forward. But our full year guidance only requires stabilization of margin. And the actions that we took in the first quarter, I would tell you, positions us better than when I sat here 90 days ago on how we can deliver the fundamental dynamics across multiple scenarios of delivering at least that $13.80. And if you play out those drivers, since you asked, first, we are going to continue to invest capital to build out our enterprise cloud and build on that momentum in as-a-service, and we're going to continue getting scale efficiencies. We made significant investments historically. That has been a headwind to us. And we are minimizing that headwind every single quarter as we get scale efficiencies. And I expect that to continue. Second, as I just talked about, the increased yield in services productivity, we expect that to play out. Workforce optimization, a mix of higher value in capture and price, infusing AI and automation on our delivery platforms, we expect that to play out and deliver significantly in the second half. Now both of these pieces, the efficiency and the productivity and scale-out are required because we all know, as we enter the second half, we have a significant headwind on mix because we are not counting on more than a typical mainframe cycle. Our mainframe, we are very pleased with the performance so far. Program to-date, we're above our prior program. We are capitalizing on secular shifts with the value of our pervasive encryption in blockchain. But it would not be prudent right now to predict or to predicate our $13.80 guidance on breaking a mainframe cycle. So that mix headwind is facing us in the latter half of 3Q and 4Q, and we need to overcome it with the scale-out efficiencies and with the increased productivity and based on the actions we took in the first quarter to better reposition the business for the long term, I feel more confident than I did 90 days ago.",596

Is there anything you can give us in terms of how we should think about the legacy outsourcing business at IBM, all those 3- and 5- and 7-year outsourcing deals that were consummated before IBM became a bigger and better cloud vendor in the last couple of years? Is there any sort of cycle forthcoming where, as those deals on one we could see conversion or transition to more of a cloud-like workload for those customers and, therefore, you achieve better scale out of your 58 data centers? Is that something that could happen this year? Or is it something more 2019 or '20?",128

I would tell you, we're seeing that already. I mean, the secular shifts that have happened in the marketplace and are happening and will continue to happen are right in front of us. And that's why I thought it was very interesting and why we shared some of the signpost data about our outsourcing composition and our backlog and how we've been able to maintain it over a decade-long period while continuing to capture those secular shifts in cloud. Today, as we exit first quarter, a total backlog of $120 billion, our outsourcing backlog is somewhere around that $80 billion number. And within that, our shift to cloud is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% to 30% already. That is providing us tremendous scale efficiency as we leverage in the 58. Actually, I think now we're north of 60 data centers in -- cloud data centers around the world. And we'll continue to differentiate ourselves as we move forward. So we have been focused. I think it's an attestation to the value of incumbency, the value of trust. And we talked about the differentiators, about our innovative technology, about our deep industry expertise and about the trust and security of our clients. Our GTS business are managing the critical workflows and critical business processes of our clients. And as they look for efficiency in delivering a new model around cloud, we are actually capitalizing on that as we move forward. So not only will it help our revenue, it will help, at the end of the day, our margin and our scale efficiencies as we go forward.",271

You did a good job of explaining the dynamics by business unit. That said, we have this issue of comping the mainframe cycle later this year. And you just stated we probably shouldn't count on an elongated cycle. So are the improving service metrics that you shared sufficient to give you more confidence that these businesses will be sufficiently positioned to offset those headwinds that'll be created by the anniversary of the cycle whenever it may happen? And then just secondly, a point of clarification. Should we expect the margin benefit from the significant items to benefit both the second half of this year and the first half of next year on a year-over-year basis?",132
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2018",2018-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4242.0,1491055.0,59070978.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,27,"Yes, David, thank you very much for your question. So let me address the second one first because I think that's a short answer. As I stated, both in the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we expect the annualized savings to be 2x the investment, and we'd get about half in the second half. So obviously, yes, that also strategically positions us for the first half plus, going forward, into 2019 because remember, we took these actions to better reposition our business for the long term and what's required to continue to generate and create client value and shareholder value as we move forward. So that's the first question. The second, as I -- that's why -- specifically, with regards to your wraparound fourth quarter mainframe, et cetera, that's why I specifically walked through the margin dynamics of what we see playing out throughout the year. We realized, and I think it's prudent based on what we've done with our guidance of at least $13.80, we know we got a mix headwind. Now believe me, we got an entire mainframe team in 170 countries around the world that are driving like crazy to deliver the value to our clients to make this a secular shift versus cyclical. We'll put that aside for right now, that's for tomorrow as we go drive the operational execution being 17 days already into the second quarter. But we do see scale efficiencies based on the momentum trajectory of our cloud business and as-a-service. We see productivity played out very nicely for us in the first quarter. And with the actions we took in the first quarter, it positions us for the second half as we move forward to get our Services business to accretive margins to help us overall. And lastly, when you take a look at it, we returned our Cognitive Solutions back to revenue growth at top line. That carries high profit, high-value based activity. We expect that trajectory to continue. And again, that backlog runout is playing out, and we got to just continue to drive the signings to fuel that backlog to get revenue in the second half, and we feel comfortable with that.
Now with that, let me wrap up the call by again saying we're very pleased with the start of the year. We gave you guidance 90 days ago. We said we'd deliver at least $13.80, 17% to 18%. We delivered at the high end of that earnings per share guidance of 17% to 18%. We made substantial progress across many parts of our business. We took significant actions to reposition the long-term position of our company, and we are on track to deliver our full year objectives of at least $13.80 and deliver revenue growth at current spot rates; stable margins, which is all we need to deliver that $13.80; and free cash flow of at least $12 billion. The first quarter was an instantiation of that. We delivered revenue growth. We delivered operating profit growth. We delivered free cash flow growth. We delivered earnings per share growth, all-in. And that positions us now as we're focused, as I started this call, on delivering consistent operational execution in this business as we move forward. So thank you all for joining the call.",546

In the second quarter, we delivered $20 billion of revenue, $3.4 billion of operating pretax income and $3.08 of operating earnings per share. Overall, it was a good quarter. We grew revenue, operating gross profit, pretax income and earnings per share with strong pretax margin performance. Our revenue was up 4% as reported with growth in all 4 of our major segments. And our constant currency revenue growth was 2%. This is our best constant currency growth in 7 years, and our pretax income was up 11%, reflecting good operating leverage on net revenue growth.
Looking at our performance at constant currency. The revenue trajectory improved in both services segments, and both returned to modest growth. This is important to our overall revenue growth profile as services represents about 60% of our revenue on an annual basis.
In cognitive, we had good performance in analytics and in our industry verticals driven by financial services and IoT. Growth was mitigated by the same 3 areas I told you about on our last call as we continue to focus on repositioning these offerings. And we had strong performance and gained share in our Systems business, which was up over 20% with growth across all 3 hardware platforms.
Across our segments, we had continued momentum in our Strategic Imperatives revenue. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39 billion, which represents 48% of IBM's revenue, and within that, cloud is now $18.5 billion. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the quarter was up 15% and accelerated to 13% at constant currency. Revenue performance this quarter was led by security and cloud.
Security was up about 80% this quarter, driven by strong demand for the pervasive encryption of IBM Z and growth in our integrated software and services business. Cloud revenue was up 20% or 18% at constant currency, driven by our as-a-service offerings. We're exiting the second quarter with an as-a-service annual run rate of over $11 billion, which is up about 25%. This reflects our success in helping enterprise clients with their journey to the cloud, and we're becoming the destination for mission-critical workloads in hybrid environments. We're capturing this high-value growth with our unique differentiation of innovative technology, combined with deep industry expertise, underpinned with trust and security, all through our integrated model.
You saw that this quarter in a long-term partnership with the Australian government valued at about $740 million to automate and digitize government services, leveraging IBM Systems, Software and Cloud-based solutions. We expanded our work at Crédit Mutuel, who is using the IBM Cloud, Security, IBM Z and Watson to drive its next wave of transformation across its business lines. We delivered the world's most powerful supercomputer to the U.S. Department of Energy. We had competitive cloud wins at leading companies like ExxonMobil, Amtrak and Telefónica de España. We signed a deal with Anthem, where we'll help them drive their digital transformation to deliver an enhanced digital experience for millions of health plan consumers. And in total, we signed 13 services deals over $100 million this quarter. These are just a few of the new client engagements that will play out over the coming quarters and years, and putting this together with our first half performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for the year.
Before getting into the detailed financial metrics, I want to provide a perspective on the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth for the quarter. What it shows is we delivered 5% growth despite a significant tax headwind. So let me break it down. Our 4% revenue growth contributed $0.10 of earnings per share growth at constant margin. We realized good pretax operating leverage on that revenue growth with 11% growth in pretax income, and we expanded our pretax margin by 110 basis points. About 2/3 of that pretax income growth came from gross profit dollars, which were up 2%, driven by profit growth in Global Business Services and Systems. Gross margin was down 60 basis points year-to-year. About half was due to mix and half from the continued investments we've been making to build out our IBM Cloud. Productivity was fairly neutral to the year-to-year gross margin dynamics in the quarter, and as we discussed last quarter, the benefit from actions we took earlier in the year will ramp up in the second half. The remaining third of the pretax income growth came from efficiencies we've been driving in our expense structure. And then, as I said, tax was a significant headwind, driven primarily by a discrete tax benefit last year. Finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, we delivered the 5% growth with good contribution from revenue, pretax margin expansion and to a lesser extent, share repurchases.
Looking at our key financial metrics. As I said, revenue is up 4%. Currency contributed 2 points, which is about half the contribution based on the spot rates at the time of our first quarter earnings call. And I'll remind you, the significant volatility in currencies has implications across the income statement, not just revenue. Constant currency revenue was up 2%, which is essentially all organic. I'll talk to revenue on a constant currency basis going forward.
Our revenue growth was broad based across geographies and sectors. We had growth in more than 60 countries, representing over 80% of IBM's revenue. EMEA growth accelerated to 4%, led by Germany, the U.K., France and Spain with pervasive growth across business areas.
Looking at our operating pretax income growth of 11%. I said that about 1/3 of that was from operating expense, which was better by 2%. This includes a 2 point impact from currency, which is significantly less than the first quarter impact due to the dollar strengthening. And so our base expense was better by 4%.
As we continue to invest to build our innovation pipeline in areas like AI, in security and blockchain, we're also realizing acquisition synergies and driving operational efficiencies by streamlining our management system, scaling agile and implementing new ways of working. I talked about some of these in our webcast back in March, and we're seeing the benefit not only in improved speed and responsiveness but also in a more efficient structure.
Within expense, we also absorbed a lower level of IP income, which was down $115 million year-to-year in the quarter and about $240 million in the first half. Our operating tax rate of 16% was up nearly 7 points with just over 1 point from the underlying rate and the balance from last year's discrete tax benefits of $170 million.
Looking at the cash metrics. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.2 billion in the first half, which is down $400 million year-to-year. Our solid working capital performance was more than offset by a cash tax headwind and growth in capital investment, consistent with what we discussed earlier in the year. Remember, there's a lot of seasonality in our cash generation, and over the last 12 months, we generated $12.6 billion. That's 111% of GAAP net income.
Now turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. We had continued growth in our as-a-service revenue, exiting the quarter with an annualized run rate of $2 billion. Within solutions software, we're scaling new platforms and solutions with growth in several key areas. I'll name a few. Growth in our underlying analytics platform was led by Db2 portfolio, our data science offerings and our new IBM Cloud Private for data offering, which makes data ready for AI across the clouds.
In our Watson platform, the AI platform for business, growth reflects strong demand for our new virtual assistant offering with triple-digit growth in our Conversation service usage. Clients using Watson and System include Prodesco, Orange Bank, Autodesk, Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone and LivePerson to name a few. Watson is both a platform on its own and a driver of growth and differentiation in several of our industry verticals. Our industry verticals continue to scale, led by IoT and Watson for financial services. IoT growth was driven by Maximo, which is the #1 asset management solution; and TRIRIGA, the #1 facilities management solution.
Financial services reflects strong performance in our risk and regulatory business and financial crimes portfolio, leveraging our Promontory skills and AI technologies. In Watson Health, we had good performance in areas like payer and life sciences. And in emerging areas like blockchain, we've now seeded the market with over 60 active blockchain networks. This quarter, we launched we.trade with 9 large banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC and Natixis. This is the first live blockchain-based bank-to-bank trading platform. Growth in these areas is offset by a transition in some areas I talked about in April, specifically talent, collaboration and commerce, which today are a combination of on-prem and SaaS offerings. We are modernizing our offerings and making investments to address the secular shifts in the market. Keep in mind, the time to value of these investments is longer in SaaS.
Our transaction processing software was down 2%, driven by declines in storage software. Within TPS, we had growth in IBM Z middleware and Power middleware.
Looking at profit this quarter. We grew pretax income 9% and expanded pretax margin by over 2 points year-to-year, driven by operational efficiencies and acquisition synergies while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas such as AI, security and blockchain.
Before getting into Global Business Services, let me give you a perspective on our total services business across the 2 segments. We continue to make good progress. Our services signings grew. The year-to-year services backlog trajectory improved from last quarter. Services revenue returned to growth, and we had a modest improvement in the year-to-year services gross margin trajectory.
Our signings were up 6%, and within that, we had 13 deals over $100 million. So we're clearly winning in a competitive environment. We're addressing the fundamental shifts in the industry like helping clients implement hybrid cloud and manage security services. This is driving a shift in our backlog content with nearly 30% of our outsourcing backlog now in cloud.
And then looking at the services gross margin. It was down just 25 basis points year-to-year. I'll remind you again that we have most of the benefits from the first quarter productivity actions still ahead of us.
So now let's get into the 2 segments. Global Business Services returned to modest revenue growth, increased gross profit dollars and expanded gross margins. We're realizing the improved revenue trajectory from the runout of our opening backlog for the year. Our strategic imperatives grew 6% with strong performance in the as-a-service offerings, which were up 25%. We have talked about how we've realigned our practice model around 3 growth platforms: digital transformation, cloud application and cognitive processes. While all are progressing, we have particular strength in digital, which again grew strong double digits. This was driven by digital business strategy and by our mobile offerings.
Across these platforms, consulting revenue growth accelerated to 4% year-to-year, led by our offerings in digital and cloud. Our GBS consulting practice brings business expertise together with technology expertise to unlock value for our clients. For example, this quarter, IBM digital and Mediaocean launched a blockchain consortium comprised of leading advertisers and publishers, including Kellogg, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Pfizer, to set the new industry standard for the digital ad buying ecosystem. We're continuing to invest, recently announcing the acquisition of Oniqua Holdings, which adds technology and professional expertise and asset optimization. This strengthens our integrated IoT platform across Cognitive Solutions and GBS.
Application management services revenue was down 3%, reflecting continued declines in traditional enterprise application managed services. We're growing in strategic offerings like Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development. The increased demand in these areas has led to 2 consecutive quarters of double-digit signings growth in application management.
Turning to gross profit. GBS' gross margin grew 130 basis points year-to-year. We have done a lot of work to transform our portfolio and reposition our offerings to capture improved price for value. And we are also starting to see early contributions from our productivity actions around labor models and structure. In summary, GBS delivered a solid quarter, and we are starting to see the realization of our initiatives in our results.
In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, revenue returned to growth. Similar to GBS, this performance was driven primarily by our improved opening backlog runout dynamics. The strategic imperatives revenue in this segment grew 24%. This was led by cloud, which grew 27%; and our as-a-service revenue grew 30%, which is up about 6 points sequentially and is now at an annualized run rate of $7.6 billion.
Infrastructure services revenue growth improved to 1% this quarter as we continue to help clients on their journey to cloud. The IBM Cloud enables clients to migrate, modernize and build new cloud apps, is AI ready and secured to the core.
This quarter, we completed the migration of Westpac's core banking applications to the IBM Cloud. It's just one example of how we're becoming the go-to destination for mission-critical workloads on the cloud.
We're continuing to build capabilities, recently announcing an expansion to 18 availability zones for the IBM Cloud across the world. The expanded global footprint is important as clients look to maintain control of their data as they implement hybrid, especially given the increased data regulations.
In Technical Support Services, revenue was down 4%. As is always the case with the Z launch, we're seeing a short-term impact in our maintenance stream, as IBM Z sales move clients from maintenance to warranty for the first year. The impact to maintenance is becoming more pronounced now with the higher adoption rates by existing clients in the strong current Z cycle. This impact was moderated by continued growth in our multi-vendor support offerings.
Integration software grew 1%. We had good performance in offerings that modernize applications and enable cloud adoption. This includes offerings like IBM Cloud Private, which helps clients to develop cloud native applications behind their firewall. We've added 100 new clients in the second quarter and now have over 300 clients since the product was announced at the end of last year.
Turning to gross profit. Margin for this segment was down 1 point from last year. The majority of this decline was driven by the revenue mix away from higher-margin TSS in the quarter with the remainder driven by continued scale-out of our cloud. We did have some productivity benefits, but as I said earlier, the actions we took in the first quarter will yield predominantly in the back half of the year.
In Systems, we grew revenue again as we continue to deliver innovative technologies that address today's most contemporary workloads. All 3 brands, IBM Z, Power and storage, grew, and we gained share overall. In the second quarter, IBM Z grew revenues by 112% year-to-year on nearly 200% MIPS growth, again driven by new workload MIPS. z14 adoption remained broad based and after 4 quarters, continues to track ahead of the prior program. The value prop benefits existing IBM Z clients who are growing and expanding workloads on z14 this quarter, whether it's e-commerce sales, mobile banking volumes, machine learning or emerging blockchain services. And we're adding new clients from all corners of the globe from a managed care provider in the U.S. to a university in Canada, to an electronics distributor in Italy, to a bank in Africa. We also had good acceptance of our new single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments, which launched earlier in the quarter.
Power revenue was up 4%, driven by adoption of our new POWER9 entry-level portfolio and continued growth in Linux. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets.
We continue to roll out our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs. As part of our deployment, the U.S. government recently unveiled POWER9-based Summit, the world's most powerful supercomputer, which is ranked #1 in the top 500 list of commercially available computers. This is the first time in over 5 years that a U.S. company topped the list.
Storage hardware returned to growth this quarter after facing some sales execution challenges in a competitive market last quarter. This growth was broad based geographically and led by strong growth in all-flash arrays. Flash grew double digits across the portfolio and took share. We are coming out with new offerings, including a new mid-range flat system announced last week with industry-leading performance technology.
Turning to profit. Systems pretax income was up about $275 million year-to-year, and pretax margin was up over 10 points, so solid performance.
Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables and $1.9 billion of free cash flow. And so in the first half, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down $400 million from last year. This reflects solid working capital performance offset by a $300 million increase in CapEx as we build out global cloud data centers and $700 million more of cash tax payments. We've now got the entire cash tax headwind that we expect for the year behind us.
Looking at uses of cash for the half. We returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. In April, we again raised our dividend, and with that, we now tripled our dividend per share over the last decade. In the first half, we bought back nearly 12 million shares, ending June with 913 million shares outstanding and $2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights. Our cash and total debt levels are pretty consistent with last June. About 2/3 of our debt supports our financing business, which is leveraged at 9:1. And the majority of our financing receivables, 54% are at investment grade, which is 2 points better than this time last year. So our balance sheet remains strong with plenty of flexibility to support our investments and shareholder returns over the longer term.
In summary, our performance this quarter underscores the extent to which we have repositioned our business over the last several years. As I said, nearly half of our revenue is aligned with the strategic imperatives, which represent the emerging high-value, high-growth segments in our industry. This also reflects a major portfolio shift for IBM, driven, as we discussed at our investor webcast in March, by major shifts in our capital allocation and investment strategy. Those shifts reflect our vision of what clients would value in a rapidly reordering IT industry, driven by cloud, data and AI. And that is innovative technology in key emerging areas, the expertise to apply that technology in the industry-specific processes and workflows and the commitment that their enterprise data would be handled responsibly.
This is IBM's differentiation, and we're seeing it come through in our revenue and profit performance. This quarter, we delivered 2% constant currency revenue growth, 11% operating pretax income growth and 5% earnings per share growth, capping off a first half where we also grew revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. As always, we have some tailwinds and headwinds as we move into the second half, but with this performance and our continued focus on driving consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow in the range of $12 billion.

You alluded to a few factors in there. I was wondering if you could provide some more granularity on the drivers of that BTI margin expansion between the operational efficiencies, the acquisition synergies that you alluded to and the relative pace of investments. And secondarily, your base expense decline was quite significant in the quarter. Can you talk about the trajectory of that in the second half, especially given some of the cost actions that you said are yet to be reflected, the cost actions that you took at 1Q that are yet to be reflected in the back half?",115
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4555.0,1503595.0,59468363.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,6,"Sure, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the question. Our -- let me address the Cognitive Solutions segment first and talk about constant currency and then get to the operating leverage component. And then I'll address your expense question next. Cognitive Solutions, first of all, as you all know, our financial model for the Cognitive Solutions segment is to deliver growth and also deliver operating leverage consistent with that growth. And what we've been seeing over the last couple quarters, as we've been driving the acquisition integration synergies across our business, we've been seeing that operating leverage well in advance of our actual revenue growth within that segment. We've also been driving operational efficiencies and synergies around redefining how we do work, redefining development optimization, applying agile methodologies and getting better speed, responsiveness, cycle time and throughput and output within our organization. So we're getting more value for dollar spend overall. And you see that play out in operating leverage in that segment in the first quarter, and you've seen it play out in the second quarter with strong profit growth of 9% on that constant currency revenue growth. So we continue to expect that as we move forward, and we'll continue to leverage and get value out of that business overall. In terms of expense dynamics, you heard in the prepared remarks our operating expense was better by 2%, but there are many different components within that operating expense 2% better. First and foremost, currency had impacted our operating expense by 2 points. Now I will tell you that was about half of the impact or even a little bit less than half the impact than we expected 90 days ago just given the volatility of what's been happening in the FX markets, in particular, around the U.S. dollar appreciation. So the last couple quarters, currency is impacted by expense by 4 to 5 points. Now it was only a 2 point impact. So our base productivity was about 4% better, and that is being driven as we continue to drive the operating leverage through our enterprise productivity initiatives around reinventing IBM and how we actually do work, changing our management system, addressing our structure, attacking costs and complexity, aligning decision rights and driving accountability. So that 4% is a base level of productivity that we're driving, and we expect that going forward. And then I'll just add one other point, and that is on IP income. You see through the second quarter, our IP income was down by over $100 million, $115 million, I think, to be exact, and through the first half, it's down nearly $250 million overall. So we continue to leverage and monetize the value of our research and development spending, and we continue to invest in those areas. And we'll opportunistically optimize that through many monetization models, but IP right now is down $115 million. When you bring all that together, it's delivering substantial operating leverage to our business as you've seen here in the second quarter.",503

What are you expecting in terms of second half mainframe compares? Are we going to be down year-over-year in the third and then down pretty severely in the fourth? And then just a follow-up on your currency comments. I assume you're losing about $2 billion of revenue in the second half relative to what you expected back in April. Have you taken actions to compensate for that to get to your $13.80 to get to your $12 billion of free cash flow?,99
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4555.0,1503595.0,59468366.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Yes. So thank you, Steve. Many questions there. So let me take each one individually. First of all, yes, we had a very strong systems quarter overall, both on revenue and on operating leverage where we grew pretax income over 10 points year-over-year. But let's put the quarter in perspective. We delivered 4% revenue overall, 2% at constant currency. It was our strongest constant currency revenue growth rate in over 7 years, and it was led by our continued acceleration in our strategic imperatives, which were up 15% at actual, 13% at constant currency. That was an acceleration from the first quarter, and within that, our cloud business, $18.5 billion, up 23%; our as-a-service annualized run rate now over $11 billion, that's up 24%. And our services businesses returned back to growth at constant currency, both GBS, which had a great quarter and TS&CP. But even if you take our Systems business, and to your question around mainframe, and if we take mainframe out, you would see those same dynamics in the quarter-to-quarter acceleration of our strategic imperative business. And as you all know, in our as-a-service acceleration of over $11 billion growing 24%, that doesn't have any Systems business within it. And the last point I'll bring up around top line, then I'll get to your other questions, we had broad-based geographic and sector growth across our business, probably the best breadth and growth across the number of countries that we've had in quite a period of time. 60-plus countries grew at constant currency, and that represented over 80% of IBM's revenue. And if you extract out the mainframe cycle, we still had over 60% of our -- or, excuse me, 60 countries that actually grew, and those are large countries like Japan, like U.K., like Germany, France, Spain, Australia, many which are not mainframe dominant. So we see continuing momentum. Now with regards to mainframe, I'm not going to apologize. This is the most enduring platform that you've seen out there, and we continue to capitalize on gaining new emerging workloads onto that platform. And we delivered substantial growth in the second quarter, over 100% growth, so -- and we tripled our installed MIPS inventory that we ship. And we're capturing over 60% of that MIPS shipped is in specialty workloads. So through the first 4 quarters -- now it's pertinent time to have the discussion. Through the first 4 quarters, we are well in advance of what the prior cycle was. And with regards to your question about second half, I would expect that to continue in the second half as we move forward. We know in the fourth quarter that we got a tremendous compare, and I talked about that 90 days ago. So we will have an impact, but we've got momentum in our services businesses returning to growth. And as you know, that's 60% of our business overall. Now with regards to currency, I'm glad you brought that up. We've seen dramatic volatility over the last 90 days since our last earnings call. And to put it in perspective, we had stated here 90 days ago that we expected about a 4 point tailwind in the second quarter coming off of a 5 point tailwind in the first quarter, and you see that, that only ended up being a little bit over 2 points of a tailwind in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar appreciated significantly against most currencies. Now when we look at the second half, the second half, we see about a 1 to 2 point headwind. Currency will flip, and that's about somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion, including second quarter's $400 million that I talked about. Now with that said, currency, you understand the top line dynamic of revenue. But currency also impacts margins, and they impact expense. From a margin perspective, if you look at -- we've got 2 different businesses. We got product-based businesses, and we got services-based businesses. On product-based businesses, you don't have a direct alignment of your sources of revenue and your sources of costs. So that translation revenue impact that you see in our product-based businesses of hardware, software and services, you will see a gross margin impact on that at the GP line. Services where you have a much more alignment of source of revenue and cost, we have basically a natural hedge, you won't see a gross profit impact on that revenue translation. But as you all know, we drive a hedging program to mitigate the foreign exchange volatility at a profit level. Why? Because it gives us time to address our pricing terms, our structure and our sourcing strategies. So at a PTI level, you see a very de minimis impact in period. Currency doesn't eliminate -- or excuse me, hedging doesn't eliminate. It only defers it, but in a -- at a profit level, it's a very de minimis impact, but it impacts the P&L differently as we move forward.",832

And the 2% growth was a nice surprise this quarter, but you're not quite at consistent and meaningful growth across the businesses.

Yes. As you stated, we delivered a very solid quarter at 2% constant currency, and I would tell you, it's our third straight quarter of growth overall with an acceleration in terms of breadth and depth across geographies, across sectors and across countries around the world. But let's take a look at our portfolio. First and foremost, we are very confident in the portfolio lineup that we have here today around each of our segments. We talked about at our Investor Day the value differentiation of IBM, and that value differentiation is built around innovative technology, around deep industry expertise and around trust and security, all delivered through an integrated model. And if you take a look at it, we talked about the key value differentiators as we move forward. And the value of bringing that together, I think, you're seeing instantiated now here in the second quarter with very strong growth overall in our systems platform, in the importance they play to our infrastructure, in our integrated model. You see our services base of businesses continue that trajectory improvement that we talked about starting in January of this year. We improved in the first quarter, and now we got both businesses back to growth. And we delivered double-digit signings at actual rates in the first half, which positions us well as we move forward. But our model overall, we've done a lot of work around remixing our capital and investment to build out the portfolio that we have today, and we're very disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. We said 70% to 80% of that capital and investment is going to go back to our shareholders in the form of share buyback and dividend. And you saw us raise our dividend here in April this year, our 23rd straight year. But the remainder is for us to use internally to build out our differentiated capability around investments in R&D and capital to drive leadership in AI, leadership in blockchain, leadership in security and leadership now in quantum as we move forward. But acquisitions are an integral part, and we're going to continue to evaluate our portfolio and how we capitalize the value of those acquisitions in light of the integrated, differentiated strategy of the IBM company going forward.",385

It was down at constant currency versus a pretty easy comparison. And it's the business that has the highest percentage of strategic initiatives in it, so it's obviously very important for you. Can you maybe comment specifically on what's happening with Watson Health? There were lots of press reports about a significant retrenchment in that business. And I know you said the acquisitions take time, but you've had them all for at least a year. And so maybe you can comment on why you think we haven't seen better revenue progress or what specifically happened this quarter. And then very quickly, if you could just confirm, you talked about flattish gross margins for the year. You're down in each of the first 2 quarters year-over-year. So should we be expecting gross margins to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year in the second half to sort of hit that bogey of flattish?",171
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4555.0,1503595.0,59468372.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"All right, Toni. There's a lot you compacted in a multiple-part question, but let me try to address each piece. So we'll start with cognitive. In terms of our Cognitive Solutions, we have a strong portfolio in the key strategic areas around analytics, around industry verticals, around security and around IoT, and we continue to see good performance overall. But I'll remind you, this portfolio is a high annuity content. Over 80% of the business is annuity with strong renewal rates we continue to drive, but that SaaS has a longer time to value and longer time to realization. But let me unpack the segment because you got to understand the piece parts because they each fit different purposes within the overarching IBM strategy and purpose. One is around TPS. TPS declined 2% overall, and it's about what we would expect in this area. And you've even commented on this the last couple quarters. We've been riding the wave of the mainframe product cycle over the last 3 quarters and saw pretty good growth that was unusual. Now we're back to down 2%. This is high value, high profit, strategically important to our clients overall, but it's in stable to declining businesses, and it wasn't unexpected. And when you look at our software solution portfolio, we've got growth in analytics as we revamp that portfolio coming off of a pretty disappointing fourth quarter. We grew in first quarter. We grew again in second. And we got good double-digit growth in our industry verticals like financial services and IoT, and we're seeing good growth in Watson Health. We got growth in life sciences segment, imaging, payer, and we're seeing good SaaS signings in our government segments within that business. Yes, we are driving acquisition synergies, and you're seeing that play out. It's well in advance of a year, and you're seeing that operating leverage play out well in advance of our financial model around Cognitive Solutions. So transaction processing software, pretty much as expected, high-value-based market. Software solutions, the key strategic areas that we have are growing. The focus that we've got, and we talked about this 90 days ago, are around 3 key segments around talent, around collaboration and around commerce, where we are investing to modernize our portfolio to address the secular shifts that are happening in both client value and in consumption models. As you know, this business today in these 3 segments are both a mixture of on-prem and SaaS, and we are investing aggressively to revitalize this portfolio into a SaaS world around driving user interface improvements to make our offerings more digitally consumable and also about shifting in investing to embed AI to deliver differentiated value for our clients overall. So that's Cognitive Solutions. Now you asked about gross profit margins. So let me take a step back and give you my perspective now that I've been on the job 6 months as CFO of IBM. I spend a lot of time with our investors and also with many of you, the sell-side analysts, listening and also getting a perspective of our company, the sentiment and the strategic positioning and what you would like to see. And in each of those, inevitably, the discussion around margin comes up. Why? Because, yes, we are a value-based stock. Our investment thesis is around value, value driving profit growth at the end of the day that gives us the free cash flow flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders and invest in our business. But the discussion around gross profit margins always inevitably get at services. Is services deflationary? And can you grow services margins? And I would tell you, I think that's at the heart of your question around gross profit. And I'll answer it in a couple ways: one, talking about our financial model; and two, talking about how we manage the business. But before I get into that, first and foremost, the net answer is, as I stated 90 days ago, we expect our services gross margins to expand in the second half, and we still feel confident coming off of the trajectory improvement of what we saw in the second quarter really led by strong margin expansion in our GBS business and the productivity actions we have in front of us. But when you look at this from an overall IBM perspective, our financial model, as we talked about, is low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit profit growth and high single-digit EPS growth. And in 2Q, you saw the instantiation of delivering that model. We grew revenue. We had PTI margin expansion of 110 basis points, strongest we've had in years, and we drove operating leverage to deliver 11% profit growth well in excess of our model. So for a full year perspective, our view at an operating level in terms of profit growth has not changed. We're going to grow profit. We're going to grow PTI margins, and that supports our full year guidance. Now let's talk about how we manage the business because I think it's important for our investors, and it's important for each of you as analysts to understand this. Number one, we got 2 distinct different business models in our company. We got a product-based business model, and we got a services-based business model. In a product-based business model, hardware, software and solutions, value is instantiated in delivering return at a PTI level. Why? Because all the investment we make in a product-based business ends up below the gross profit margin line. And you see in our product-based businesses, Systems and Cognitive Solution were growing substantial operating leverage and were growing substantial return on investment. Now in services, as I said 90 days ago, in a human capital-based business, value is instantiated in gross profit margins. And we manage our services business to get a return on our human capital at the gross profit level. And as I said, at a gross profit level in services, we still expect to expand margins in the second half. The only thing that has changed in the last 90 days has been the extreme volatility in the FX world around the U.S. dollar appreciation. And as I stated earlier, we have a hedging policy that mitigates the volatility of currency in our I&E at a profit level, but it does impact gross margins, in particular, at a product level in our product-based businesses, does not impact profit in the near term. It allows you time to then go adjust your pricing terms, your cost structure and your sourcing strategies as we move forward. So that's the only thing that's changed in the last 90 days. We feel confident we're going to grow revenue for the year at current spot rates even in light of currency flip into a headwind in the second half. We feel confident we're going to expand pretax margins similar to what we did in the second quarter in the second half. And within that, we feel confident we're actually going to deliver services gross profit margin expansion in the second half of the year.",1187

And you saw that play out in continued trajectory improvement throughout the first half and returning to modest revenue growth and significant operating leverage and margin expansion, which we expect will be a big contributor in our second half services margin expansion that we talked about in the last question. Now with that said, if you look at that acceleration and what's been happening in the trajectory of our services business, first, as you all understand the dynamics of that business, you have to get signings that have to yield into backlog, which has to yield into revenue as we move forward. And we're seeing tremendous momentum in our consulting base of business. We delivered 4% revenue growth, as you stated, in the second quarter, and that's leveraging momentum around how we redesign our growth platforms and how we redesign our service lines and offerings and practices. And we're capturing higher value, value around the digital transformation offerings that enable clients to move their journey to the cloud as we move forward. We're doing great in our CRM practice, our Workday practice. And we're also capturing new emerging areas like blockchain, where we're seeing good growth in our services base of business at all. And as you know and we talked about extensively at our investor webcast in the beginning of the year, GBS has a very integral part in an integrated model strategy of the IBM company. They have the mission of bringing business and technology transformation together. So the long answer to your question around is consulting in GBS a key leading indicator of dragging the rest of IBM, the answer is definitely yes.",325

Thanks for the question. Yes, on TS&CP, similar to our discussion around GBS, we're pleased with the trajectory improvement and the progress that we've been making within this business on the top line throughout the first half. We made sequential progress quarter-to-quarter. We have now returned to growth, delivering $8.6 billion of revenue. But let's talk about a couple of the key components. First, we are capitalizing on tremendous momentum around enterprise hybrid cloud strategy. We are becoming the destination of moving and enabling our clients' journey to the cloud, and our GTS business is an instrumental part of that strategy as we move forward. So we got a lot of momentum in our enterprise hybrid cloud. That, as you see, is delivering as-a-service annualized run rate of $7.6 billion. That's up 30% year-to-year, and that has tremendous value as we move forward to continue getting scale efficiencies and the like. But let's talk about then the core GTS business overall. Infrastructure services returned to growth, 1% in the quarter, and it's really been built off of a very strong first half where we delivered double-digit signings growth at the GTS and TS&CP segment level. And now you saw our backlog continues to improve. Our backlog now in total is $116 billion, and within that, 30% of that backlog now is cloud as we continue to capitalize on the secular shift and deliver more and more value overall. Our integration software business is growing 1% and continues to grow through the first half. And what we've got to work on, and this is a -- this is part of having an integrated portfolio and part of having success in other areas, our TSS business is down 4%, but that's a function of us significantly overachieving against our last program, our mainframe product cycle. And we see a deceleration in TSS, but we're seeing the offset in our Systems base of business going forward. So when you look at that trajectory improvement, we returned our backlog back to flat in the second quarter in TS&CP, and again, a lot of work ahead of us. We got to fuel second half signings. We got a good opportunity pipeline. But I see continued trajectory improvement, and then our focus on margins, as we move forward in the second half, to deliver second half services gross profit margin expansion are going to be critical to our guidance.",412

I know it's way too early to be providing 2019 insight. However, are there any factors that are driving the '18 free cash flow that may not reoccur next year or even potentially reverse that we should be factoring into our thinking for next year?",65

David, thank you very much, and good to hear from you again. Before I get to the long-term view, I mean, I think you kind of nailed it. Let's talk about our free cash flow guidance here through the second quarter and more importantly, through the first half. First of all, we talked about entering the year that we expected $12 billion of free cash flow. That was down about $1 billion. If you remember, at that point in time, we talked about we were going to continue to invest in our business in terms of capital to build out our IBM Cloud architecture. And by the way, in the second quarter, I think you have seen the announcement where we expanded 18 new availability zones around the world. So we are committed to winning in the cloud space, and we're investing to go do that. But we also said we're going to have a significant cash tax headwind here in 2018. And then our GAAP profit, as we start turning this business and deliver on our at least $13.80, was going to pretty much offset our strong working capital efficiency that we exited last year on with our mainframe cycle. So through the first half, we delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow. That's down $400 million. But it's important to understand the underpinnings behind that. Within that, we've invested $300 million year-to-year, up 20% on capital already through the first half, and we've had strong operational pretax -- or, excuse me, after-tax profit performance that's delivered a positive contribution of $600 million to support that investment in capital as we move forward. So when you do the net then, our entire year-to-year reduction through the first half is all driven by cash tax headwind. And that cash tax headwind is $700 million through the first half, and it's all behind us now. So our second half free cash flow, to your point, we've always said as a rule of thumb, free cash flow should follow our profit levels. And when you look at our realization, you see it playing out in our realization. We're well in excess of 100%. And our trailing 12 months is at $12.6 billion, and our attainment supports that $12 billion free cash flow level as we move forward. So it's too early to look at '19. We'll deliver that in January, but at least, hopefully, the answer gives you some of the dynamics of what's playing out within free cash flow.",419

Application management is still under pressure as it is for most of the providers. And is that going to continue within the context of GBS or you actually see application management within the confines of GBS improving?",48

So thank you very much for just getting it all. It gives me a better perspective of the entirety of your multiple-part question, so we can put this in perspective. So let's talk about -- I'll drive you back to 180 days ago when we were sitting here in January. We talked about the position where we were at. We talked about what's going on with the dynamics of our backlog overall, and we talked about the backlog realization runout that we saw over the 2018 period. And we said entering 2018 that we had a much stronger backlog realization or runout, I should say, than we -- that we're starting with than we did entering 2017. And you're seeing that play out as we go through the first half, where we made sequential year-to-year improvement over the first quarter and now returned both of our services businesses back to growth. Now within that, as we stated earlier, in a human-capital-based services business, you've got to continue fueling those signings that delivers backlog, and more importantly, you got to drive the right composition of backlog that drives your backlog realization and yield and also drives duration. And obviously, what you're seeing over time is you're seeing, I think, a secular shift with regards to what's happening to duration in long-term contracts. You're not seeing that anymore. So we're getting higher-yielding revenue. We're also -- the composition of our backlog with consulting, which accelerated to 4%, that composition is much more shorter term and higher value as we move forward. So over the long run, you're right. You got to continue to fuel signings to fuel that backlog. But I would tell you, outer years of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are very, in today's world, much less relevant than an in period, your first year, your second year, your third year in the composition. So we do feel confident with that trajectory improvement. We came off of first half delivering good growth, double digits, in signings in the first half. And the composition of those signings, as I said, we already have 30% of our backlog that's sitting in cloud. And by the way, over 40% of our backlog is now in key strategic imperative workloads overall. So that's kind of your first question. Your second question, AMS. We talked about AMS. Obviously, that's going through a secular shift in the industry, and you're seeing that play out against all the competitors that are in this space today. But I would tell you what differentiates IBM with regards AMS. One, it's our value of incumbency. The integrated play, the integrated model of IBM, the value of incumbency and the reason we're in the AMS business is we understand our clients' operating models, our clients' workloads and our clients' business processes. And we said entering this year that we were seeing success in us leveraging that value of incumbency to be the destination to help our clients with the journey to the cloud and move to the cloud. And we're seeing that play out in the first half, where not only in the first quarter but also in the second quarter we had double-digit signings growth in our AMS business over time. Again, backlog, yes, is still down overall. Our revenue was down 3%. But we see this inflection point as we move forward, and we continue to leverage and deliver that value for our clients as they move on their journey overall.",584

As you sit there in the CFO seat and you're calling now for margins to accelerate or improve or expand year-over-year in the second half of the year, what are the milestones that are hitting that kind of make you call that out, the happiness behind it, the confidence? What's the milestones that we can look back and say, ""Oh, that made a lot of sense, and it has long-term durability to it.""?",81
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4555.0,1503595.0,59468389.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,32,"Jim, thank you very much for the question. It's a good question overall. Let me take a look at it. I've said from January, as we look at -- we obviously have multiple scenarios. How do we make at least $13.80? And what I look at and the team and the entire management team looks at is the trajectory of our business, the operational indices and the drivers, as we see going forward, of headwinds and tailwinds on how we deliver that guidance for our shareholders of at least $13.80. But when you take a look at revenue growth, I said we would have revenue growth at current spot rates for the full year and that we would have pretax operating margin expansion and operating leverage in our business. So to your question, what do we look at and what are the trends that are driving that, so let's unpack it. And I've talked about this the last couple of calls. And the way I look at margin expansion really centers around 3 or 4 major areas. Number one, margin expansion is going to be delivered through us continuing to leverage the momentum in our enterprise cloud, in our as-a-service-based business. Why? Because it's going to generate scale efficiencies for us to deliver on what we've said at our Investor Day, which is margin accretion as we move through to the cloud. So scale efficiencies, we are seeing that improvement in the first quarter. We're seeing the improvement in the second quarter, and it's all being built off of the momentum around our cloud and our as-a-service-based business. Second, we talk about mix, mix being another lever. So you look at the mix of one within our -- each of our segments and how we're shifting to higher value, which we're making good progress. The best instantiation of that is GBS, where they're getting better price realization and better value around remixing their offerings to sell better value. But also across segments, we have a big mix headwind, as we talked about 90 days ago, with regards to the mainframe cycle. So we take that into account. But the third bucket is around productivity. This is around how you transform the way you work. It's predominantly led by our services base of business, but it's also about how we reinvent and how we run our company around our infrastructure and enterprise productivity. Both are giving us operating leverage as we move forward. We're seeing the latter play out in our expense efficiency structure here in the second quarter. And in our services base of business, we talked about the work we're doing around our workforce optimization, the significant actions we took in the first quarter. I said it's predominantly the yield on that is in the second half, and that should accelerate significantly. But we're also transforming the way we actually deliver service, redesigning it, applying agile methodologies, infusing AI and automation and driving a differentiated value to our clients to improve the quality in addition to the efficiency in margin. And then finally, the last point, which given services is 60% of our business, human-capital-based business, you have to generate revenue to generate operating leverage. It's tough generating operating leverage when revenue is down, and we're seeing, as that revenue trajectory improves, and we're seeing, as we play out here in the second quarter, returning services back to growth that we're going to get the operating leverage as we move forward. And that's what makes us confident in delivering at least $13.80.",593

I guess, maybe to start, cognitive revenue, the down in constant currency in the quarter and really the sum amount of transactional businesses there, but just help me understand what tempered the growth there. And then do you think cognitive will actually grow in the back half of the year because your compares start to get fairly difficult in that business, I think, in the back half of the year? And then, Jim, just on gross margins, what's leading you to start talking about -- 90 days ago, it was aggregate total IBM gross margins will be flat to stable, and now it sounds like it's only in services. So what's the degradation in cognitive or Systems that's changing that statement on gross margins from a corporate level to only services now?",140
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4555.0,1503595.0,59468392.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,35,"Okay. So on each of them, Amit -- first of all, thanks for getting into the queue. It's good to hear from you again. But on each of these, I think I answered them already, but let me just give the synopsis. On cognitive, we talked about the different dynamics within our portfolio around TPS, which had been growing, leveraging the mainframe cycle, now is more in line with what our expectations are. And in solutions software, we've got strength in key strategic areas of our portfolio, analytics industry verticals, both FSS, in health, in security, in IoT, but we've got work to do on modernizing those key 3 segment areas of talent, collaboration and commerce. And that -- as those secular shift move much more aggressively to SaaS, that time to value gets realized over a longer period of time. So we do see strength in certain components. We're making investments in others to transform, as I talked about, modernize those offerings, and that will play out over time. But with that said, we've done all the work and we are driving the acquisition integration synergies, the operational efficiency savings that we feel confident, even at this level of revenue, we can drive operating leverage within that business. And then finally, back to your question on margins. As I talked, first, I think, value -- the way we manage this business, value is instantiated in the services-based business in gross profit margin. Value is instantiated in the product-based business in pretax income because you got to recoup the return on investment of your go-to-market and your development. So why -- I would not say I'm changing. I would say our operating view of the year of our financial model, of revenue growth, of profit growth, of earnings per share is exactly the same. The only thing that's different within that is the FX change in the last 90 days with the significant U.S. dollar appreciation. Now we hedge. We hedge that mitigates that profit variability. But when you look at currency around the element of the I&E, you see how it plays out differently. And that transparency and credibility is what I feel is important for you and investors to understand, but it has no impact on our bottom line profit contribution and our delivery of our free cash flow and our at least $13.80 for the year.
With that said, let me wrap up the call where I started by saying this was a good quarter and we're pleased. We had solid revenue growth and profit performance. This reflects the work we've been doing to reposition our business in terms of our offerings, our people, the way we work in reinventing IBM. Now as always, there's more work to do, and I look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you all for joining us on the call here this evening.",488

In the third quarter, we delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, $3.6 billion of operating pretax income and $3.42 of operating earnings per share, and over the last 12 months, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow with realization over 100%. As compared to last year, our revenue was flat at constant currency, though down 2% with the impact of the stronger dollar. Gross profit margin was flat, which is the best year-to-year performance in years. The improvement was led by services margin expansion. We expanded our overall operating pretax margin, and we grew operating profit and earnings per share.
We continue to see strong client demand in the emerging high-value segments of the IT industry. And our performance this quarter was driven by the offerings in hybrid cloud, in security, in digital and in analytics and AI, a testament to our ability to deliver differentiated value to our clients through innovative technologies with the skills and expertise to implement these technologies. We see the results in our strategic imperatives revenue growth of 13% over the last 12 months.
We also see this playing out in higher operating margin over the last few quarters, which supports both our long-term investment and return to shareholders. With our success in these higher-value areas and our focus on delivering consistent operational performance, we remain on track to our full year expectations of earnings per share and free cash flow.
Coming into the second half, we said we expected to improve our services revenue trajectory and to expand total services margins for the half. We also said we'd face some headwinds as we wrap on the new mainframe launch and our strongest software performance in the third quarter of last year. And so now this quarter, we deliver revenue growth and gross margin expansion in both services segments.
In Global Business Services, our revenue growth accelerated, driven by consulting as we help clients with their digital transformations. And we grew revenue again in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, driven by hybrid cloud implementations. And I should mention that my revenue comments here and throughout will be based on constant currency.
In Systems, our IBM Z revenue grew despite a wrap on new mainframe launch, resulting in what is now the most successful Z program in our history.
And then looking at our software revenue, which spans our segments, we had growth in integration software, driven by offerings that help clients modernize applications and enable hybrid cloud adoption. In solutions software, we had good performance in several areas, including security, key offerings in analytics like data science and our Watson Health vertical as we embed AI into more of our offerings. At the same time, we continue to deal with challenges in a few horizontal solution areas and a tougher compare in transaction processing software, both of which impacted overall software revenue growth.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39.5 billion over the last 12 months. Within that, our cloud revenue is $19 billion, and we exited the third quarter with an as-a-service annual run rate of $11.4 billion, which again was up 24%. While that's already a significant revenue base in the emerging high-value segments of the IT industry such as cloud and AI, it's still early in the adoption of these technologies.
For example, it's estimated that enterprises are only 10% to 20% into their cloud journey with progress slowed by the lack of interoperability across cloud environments and concerns about the ability to manage data privacy and security in multiple cloud environments. And so clients need a cloud partner that can offer a hybrid cloud for workloads that cut across public, private and traditional; a secure cloud for mission-critical workloads and highly sensitive data; and an open cloud to run complex, multi-cloud environments.
12 months ago, we launched IBM Cloud Private, which is the starting point for many companies as they embrace a hybrid multi-cloud strategy. Already, more than 400 global companies have embraced this platform to manage mission-critical business processes in the cloud, and nearly all of these are competitive wins.
Just yesterday, we announced a series of innovations that will help clients scale their cloud, AI and cybersecurity initiatives. These include IBM Multicloud Manager, which is the industry's first service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We also announced IBM's AI OpenScale technology, the first open interoperable AI platform to manage the life cycle of all forms of AI applications and models. This includes the management of bias, security and providence of models and data, which are the issues clients are facing with scaling AI in the enterprise. These are just a few examples of how we're building our technology innovations and industry expertise with trust and security to help an enterprise on their journey to cloud and to AI.
Before getting into the financial metrics, I'll lay out the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth. As I said, our revenue was flat at constant currency, but with the continued strengthening of the dollar, revenue was down 2%. And at constant margin, this was a headwind to profit and earnings per share growth. Our actions to reposition our cost base and drive operating efficiencies resulted in pretax margin expansion of 50 basis points despite a headwind from mix. And so we had modest growth in our pretax income. Our tax rate was down, driven by a discrete benefit in the quarter. And finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, our operating EPS was up 5%. Year-to-date through September, our operating EPS is also up 5%., and you can see on this chart the contributors to earnings per share growth, consistent with how we presented it over the last 3 quarters.
Looking at our underlying profit and cash metrics. As I said, our gross margin was flat compared to last year, which is an improvement in the year-to-year trajectory. We had solid gross margin improvement in the services segments, together up 160 basis points. And as I talked about last quarter, in services, which is a human-capital-based business, value is instantiated in gross margin. This was offset by the mix headwinds we discussed 90 days ago in z14 mainframe and software.
Our operating expense was down 4% year-to-year with half due to currency and half due to the base operational performance. When currency hurts the top line, it generally helps the expense line due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. The base expense reduction of 2 points was driven by operating efficiencies, including acquisition synergies.
We deliver productivity across our business by using automation, leveraging agile processes and changing the way we work. This provides flexibility to increase investment to deliver innovations in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, cybersecurity and blockchain while also dropping some to the bottom line. Within our expense decline, we also absorbed a lower level of IP income. We expanded both operating pretax and net income margins, and net income was up 3%. Our operating tax rate was down 2 points from last year while our underlying rate of 16% is up slightly. As I said, the year-to-year dynamic is driven by a discrete benefit in the quarter.
Looking at our cash metrics. We generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion through September, which is down year-to-year. As expected, our year-to-date decline is driven by a cash tax headwind and growth in CapEx. As always, trailing 12 months is the best way to look at our cash flow performance. And on that basis, we generated $12.2 billion, which is 108% free cash flow realization. We returned about 70% of that to shareholders while increasing our capital investment.
Turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions had $4.1 billion of revenue, which was down 5%. The segment is comprised of a broad set of offerings, so let me take a minute to break it down. 
Solutions software includes offerings in strategic verticals like health, domain-specific capabilities like analytics and security as well as our emerging technologies of AI and blockchain. We had good performance across these areas this quarter, and I'll come back to these in a minute.
Solutions also includes offerings that address horizontal domains, and over the last 3 quarters, I've been talking about challenges in a few of these areas, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent, where we're dealing with secular shifts in the market. We've been taking actions, including modernizing our offerings, infusing AI and enhancing the digital experience. While these 3 areas continue to weigh on the segment's overall performance, we've made some progress.
For example, in commerce, where we infused AI into offerings like customer experience analytics, SaaS signings grew double digits this quarter. And in collaboration, we've had very positive reaction to the recent introduction of Notes Domino version 10, which is optimized for mobile and supports JavaScript and Node.js. So we're starting to see some green shoots, but because the time to value is longer in SaaS, we will start seeing this play out as we get into 2019.
Cognitive Solutions also includes transaction processing software. This includes software that runs mission-critical workloads, leveraging our hardware platforms. While much of the revenue is annuity based, in any quarter, the performance reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client-buying cycles. We have a good pipeline in transaction processing software as we enter the fourth quarter, which supports a return to growth. 
So now let me turn back to a few of our high-value areas where we continue to scale new platforms and high-value solutions.
This quarter, we had growth in industry verticals like health, key areas of analytics and security. In Watson Health, where we've been infusing AI the longest, we had broad-based growth, including in payer, provider, imaging and life sciences.
In the area of life sciences, we've been working with Medtronic to leverage data and apply intelligence into their glucose monitors. In June, the Sugar.IQ app with Medtronic went live, and initial demand and patient results are very strong. 
In our underlying analytics platform, we had growth in our data science and IBM Cloud Private for data offerings. We continue to invest in advancing data and AI. We announced bias detection services and introduced new Watson services on the IBM Cloud Private platform as clients seek the benefits of AI and the cloud behind their firewall.
Security growth in the quarter was led by offerings in orchestration, data security and endpoint management. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position, comprehensive integrated portfolio and differentiation with AI. 
In the emerging area of blockchain, this quarter, our IBM Food Trust network for food safety went live, and Carrefour, one of the world's leading retailers, joined the network.
We also jointly announced TradeLens with Maersk. Together, we will apply blockchain technologies to address inefficiencies in the global supply chain and signed up over 50 ecosystem participants. And we now have over 75 active blockchain networks.
Looking at profit this quarter, we expanded pretax margin by over 1 point year-to-year. This was driven by operational efficiencies, including acquisition synergies while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas.
Looking at services. Our Global Business Services revenue grew 3%, building on the progress from first half. Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 7%, led by strength in offerings within the digital strategy and iX as well as cognitive process transformation. And in application management, a decline in traditional enterprise application managed services is being mitigated by the continued strength in areas such as Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development. Our consulting performance reflects the fact that enterprises are undergoing a digital transformation and reinvention, leveraging technology to transform the way they operate, to attract the best talent and to improve engagements with their customers. Customers are turning to GBS as we are uniquely positioned to infuse IBM's leading-edge technology and partnerships with our industry expertise to enable clients' digital transformation.
For example, we are partnering with Sally Beauty to provide an innovative digital and in-store customer experience, influenced by deep understanding of the brand, consumer and retail industry. We are creating virtual assistants for Lloyds Banking Group to enhance the way they communicate with and serve customers. And at the U.S. Open, GBS provided the digital fan experience, which included several innovative features. AI Highlights enabled the tournament's digital team to view and find the most exciting shot of the day or match for distribution, and the AI-powered virtual concierge answered fans' questions on a range of topics.
Turning to gross profit. GBS gross margin expanded 270 basis points year-to-year. We are shifting our revenue mix towards higher-value offerings such as digital and cognitive and capturing that price for value. Additionally, we have aligned our resources to key skill areas and are seeing productivity and utilization benefits.
Putting it all together, GBS delivered a solid quarter. They are executing well and delivering value to clients in key strategic areas.
In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.3 billion of revenue and grew for the second consecutive quarter. Growth was led by hybrid cloud implementations with cloud revenue up 22%, and we exited the quarter with a $7.5 billion as-a-service annual run rate. This reflects IBM's differentiated value proposition to address cloud for the enterprise.
As I said earlier, clients are early in their cloud journey and their needs are evolving. Initial cloud projects focus on the productivity economics of renting IT infrastructure at scale. More and more, however, clients want to move beyond that model and start to shift mission-critical business processes and apps to the cloud. They recognize that cloud can help drive real business value in those processes, launch new applications rapidly and enter new markets. And this all needs to be optimized across public, private and on-prem, where many of the workloads will remain. This is why IBM's approach to cloud is hybrid, secure and open. 
I mentioned our announcements yesterday. It's important to note that we are bringing new, open and interoperable approaches to cloud. This is consistent with our heritage as a leader in open standards and governance. From the early days of Linux and Java to Kubernetes and Hyperledger for Blockchain, we're bringing the same open approach to the cloud and AI, which will also help clients overcome the complexity of proprietary technology and vendor lock-in.
Within this segment, we see results of this shift in infrastructure services and integration software, with strong cloud performance contributing to revenue growth in both of these areas. I mentioned earlier the strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private with 95 new companies alone this quarter around the globe. For example, AFLAC in Japan is trusting IBM Cloud to help speed the development of new business products and services. Brazil's Fidelity National Information Services, a global leader in payment processing solutions, has adopted IBM Cloud Private to help streamline credit card chargebacks for its Brazilian operations. And CNH Industrial, a leader in the capital goods sector, will use IBM Cloud Private and Watson artificial intelligence to transform its business processes across manufacturing, supply chain, sales and marketing and financial services.
And now turning to technical support services, revenue was down 3%, which is a modest sequential improvement from second quarter. Similar to last quarter, this area continues to be impacted by the dynamics of our hardware product cycle, moderated by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings.
Moving on to gross profit for the segment, margin expanded 120 basis points. This improvement was driven by scale efficiencies in our cloud business as well as a lift in our productivity initiatives. As we continue to drive value in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, we are making investments to capitalize on the shifts to cloud by adding capacity and expanding our data center footprint around the world as well as expanding our go-to-market capabilities to capture the opportunity in hybrid.
We're also investing in development to drive hybrid cloud innovation. That means both private and public technologies. You see this in the introduction of IBM Multicloud Manager and AI OpenScale. And we're also adding functionality and enhancements to IBM Cloud Private and IBM Cloud.
Before moving onto systems, let me give you some perspective on our combined services business. As we entered the year, we saw improved revenue from opening backlog, which pointed to an improving revenue trajectory. And the actions we've been taking to remix our offerings to higher value, improve price realization and drive productivity and workforce optimization, combined with scale efficiencies in the cloud, are designed to improve gross profit performance, which in a human-capital-based business is where the value is instantiated. In the third quarter, for services, the revenue trajectory and gross margins continued to improve with combined revenue up 1% and gross margins expanding 160 basis points.
In Systems, we grew revenue again this quarter, driven by a combination of a strong z14 and newly introduced POWER9 adoption. This quarter, IBM Z revenue grew 6% year-to-year on 20% MIPS growth, and margins expanded. The z14 program continued to track ahead the prior cycle, and in fact, program to date in terms of shift capacity is the most successful in our platform's long history. The z14's pervasive encryption continues to be a key differentiator. For instance, governments are selecting z14 to protect their sensitive data, including a large U.S. government agency this quarter. The z14 adoption spans many industries and countries. And we added new clients to the platform again this quarter, including several new clients to our new single-frame z14, designed specifically for cloud environments.
Our power revenue was up double digits, driven by strong growth in Linux and traction across our new POWER9-based architecture. In the third quarter, we released our next-generation POWER9 processors for midrange and high-end systems, and we've seen strong adoption. These systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets.
We also introduced new offerings, optimizing both hardware and software for AI. Offerings such as PowerAI Vision, and PowerAI Enterprise will help drive new customer adoption. And we continue to deploy our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.
Storage hardware was down this quarter with declines in midrange and high-end mitigated by strong growth in all-flash arrays. Storage is an increasingly competitive environment with continued pricing pressures, so to differentiate in this environment requires additional investment in innovation. We've been releasing new functionality like Safeguarded Copy for cybersecurity to protect critical client data from cyberattack, and we signed our first large deployment of this technology with a major bank this quarter.
And our new FlashSystems with next-generation MVME technology was announced earlier this quarter. We will continue to roll out MVME across the portfolio.
Turning to profit. Systems pretax margin was down over 6 points, reflecting a mix headwind and lower level of IP income and ongoing investment to drive innovation across the brands. 
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet in the quarter. We generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables and $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion, which is down $800 million year-to-year. The decline is driven by a combination of higher capital expenditures and cash taxes.
You'll recall at the beginning of the year, we said we expected 3 headwinds to our free cash flow growth this year: higher CapEx, higher cash taxes and our strong working capital performance at the end of last year driven by the IBM Z introduction. The combined impact from cash taxes and capital investments is in line with what we expected at this point, though we spent a little more on CapEx and a little less on cash taxes.
Looking at uses of cash. Over the last 3 quarters, we returned $6.6 billion to our shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends. And we bought back 16 million shares with $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of September.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights. We ended September with $14.7 billion in cash and non-financing debt of about $16.5 billion. We have just over $30 billion of debt in support of our financing business, which continues to be leveraged at 9:1. Our financing portfolio remains strong at 55% investment grade. That's 1 point better than December and 2 points better than a year ago. So I'm confident in the strength of our balance sheet. We've got plenty of flexibility to continue to invest while returning value to our shareholders as evidenced by 23 consecutive years of dividend increases.
So let me wrap it up. Our performance through the first 3 quarters reflects the investments we've been making over the last couple years and actions to reposition the business. We've been rebuilding our innovation pipeline to address what our enterprise clients value in an IT industry that has been rapidly reordering technologies like AI, blockchain, cybersecurity delivered in hybrid cloud environments. And we've taken actions to further align our skill base to this opportunity and to drive operating efficiencies.
And so now on a year-to-date basis, our revenue is up, our gross margin trajectory has been improving and in the third quarter, was flat year-to-year. Our operating profit is up modestly, and we returned a lot of value to shareholders. These all reinforce the fact that we're a high-value company. As we look forward, as always, there's more work to do, and the fourth quarter seasonally has a large transaction base.
But with the performance in the first 3 quarters and our focus on consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share. Regarding our free cash flow with the headwinds we expected in cash taxes and capital expenditures largely behind us, we are maintaining our view of about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, which is over 100% realization.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia, so we can get started on Q&A.",3701

So I guess, it will be helpful just to hear how you would characterize IBM's performance in September quarter versus what you guys were expecting 90 days ago and importantly, the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing, especially on gross margins, which were flat on a very difficult compare, I think, it was last year, and then on the other hand yet, cognitive was down somewhat more than I thought. So if you could maybe just characterize the performance and sustainability of some of these trends versus what you thought 90 days ago, that will be really helpful for us.",123
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993954.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,6,"Okay, thanks, Amit, and it's a good place to start here talking about the characterization of our quarter now that we're through 3 quarters of 2018. But I guess, from my perspective, I would say, first, we had a solid quarter. We delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, which was consistent with our guidance of a typical quarter-to-quarter seasonality even in light of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which continues to go against us. But the headline overall would be, we fundamentally have taken the actions to reposition our business entering 2018, and you see that play out as we enter the second half where we grew operating profit, we expanded operating pretax margin by 50 basis points, we grew EPS 5% consistent with the first half and we continue to drive strong free cash flow realization to deliver value back to our shareholders. Now some of the underpinnings behind that: One, we still see strong demand in key high-value segments, and you see that play out in our third quarter performance, and we think that will continue moving forward, areas like hybrid cloud where we're winning with our hybrid cloud value proposition in the marketplace; data and AI, security, digital. All of these are instantiated in our strategic imperatives, which now from a trailing 12-month perspective, we're at $39.5 billion, pretty close to that $40 billion target that we put in place well over 3 years ago when the IBM company had less than 25% of its portfolio in strategic imperatives. Today, we're roughly at 50%. That's a massive transformation over a period of time. And that's led to significant improvement in trajectory of our revenue growth overall, whereas year-to-date we're up 2%. But underneath that, you see some of the areas of growth around cloud, $19 billion, growing 20%. And within that, it's being driven by our high-value as-a-service content driving our cloud component. That's up now to $11.4 billion on an annualized exit run rate growing consistently at 24%. But if you put all that together, yes, we're seeing the underlying fundamental shifts of our top line. We've done the tough work to transform our portfolio. But really, what I would call as an inflection point as we enter the second half of the year is what's happening with our operating leverage. And you see that play out in our gross margin performance, which is the best we've had year-to-year in over 3 years. Now let's talk a little bit about that because each of you as analysts and more importantly, as I go out and meet with many of our investors, it is a very critical signpost in a high-value-based business model. And they've been talking about our gross margin performance and when are we going to stabilize and how are we going to get back to expansion towards our model. And we talked about, as we entered the year, we knew we had headwinds coming into the second half predominantly around mix, mix around our successful mainframe launch, but also, mix is starting to hurt us from a currency perspective as we talked at length 90 days ago on how currency and the strengthening of dollar is actually hurting our product-based businesses in hardware and software, where you have a disconnect between your cost base, which is in U.S. dollars, versus your actual revenue in local currency. So we knew that headwind. And now what we've been able to do is we've been able to reposition our services base of businesses. And you see not only did we return both units back to growth. We actually delivered 160 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. That's the best year-over-year in our services business in over 5 years. And we see that continuing, and we expect that to continue to accelerate as we move into fourth quarter. So you combine that margin with our continued enterprise productivity, and you see that we're able to deliver strong operating pretax margins, and you couple that with our strong free cash flow with -- on a trailing 12 months is still in excess of $12 billion and a free cash flow realization over 100%, and that gives us confidence to reaffirm our expectation of at least $13.80.",705

Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, we still got a lot of work to do. We're 16 days in to a very important fourth quarter. We are focused on delivering consistent operational performance to deliver value for our clients in the marketplace and also for our shareholders. So with that said, we'll give updates on guidance in January. But let me give you -- to your point, let me give you kind of what we see as a trajectory of our business in the connotation of a headwind, tailwind as we move forward. So let me first start with services. You see, as we entered 2018, we talked about we had a much better position on our backlog near-term runout, and you've seen that play out throughout 2018. And I think that's a culmination of us taking some very bold actions about repositioning our services business and capitalizing on a differentiated services model, services practices and services value propositions to capture the growth in digital, cognitive and cloud. And we see great momentum in our GBS base of business, both on top line and on bottom line as we move forward. In our GTS business, again, we continue to make progress, see acceleration in revenue through the third quarter. We are leveraging our differentiated hybrid cloud value proposition. Our clients value our incumbency. They value it because we understand their infrastructure, their workloads, and they trust us to move them to the future. And we talked about in the beginning of the year, when you look at our outsourcing backlog, we were hovering around 25% of a $90 billion outsourcing backlog. Well, right now exiting third quarter, that $90 billion backlog, give or take, we are now in about 32%, 35% cloud content. So we are winning in the marketplace, and our clients are choosing us to move them to the future. So I continue to see both of our services business. Now with that said, we got a big fourth quarter on signings. We fell short in third quarter on signings, and as you know, signings can vary. And really, all signings are not equal. The reality is the duration, the mix of signings and also new logo versus just extensions, all can impact overall. But when we look at our fourth quarter, we got the strongest lineup and greater than $100 million deals lined up that we've got a chance to exit the year with a very strong position in our services base of business. And when I couple that with our margin leverage that we're getting out of that business, once you get to revenue growth, you see the fundamental operating leverage, I definitely see that playing out into '19. Now on systems, systems, as you talked about, we're into our fifth quarter on mainframe. By the way, in terms of shipped MIPS, as I said in prepared remarks, this is the most successful mainframe program that we've ever had. And we still grew in the third quarter, albeit mid-single digits. Now we know we wrap on that in the fourth quarter, coming off of a 72% growth last year. But you see the underlying innovation playing out in our systems portfolio as we rolled out our new POWER9 architecture and we grew nicely in the third quarter by 17%, if I remember correctly. And we see that continuing to play out. As we rolled out the midrange and high-end late in the third quarter, we see that playing out in fourth quarter and next year also. And we've got also innovations coming out in our all-flash systems in storage, which is where we're gaining share and winning in the marketplace. So the innovation of continually modernizing those platforms and systems, power and storage, we should see some continued growth as we move into '19. But we will wrap on some very tough compares in mainframe, which leads me to cognitive. And we focused on cognitive throughout this year. One, in the third quarter, we dealt with some enterprise client-buying seasonality. And as I said earlier, that will come back in the fourth quarter just given where clients are at in their buying cycles about committing to the platform, but we've been dealing with some issues around our horizontal apps. And as I said, that's a function of the secular shift in client value and consumption models to as-a-service. And we'll see that play out as we get into '19 and throughout '19. So our focus has been on the key high-value emerging areas of cognitive around our industry verticals and around our domains like security, blockchain, which we see great opportunity and we're very pleased with that portfolio overall. So kind of a posture around headwinds, tailwinds, but we'll give a lot more color as we get into January.",807

You mentioned that it will be greater than 100% of GAAP net income this year despite the fact that you have some headwinds and cash taxes and higher CapEx, and that number is higher than your longer-term guidance of 90% to 100% realization. So I'm wondering if you can help us understand what are the positive tailwinds that you're seeing that are enabling free cash flow to be higher than 100% of GAAP net income. And can you explicitly comment on what your expected cash, pension and retirement contributions are this year and whether receivables factoring will benefit your free cash flow and to what extent?",124
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993960.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,12,"Okay, Toni, thank you very much. And as always, many very good questions that you bring up, but I hope I can capture many of them. If not, Patricia can get to all of you after the call. But first of all, let me start at the big picture, free cash flow as we entered 2018. We entered 2018 coming off of a very strong fourth quarter in 2017 where we drew -- we actually contributed significant working capital efficiency through the launch of our mainframe product cycle. And we said in our January call that we expected about $12 billion of free cash flow in 2018, and the drivers of that from 2017 were really going to be centered around, one, incremental cash taxes. That would be a headwind to us in '18. And by the way, that is playing out, and all of that is behind us now as we exit the third quarter. Number two, that we work on a plan on driving that strong working capital efficiency with the introduction of our mainframe as we exit the fourth quarter of 2018, and that would be a headwind. And then third, we said we were going to continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our innovation and differentiated value around our hybrid cloud. And we've continued to invest, actually invested more this year because we're seeing accelerated growth in our cloud overall. Our CapEx is up, I think, year-to-date 21%. So when you put those 3 headwinds in play, that's what you're seeing play out in our free cash flow through 9 months. And by the way, we still feel comfortable and expect about $12 billion for the full year based on any metric I look at [ in payment ] wise, and our trailing 12 months is at $12.2 billion, et cetera. Now let's get to free cash flow realization. First of all, as you know, appropriately so, we draw free cash flow realization compared to GAAP earnings and GAAP net income because we believe that's the best way of doing realization overall. And you know within that, you've got not only our core operating profit, but we got working capital efficiencies. You got CapEx. You got tax. You got pension. All of those can be variables in that free cash flow realization. But if you look at the last couple years, we've seen positive impact to our stated goal of at least 90% free cash flow realization driven by working capital efficiency. It's been driving that free cash flow above 100%, and then also tax and pension: tax, about 6 points; pension, a couple points year-over-year. So when you take a look at those pieces, we feel comfortable in 2018, looking at both our expectation for non-GAAP and our expectation for GAAP, that we will be well north of our realization here in 2018. And on factoring -- I would tell you, our factoring, there's no difference from 2018. We use that appropriately as a risk mitigation strategy to manage credit, to manage concentration and collection risk overall. And we'll continue to use that judiciously, but I wouldn't see any major change in that year-over-year.",532

Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there and some color on what you think drove that client-buying seasonality that you mentioned to a prior question? And if I could, how do you think that some of these new announcements around AI OpenScale and multi-cloud could change the trajectory for cognitive and when?",90
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993963.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Okay, Wamsi, thank you very much for your questions. There's a lot there to compact into one answer, but let me talk about strategic imperatives first, and then I'll get into cognitive next. But let's put the strategic imperatives into perspective. So as I stated on the call, trailing 12 months, $39.5 billion. We talked about 3 years ago we put the signpost out there to hit $40 billion. At that point in time, the IBM contribution was less than 1/4 of IBM's revenue. Now we're approaching 50%. We're growing in the mid-teens, 13% I think, if I remember correctly, over the trailing 12 months. And that has lifted IBM's overall revenue growth as you've seen, year-to-date, we're growing 2% at the IBM level. But within that strategic imperatives, our cloud business, to your point, is at $19 billion right now, up 20%. And the high-value as-a-service component underneath that is up 24%, consistent with where we've been in the first half of the year. And I think that's an attestation to we are capturing the new and emerging workloads as the secular shift to as-a-service world is happening overall. Now when you take a look at our strategic imperatives, let's put this in perspective, where we were 90 days ago. We knew to hit that $40 billion that we needed to be at basically mid- to high single-digit growth in the second half. And we knew, similar to how we laid out our expectation for guidance, that we were going to wrap around the most successful mainframe product program that we've had in history. So as we entered the second half, we knew we had to focus on driving that underlying high-value as-a-service content and continue to accelerate that to offset the impacts on that mainframe wraparound on product cycle. And you see in the third quarter, our strategic imperatives basically accomplish that. We did what we expected. So as we look going forward then in the fourth quarter, we have to repeat what we just did in the third quarter. And the underlying acceleration in our base services businesses I talked about, the expectation as we have a great a pipeline lined up for our software entering the fourth quarter based on those buying cycle seasonality that impact us in third quarter, we do expect to hit the $40 billion at the end of the year. And I'll remind you, when we set that $40 billion target in 2015, we've lost over $2 billion of revenue due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So you've seen what it's done to transform our portfolio. It's changed the mindset of how we run our company, how we allocate capital and investment, and you see how that's playing up with regards to the improved trajectory. Now getting to cognitive, and I'll just talk about Cognitive SI because to be honest with you, it's a simple answer. We talked about the last 90, 120 days about the challenges and headwinds we're facing with regards to our horizontal application areas of talent, collaboration and around Watson -- excuse me, marketing and commerce. We've been making progress, and I'll talk a little bit about that, but those 3 areas are still depressing our revenue. And as you know, there are secular shifts to SaaS and consumption models. They hurt our as-a-service run rates. So while we've been maintaining, rounding up and down $2 billion of an as-a-service for the last couple quarters, you're seeing strength in areas like security, in our industry verticals like health care, in blockchain and Watson. But it's getting depressed by those 3 horizontal app areas, and that will not play out until that [ time ] to value throughout 2019.",622

Don't know what happened. Just wanted to clarify, I guess, on the $13.80 -- at least $13.80, trying to better assess the ""at least"" in that comment and what's required or how much cushion there is on the transactional side to achieve your outlook because if we use $13.80, that suggests 4Q earnings looks like a little below consensus and below each of last 2 fourth quarters. So just trying to understand the ""at least"" piece at this stage.",82
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993968.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,20,"Sure, Tien-tsin, and thank you very much for the question. I think the -- a little bit below when you're doing the math, I mean, we just beat third quarter by $0.02. But let's put that aside right now. As always, when we take a look at our following quarter and most importantly for the year, and it's one and the same right now, we always have multiple scenarios, taking into account, one, the trajectory of our business and also the fundamentals in the operational indices that we see. And all support our expectation of the at least $13.80 of earnings per share. So if you put that in perspective, how are we entering fourth quarter? Well, if you look at the fundamentals of our business profile, through third quarter, we're growing revenue. We're growing operating profit. We're growing earnings per share consistently, and we're still driving that strong free cash flow realization. So kind of let me walk down the I&E and give you a perspective, and again, there are multiple variables here, but the way we kind of see it triangulating each of these pieces. First, on revenue. On revenue, as you've seen in our supplemental charts, the dollar continues to go against us and strengthen against foreign currencies. And right now on revenue, we see about a 2-point currency headwind here in the fourth quarter, pretty consistent, by the way, with the third quarter. But we would expect a normal historical quarter-to-quarter seasonality probably in the range of somewhere around 3 to 5 years of an average seasonality of 3Q to 4Q. But putting that in perspective, year-to-date growing at 2% and where we think fourth quarter can be, we continue to feel that we expect full year revenue at current spot rates that we will grow. And again, I'll make the statement, we've been saying that throughout the year. And from the trough of the U.S. dollar to FX, we've lost $1.5 billion of revenue since that period of time. But we still feel, based on the fundamentals in our underlying business, that we will see growth moving forward with regards to that content. So now let's turn to margin. Margin though is where we made the most progress. It is how you instantiate value. And when you take a look at, again, 90 days ago, nothing's different. We expected a headwind on product mix, and now we're dealing with a headwind on currency with regards to our product-based businesses, and we're more than offsetting that with services. We delivered our best year-to-year margin performance in the third quarter led by services, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The tough work we've done around shift in the higher value, we're starting to see the realization in our margin on that. The momentum that we've got on our hybrid cloud value proposition, we're starting to see the scale efficiencies and the productivity benefits are playing out as we move forward. So when you take a look at margin, we see our margin continue to accelerate and approaching our model here in the fourth quarter. And then you combine that with the work we have done about fundamentally changing the way we operate this company and our enterprise productivity. I'm talking about things like embedding agile into all of our methodologies, transforming the way we work, embedding automation, AI, becoming a cognitive enterprise. With that enterprise productivity, we see our fourth quarter operating pretax margins expanding significantly as we move forward. So the last thing I'll bring up is tax. And as you know, on tax, our third quarter, our underlying rate was still 16%. We did have a discrete in the third quarter. But if you look at our fourth quarter, we continue to expect our underlying rate to be 16%, plus or minus the 2 points. And I'll tell you, when you take a look at fourth quarter, fourth quarter always has the biggest variability in tax. Go look at the fourth quarter over the last 5 to 10 years. Why is that the case? Because, one, it's our largest transactional quarter. So the product mix and geographic mix has a major implication on our underlying rate. But also, tax events typically happen in the fourth quarter: tax closures, audit closures, statute expirations, each tends to drive variability overall. But with that said, consistent with what I've said all year long, we expect on a full year basis that our tax rate, all-in, printed, will be a headwind. So you put all those elements together, we expect a full year guidance of at least $13.80, and as I said earlier, about $12 billion of free cash flow.",780

Is there any chance you'd continue to see slower moderation as you go through? Or are we back to the regular mainframe cycles?",34

I appreciate it. Very good question. And to be honest with you, I haven't talked enough about mainframe because we couldn't be more pleased with how we've been able to leverage our high-value innovation technology, which really is instantiated, and I would argue, one of the most enduring platforms that delivers tremendous value to our clients overall. But with that said, mainframe, we had a good quarter in mainframe. It is the fifth quarter we wrapped. We grew 6% on a successful z14 launch. And again, I'll remind you, that's off of 62% growth last year. We had double-digit growth in MIPS, 20%. And by the way, as you get to the back half of the mainframe cycle, we drive margin expansion, and that happened here in the quarter. So again, best program ever against the prior cycle. We are still well in excess of that prior cycle, and I would expect us to continue to be well in excess of that prior cycle here in the fourth quarter. Although, I'll caution you, in a GA plus 5 or a 6 quarter in, we typically do not grow. And again, we're coming off of 71% growth last year on a strong launch. But we are very pleased with the platform, the pervasive encryption. Value proposition is really resonating now as we get into the back half of the cycle. We drive margin expansion, and now we start seeing the rest of the platform stack play out with regards to our maintenance base, our IGF base, our software base that's on top of it.",266

Cognitive. So from a net perspective, and then I'll expand, we were impacted by enterprise client-buying cycles as I said in the prepared remarks and also challenges that we've talked about in the last quarter around our horizontal apps, in particular, talent, collaboration and marketing and commerce. Where we're seeing some green shoots, but again, time to value in that as you shift to SaaS, all you know quite well will play out as we get into 2019. But let's take a moment and really unpack this segment. And to your point, and part of this, I think, is on us, but there are many different pieces of this segment. So we have a strong portfolio of high-value areas around domains like security, analytics, blockchain. We've got industry verticals like health care, our FSS portfolio and IoT. We've got horizontal apps, as I talked about, like talent, collaboration and marketing and commerce. And then we have transaction processing software. So let me unpack this, but I'll remind you, this segment's high value, high margin and we continue to expand even in third quarter, in third quarter year-to-date, we're expanding our pretax margins overall. But let me give you the different dynamics on how they're playing out, and I'll do it kind of headwind, tailwind. First, in terms of headwind. As you could see through our -- the prepared remarks, we were impacted by TPS and by these -- by our horizontal apps. So let's talk TPS. TPS, high-value business, strategically important to our clients. By the way, it encompasses mission-critical systems that run many industries like banking, like airlines, like retail and there is seasonality to this business. And what you saw play out in third quarter was tied to enterprise client-buying cycles that really reflect the time of when they commit to choose to go to the platform. And what we see right now, when you look at the last couple of years, by the way, a 2-year [ CGR ] kind of is within our long-term model expectations. We had a strong growth last year, down 8% this quarter. But when we look at our fourth quarter, we actually see a very strong pipeline because we're in the sweet spot of what that client-buying cycle is here in the fourth quarter. And with that, we expect growth in this part of the portfolio here in the fourth quarter, and that will lead to much better software performance overall. Around our horizontal apps, again, we talked 90 days ago, what did we say? We were going to strategically invest, and we were going to take action, action around revitalizing our portfolio to be more digitally consumable, around investing, around high-value embedding AI and Watson to differentiate and around actions we were going to take around portfolio simplification and repositioning our platforms for further innovation. And we've made progress, I'll tell you. In collaboration, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've had our biggest release ever of Notes/Domino version 10 focused on mobile, supporting JavaScript, Node.js, more open than ever, integrated with other platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, Watson, Weather. And we expect that to play out as we get into '19 with that innovative technology. And in commerce and talent, we've been making innovation and investments and embedding AI so we can differentiate our value proposition in the marketplace to win. And I would tell you early signs -- we got some green shoots. Our SaaS signings are growing. And in particular, in commerce and in talent, collectively, they're growing significant double digit in the third quarter. So there are some good green shoots starting out, but again, that will play out as we get later into 2019 and we can ramp and scale. And then finally, I'll wrap up on our high-value industry verticals and domain areas. We had good growth in security. We have a differentiated value proposition. We're gaining market share. We're the industry leader. We expect that to continue. And in health, we had strong growth in health, pervasive across the platforms, and we're scaling. We're scaling new emerging areas like blockchain where, again, we've got 75 active blockchain networks in production and we've got engagements in over 500 clients around global trade, universal payments, around trade finance, around food safety, et cetera. So we see that part of the portfolio continue to improve. So when you bring it all together, we expect with the strong pipeline that we would return IBM Software back to an expectation of modest growth in the fourth quarter. And we'll see, as we get through fourth quarter, how that momentum will continue in '19, and we'll talk in January.",787

The backdrop to the question is your backlog is down a little bit, but I think your duration is also down. But against that context is technology services support declined meaningfully this quarter, down 3%. With presumably being a harder mainframe cycle next year, can that grow and enable the whole business unit to grow? So if you could just talk more broadly about the outlook for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms with particular bias to CY '19.",112
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993977.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,29,"Sure. Sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it. Remember, within this segment, we've got multiple components, and I think you want to get to the services aspect of Technology Services & Cloud Platform. But let me start first with the integration software, which is central part of our integrated value proposition around our hybrid cloud strategy, which differentiates us in the marketplace. You've seen consistent growth over the last couple quarters, and we think given that differentiated value proposition, that we've got momentum in that space, that we've always focused on being open, a secure platform and driving differentiation around multi-cloud as we move forward. That integration software is going to be a critical component of that moving forward. So that's that. Now let's go to our technology services or GTS part of the business. Remember, that's made up of 2 primary offering segments: one, TSS, which has been a drag on us throughout 2018, and that is entirely aligned to what our expectations would have been with a mainframe product launch cycle. Typically, we'll see that cycle hurt us in the first 5 to 6 quarters, and then it comes back and accelerates, especially coupled with our extension into multi-vendor service where we've been doing quite well as we move forward. And the margin dynamics, by the way, are very strong in that portfolio. So as we start accelerating growth, we'll see better operating leverage in that segment as we go forward. And then finally, you have your core infrastructure service offering, and that ties right back to our overall outsourcing backlog that you quoted, and it ties back to our success in moving our enterprise clients to the cloud. And I talked earlier about over 30% of our backlog now sits in cloud and new SI content is approaching 45% overall. Durations, you're right, have been reduced as we continue to execute, and again, fourth quarter is huge. We expect a good quarter, and that will position 2019 as we execute and deliver the value for our clients.",344

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2018",2018-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4556.0,1571578.0,61993980.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,32,"Yes. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate the question overall. Obviously, we'll get into 2019 in January. We've got a lot of work to do ahead of us. Again, as I said, we're 16 days into arguably the most important quarter given the amount of large transactional business that we've got to get done. I talked about my answer in cognitive. We see a good opportunity pipeline ahead of us right now. We believe in the portfolio, the strength of it, the offerings we have to deliver differentiated value to our enterprise clients overall. And we expect, as I stated, IBM Software to return to modest growth here in the fourth quarter. And as we play fourth quarter out, we'll see, as we get into January, where we'll move forward, you're right, our model is mid-single-digit growth. We believe we've got the right portfolio for that. But as always, portfolio optimization has been a critical strategy to our overall business model and our financial model. And you've seen that play out over time not only on where we invest our capital organically, but where we leverage M&A and how we create value for our clients and for IBM shareholders and also where we divest in areas that either didn't meet our strategic fit or our financial requirements on where we see growth and more importantly, profit pools as we move forward. So we'll continue to evaluate that, and we'll update you in 2019 on where we're at.
So with that, let me close up the call, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us here today. So our results through the third quarter reflect the work we've been doing collectively across 366,000 IBMers around the world, around how we've reallocated capital, how we've taken bold actions around where we place our investments and how we've repositioned our business. And then we've done all the work on how we transform the way we operate in our operating model overall, and you see that play out in our margins, in our level of operating leverage and productivity here in the third quarter, which we expect going into fourth quarter and beyond. You see those results. Profit margins are strong. You see it in the innovation, in differentiation that we're bringing to the market, especially in areas like hybrid cloud, how we're winning in digital with our GBS business and around data and AI and security.
So with that said, we'll talk more about hybrid cloud, in particular, at the end of this month when Arvind and Martin Jetter will host the next webcast in our investor webcast series. So I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. And as always, it's back to work for all of us. Take care.",461
