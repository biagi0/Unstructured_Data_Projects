Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We delivered strong revenue growth in our business. The growth was broad based across our software, consulting and infrastructure segments as well as across geographies. 
Our clients recognize that technology continues to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Over the last several quarters, it has become clear that technology is playing a significant role in boosting productivity in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, supply chain challenges and sustainability requirements. We entered 2022, a more focused company and took steps to reinforce our position. We strengthened our consulting expertise and expanded strategic partnerships. To bolster our software portfolio, we invested in hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. We also delivered significant innovations in infrastructure with our Z16 and Power platforms. All of this was brought to market with a more technical and experiential sales approach.
Looking back on the year, we are pleased with the progress we made. We delivered revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model, and we delivered solid free cash flow. But I'll acknowledge there is more to do. This year, we'll unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets.
For 2023, we see revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range and about $10.5 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us on a path of sustainable growth. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy.
Our perspective is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the 2 most transformative technologies for business today. These technologies work together to drive business outcomes. Hybrid cloud is where the world is going. Containers are the preferred destination for applications. Hybrid cloud offers more value than relying on a singular public cloud. It enables organizations to drive business value across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge.
This includes scale, security, ease of use, flexibility of deployment, seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles. Our platform, built on Red Hat, is the leading container platform, allowing clients to harness the power of open source software innovations. IBM software and infrastructure technologies have been optimized for this platform. Our consultants and others leverage their extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate clients' digital transformation journeys.
Clients are realizing real value from working with IBM's hybrid cloud platform approach. For example, we worked with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC, to adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Using Red Hat technology, CIBC manages and scales its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility. They can now develop applications in a private cloud and quickly deploy them to a public cloud. They delivered hundreds of new applications and reduced provisioning time by 95% and deployment time by 50%.
We are helping Delta Air Lines leverage hybrid cloud to modernize options, automate operations and integrate security. IBM Consulting deployed Red Hat on Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud Paks to provide a consistent platform. Delta now has more levers they can use to boost developer productivity, reduce time to market and improve employee satisfaction. CIBC and Delta are both great examples of the value hybrid cloud can provide.
Let's now talk about artificial intelligence or AI. AI is projected to contribute $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, including a massive boost in productivity by infusing AI into every enterprise process. We have been co-creating with many clients to deploy AI at scale. We automated the drive-through experience for quick-serve restaurants. We accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by automating the processes that assist millions of customers with inquiries and appointments. By applying AI and automation, we have helped security analysts reduce the time to respond to threats from hours or days to minutes.
Recently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office partnered with IBM to leverage a host of AI capabilities that make it easier for people to glean insights from their vast database of patents. The BBC is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure.
For businesses, deploying AI can be challenging because it takes time to train each model. But by using large language models, companies can now create multiple models using the same data set. This means businesses can deploy AI with a fraction of the time and resources. That is why we are investing in large language or foundation models for our clients and have infused these capabilities across our AI portfolio.
Our partner ecosystem plays a critical role in the execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, we made a series of new IBM software offerings available as a service in the AWS marketplace. Likewise, Red Hat continued the expansion of its offerings in hyperscaler marketplaces, making Ansible automation platform available on both Azure and AWS. Adobe and Salesforce are also leveraging open source innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings. Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP, Microsoft and AWS all over $1 billion in revenue for the year.
We've had great success with our strategic partners; and as we enter the new year, we are expanding and better enabling our broader ecosystem. Recently launched Partners Plus, a new simplified program that increases our reach and scale through new and existing IBM partners. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we introduced Red Hat Device Edge, a lightweight solution to flexibly deploy traditional or containerized workloads on small devices such as robots, IoT gateways, point of sale and public transport.
We also formed a collaboration with the Japanese consortium Rapidus to leverage the depth of our intellectual property on advanced semiconductors. We unveiled Osprey, a 433 qubit quantum processor that brings us closer to delivering our goal of building a 1,000 qubit system later this year.
At the same time, we continue to acquire companies to complement our organic innovation. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Octo, which improves our footprint in the U.S. federal market. This caps the year with 8 acquisitions across software and consulting. 
As sustainability becomes more of a priority, companies need digital technologies to analyze data, creating a baseline and improve the way they operate. Our software has helped IBM reduce its own carbon footprint. Across IBM's global real estate presence, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by over 61% when compared to 2010. Using IBM Sustainability Software, we have simplified and automated our sustainability reporting processes and reduced reporting costs by 30%.
Let me wrap by saying I'm pleased with the progress we have made with our portfolio, our go to market and our ecosystem. I'm confident in our ability to leverage hybrid cloud and AI to help clients turn business challenges into opportunities. Our strategy continues to strongly resonate with clients and partners, and this gives us a solid foundation to build upon in this year. While there is more to be done, we enter the new year as a more capable and nimble company, well equipped to meet our clients' needs.
I will now turn it over to Jim, who will give you more detailed information on our performance and expectations.",1210
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335983.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $3.60. In our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up over 6% at constant currency. While the dollar weakened a bit from 90 days ago, it still impacted our reported revenue by over $1 billion and 6.3 points of growth. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency, and I'll remind you that we wrapped on the separation of Kyndryl at the beginning of November. The 1-month contribution to our fourth quarter revenue growth was offset by the impact of our divested health business.
Revenue growth this quarter was again broad based. Software revenue was up 8% and consulting up 9%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 7%.
Within each of these segments, our growth was pervasive. We also had good growth across our geographies, with mid-single-digit growth or better in Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. And for the year, we gained share overall. We had strong transactional growth in software and hardware to close the year. At the same time, our recurring revenue, which provides a solid base of revenue and profit, also grew, led by software. I'll remind you that, on an annual basis, about half of our revenue is recurring.
Over the last year, we've seen the results of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform centric. As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting and infrastructure. For the year, our hybrid cloud revenue was over $22 billion, up 17% from 2021.
Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter, we expanded operating pretax margin by 170 basis points. This reflects a strong portfolio mix and improving software and consulting margins. These same dynamics drove a 60 basis point increase in operating gross margin. Our expense was down year-to-year driven by currency dynamics. Within our base expense, the work we're doing to digitally transform our operations provides flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and in talent. Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year. And our operating earnings per share of $3.60 was up over 7%.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $5.2 billion in the quarter and $9.3 billion for the year. Our full year free cash flow is up $2.8 billion from 2021. As we talked about all year, we have a few drivers of our free cash flow growth. First, I'll remind you, 2021's cash flow results included Kyndryl-related activity including the impact of spin charges and CapEx. Second, we had working capital improvements driven by efficiencies in our collections and mainframe cycle dynamics. Despite strong collections, the combination of revenue performance above our model and the timing of the transactions in the quarter led to higher-than-expected working capital at the end of the year. This impacted our free cash flow performance versus expectations. 
Our year-to-year free cash flow growth also includes a modest tailwind from cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions, partially offset by increased CapEx investment for today's IBM. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested $2.3 billion to acquire 8 companies across software and consulting, mitigated by over $1 billion in proceeds from divested businesses; and we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong liquidity position with cash of $8.8 billion. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year, and our debt balance is down nearly $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and I say the same for our retirement-related plans. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 114%, with the U.S. at 125%. Both are up year-to-year.  
You'll recall back in September, we took another step to reduce the risk profile of our plans. We transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan obligations to insurers without changing the benefits payable to plan participants. This resulted in a significant noncash charge in our GAAP results in the third quarter, and we'll see a benefit in our nonoperating charges going forward. You can see the benefit of this and other pension assumptions to the 2023 retirement-related costs in our supplemental charts.
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 8%, fueled by growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. We concluded the year with seasonally strong transactional performance as well as a solid and growing recurring revenue base in software.
In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 10%, with pervasive growth across our business areas: Red Hat, automation, data and AI, and security. Our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI is resonating with clients. As a proof point, OpenShift, our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, now has $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And we modernize and optimize our software capabilities, including through Cloud Paks across automation, data and AI, and security for that platform.
Red Hat revenue grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in OpenShift and Ansible, both growing double digits and gaining market share. Automation revenue was up 9%. Growth was led by business automation, application servers and integration as clients look to automate business workflows and improve applications. Data and AI revenue grew 8% with enterprise needs to organize, store and manage their data. This performance reflects demand in areas including data management, data fabric, and asset and supply chain management.
Security delivered 10% revenue growth. We're helping clients detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, which led to strength across threat management, data security and identity. Across these businesses, the annual recurring revenue or ARR for Hybrid Platform & Solutions is $13.3 billion. And for all of software, hybrid cloud revenue is now more than $9.3 billion over the last year, up 16%.
In Transaction Processing, revenue was up 3%. Demand for this mission-critical software has followed increases in zSystems installed base capacity over the last couple of product cycles, and strong renewal rates continued this quarter. Both are evidence of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment.
Moving to software profit. Our pretax margin was up 2 points this quarter, contributing to a full year margin of nearly 25%. Consulting revenue grew 9%. Clients are leveraging IBM's hybrid cloud leadership and deep industry expertise to navigate the complexity of their digital transformation journeys. Revenue growth was broad based across all business lines and geographies. And I'll remind you that this is on top of the 16% growth Consulting delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Strong demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 17%. With this, fourth quarter had the best quarterly book to bill of the year, and we sequentially improved our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio to 1.1.
Clients are partnering with IBM Consulting as they decide what applications to modernize and how to migrate those applications across hybrid, multi-cloud environments. Over the last 12 months, Consulting delivered $9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 23%. This quarter, our Red Hat practice was again a meaningful contributor to this growth. Revenue from strategic partnerships also grew at a strong double-digit rate. We continue to see momentum in this space. In aggregate, our strategic partnership bookings were up over 50% with Azure and AWS more than doubling.
Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 7%. Growth in business transformation was once again driven by data and client experience transformations along with supply chain and finance optimization. Our partnerships with key ISV partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe enable IBM Consulting to transform critical workloads at scale. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 10%. Growth was led by cloud application development practices. Red Hat engagements along with our strategic hyperscaler partnerships contributed to the growth.
Application operations revenue grew 12%. We help clients to optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environment. Our incumbency and understanding of clients' applications are key differentiators.
Moving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin was 11% for the quarter and nearly 9% for the year. The fourth quarter margin is up nearly 2 points year-to-year and over 1 point sequentially. We are starting to see the benefit from pricing actions and productivity, and our acquisitions have become more accretive.
Turning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 7% driven by hybrid infrastructure, which was up 11%. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue grew 21% this quarter. Among the new z16 capabilities, clients are leveraging cyber resiliency to comply with business regulations and proactively avoid outages in their operation; and the new on-chip AI accelerator, for example, has been helping mitigate risk and detect fraud in credit card application processes.
Our Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 5%. This performance was fueled by strength in Power following the extension of Power10 innovation throughout the product line. Infrastructure Support performance was flat including the impact from client adoption of new hardware with the latest z16 product cycle.
Moving to Infrastructure profit. Pretax margin was down less than 1 point in the quarter. And for the full year, our pretax margin was nearly 15%.
Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. At our investor briefing 15 months ago, we laid out our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and our priorities of revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Since then, we've been focused on our portfolio, our go-to-market model, our ecosystem and our capital allocation to execute that strategy and create value through focus.
We now just completed the first year as today's IBM. Our 2022 revenue was up nearly 12%, including nearly 4 points of incremental Kyndryl contribution. That's above our model of mid-single-digit growth. Over 70% of our revenue was in our growth vectors of software and consulting, and about half of our revenue is recurring.  
With this high-value mix and contribution from the incremental Kyndryl revenue, we expanded our full year operating pretax margin by 2.5 points. And our free cash flow was $9.3 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year. We invested organically and inorganically and returned significant value to shareholders through dividends.
Now there were some external factors that we faced this past year that impacted our profit and cash. We exited a profitable business in Russia. We are dealing with a much stronger dollar, and we are operating in a highly inflationary environment, which put pressure on our margins, especially in Consulting.
Putting it all together, we are pleased with the fundamentals of our business and the progress we have made in executing our strategy. Our 2022 performance demonstrates that we now have a higher growth, higher value company with higher return on invested capital and a strong and growing free cash flow.
For 2023, we again expect solid growth in our 2 most important measures of success: revenue and free cash flow. Arvind talked about the important role technology plays in this environment and how our solutions are closely aligned to the needs of our clients. With this, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we enter this year, I think it's prudent to expect the low end of the mid-single-digit model. And for free cash flow, we'd expect to generate about $10.5 billion in 2023, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year.
Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In Software, with continued momentum in our recurring revenue stream in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, we expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth generates operating leverage, and we'd expect software pretax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. Consulting's model is to deliver high single-digit revenue.
We're coming off a strong year with revenue growth of 15% as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and strong book-to-bill ratio support Consulting revenue growth at the high end of its model despite the tough compare. We expect to expand Consulting pretax margin by at least 1 point as we continue to realize more of the price increases and improved utilization. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're entering the year 3 quarters into the z16 cycle, and we'll also wrap up Power10.
As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue below its model and pretax margin in the low teens. For perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point. That's in line with our model. And our tax rate should be in the mid- to high teens range.
Let me comment on a few items within our expectations. First, as I said, currency was a significant headwind in 2022, impacting revenue by $3.5 billion. With the movement of spot rates over the last 90 days, currency translation would be fairly neutral to revenue in 2023 with a headwind in the first half flipping to a tailwind in the second. But I'll remind you that we had over $650 million of hedging gains in 2022, which will not repeat in 2023, resulting in an impact to our profit and cash on a year-to-year basis.
Second, as you know, we've taken a number of significant portfolio actions over the last couple of years, which has resulted in some stranded costs in our business. We expect to address these remaining stranded costs early in the year and anticipate a charge of about $300 million in the first quarter. We would start to see benefits in the second half and pay back by the end of the year.
And then third, we regularly review the useful lives of our assets. Due to advances in technology, we are making an accounting change to extend the useful life of our server and networking equipment effective the first of January. Based on our year-end asset base, we expect this change to benefit 2023 pretax profit by over $200 million, primarily in our Infrastructure segment. Given this is a change to the depreciation, there's no benefit to cash.
Looking at the first quarter. Our constant currency revenue growth should be fairly consistent with the full year. Reported growth will also include about a 3-point currency headwind at current spot rates. With operating leverage, we'd expect operating pretax margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points in the first quarter. And that's before the charge I just mentioned for the remaining stranded costs. Given the timing of currency and stranded cost dynamics, we'd expect about 1/3 of our net income in the first half and about 2/3 in the second half.
To sum it all up, we have made a lot of progress this past year. While there's always more work to do, we're confident in the fundamentals of our business, and how we're positioned as we enter the new year.

And perhaps you could spend a little bit of time on -- you touched on kind of the '22 levers a fair bit and how you got there. But as you think about calendar '23 free cash flow of $10.5 billion, upwards of $1.2 billion, what are the puts and takes? What are the bridges that get you there?
And then maybe related to that, as I think about what you did in '22 and '23, it does imply to get to this $35 billion number over 3 years, '24 would have to be $14 billion plus. So perhaps you can level set that because I do think from when you provided the $35 billion number, a fair bit has changed. So maybe a bridge for '23 and just an update on how you think about the $35 billion number over 3 years as well.",156
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335987.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Amit. This is Jim. I appreciate the question. So let's start there. We saw a solid free cash flow generation in 2022, up $2.8 billion year-over-year. Now as you remember, we entered 2022. We talked about a very strong free cash flow generation engine, and we put in place a guidance for 2022 well in excess of our model of $750 million year-to-year. First, as we were very transparent, we were going to get at least about half of that out of the Kyndryl-related spin dynamics. That's the charges and CapEx. And we were going to get a little bit more than half of that out of our base operations overall.
And I think when you look at 2022, what happened? We got impacted by 2 external factors: number one, the unfortunate humanitarian crisis with the war in Russia and Ukraine, and we exited that business, the right decision; second is unprecedented U.S. dollar appreciation. I think last time I looked, the rate, the breadth, the magnitude of the change is the most we've seen in multiple decades. We got hit with that, but we're able to overcome some of that with the fundamental underpinnings of our business overall and still delivered almost $3 billion of free cash flow year-over-year. By the way, Russian currency by themselves is over $600 million of profit and cash we had to absorb.
So now to your question about 2023, we guided, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a $10.5 billion. That's up $1.2 billion year-over-year and again, above our $750 million year-to-year. The underpinnings of that, though, are going to be very different in '23. Given the improving business fundamentals of our now sustainable revenue growth with a high-value mix contribution, we see then continued operating leverage. So our cash PTI is going to deliver a substantial amount of that free cash flow generation year-over-year.
We're still going to get working capital efficiency, so our realization will definitely be up over 100%. But that's really given the volume dynamics of what happened in the fourth quarter with a very strong and accelerated growth profile as we went through fourth quarter. We finished extremely strong on our transactional business in the month of December. So that now creates an opportunity for free cash flow generation in '23, and that's in our guidance.
And then there are some other puts and takes. Yes, we'll get modest structural actions tailwind, but they're going to be offset by a cash tax headwind for the year. So that kind of plays out 2022 and 2023.
Now how does that relate to a midterm model? First of all, we're 1 year into that midterm model. And as I talked about, the dynamics in dealing with the decision to exit our Russia business and the significant U.S. dollar appreciation, I quantified it for you over a $600 million impact on profit and cash. But as you all know quite well, that's not a onetime impact. That will continue over a multi-period, and it definitely puts pressure on our midterm model to the tune cumulatively about over $2.5 billion. So we are entirely focused on how we execute this company on a sustainable revenue growth profile and generating that $10.5 billion of free cash flow, so it enables us, with the right ample financial flexibility, to continue to invest in our business and return value to our shareholders overall.",570

I was wondering if you could share some thoughts around what's happening in software in particular. You've had a really strong performance in Transaction Processing over the past year. How are you thinking about the trajectory of that? I know historically, we've kind of thought about this as mid-single-digit or higher decliner, and clearly, we're tracking very differently here. If you could share some thoughts around the trajectory of that in 2023 and beyond, that would be very helpful.",87
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335990.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. So I'll address your Transaction Processing question first and then all of Software right after that. So some of you have heard me talk about that Transaction Processing would be a mid-single-digit decliner in the past. And that effectively, Wamsi, is what you asked, what's going to be different. As we look at our business there and we look both at the underlying MIPS growth as well as the criticality of that software as well as our ability to have some very modest pricing uplifts, we would now look at that business as being a slight increaser as opposed to a modest decliner. So I think if you are looking at that one, Wamsi, low single-digit increases for Transaction Processing is what we think is appropriate for the short- to medium-term model looking forward. 
Now that does help in overall Software. So first, let's look at Software and decompose it. Software, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, is almost 80% recurring revenue. We see that recurring revenue increasing consistent with our model of the mid-single digits based on both the consumption, the usage as well as what we have seen through '22 in people renewing that base of Software business.
Then I will acknowledge to you that '22 was a great ELA year. '23 will be not as good as '22, but with the transactional piece of the business being less than 20%, that has a much smaller impact on the overall growth rate. As you put all that together, we see the mid-single digits as being appropriate for the Software business.",269

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335992.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,12,"I was wondering if you could just comment on operating profit more broadly. I think your target at the beginning of the year was for operating profit to improve 400 basis points, and it came in at 270. I think your target for the fourth quarter was 250 basis point improvement in operating margin and came in at 170. And so -- and that's manifesting itself into a free cash flow number that was lower than you had expected and this year and potentially for next year relative to your $35 billion target.
So you have a dual mandate, Arvind. One is to try and grow mid-single digits, and the other is to deliver very strong cash flow, which is impacted by margins. The margin was not as strong this year, and I'm wondering if you can highlight what was different from your expectations and what were the challenges in forecasting that and how investors should think about that and free cash flow realization going forward.",166
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335993.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,13,"Yes. Toni, thanks. So you're completely accurate that these numbers are slightly below our expectations from the beginning of the year. I will ask Jim to comment and give you a lot more color on it. But let me first comment on your statement of we have a double mandate of revenue growth and free cash flow growth. So -- but I want to also be clear, revenue growth has -- which manifests itself in client satisfaction, higher NPS from our clients, better consumption of both software and consulting from our clients, which allows them to consume more and more over time, is what we are focused on. And it's an -- and we have to deliver the free cash flow growth. 
Jim mentioned in a response to the first question that we were not expecting the business in Russia to get shut down. That impacted it a little bit. We were not expecting the currency headwinds to be as severe as it turned out to be. That's certainly impacted. And I'll acknowledge that inflation, as in wage inflation, showed up and impacted our margins in Consulting a lot more than we were expecting.
Now an answer could have been to not hire people and to not give that, but that would have resulted then in lower capacity at the end of this year, which would not have allowed us the confidence into the growth, both in Consulting and in Software that we are now committing for 2023. So as we balance those, it becomes a business decision to say we are going to keep going on increasing capacity, which results in healthier revenue, and it will result in improving margins, but that flows through into 2023 as opposed to giving it all to us in 2022. 
So Toni, that's kind of how we think about balancing the investments in the business versus a quarterly result. And I'll ask Jim to comment a bit more on some of the specifics of what you were asking.",335
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335994.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,14,"Yes. Just to put some numbers around this, Toni, you're exactly right. We entered the year. We talked about a business profile, higher revenue growth company, higher operating margins, strong free cash flow yield. And we had guided at mid-single-digit revenue growth, and we guided that 4 points of operating margin improvement.
The 2 points of external that both Arvind and I have both talked about Russia and currency, by the way, that was about 0.5 point because currency, as we've talked about many times throughout these calls, not only the rate breadth and velocity and change in magnitude that we haven't seen in about 2 to 3 decades, but it impacts human capital-based consulting business very differently than a product technology-based business.
As we talked about, human capital is all pretty much a natural hedge because your cost is basically matched with your revenue outside of global delivery. But in a product-based business, our costs like the industry is predominantly U.S. dollar sourced, and that's why you've seen pressure on the gross profit margin line and the pretax profit margin line around our technology base of business.
Now underlying that, though, I think you're seeing a fundamental improvement in our margins as we go forward, so about 50 basis points of currency. The remaining 100 basis points was Consulting. And we talked about that. That's been a rate and pace discussion. You dial back 15, 18 months ago, we called a very accelerated demand environment of our clients shifting the digital transformation and journey to cloud. And starting in the second half of '21, we made the bet to make investments around skill, capability, ecosystems, and we opened up the aperture to build extended capabilities inorganically.
And we knew as we went through 2022 that we then we're operating in a highly inflationary environment. And then it became a rate and pace discussion on how quick can you get price margin and optimization and realize through your backlog. And I think we've acknowledged that we were pretty slow throughout the year. 
Now with that said, we finished the year about 9 points of margin in Consulting. We had nice improvement. We exited fourth quarter at 11-point PTI model. That was up almost 200 basis points year-over-year. Our first half to second half, we saw an acceleration of 3 points of margin from about a 7-point operating PTI model to well over 10 points of an operating PTI model. And most importantly, the green shoots are starting to play out in the fourth quarter. Our utilization of effective capacity, 1 of the 3 levers we talked about all year, up 3 points in the fourth quarter. Our price margins, third consecutive quarter, are up year-to-year, and you're seeing that play out in that operating profit performance.
And finally, acquisitions, now we're on a steady state, and our acquisitions are back to accretion. So we see nice green shoots that lead to our guidance in 2023 at the high end of our high single-digit model in Consulting on revenue coming off of a very strong 15% growth in '22 and guiding another 1 point plus in operating margins going forward.",529

Interesting. Yes, Arvind, can you talk a bit about AI and how it runs through your business? There's obviously so much discussion right now about OpenAI and Microsoft making investments. And I guess I'm trying to think about how we should think about IBM monetizing it, capitalizing on it, how you think about your competitive position relative to others. I don't know if there are examples you can give of where you're utilizing it. But I'm just -- I'm wondering, as AI gets more and more of a -- becomes more and more of a discussion point apparently for 2023 and you have such a long history with it, how we should think about where you are now and where you're going to take it.",126
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102335999.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,19,"Thanks, Shannon. So first, let me acknowledge, AI has become a big topic of conversation this year. I was in Davos last week, and it probably came up at almost every single discussion around technology, what's happening with AI as well as what's happening with OpenAI. If I think about it over the last decade, I think there were 3 moments we can talk about, and then I'll begin to translate those into a business impact. One, when IBM won Jeopardy! with Watson, I think it was a big moment, and AI came on to everyone's road map. Second, when deep mind from Google or Alphabet started winning competitions around, for example, GO, and that became another big moment along with the protein folding that they did and now with OpenAI and ChatGPT. 
But if I step back just a moment, all of this latest version is based on what is called large language models as the underlying science. Universities do it. Google does it. IBM does it as does OpenAI. To just get to why it's so exciting, for example, for us, it allows us to do 13 language models when we are looking at understanding different natural languages in the same cost as originally 1. That is what is so exciting about these technologies because if you can get an order of magnitude improvement in cost and speed and the resource consumed, both in terms of hardware and people, that is incredibly exciting.
Now let me translate this into how do we monetize this. So our monetization of AI is very much focused on that $16 trillion of productivity that I've talked about that we're going to get over the decade. The vast majority of that comes from enterprise automation; and when I say enterprise, I include governments into it. Some examples, if you can automate the drive-through and order taking for quick-serve restaurants, that's an example of what can happen. If we can get deflection rates of 40%, 50%, 60% at everyone's call centers, that's a massive operational efficiency for all of our clients. If we can help retirees get their pensions through interacting with a Watson-powered AI chatbot, that is an enterprise use case where all of these technologies come into play.
By the way, all my 3 examples are real clients where we are resulting in anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people, the  efficiency for each of these clients. So that's how we get it. If I look inside IBM, how we do promotions, how we do people movement, how we begin to improve our quote to cash, how we improve our customer service and people ask complicated questions around triage of IT systems going down are all very real examples where we are improving client service and saving money all at the same time.",471

Signings were very strong in the December quarter, up 17%. Your quarterly book to bill was an improvement from the September quarter. Can you maybe just, again, just step back and elaborate on the environment we're in, what you saw in 4Q that potentially stood out to you, where strength in signings is coming from, changes to contract duration? Maybe just double clicking on the Consulting business just to help us understand what gives you confidence to be kind of at the high end of your midterm model for 2023?",99
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102336002.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,22,"Thanks, Erik, for the question. I'll take this. When we entered the fourth quarter, we had a pretty solid pipeline. And we talked about and reaffirmed mid-teens growth for Consulting for the year, which, as you know, is well above our model. But again, as I talked about on the previous question, we had made the investments in bringing in skill, capability, expanding ecosystem, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. But we saw that pipeline entering the quarter. We saw a very solid and pretty disciplined sales closure rate as we moved through the year. Now how did the year end that positions us for 2023? And let me just put some stats to really bring it home.
Number one, ecosystem velocity, we saw continue to increase throughout the year of our strategic partnerships. I think we said in the prepared remarks, strategic partnerships, 1, grew revenue 25% in 2022 and was about 40% of our consulting base of business. That is up about 50% year-over-year. We have saw -- seen extensive acceleration. And by the way, in the fourth quarter, our signings growth, which delivered a 1.3 book to bill, our hyperscaler partnerships with Azure and what AWS, our signings were 2x. And our ISV portfolio with the likes of SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, we were up over 50% in signings. So our book of business and the partnerships, we have tremendous strength that's fueling our backlog, point #1. 
Point #2, Red Hat. We continue to see acceleration of Consulting being the tip of the spear that's really driving the scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and oh, by the way, is also dragging IBM technology and software. Since inception a little over 3 years, we signed $7.4 billion of business in Red Hat, tremendous strength and that, again, fuels our backlog for 2023. And then you look at full year, we grew both large transformational deals, and we grew small deals double digit, both sides. So it was pervasive across the board. 
So when we look at our backlog, we look at all of our indicators of our business on the realization of that model. We look on the acquisition portfolio and how it's scaling. We feel pretty confident about the high end of our high single-digit model in 2023. Oh, by the way, to Toni's question, at operating margins being accretive.",393

I think with earnings coming in from various enterprise tech players, so far, we're seeing a pretty wide range of signals about how the demand environment is shaping up for 2023. Can you just comment a bit on what you're seeing from your large clients, say, kind of relative to this past year?",70
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102336005.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,25,"Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Look, if I think about our overall client base, we were first really pleased that there wasn't much of a difference by geography. As I sort of go through it, Japan, India, Australia, the Middle East, Western Europe, the U.K. North America were really pretty strong in demand across. So I think, Lisa, if I break it down into the 2 portions around technology and consulting, what we are seeing is that most of our clients do believe that even if there are some, I'll call, the minor or different headwinds in 2023, they are going to emerge stronger. As they are to emerge stronger, that means they're all deploying technology to help offset wage inflation, cyber issues, supply chain challenges and all the demographic shifts, meaning there's just fewer skilled people to hire.
Consequently, we're seeing them double down, and that is why we have focused on certain areas and certain partners, both for consulting and in technology. They all want to deploy automated ways to get from the front to the back. Maybe Salesforce and Adobe play a very strong role in that. They all want to leverage cloud technologies, so they can scale technology up to better handle client demand. Our partnerships with the hyperscalers play into that. They all want to leverage far more technology than they have before to counteract the wage inflation and other inflationary aspects. And what we do with Red Hat plays into that. 
So I kind of see, Lisa, that all of our clients play into that. Now you've mentioned a wide spectrum from the people you're seeing recently. I think the reason that we are remaining in this optimistic frame of mind, we have no consumer business. I agree that our clients may have a consumer business, but we don't have that directly. And so I think, consequently, we might be seeing a little bit different subset of the economy than those who might have a large direct exposure to a consumer business.",339

That said, Arvind, can you talk specifically or identify any product-specific changes in software that you think may be driving that momentum and that may suggest your competitive positioning is shifting in any of those 3 non-Red Hat segments.
And then just one other thing, just sorry about the 2-part question. But just for Jim, I just wanted to clarify with that working capital headwind in the fourth quarter that you talked about reverses in 2023.",128
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102336008.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"Yes. Thanks, David. Let me talk a little bit about the product capabilities and as you said, outside Red Hat called focus on automation, data, AI and cyber. If I look at those -- let's take automation. I'm really pleased with the progress we have made around an area I'll call AIOps. But if you think about, we made a couple of small acquisitions, Instana and Turbonomic, we built our own AIOps portfolio, and we're seeing tremendous pickup from that as our clients want to take out labor complexity but also want to optimize their overall IT infrastructure, hardware and software. They also want to have uptime that is now the talk about not just two nines and three nines but up to five nines. And they also want to worry about how to make sure some go to always on. And so I think our AIOps portfolio there really advantages us, and I believe we're in a unique position because we help our clients in an environment across multiple public clouds and on-premise, and with their private clouds in that space.
If I think about data and AI, our focus on data fabric and allowing our clients to leverage the data wherever it is, not always moving it but allowing them to catalog it, leveraging AI deep inside our products is another example of where we have a unique capability. And third, if I look at cyber, we focus a lot on threat management. And if we think about how we can leverage the inputs from all kinds of sources in these days and people are really worried about all of the threats coming, whether from nation states or from just bad actors, then it allows them to leverage that portfolio better.
Consequently, we're going to remain pretty focused on these areas. You should expect both organic and inorganic investment. And David, I can't help but say, we are giving our clients the ability to deploy these capabilities on multiple public clouds as well as on-premise. And I believe that does advantage them because it gives them a lot more flexibility and freedom than they might have from some other vendors.",362

I would just build on that, Arvind. I mean Software book of business today, it's an integral part of our hybrid cloud platform thesis. It is the foundation. We eclipsed $25 billion for the first time ever here in 2022, so over 40% of IBM's revenue and 2/3 of our EBITDA. So when you look at it, we are a hybrid cloud AI platform-centric company overall and Software is right at that course. So why that recurring revenue stream and the improvements we've been seeing throughout 2022? And as Arvind answered earlier, getting that back to a growing contribution not only helps the competitiveness and market share of our top line, but I think all of you understand the marginal dollar of that book of business is in the 90-plus percent range as we move forward.
So David, I think you also asked a question about clarification. Free cash flow growth, $10.5 billion about, up $1.2 billion year-to-year, above our model of $750 million. That will be driven based on the fundamental improvements of our underlying revenue growth and operating leverage and cash PTI, but there will also be, yes, a working capital efficiency contribution to our cash generation next year, really just the volume dynamics of what played out in the fourth quarter. We'll get that back.",219

This one is macro related as well, but it's pretty quick. It seems like some of the slowing macro's implied in your 2023 guidance, but I don't think you talked specifically about whether you're seeing anything specifically slowing. It sounded generally positive for you guys, even though there's a bit of a slowdown implied in the guidance.
Microsoft and F5 talked about a divergence between new business and new applications, seeing some growth versus renewal business, capacity expansions, cross-selling and things like that. Are you seeing a similar thing in terms of new applications slowing a bit and some of the kind of recurring and cross-selling capacity expansions holding up. How much of either of those is driving your lower end of mid-single-digit growth guidance for 2023? And kind of break it down if you can.",143
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2023",2023-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4071.0,2730232.0,102336012.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"Okay. Look, I think that first -- and I'll address your point on new application versus existing pretty directly. The point about the lower end of the mid-single digit is largely from the fact that Infrastructure segment will be a headwind going into 2023, whereas it was a tailwind in '22. I wouldn't read anything more than that into our low end as opposed to the middle of the range.
Now for us, I don't really see that. I see that our clients do want to do new development. Now from our perspective, if somebody is doing an expanded Salesforce deployment, I call that a new application. If somebody is doing a new application on Azure or if they are moving, well, they never really directly move. They always talk about refactoring, putting in new function, integrating with other applications they might have in their shop or that they buy as SaaS properties, we consider all that new development. And so for us, our consulting teams are largely doing that new development for our clients. 
And in that process, they tend to use OpenShift from Red Hat. They tend to use Red Hat Linux. They tend to use our AI automation. Our AI automation then surrounds all those things to make them much more resilient, much more robust, much more secure, and those are the capabilities we bring. 
So we are not really seeing that divergence, I will tell you straightforwardly, but there is likely a focus that in that new application, is it helping automate things more. Is it helping make things, I'll call it, straight through as opposed to with a lot of manual intervention? That is probably a bigger focus. Maybe we don't see it because we kind of call that play in late '21 because we kind of saw those things coming and becoming more important. And we decided to invest in them, both in technology and in consulting.
Patricia, with that being the last question, let me now make a couple of very quick comments to wrap up the call. 2022 was an important year for us. As Jim said, it was the first full year of the new IBM. The results we delivered reinforce our confidence in our strategy and our model. While there is always more to do, we are pleased with our position as we enter 2023, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue as we move through the year.",409

Our first quarter results demonstrate that clients continue to turn to IBM to help them address today's business needs while positioning them for the future. We had a good start to the year, with mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency, in line with our midterm model and growth in free cash flow. Performance was led by software and consulting as clients continue to accelerate their digital transformations, modernize their applications, automate their workflows and  create flexible and secure hybrid cloud environments.
More recently, clients are prioritizing digital transformation projects that focus on cost takeout, productivity and quick returns. While demand for our offerings that support these priorities remains solid, we are seeing some deceleration in consulting from the previous robust growth levels, especially in the United States.
Globally, our clients continue to see technology as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Technology helps them scale and enhance productivity, which is especially important in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, cybersecurity, supply chain issues and sustainability goals. All of this supports our revenue growth expectations for the year. Our focus remains on revenue growth and free cash flow.
90 days ago, I shared that in 2023, we continue to unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets. Productivity has always been an important part of our business model. It frees up spending and increases financial flexibility to enable investments. We have started to see some of these pay back in our results, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year free cash flow objectives.
Let me spend a few minutes on the progress we have made in the execution of our strategy. Our focus is on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, the 2 most influential technologies for business. In tandem, these technologies drive both business outcomes and innovation. Hybrid cloud is now the most prominent form of IT architecture, and our approach is platform-centric. Red Hat OpenShift is the leading container platform, enabling clients to leverage the latest innovations in open source software. IBM's software and infrastructure have been tailored for this platform. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation processes. 
In the first quarter, we co-created with more clients to unlock business value from a hybrid cloud approach. We are working with Virgin Money to migrate their credit card service to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. They will also leverage IBM's consulting capabilities to create new digital customer experiences. For the Boston Red Sox, we are collaborating with Wasabi Technologies, leveraging hybrid cloud technologies to analyze key data sources that improve the club's operations. 
The second element of our strategy is top of mind for a lot of clients: artificial intelligence. AI is projected to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Keep in mind that AI for business is different than AI for consumers, given their need for more accurate results, trusted data and governance tools. AI techniques such as foundation models, large language models and generative AI give businesses the ability to create 100 AI models from a single data set. Early cloud engagements experienced a 70% faster time to value. That is why we are seeing a lot more interest from business and using AI to boost productivity and reduce costs. Productivity gains will come from enterprises turning their workflows into simpler automated processes with AI. 
To achieve this, we are collaborating with companies like Citi to enhance their internal audit and compliance processes through AI. J.B. Hunt Transport use our Turbonomic AI-powered resourcing and automation engine to optimize their cloud environment. This helped reduce infrastructure refresh costs by 75%. This is a great example of the work we're doing in IT operations. In other areas such as customer care, we are automating hundreds of thousands of call center responses with AI with more than 90% accuracy and greater levels of customer satisfaction. 
In cybersecurity, our elite defense teams are deploying AI to defend against criminals in real time. In digital labor, we are helping finance, accounting and HR teams save thousands of hours by automating what used to be labor-intensive data entry tasks. To bring our hybrid cloud and AI strategy to market, our partner ecosystem continues to play a critical role. We expanded our partnership with Adobe to help marketing and creative organizations make the production of content easier. IBM and EY announced a collaboration using IBM software and EY's sustainability consulting practice to help companies operationalize decarbonization action plans. 
Juniper Networks and Nokia also recently expanded their collaboration around IBM's network intelligence and automation solutions to monetize and optimize investments in networks more effectively. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. A good example of this is the Cleveland Clinic IBM Discovery Accelerator where multiple projects are underway that leverage the latest in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud to help expedite discoveries in biomedical research. At the Cleveland Clinic, we also recently unveiled the first quantum computer dedicated to health care research. 
To complement our own innovations, in the first quarter, we acquired 3 companies that extend our capabilities in hybrid cloud and AI. We also continue to engage in projects that have a positive impact on society. Many clients are leveraging our technology and expertise to advance their sustainability agendas. For example, in the area of manufacturing, Siemens and IBM are announcing a new software solution that integrates software from both companies to enable sustainable product development. Sustainability is a focus area for all businesses. And just last week, we released our annual report on IBM's efforts in this area, IBM Impact. I'd encourage you to read about our progress in areas ranging from energy savings and carbon emissions reduction to skills development and increasing diversity. 
I'll conclude by saying that we are confident in the changes we have made to our business over the last 3 years, aligning our strategy, priorities and portfolio to the needs of our clients. This work, together with our continued focus on productivity, are enabling us to deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. 
I'll now hand it over to Jim who will offer more insight into our performance and expectations.",1048
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853702.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the first quarter. We delivered $14.3 billion in revenue, $1.4 billion of operating pretax income, $1.36 of operating earnings per share and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up about 4.5% at constant currency. That includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested. Currency rates impacted our reported revenue growth by 4 points. That is over $100 million more than spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. 
As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue growth this quarter was led by software and consulting. Software revenue was up nearly 6% and consulting up 8%. These are our growth vectors and now represent about 3/4 of our annual revenue. Our infrastructure revenue was flat, with continued strength in z Systems. All 3 of our geographies grew, with high single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Across our business, more than half of IBM's revenue is recurring, led by high-value software, which is growing at mid-single-digit rate. 
Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter. Operating gross margin expanded 80 basis points. We expanded gross margin in all segments with a strong portfolio mix overall. Operating pretax income, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing, was up 12%, and margin expanded 130 basis points. You'll recall back in January, I mentioned we were planning to address remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions and we anticipated a charge of about $300 million. As we executed our plan, we took a charge of $260 million in the first quarter, and we expect to complete this action in the second quarter. This workforce rebalancing charge primarily addresses indirect support function. We are no longer including workforce rebalancing charges in our measure of segment profit to provide a view of our segment results consistent with our ongoing operational profile. 
At the IBM level, including the workforce rebalancing activity, operating pretax income was down 4%, and margin was down 50 basis points. Within our margin performance, we absorbed a significant currency headwind. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pretax profit growth by about $160 million and operating PTI margin by 70 basis points year-to-year. As I've discussed in the past, this essentially impacts our product-based businesses. Mitigating that, the change in useful lives of our server and networking equipment provides a 50 basis point year-to-year benefit to operating PTI margin, which is included primarily in our infrastructure segment. 
Taking it back up a level, IBM's profit performance this quarter benefits from improvements in business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. We've been digitally transforming IBM, much in the same way we're helping our clients with their transformation, using both IBM and third-party capabilities. Think of IBM as client zero. We are driving G&A efficiencies by reimagining and transforming the way we work. This includes optimizing our infrastructure and application environments as well as redesigning our end-to-end business processes. 
Let me give you a few examples. Across IBM's IT environment, we're realizing the value of hybrid cloud. We reduced the average cost of running an application by 90% by moving from a legacy data center environment to a hybrid cloud environment running on Red Hat OpenShift. We've been simplifying our application environment. By standardizing global processes and applying AIOps, we are reducing our application portfolio by more than 35%. We've automated over 24 million transactions with RPA, avoiding hundreds of thousands of manual tasks and eliminating the risk of human error, and we're deploying AI at scale to reengineer our business processes. We're doing that in areas like HR and talent, finance and end-to-end processes like quote-to-cash and source-to-pay. For example, in HR, we now handle 94% of our company-wide HR inquiries with our AskHR digital system, speeding up the completion of many HR tasks by up to 75%. These productivity initiatives free up spending for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. 
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion in the quarter. This is up $100 million year-to-year and puts us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by our profit performance and working capital efficiencies as well as lower payments for structural action. This was mitigated by an increase in capital expenditures and higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash over $17 billion, which is up nearly $9 billion from December. We have been opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt early in the year to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was over $58 billion, up nearly $8 billion from year-end. 
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew nearly 6%, in line with software's mid-single-digit model. We had growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. This performance captures the benefits of our growing recurring revenue stream, which is about 80% of annual software revenue with continued strong renewal rates. This, together with growth in software transactions this quarter, demonstrates clients' commitment to our hybrid cloud and AI platforms. 
In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 5%, fueled by growth across all business areas. We continue to see client demand for broad capabilities across Red Hat, automation, data in AI and security. Red Hat revenue grew 11%, with growth across all major offerings. We have particular strength in our hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift, and Ansible, our IT automation solution. Both offerings also continue to take market share this quarter. Automation revenue was up 2%, driven by integration and application servers, given client demand for improved IT performance and costs. In data and AI, revenue grew 3%, reflecting growth across data management, business analytics and asset and supply chain management. Many of these offerings, like Db2, serve as the underpinnings for modern AI and mission-critical workloads. 
Security revenue was up 2%, with growth across security for hybrid cloud, which includes both identity and threat management and security for data. Bringing this all together, our hybrid platform and solutions' ARR is now at $13.5 billion. In transaction processing, revenue grew 6.5%. The software remains core to our clients' hybrid cloud strategies. The strong performance of the last couple z Systems' cycles drove significant capacity growth. In fact, installed MIPS growth during our z15 cycle was 2x that of z14. This translates to software opportunity and contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Layering in this year's price increases, we delivered good performance in Transaction Processing this quarter. 
Moving to profit for the software segment. Gross margin was up and pretax margin was flat this quarter, with the latter absorbing nearly 1 point of impact from currency. Consulting revenue was up 8%, and I'll remind you, we had a strong growth in the first quarter of last year. Our book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months was 1.07. Signings in the quarter grew 7%, with similar performance across both larger and smaller engagements. We continue to see broad demand for projects that deliver technology-driven transformation, leveraging a hybrid cloud environment. Within the quarter, demand was solid for cloud modernization offerings, and we had one of our largest Red Hat signings quarters ever. 
More recently, clients are particularly focused on driving productivity and cost reductions with greater agility and faster time to value. This is contributing to signings growth from digital transformations in areas such as talent, finance and supply chain transformation. In terms of revenue, while we had solid growth overall, we have seen some clients in the U.S. pull back on more discretionary projects, impacting backlog realization within the quarter. 
Bringing it back up to the global level, business transformation grew 6%, technology consulting grew 4% and application operations grew 13%. Revenue growth was led by data and customer experience transformation project, in addition to cloud application development and management. Our hybrid cloud expertise and depth and breadth of strategic partnerships differentiate IBM Consulting in today's market. Red Hat consulting revenue, now over $2 billion annually, continue to grow at a double-digit rate. And our strategic partnerships continued strong growth, making up over 35% of our revenue in this segment over the last 12 months. 
Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pretax margins. Our pretax margin of about 8% in the quarter was up 50 basis points year-to-year as we continue to benefit from the productivity actions we've taken. 
Turning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was flat. Hybrid infrastructure revenue was up 4% and infrastructure support revenue was down 4%. Within hybrid infrastructure, z Systems revenue was up 11%. This was a fourth quarter of z16 availability, and the solid program performance has outpaced that of prior cycles. In addition to capabilities around embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security, clients are also leveraging z16 for its energy efficiency. 
For example, consolidating Linux workloads on a single z16 system can reduce energy consumption by up to 75%. We continue to see strong growth in shipped MIPS for new Linux workloads on z16. Distributed infrastructure revenue was flat. Growth in storage was offset by declines in power as we have wrapped on the launch of the Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit. We expanded both gross and pretax margins. The 80 basis point improvement in pretax margin reflects benefits from both the z Systems' product cycle and changes in useful life, partially offset by nearly 2 points of currency impact. 
Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. When we first introduced today's IBM back in October of 2021, we provided a midterm model for revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth. We delivered on that model throughout last year and now have a good start to 2023. In the first quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, expanded gross margin, drove productivity in our underlying business and grew our free cash flow. 
Looking at full year 2023, as always, I'll start with our 2 primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. On the top line, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Inherent in our midterm model is margin expansion, driven by improving business mix, efficiency initiatives and productivity enhancement. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been a part of our operating and financial models. 
I mentioned some of the initiatives we have underway and we continue to evaluate additional actions. Altogether, the current initiatives are expected to deliver $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. These initiatives provide additional flexibility, enabling reinvestment in the business to support future growth, contributing to margin expansion and increasing financial flexibility. 
Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In software, we continue to expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth drives operating leverage, and we still expect software pretax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations and application modernization. So as I said, we are seeing some pressure on more discretionary projects in the United States. 
We now see Consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and continue to expect to expand Consulting pretax margin by at least 1 point as we capitalize on the yield of our productivity actions. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're about to wrap on the z16 introduction. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue to decline, with pretax margin in the low teens. 
To provide some perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year. That's in line with our model. And we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range. As I mentioned earlier, the dollar has strengthened over the last 90 days. We now expect currency translation to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year, which is about 0.5 point worse than 90 days ago. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the unwinding of last year's hedging gain, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pretax margin expansion.
Looking at the second quarter, we expect first to second quarter revenue seasonality to be fairly consistent with last year. That's up about $1.3 billion, though the underlying dynamics are different due primarily to z Systems' product cycle and currency. I'll remind you, we had a successful launch of our z16 in the second quarter of last year, and that creates a year-to-year headwind to growth of about 3 points.
In terms of profit, we now expect a little over 1/3 of our operating net income in the first half and just under 2/3 in the second half. This reflects a first half headwind from currency and workforce rebalancing dynamics, both of which flip to a tailwind in the second half. I mentioned the workforce rebalancing activity we have underway. Between the first and second quarter, the charge should be in the range of $300 million, maybe a little more. We still expect this action to pay back by the end of the year.
In closing, we entered the year as a more focused business with solid fundamentals. We had a good start to 2023 and are positioned to deliver revenue growth, expand margins and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A.

So I'm wondering, as you speak to customers, can you talk to demand trends you're seeing both on a vertical and a geographic basis? Just give us some more color on what you're hearing because, I mean, after CDW, I know it's a different market, but there's a lot of questions out there in terms of what people are spending money on, why they want to spend and if it's going to continue in the second half.",94
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853706.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,7,"Shannon, thank you for the question. And as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time both digesting and making our own estimates based on what our clients are saying. So you said geography verticals and then within technology segments, so let me try to unpack it a little. So on a geography level, a lot of the uncertainty that is in the media here, certainly in North America, is not there in Asia at all. If I look across Japan, India, the Middle East, which kind of covers the broad swath of Asia, with the exception of China, we don't see any of that playing out. The geopolitics around China is a slightly different piece, but I think everyone is subject to that right now.
Then if I come to Europe, it's actually been stronger than I would have predicted 6 months ago, but that is because of my point on technology as a deflationary force. When we look at the mixture of interest rates, inflation, wage inflation, demographic, meaning labor shortages, supply chain resiliency, cyber, technology is actually the only answer companies have against all that. Now that does apply to the larger enterprises who are our primary customers.
When I come to the United States, we did see some slowing down in consulting projects, as I said, but that is because consulting is somewhat discretionary. However, we are not seeing people cancel projects. What they are doing is slowing them down, meaning pushing to the right, which is why we took the numbers down for consulting, believing that, that may spread, in some sense, to other parts of the globe as well.
Software, we are seeing demand remain very steady. We're not seeing any signs of weakness in software. Admittedly, we are in B2B software. We are not in any B2C segment. And in infrastructure, I think it's less of a macro. It's much more, in our case, a product cycle issue that is playing through. 
I hope that gave you some color on why we have confidence in the demand, weakness in one particular area, which we think will likely play through. But I want to caution that weakness is not us shrinking. It just says that double-digit rates went down into the 6% to 8%, which is still healthy.",385

But Arvind, if you think about some of these consulting softness that's happening, you talked about that in North America. How do you think about the risk of that potentially spreading to some of the software side as well? So I'd love to understand, are you seeing any sense, any of that pushout happening in the software side as well? And then as you -- secondly, as you think about this mid-single-digit growth in software for the year, how do you think that stacks up between hybrid versus Transaction Processing?",122
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853709.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,10,"So Amit, let me just take the first part of your question on the linkage between consulting and software, and then I'll hand it to Jim for other parts of the question. So I think that if I look at the consulting, it's not going to spread to software in our belief. Remember, our consulting is comprised, if you just want to break it down, into sort of 3 parts. We work with a lot of other partners including on the public clouds, including with large software providers, and we tend to do these projects for our clients.
I keep cautioning, it's slowing down but still in the 6% to 8%, not in a rate lower than that. Yes, there is a linkage to software, but a lot of our software is running critical systems for our clients, and we don't see those very subject to what we see in the current macroeconomic environment. And so that's what gives us confidence on those.
Also, I think the movement towards hybrid clouds and the ability to take advantage of AI for enterprise productivity is perhaps going to be a tailwind as we enter the second half of the year because I do think that clients are going to do a lot of automation and a lot of cost cutting, which will likely benefit elements of our software portfolio. Jim?",228

So Amit, thank you very much for the question. I mean, as building on what Arvind just said, we are very pleased overall with our start to the year with regards to software here in the first quarter, nearly 6% growth at the high end of our model overall. By the way, the fundamentals of that business doing extremely well, growing gross margins 60 basis points, growing pretax income. But software is an integral part of not only our hybrid cloud platform thesis but also an integral part of that economic multiplier equation.
$25 billion of revenue, over 40% of IBM's revenue composition, over 2/3 of IBM's profit, solid ARR at $13.5 billion, growing 7%, and a flywheel effect of NRR going well north of 100%. And I think linking back to Shannon's question and part of your question, Arvind's been very clear that we believe that technology is a source of competitive advantage for every industry and every client now, and we built out a portfolio to go capitalize on that.
Now let's take a step back because you asked a question about revenue contribution and then the mix of hybrid platform and solution versus transactional. Let's talk first about the revenue contribution. Going back 90 days ago, we laid out the year. We said we were confident in our software portfolio growing on model. We started off the first quarter with putting a dot on the board and contributing to that level actually near the high end. But we said entering the year that we've got about 80% of our portfolio is high-value recurring revenue, annuitized revenue. And we thought that, that is going to contribute a little over 5 points of that midterm model growth -- mid-single-digit model growth.
And underneath that 5 points, about half of it is going to come out of Red Hat, by the way, growing 11% to 13% for the year, and about half of that out of our recurring revenue stream from IBM, capitalizing on a very strong installed MIPS capacity and renewal rates, along with some price optimization. And by the way, first quarter played out that way. Now transaction, the remaining 20%, we said we definitely acknowledge we're heading into the down cycle on ELAs. And by the way, ELAs don't go up 100% 1 year and down. Over a 3-year period, you typically get 60% in the first year and then it whittles down over the next couple of years. And we said we expect about a 0 to 1-point headwind. And in the first quarter, we actually did quite well. The transactional volume actually contributed over 1 point of software's growth. So that's kind of a buildup of the contribution between our 2 businesses.
Now around the lines of business, hybrid platform and solution, our model is anywhere from mid- to high single digit. We delivered 5% in the first quarter. And what we see for the full year is right along that model. Red Hat improving, given the performance of a renewal cycle. We've got an ARR at $13.5 billion, growing 7%. And by the way, that's a leading indicator, which is positive for us. Our Cloud Pak growth continues to be very strong, and we got new innovation that we continue to bring to market.
And then Transaction Processing, very pleased overall first quarter, 6.5% growth. We believe full year is going to be somewhere in the low to mid-single digit. And again, that is capitalizing on that 2x growth in installed MIPS and those strong renewal and price. So that kind of hopefully sums up the software portfolio for your question.",608

I think I recall your guidance was for mid-teens growth for the year. And in the first quarter, it was 11% at constant currency, but ex deferred revenue accounting was probably 7% or 8%. So how do we get confident that the back half of the year where there's little to no deferred revenue accounting contribution can be fundamentally like 17%, 18%, so an acceleration from 7% or 8% to 17% or 18%.
And then secondly, can you comment just on the impact of software pricing? Are you only seeing that in Transaction Processing? Or are you seeing in other parts of the software business? And how should we be thinking about sort of the magnitude of the impact of price increases?",136
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853713.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,14,"So great questions. So let me start, and then I'm going to give it to Jim for a lot more detail. So first of all, on Red Hat, as I think Jim answered in one of the prior questions and in some of the prepared remarks as well, we are now expecting 11% to 13% for the year. That's kind of where we expect Red Hat to be. And that's an all-in number for the year that's inclusive of Q1. So Q1 was at the bottom end of that range.
We are seeing more demand coming up as we go through the year. We know our cycles of renewals in Red Hat. If you sort of think that much like other software businesses, it's about a 3-year cycle. If you go all the way back to 2020, which was a boom year, those are coming up in 2023. And so we believe that will give us 1 point or 2 further tailwind behind the Q1 numbers. 
So as we sort of go through that, that gives us confidence based on the demand profile, the renewals as well as the uptick of the faster-growing areas like both OpenShift and likely Ansible coming down the road that we'll see numbers in that range. So with that sort of color on that, let me give it to Jim to add a lot more color on to both Red Hat and the other part on your pricing question.",244

Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Toni for the question so we can get some clarity out here because I know this has been a hot topic of all of my discussion with investors over the first quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic environment. First of all, as Arvind indicated, we're pretty pleased with the performance overall of our Red Hat portfolio. 11% growth here in the first quarter, off of, by the way, the toughest compare last year at 21% growth overall.
And by the way, just to put this to rest, the operational growth compared to the GAAP growth is very similar in the first quarter. So the combination of deferred revenue, which, by the way, is de minimis, it's like in the single million dollars, and the intercompany, to get a bridge from operational to GAAP is a rounding error in the first quarter. And by the way, we continue to expect that as we go forward.
So the number that we report, and by the way, we're, what, 4 years into this acquisition now and we continue to talk about deferred revenue. But let's put that aside. Underneath the performance of 11%. Red Hat OpenShift's strong performance here in the quarter, growing north of 40%. We talked about 90 days ago, we put the number out there. Now that we've got to a $1 billion ARR business, we're seeing very good momentum in OpenShift as the leading hybrid cloud platform overall. And our Ansible portfolio, to Arvind's point, is scaling nicely and taking share on top of that.
Now what's going to drive the growth in the second half of that 11%? We called the year now at 11% to 13%, I think being prudently cautious. We have a strong renewal available base that will start kicking in, in the second half. So I think that's really the core to the answer about the renewal base on the subscription. But just wrapping up Red Hat and the discussion I have with investors, taking a big step back, we're pleased overall. We're 4 years into this acquisition. We have quadrupled the Red Hat revenue from pre-acquisition in 3.5 years.
And around the multiplier effect, we've accelerated our software portfolio, and we've accelerated our consulting portfolio to a high -- mid- to high single-digit growth business overall. So we're very pleased overall.",394

But at the same time, profitability is even more back-end loaded now. So what is giving you the confidence that these PTI improvements that you're targeting by segment, 100 bps in consulting and 200 bps in software, is really going to come through in the second half of the year? And free cash flow guide remains unchanged despite sort of the revenue outlook having potential deterioration. Love to get some color on that.",101
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853717.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,18,"Sure, Wamsi. Look, I'll answer it in terms of what I'm seeing on the business, and I'll let Jim then put some precise numbers on it. We actually -- when we spoke to all of you in January, we were saying about 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half. Now we are saying actually a little bit more than 1/3 in the first half and the remaining in the second half. So actually, we are actually bringing it up a little bit despite taking on the restructuring charges and some of the Kyndryl associated charges that we're absorbing in those numbers.
So what gives me confidence is when we look at the underlying performance in the first quarter, not all of our actions and productivity play out right in the quarter. But we are seeing enough green shoots in all of them to be able to predict those increases, of 1 point in consulting, the 2 points in software, et cetera, as you play through the year. And that allows us to have confidence in both the PTI and the cash flow despite the revenue numbers that we are projecting going forward.
And I think actually, Q1 is a good down payment towards that, Wamsi. Despite the restructuring charge, we increased free cash flow by $100 million, and so that actually all goes together towards our numbers. Jim, anything you'd like to add to that?",239
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853718.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,19,"Yes. I would just say, I mean, you nailed it, Arvind. Wamsi, thank you very much for the question. Again, another important topic for our investors overall. The real 2 issues that are driving this distortion of seasonality of our profit and our cash, to Arvind's point, is currency and the workforce rebalancing charge. We said on the latter that it would pay back in the year, maybe a little bit more, but that is a big distortion of a $300-plus million charge in the first half and a significant return in the second half. And by the way, that will benefit all of our segments. As you know, we fully allocate all of our indirect support costs to all of our segments so they'll get margin leverage off of that.
But the only point I'd make on currency. Currency is a very different picture half to half. Revenue, neutral for the year, a headwind -- by the way, it was a bigger headwind in the first quarter. It was at the high end of 400 basis points. Second quarter, we say it's about 100 basis points headwind. That turns into a nice tailwind in the second half. And as we talked about many times in the past, currency impacts our business differently. Between our human capital-based consulting business, which, by the way, as you all understand, is a natural hedge because cost to source the same way as revenue. But our product-based businesses have a distortion in predominantly U.S. dollar cost and revenue in local currency.
So when currency flips to a translation benefit in the second half, it has substantial margin leveragability coupled with that software growing at mid-single digit and a high-value annuitized TP world that carries very high marginal dollar profitability. So all else equal, currency and workforce rebalancing aside, it's a pretty typical year. And we, on top of that, have put out the $2 billion productivity number that we're going to continue aggressively going after.",331

What impact are you seeing on your business, given how much work IBM does with financial services firms? Like are you seeing any disruption, or maybe on the flip side of that, any acceleration in demand for products and services, say, in like the risk management area?",69
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853721.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,22,"Lisa, great question. I'll begin by saying that what we have seen, which is so far mostly United States and a little bit in Europe, is going to be a second-order impact on us, not a first-order impact. Let me unpack that and say what I mean. The bulk of the uncertainty is around the smaller banks. They're being labeled regional banks, but let me acknowledge some of these regional banks are really national banks.
But that said, now as they get forced into tightening some of their lending standards, that is largely going to have an impact on SMB, small and medium business clients who are not our direct clients. Now let me acknowledge they are clients, though, of other larger companies who are our clients, but it gets muted as in the impact on us. When we're looking at our large banking clients, whether you think of the top 5 or 10 in the United States, you think of the top 20 in Europe, we are seeing pretty consistent demand right now because that is largely driven by payments, by retail accounts, by capital markets.
And as you think about all of those, as long as you have reasonable employment and reasonable GDPs, we expect that, that demand is going to continue for our first-order clients. The second order will no doubt have a muted but it's a very tiny impact, and that is kind of what is baked into our current growth assumptions.",246

Great question. So I actually believe -- I'll begin by saying, I believe that as asset prices adjust, this could be quite an opportunistic time. Now is it going to be opportunistic in a month or in 3 months or in 12 months? I can't really predict. I'll be candid to say most of you probably determine that far more than we do.
Now what are we doing to prepare and in what areas are we interested? If you notice, we carry a fair amount of cash on our balance sheet. As we have pointed out, we have a fair amount of FINFLEX at the IBM level. Even accounting for the dividend, because if you look at it over a 3-year period, that leaves circa $20 billion of total FINFLEX over 3 years. We're going to be judicious. We're going to wait for the right time. And it is going to be in the areas that we want. Those areas are going to be in our higher-value software and in areas where consulting can accelerate. We expect to remain 60%, maybe 75% of our total spend will be in software. The remaining will be in consulting.
In software, we're going to stick to our areas: hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and data, cyber, automation, the areas we have talked about. So those are the areas, that is the amount we have, and we're going to wait for the appropriate time to leverage. But Erik, to answer, M&A is a very definite part of our model, and it is part of what is baked into both our mid- and long-term models for growth.",273

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853727.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"Okay. Thank you, David. Look, I'm going to break my answer up differently between the labor-based businesses and the technology businesses. In a labor-based business, we face the same inflation that the rest of the world is seeing. Our employees are expecting higher wages. As we hire new people, they get hired in at higher wages than their similar colleagues were a year ago. We have to get a return on that back from our clients.
That said, if you take a 12- to 18-month period, all of that has to get baked in. Otherwise, that's not a healthy business. But if I take a 6- to 12-month period, there is a slight lag, which is why you get some but not all of that, and you can see that in the consulting margins late last year. We expect that we'll begin to get some of that back. But if inflation remains at 10%, then you're kind of behind that but you get pricing power over the medium term there.
If I go to our technology businesses, there is a gain. There is inflation in the goods that we purchase against those. And we invest very heavily in R&D and in technology-experienced people to help our clients. So there is, again, inflation in there. There is also inflation currency rates. But it's all in, it's packaged into what I'll use the word inflation. We expect that we will not get the full inflation. If I looked at the number this morning, the U.K. was saying 10%.
We may not get 10% but we will get 4% or 5% or 6%. So over 2 or 3 years, you can feather that inflation back in, which is, again, required. Otherwise, we will not be able to invest in the innovation that our clients want. And that's how we should think about it, that we are willing to sort of feather it in so that our clients don't get a sticker shock right away. But over time, that is, I think, the nature of inflation, if I remember my college economics class.",349

It goes without saying as Arvind continues to coach me, pricing optimization is always a direct reflection of the value that you have and the differentiation you have within your offering portfolio overall. So we talked about the consulting side. By the way, fourth consecutive quarter of nice improvement on price margins. You're seeing that play out in the gross margin up 90 basis points.
But our software-based portfolio, where we do have differentiation overall, we talked about 90 days ago, right, we had some price optimization. You're seeing some of that play. And in the first quarter, probably about 1 point. For the full year, we think of our mid-single-digit model might be a couple of points. So somewhere in that ballpark, David.",130

Do you have any new stand-alone AI products that you're launching that you could use to help reaccelerate in data and AI? I know that products go across the whole business, but some reacceleration in data and AI software products would be great. And what areas of the business do you see the most near-term opportunity, whether it's end-to-end applications or foundational models or infrastructure like the Vela cloud-native supercomputer you just announced?",101
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2023",2023-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3704.0,2782103.0,103853731.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"Kyle, great question. I'm not sure we have an hour so I'll try to my answer into 2 or 3 minutes. So we see a lot of opportunities. You used the word foundational models. So I think that, look, just for everybody else, AI has gone through sort of 4 generations very quickly, from expert systems in the '80s and '90s, to machine learning, through about 2010, deep learning for the last decade and now this era of large language models and generative AI.
We believe it has a tremendous application to the B2B side of AI inside enterprises. I kind of capture it as AI for business as opposed to AI for consumers. A lot of the excitement out there is on AI for consumers, and I think it's going to be a home run for those companies that are going down that path. But there's a lot of industries where people still worry about their data. They are careful about what's used to train the data. They cannot have an answer that occasionally inserts some fiction into the answer. You need an answer that is from reliable sources only.
Then the second part is a lot of these techniques, what people don't realize is it takes down the cost of deploying AI. What we are seeing is that a large language model can be trained and then do 100 tasks with very minor additional training. So yes, the first training is a lot more expensive, maybe 4, 5 times. But then if you can do 100 tasks for almost no additional cost, you can see that the overall is a 4 to 5x benefit in terms of time to value and productivity.
So what are some examples? We did a preview of AI for ITOps around a product called Ansible. We're calling it Project Wisdom is our internal code name, but it shows that you can get 60% to 80% of the code that our IT operations person might write gets written by the AI. Well, that's a 3 to 4x productivity for that individual. That's one example.
Another example that we used, and you can see that play through in our customer care examples, which are multitudes, whether it's order-taking at McDonald's or CVS Health or Bradesco Bank, where we can now do 10 to 15 to 20 languages as in Spanish, French, English, German, for the cost of effectively 1 language from the past. So that shows through the speed of deployment that we can do there.
The areas that we are focused on to go drive all this is customer care, IT operations, digital labor. And an example of that is what Jim talked about in our internal service centers and in cybersecurity. You'll see it come through sometimes directly, like I talked about in Wisdom, sometimes embedded with one of our software partners and sometimes as a piece of one of our products, be it our data lake products or our cybersecurity products. So in all those 3 flavors, consulting with clients, products from IBM and products with ISVs.
So let me now wrap up the call. I hope what you took away from this discussion over the last hour is we feel very good and confident about our ability to meet client needs in this environment and our ability to deliver value to shareholders. I look forward to continuing the dialogue as we move through the year.",574

Our second quarter results reflect continued solid execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We again had strength in our growth vectors, our software and consulting and solid cash generation, consistent with our financial model.
Clients and partners continue to view technology as a source of competitive advantage. Clients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize applications and optimize their business workflows. At the same time, they continue to prioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value. To seize this opportunity, we are bringing new innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships and making investments in targeted growth markets while unlocking value through our productivity initiatives. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year expectations for revenue and free cash flow, which remain our 2 primary areas of focus.  
We have made progress in our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, the 2 key drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open source innovations, plays a crucial role in making this possible, along with IBM Software and Infrastructure. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation journeys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms. Our broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our reach and ability to meet client demand.
Let me highlight a few collaborations from this past quarter that take advantage of our platform-centric approach. We're helping Air Canada improve its digital footprint, including their website, mobile application and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational and financial data.
With Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a large global digital transformation to improve customer satisfaction, optimize business workflows and enhance its financial performance reporting capabilities.
We also forged a strategic partnership with Nokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the preferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business.
This past quarter, we made strategic moves to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans to acquire Apptio, which offers a virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs to manage their technology investments. Apptio's offerings, combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities, will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments.
AI is a transformative technology that has the potential to unlock tremendous business value. According to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI designed to address these opportunities and solve business problems. The list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved automation, customer service, augmenting HR, predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management and supply chain amongst others.
AI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases, such as digital labor with Watson Orchestrate, customer service with Watson Assistant and code generation with Watson Code Assistant. At our Think conference in May, we announced watsonx, our enterprise-ready AI and data platform to help clients and partners capitalize on the AI opportunity. watsonx delivers the value of foundation models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive.
We began to roll out watsonx a little over a week ago, and we are excited by the client response. To date, the platform has been shaped by more than 150 businesses across industries from telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about tapping foundation models and machine learning in one place with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads.
For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI to deliver unprecedented innovation for clients. Citi is pursuing the potential use of large language models for connecting controls to internal processes. NatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot to improve customer experience. And SAP is integrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions.
IBM is also working with an expanding ecosystem of partners to co-create and innovate across industries and use cases from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation model for analyzing geospatial data; and Wimbledon, where watsonx was used to produce tennis commentary.
Large language models are a step change in the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use. We believe the opportunity for large language models for enterprises is immense given the existing amount of business data. This includes sensor data, chemistry data, materials data, geospatial data, code and, of course, speech. Because enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effectively trained when companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach.
Enterprise AI can also be based on multiple models including public, private and open source. Our watsonx platform takes into account this reality and is differentiated in a few important ways. For instance, instead of relying on a single model, watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs, whether they're open source technologies, IBM's models or those co-created with us. Another fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias-free models.
In addition, beyond offering companies the capability to tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we have over 20,000 Data & AI consultants and recently launched our new center of excellence for generative AI, already staffed with more than 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we are making in products and skills will help us to seize the AI opportunity.
Our path is clear. In the same way we've built a consulting practice around Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift as the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid cloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core technology platform for our AI capabilities.
watsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think conference, at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor and manage the life cycle of AI models and applications.
We also unveiled IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid and multi-cloud environments. To help clients with their sustainability agendas, we launched our AI-powered, cloud-based tool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads.
And as an example of how we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, IBM recently demonstrated using error mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100-plus qubits. This is a significant breakthrough that firmly puts us on a path towards building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance and materials.
Let me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution. It is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off. The momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity position us to achieve our full year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth.
With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim, who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations.",1246
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944513.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the second quarter. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.4 billion of operating pretax income; $2.18 of operating earnings per share; and through the first half, nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow.  
In the second quarter, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested last year. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to growth, with dollar strengthening over the last 90 days. Currency impacted our reported revenue growth by about 80 basis points, which is about 0.5 point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency.
Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting. These are growth vectors that together represent about 3/4 of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8%, with good growth across both hybrid platform and solutions led by Red Hat and Data & AI and transaction processing. IBM consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad based, with growth across all 3 lines of business and geographies.
Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics. Infrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportional impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year. Looking at the 2-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. 
Turning to our profit metrics. Operating gross margin expanded 140 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and productivity. We had good performance this quarter with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment.
Our operating pretax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year, we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our health care software assets. Without the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pretax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance.
Let me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pretax income performance. As we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we address the remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions, resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter. Workforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pretax margin expansion by another 60 basis points. And then currency remained a year-to-year headwind, not only the revenue but also to our expense and pretax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pretax profit growth by about $150 million and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year-to-year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses.
We have good momentum in our underlying operational profit performance. I mentioned a strong business mix, but we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives. We're digitally transforming IBM as client 0, simplifying workflows and deploying AI across our processes, from IT operations to HR to source to pay. The productivity benefits free up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first half. This first half performance is up over $100 million year-to-year and keeps us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes.
In terms of cash usage, through the first half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire 6 companies. Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities.
From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash. That's down over $1 billion since March and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year-end. You'll recall earlier in the year, we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities as well as capital allocation priorities.
Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing grew as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities. This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue as well as transactional revenue.
In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 7%, fueled by growth in Red Hat, Data & AI and automation. Our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients.
Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform, grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double-digit growth. and gained market share this quarter.
In automation, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across integration, application servers and business automation as clients drive enhanced business value through productivity and performance optimization.
Data & and AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, giving enterprise needs for data visualization, organization, analysis and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads.
Security revenue declined 1%. We delivered growth in security software driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter.
In transaction processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in z Systems installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of z Systems platform in a hybrid cloud environment. These dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing.  
Moving to profit for Software segment. Our pretax margin was up 0.5 point while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. We delivered operating leverage given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter.
Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI. At the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary were being delayed predominantly in the United States. The second quarter client buying behavior played out much in the same way.
Our signings were solid, up over 20%, with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We addressed continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increase productivity.
Turning to our lines of business in consulting. Growth across our service offerings was broad based. Business transformation grew 5% driven by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy. Technology consulting grew 5%, and application operations grew 8% as we again saw strength in cloud-based application services across development, modernization and management.
Contributing to growth across the business, our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double digits with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion.
Moving to consulting profit. We expanded both gross and pretax margins 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor cost and investments.
Turning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, z Systems revenue declined 30%. We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77% when z16 launched in a seasonally strong quarter. Through the first 5 quarters of availability, revenue was well ahead of prior cycles.
z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM's z16 and the Telum processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data.
Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%. Let me remind you, we're wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17%, driven by strength in storage and Power10 high-end systems.  
Moving to Infrastructure profit. We expanded gross margins 200 basis points. While pretax margin was down 40 basis points, including about 1 point of impact from currency.
Now that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our first half performance with momentum in our growth vectors of software and consulting and a solid recurring revenue base driven by our high-value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance with growth across our segments driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year-to-year profit dynamics, as expected, reflect the impact of last year's divestiture.
As we look to the full year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our 2 primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. We see constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. And we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over $1 billion year-to-year.
Let me comment on a few items within these full year expectations. We expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90 days ago and in line with our model.
We're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid- to high teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the wrap on last year's hedging gains, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pretax margin expansion.
In terms of segment dynamics, in Software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of Software's mid-single-digit model. This is all in including acquisitions. Our revenue growth drives operating leverage, with software pretax margin expected to expand 1.5 points to 2 points year-to-year.
In consulting, we've repositioned our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year. We continue to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and to expand consulting pretax margin by at least 1 point.
And then for Infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. In the second quarter, we wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter. For the year, as you expect, 2023 infrastructure revenue will decline, impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. We continue to expect pretax margin in the low teens.
Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher growth, higher value business with strong cash generation, what we have referred to as today's IBM. The analyst estimates also reflect these dynamics. And as we look at the third quarter, the average of analyst estimates look reasonable.
In closing, we are pleased with our first half performance, and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A.

Wondering if you can share some thoughts on AI monetization in the short to medium term. And any quantification, if possible, either in terms of dollars or growth rates or '23, '24 would be helpful.
And if I could, Jim, you saw very strong transaction processing growth. You noted a few different items there. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is structural versus cyclical. And if transaction processing is growing this fast, does that drive upside to software revenue for the year? Or are there other areas that are offsetting? And if you could just reiterate if Red Hat, do you still expect that to grow 11% to 13%?",139

And as you noted, I am very excited by our progress on AI and what it's going to do for our clients most importantly and then return, of course, for us as we monetize it. 
Our monetization is largely going to be through consulting and software, and I'll explain that. Infrastructure will benefit, but I would not call that a direct monetization route.
So let me start with consulting. If you noticed, I talked about and Jim talked about what we have done with hybrid cloud, aka OpenShift in consulting. Where we began with this journey in 2019, our book of business was, to be precise and to round it out, 0. In the first year, we signed about $1 billion of business. And at this point, we have, inception to date, signed $9 billion with an annual run rate of $2 billion in consulting. I would tell you and expect that we will play out AI in a similar way. I hesitate to call it anything else until we get 6 months or so down the road, in which case then, we'll have more knowledge.
Now on the software side, we are very, very excited by the initial reaction to the watsonx platform. The number of projects we have going on, the client interest, it really is something which we are very, very pleased by. So what's the model to think of it on? As I think about how OpenShift, which was a Red Hat product, came in, in 2019, it grew, literally doubled each year for the first 4 years. And at this point, the revenue is about 10x of what it was when it came in. And right now, we have quantified it at $1.1 billion on an annualized run rate basis. So that gives you a sense of the excitement we have around these projects, these technologies and what it could do for us as we begin to go forward.
Now third and most important, but I don't want to quantify it, is the fact that AI will infuse in models every single product we have, whether it's sustainability, whether it's our database products, whether it's our consulting projects, whether it's inside the mainframe with the Telum, but I'm not including those in those first 2 categories.
So with that, let me give it to Jim for the TPS question.",401
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944518.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,8,"Thanks, Arvind; and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our overall software performance here in the second quarter, accelerating to 8% at constant currency. It was pretty pervasive, both acceleration in the hybrid platform and solution and, to your question, transaction processing. But you get underneath the performance, double digit in Red Hat, double digit in Data & AI and double digit in our high-value transaction processing business overall, which, by the way, gives us the confidence exiting first half to raise our guidance on software overall to the high end of our mid-single-digit model.
Now to your question about transaction processing, we constantly talk about, on these calls, the value of TP in our business model. It's a value vector, 30% of software. It's a tremendous source of profit and cash that gives us financial flexibility to reinvest for growth overall. It also provides a tremendous incumbency position for our IBM multiplier effect.
We entered the year, Arvind and I talked about, we saw the inflection shift in TP in '23, and that was predicated on the successful mainframe programs that we've had over the last 2. By the way, the last program, we're up 2x our installed MIPS capacity. So we have a much more extended opportunity base to go get those strong renewal rates overall. But we said from a model perspective, we saw the inflection shift versus being down mid-single digit, which was tremendous strain on us. We saw low single-digit growth.
Now on top of that, just given the highly inflationary environment, we talked about we were going to get disproportional price in '23. Call that, I don't know, 2, 3, 4 points, somewhere in that ballpark.
So when you look at our first half performance, our first half, we're up 8%. By the way, our first half last year was relatively flat. It's our easier compare. So we have to acknowledge it's easier compare. We're going to enter a different -- more difficult compare in the second half. But that 8 points of growth overall, I would say, once you normalize for the easier compare, we can grow low single digit on a sustainable basis. This year, just given the differentiated price position, we said we'd grow mid-single digit, and we feel very confident exiting some first half.",388

I'd love to understand how did that 6% growth in consulting in Q2 stack up versus your internal expectation. And then given the decelerations are in June, maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that the growth rate holds up in that 6% to 8% range for the back half of the year when some of your peers have actually talked about that market decelerating a bit.",98
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944521.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Amit. I'll take this one. We're actually pleased with our consulting performance. Remember, you dialed back 90 days ago, and we saw a real change in buying behavior, particularly in the United States, around discretionary project-based activity that slowed down in the month of March, and that impacted our backlog realization in the quarter. But we actually posted relatively strong growth, 8% in the first quarter. We had mid-teens, if I remember correctly, signings growth.
When we look at second quarter, we have not seen any substantive change in client buying behavior at all. So I think that's actually a positive indicator. We didn't see it permeate across other markets around the world. Clients like us, internally, I'm focused every single day on getting productivity, cost, quick payback, ROI, and our clients are looking at that. But on top of that 6% growth here in the second quarter, I think it should be noted, we delivered very strong signings growth that was pervasive, both large deals, small deal. So we see continued momentum where client demand is there, where there's a value to clients overall and how we've differentiated ourselves. And I would argue we're gaining share.
We grew 24% in signings in the second quarter, and that was driven by areas that you would quite expect around digital transformation, application modernization, data and technology. AI, by the way, grew 50% signings in the first quarter. So to Arvind's opening [ valley ] about AI and how we're going to monetize, this is early green shoots on some of these things. So we exited the quarter with about [ 1.11 ] book to bill. By the way, that's the strongest book to bill we've had in quite some time. 
Now that positions us well for the second half. We got very good strategic partnership velocity. We got very good Red Hat book of business, growing strong double digit. But we're going to continue to monitor this client buying behavior around backlog realization. That's the critical piece. And by the way, our erosion, we have not seen any change or inflection shift in erosion. So we're positioned well for the second half, and that gave us confidence in our 6% to 8% maintaining guidance for the year.",377

I just wanted to clarify. When you talked about feeling comfortable with Q3 estimates, was that both the revenue and an EPS statement? And then my question is, on software, I think you were looking for 200 basis point margin improvement for the year, and now you're saying 150 to 200. Can you speak to that?
And also, when we look at the improved software revenue growth, is that just improvement in transaction processing because you were way above your forecast in Apptio? Or is there something beyond that? And related to that, are you modeling any substantive revenue from AI in consulting or in software this year? And why would that not impact your outlook if you were?",120
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944524.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,14,"Toni, thank you. I'll take the first 2 or 3 or 4 of your questions, and then I think Arvind can talk about the AI piece overall. But when you look at our software margin overall, first of all, we're taking our full year guidance up on revenue to the high end of our model, so that's about 1 point raise year-over-year. And by the way, that's all in, as we stated in prepared remarks, including how we're very excited about the Apptio acquisition overall.
But that raise in guidance, I think, is a reflection of the pervasive performance we've seen in the first half that we feel pretty confident in. We entered -- let's dial back. We entered the year. We said mid-single digit. We were coming off a peak ELA. We said we get 5 to 6 points of growth out of annuity, and we would have about a 1 point headwind on transactional. We had a pretty solid first quarter delivering above our model. We continued and accelerated that in the second quarter. And by the way, it's both transaction processing, hybrid platform and solution overall.
So when you look at it, we see, one, yes, Apptio, very excited. It's a high-growth company, high recurring revenue and a highly profitable company. And we expect, just given normal customary regulations of closing, we probably assume sometime early fourth quarter. So that's about 0.5 point in that raise. 
The remaining 0.5 point is going to be solid mid-single-digit growth on TP, to my answer to Amit. And then third is we actually exited our first half with very solid transactional growth, albeit we do understand we're going to wrap in fourth quarter on a very strong ELA cycle. But the first half, we're seeing very strong clothing upsell that's in the mid-20% year-over-year on those expiring ELAs through the first half. 
So I think it's all 3 pieces overall. I think I covered both the revenue piece on the margin, Toni. That is really just the dilution effect in the first quarter of Apptio. So we called about 200 basis points for the year. Now we're putting Apptio in. We're somewhere between 150 basis points and 200 basis points. But I'll remind you, we expect a very quick accretive business as we go forward just given they're profitable overall.
So I'll turn it over to Arvind on the AI.",400

Thanks, Jim. So Toni, I'll comment quickly on the color on revenue from AI, both in software and consulting. So as I said, in consulting, we are expecting a number of projects to get signed. By the way, as Jim mentioned, some of that is getting baked in. And you're seeing that in the strong signings that we have in consulting in the second quarter with the over 20% growth in signings, and a lot of that was indeed Data & AI consulting projects.
Ditto in software. I'd just note that we had double-digit growth in the Data & AI subsegment of software, and no doubt that some of that is colored by clients doing more around AI with us than they have historically. So we expect to see it. But I do want us to be sort of all in, all in with 2023, including the AI color. We see software at the high end of our model, and we see consulting in the range that Jim just laid out. So while we are very excited about it and we see a lot of traction on AI, it is included in the estimates that we just gave.",199

What is the interest level and understanding of AI by geography? And how do you think that sort of plays out and rolls through?
And then just as a follow-up to the commentary on Apptio. I wondered if you could talk a bit more about what were sort of the key drivers of that acquisition, what KPIs we should watch for. And then I'm also curious as to how the 450 billion of anonymized data that you're gaining with that, how do you think you'll leverage that within your foundational model?",115
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944528.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,18,"Thanks. Shannon, great questions. So when I look at AI by geography, at one sort of simple level, I would tell you that, over the last 6 months, the interest in AI spans across all markets, all industries. So it is a international phenomenon, not confined to the U.S.
Now we've got to dig under it. Then if I look at the maturity of clients to actually have their enterprise ready to embrace AI to be able to interact with their clients, their employees, that does vary. I have to acknowledge it. The North American market is probably the most further ahead on this. I think Western Europe comes second, likely together with some of the more advanced and developed markets in South America. Following that then is Asia and all of what would be called the Global South. Japan has a strong interest, but they tend to be cautious on adopting technology, not necessarily in experimenting. In experimenting, they'll be pretty quick. And then it will go into South Asia, where always, I think technology adoption tends to lag by a year or 2 behind the West. So that gives you some sense of that.
But that said, every government, every enterprise, every CEO, every CIO that I talk to wants to talk about AI, what it can do to their company, what should it be in their country. And all of the questions around sovereignty of models and data and privacy and not depending only on a few international players come into the conversation, and that's why we talk a lot about private models and models that can be left behind with the client because that is coming up more and more. And so that, I hope, gives you some color on how this is going to play out. 
Coming to the next part of your question on Apptio. Look, the key drivers of this acquisition are pretty straightforward. When we look at and talk to CIOs, CFOs, CEOs, they're all getting worried about their spend across the hybrid landscape. What do I spend on my first public cloud? What is it on my second? What is it on a SaaS property? What am I spending on my own data centers?
So to give people a virtual cockpit that really lets them span across this, not just in terms of the third-party spend but also the people and the process spend, is something they're all deeply, deeply interested in. And more than a few CEOs I've talked to said it really gives them a handle on what's going on and where the money is being spent. That, I think, is going to play in right away.
And you went right to the second value prop. With that spend data coming in across enterprises, the aggregate anonymized across the asset is the 450 billion. Now helping people benchmark, who does this better than you, who does this process better, who can do this with fewer total spend on a public or a private resource is interesting to people because benchmarks is a great way to guide oneself to better performance. We expect that, over time, we'll be able to monetize that into a large language or a foundation model and be able to give people even better predictors of where they can take their spend to. That's why we are so excited about it.
And I think the last part of your question was KPIs. Look, as we look to get Apptio much more international, while our footprint is, I'll call it, maybe 2/3, 1/3 outside the U.S. and in the U.S., they're almost inverse. So as we can put it into our distribution channel, that will be one big expansion as we go over the next year or so.
The second one is we believe we have a great chance to also increase the penetration in our larger clients. So those are 2 big metrics, while we continue the success in the growth rate they've had using their own channels.",672

Obviously, you announced the Apptio deal a few weeks ago. That largely probably takes transformational M&A off the table, but you obviously still have some additional dry powder to make other acquisitions. So maybe if you could talk about what your appetite is for further M&A. Are you thinking about any other end markets or solutions you'd target now? Is valuation becoming more restrictive for you? Maybe said differently, just what's your message on M&A today post Apptio?",92
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944531.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,21,"Erik, so I might sound somewhat repetitive to those of you who have heard me over the past 2 years on this topic. So if I just sort of maybe just step back and say, taking unusual actions off the table for a moment, we had talked about a total FinFlex, let's call it, circa $20 billion over a 3-year period. That includes the ability to raise additional debt if we so desired. We've been spending circa about $3 billion a year for the last couple. So that tells you what's the capability and the flexibility that we have.
You asked about valuations, and I hope my answer there tells you that we are always on the lookout, and I'll get to which categories because you asked that also. On valuations, I wouldn't call it so much that today is restrictive. What I could say is that while some of at least the reports I was reading were talking about valuations perhaps coming down in multiples over this year, it doesn't seem that that's the case. They've not gone up in any kind of tremendous way, but they have not come down.
But the market is what the market is. So if we find properties that meet our criteria, and my criteria are pretty straightforward. Does it align with our strategy? And I'll call those areas out in a moment. Does it actually give us synergy, meaning can we, the combined entity, grow faster than the individuals could before, right, just to put in very financial terms. And if it is larger, it has to be accretive. And by larger, I mean it's not a tuck-in, meaning it's not a few hundred million. It's larger than that. Then it's got to get accretive, let's say, within 2 years at the latest. So if it meets those criteria, it's certainly an attractive proposition. 
The areas we are in, we don't want to open up more strategic lanes, so to speak. Our areas are hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, cyber and those consulting properties, which in turn help these. So that's kind of the lanes we're in. And if I look at the latest one, Apptio, I'd say it kind of hits 3 out of my 4. It hits hybrid cloud because it helps you deploy those. It is a big data and AI property because that's what they use. And it is automation because it takes out human labor cost from many of those processes. So it was actually a very, very good fit. And if any of you have suggestions for similar things, we are all ears, and you can certainly write to me.",445

What have you learned from repricing that portfolio? And what other segments of your business could potentially benefit from similar actions?
And sorry to violate the one-question rule. But Jim, I just want a clarification. My recollection is that you had about $500 million of working capital tailwind factored into the free cash flow guide. I just want to make sure I got that right and that's the same.",84
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944534.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,24,"So David, let me address the first part of your question on pricing. Look, I'd like to be careful. TP certainly benefited this year, but the biggest part of the benefit has been the mainframe cycle and the capacity and value that our clients see.
Yes. Was there a price increase? Given the labor inflation of 2022 and some ongoing in '23, given the strong dollar, effectively, there was pricing increase because of those factors, and that got taken well by the market because of the value they see on that. Would I expect to see similar pricing on TP and then I'll come to other parts of both consulting and software? I doubt, David, that it will be on the same range because, definitely, I think we would all agree, '22 had a high inflation. And because our costs go together with the labor and the dollar, I don't think it will be as strong as that, but I would expect maybe moderate increases based on just the pricing in TP.
Now consulting has also got both labor and inflation built in. And when we are seeing 6%, 8%, 10% increases in labor cost, it is, I think, appropriate to be able to pass some of that on, albeit with a lag. And you heard Jim talk in his prepared remarks about that, that is some of what is coming through in consulting. If there remains underlying labor inflation, I fully expect to be able to pass that on, again, with a bit of a lag to clients in consulting because, otherwise, that's not a healthy business to go around.
I think on the rest of software, except TP, I would expect that as labor inflation is there, those elements do come in effectively on pricing, renewal rates and so on. But I'd also say it's a competitive market, and you have to remain competitively priced to where the others are. So I would say it's in those 2: TP, consulting and then in other elements of the portfolio that pricing can play a role. By the way, our renewal rates are a very strong indication that these are portfolios that provide tremendous value to our clients, but we remain competitive on price.",374

I mean our strategy overall has always been around pricing for value, right? But, David, just to put it in perspective, last year, we all dealt with a very -- and we're still dealing with a very highly inflationary environment that was somewhere anywhere, what, 3, 4, 5 points above history overall. That's kind of what we've been talking about, is a disproportional price in '23. You're not going to get that every single year, to Arvind's point, but I've always said pricing optimization is a direct correlation to the value and differentiation you offer to clients. You got to bring value to clients, or they're not going to accept the pricing. And we've been seeing good take-up with our mission-critical transaction processing. Arvind talked about the human capital-based business, the consulting, et cetera.
But just quickly to wrap on your second question, David. We said entering the year, remember, we came off of December, where we had a shortfall leaving much more on the balance sheet and collected in working capital. Working capital for the year is probably somewhere around $400 million to $500 million, like you said, and that's a tailwind coming off of last year. The remaining piece of the $1.2 billion of free cash flow growth year-over-year is the fundamental improvement in the operating discipline of our revenue and operating margin and cash from profit.",230

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944537.0,Question,Keith Bachman,,Analysts,27,"Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you if I could. You've talked about the success you've had even at these early stages of signing new AI offerings in the consulting side of the business. How are you thinking about the supply side of the business? And what I mean by that is, as you look at over time, the software development process, as you talked about that in Orlando, is going to become much more efficient. And so if your consulting business is really a seat-based model that drives revenue and if those developers are increasing productivity by, I don't know, 30%, 40% because it's in AI, presumably, clients will want that back. So how do you think about the disinflationary forces associated with [ C&AI ] on delivery side of the model, which is, I think, separate and distinct from the opportunities associated with new demand sources?
And Jim, if I just sneak one in to you, too, if you could talk about the total MIPS growth, not just the cycle growth but the total MIPS growth that you've recently experienced as we look out over the next couple of years, just trying to understand what the pricing increase, how that may -- how you may be able to use pricing on TP to leverage that MIPS rate. That's it for me.",224
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944538.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"So Keith, let me address the first part of your question. So if I look at it in the short term, let's just walk through. What does the consulting team actually do? They spend a lot of time upfront with the business side going through business processes, worrying about how to optimize business processes, cutting across silos, coming up with data architectures, which could help the business, helping the business decide how they're going to roll forward. All of that, to be candid, holds even in a world of gen AI, assuming it gets to perfection.
Now let's get to the next level. A lot of what our teams do, and it is perhaps unique to us, we tend to work on much more mission-critical systems. We tend to work much more on things, which are fundamental to the business around financials, supply chain, cyber resilience and so on. Will gen AI and large language models have an impact? Absolutely. I would tell you that if I look over a 5- to 10-year horizon, I would agree with you that for that second part of consulting, not the first, I would agree and expect to see a 30% productivity.
Now I would tell you that in that time frame, I would believe that for IBM, that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Why? Absolutely, it's disinflationary. But if we share that with the client, that means we can win more work. And the total labor pool we need to drive an amount of revenue is lower because there is obviously value in the technology that we are using, be it for test automation or code writing.
And maybe I can be a little bit boastful. I'll use that word, Keith, and talk about one example that we have. So we wrote a code assistant for Ansible, and it is part of our watsonx family. That code assistant for Ansible can help our Ansible developers, which is used as a -- I think it's the most widely adopted language for IT deployment, gets up to 60% more productive.
Now that's one piece of it. IT deployment overall, I would then say, gets probably somewhere between 10% and 30% overall productivity. So that's why I think that 30% number is a good one to keep in mind. But to go across all the environments, COBOL, Java, Python, AI models, that's going to take a few years before our clients get the full confidence around that topic.",413
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944539.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,29,"Keith, thanks for the question. On mainframe overall, pretty pleased given where we're at, GA plus 4 quarters in. So we wrapped on last year. Remember, we talked a lot last year. We came out with -- unlike the prior programs, we came out with a second quarter launch in a highly seasonal transactional quarter, and we grew 77% last year overall. And we wrapped on that this year. I think we printed down 30% here in the second quarter. But a 2-year CGR, so far, our 5 quarters in, it's most successful program and mainframe that we've had. 
Now why is it important? Yes, definitely, the value we deliver to clients, whether it's embedded AI, it's scale, cyber resilient security, cloud native development, but it's important internally to us because it's a platform that drives a multiplier effect, to your question, around transaction processing. And we've been talking about this 2x installed MIPS shift -- MIPS capacity over the last program. That was actually the z15 program over z14 because we're only 5 quarters into z16.
But if you fast forward right now into z16, 5 quarters in, we're 120% to 130% up on an installed MIPS capacity already. And you know the tail of that usually happens in the outer path of the next 3 or 4 quarters before we come out with the new one. So we feel pretty good, and that's why we had the confidence entering this year, Arvind and I, to take up the transaction processing model to actually low single-digit growth from being down mid-singles. So we see that continuing. Thanks for your question.",271

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944541.0,Question,Benjamin Reitzes,,Analysts,31,"I wanted to ask you, Arvind, in layman's terms with regard to AI, I find a lot of investors want to understand IBM's place better. And in terms of AI, where you have your consulting and then hand it off to software, are you finding that IBM is well positioned to help people pick the right models to train, to lower their cost? What is it about IBM with the consulting and software that has your unique place set for growth and some of the optimism that you sound like you have heading into next year?",96
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2023",2023-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4046.0,2854212.0,105944542.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"Ben, thank you for the question, and I deeply appreciate your asking it in that form. Look, when we look at -- let me start with our extreme advantage. When clients have data that they like to train models on and they absolutely want to preserve the intellectual property in that data, they do not want the learnings. I mean I can go through 3 forms. 
Almost everyone will say, look, we're not going to take your data and give it to anybody in direct form. Okay. Next, how about learnings in the model itself from the data? Do you use that implicitly or explicitly or not at all? Three, the very fact that you're asking a certain kind of question can in turn reveal information. I'll use the word from my college training of site channel information. I'm sure that all of you also understand what that word could imply.
So for people who are worried about all that, which we estimate to be at least 30% of the overall AI opportunity, think about a bank dealing with regulatory compliance. Think about a pharma company dealing with reports to the FDA. Think about a health care company worried about some kind of side effect on something. Think about a chemicals company worrying about their proprietary formulations, not just Watson, the literature. So as you go through all of these, there are lots and lots of examples where people want to train models. Maybe it's a refinement of a larger known model. So to your point on other models, and I'll come to that. So we found that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are the questions that people are asking us.
Then next, a number of people, [ apparently ], they have great models. They're great for big public consumption. They are great because everybody kind of has the same need for productivity. But there is also a world right now from the partners we work with, there's already over 100,000 open source models in addition to the models that we, IBM, provide.
How do you pick from those models? Which one is appropriate? And we have taken a conscious strategy that we are not going to constrain the model that our clients want. So on our consulting teams, we will work with all the models, our own open source and others' models, so we can help our clients decide on which is the best one for them.
Look, 30 years of being here has shown us that trying to help the clients navigate through the extreme complexity of this world is helpful to us, and we can become much better advisers and gain revenue in the process. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we are going to win here and get our fair share of this market.
So given that we just passed the top of the hour, let me wrap up the call. We are in a really good position as we enter the second half of the year. Solutions meet today's clients' needs, new innovation we are bringing to market, and there is momentum and productivity in our underlying operations. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.",561

Before we start, let me address the outbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism. We are also saddened over the loss of innocent lives and join the global community in the hope that peace and safety can be restored.
Let me now turn to our business performance. In the third quarter, we had solid growth across revenue, profit and free cash flow while delivering innovations and positioning our business to capture future opportunities.
On the broader trends we are seeing in the market, technology continues to serve as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Businesses and governments around the world are looking for opportunities to address demographic shifts, make the supply chains more resilient and improve sustainability. More recently, geopolitical events and the reality of higher for longer add to the growing uncertainty.
Technology helps organizations better deal with the many challenges they face. We see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants to leverage technology to offer better services, scale more quickly and fuel growth without increasing their footprint. This has been driving demand for technologies that boost productivity and competitiveness like hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Overall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the headwinds, and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP.
In this past quarter, we saw good revenue growth in Software and Consulting. In Infrastructure, more than a year into the product cycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to help clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions. We also continue to position our business for the future, launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills and focusing our portfolio.
We have been taking concrete actions to deliver productivity in our own business. All of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients' most pressing needs and has a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter results are another proof point.
Typically, at this point, I talk about hybrid cloud and the progress we have made. Hybrid cloud remains vitally important to our clients and to our business. Given the inflection in AI and more specifically, generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we are approaching this opportunity. We believe that generative AI will be multimodal with clients using a combination of IBM's models, other companies' models, their own proprietary models and open-source models. This hybrid approach to AI is similar to the hybrid approach to cloud.
Let me give you an overview of the capabilities we have been building. Our generative AI software stack starts with Red Hat OpenShift, which serves as a foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment. These services help make the data ready for AI. Watsonx is a core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We are providing models that address specific domains such as code, language and cybersecurity, among others. Our AI assistants include the watsonx Code Assistant to augment developers, watsonx Assistant to augment customer service agents and watsonx Orchestrate to augment employees.
This quarter, we introduced new AI capabilities for our clients and partners. We unveiled Granite, a multibillion parameter foundation model on watsonx.ai, which excels in both language and code. We also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for Z to help clients accelerate the modernization of mainframe code and apps. It's fueled by a 20 billion parameter model and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java. There are hundreds of billions of lines of code written in COBOL. So the opportunity is significant.
Looking forward, we plan to launch watsonx.governance before the end of the year that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance through the AI life cycle. This is a key consideration for clients as they go beyond early proof of concepts into real deployments.
To bring our AI capabilities to life, we have more than 20,000 data and AI consultants, including a center of excellence for generative AI. Our teams help clients navigate the AI landscape, from crafting a strategy, understanding how AI can be used and deploying AI responsibly. These consultants also provide valuable real-time feedback to other product teams.
As in hybrid cloud, our ecosystem across GSIs, ISVs and hyperscalers plays a critical role in bringing generative AI to our clients. The work we are doing, clear patterns are emerging in terms of the AI enterprise use cases. Based on extensive feedback and trials to date, 3 have risen to the top: code modernization, customer service and digital labor. All have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits.
We have also seen this internally, as we apply our AI capabilities to areas such as client support, HR, IT optimization and source to pay to automate a significant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people.
Our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI was in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. The interest is larger with thousands of hands-on interactions with our clients. These are across our largest clients and smaller clients, which lays the groundwork for future watsonx opportunities.
Let me close the discussion on AI by talking about a couple of client examples. Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting and software capabilities fueled by watsonx to help their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions. IBM and EY also just announced a new solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate to enhance EY's people advisory services.
We continue to bring innovations to the market in areas other than AI. This includes new innovations to our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, Red Hat OpenShift, which was recognized recently by both Gartner and Forrester as the leader in container management. We completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In Quantum, we're making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance and materials.
In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and have good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology. We continue to take portfolio actions to increase our focus on hybrid cloud and AI, and we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value. All of this reinforces my confidence in our future.
We're executing a strategy that closely resonates with our clients' needs, and this is propelling our business forward. Three quarters into the year, we are well positioned to deliver on 2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow.
Now to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim.",1157
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2023",2023-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3562.0,2926211.0,107856958.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered $14.8 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating pretax income and $2.20 of operating earnings per share. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow.
Reported revenue growth was 4.6%. This includes just over 1 point of growth from currency translation, which is significantly less than the currency rate suggested in July. In fact, currency movements over the last 90 days impacted our third quarter revenue by about $250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5%. As is typical, I'll focus the discussion on constant currency.
Arvind talked about clients' priorities in today's environment, which are driving solid growth in our software and consulting offerings. I'll remind you, software and consulting are our 2 growth vectors, and together make up about 3/4 of our revenue base. Software revenue was up 6% as clients leverage their data for insights and automate their IT in a hybrid environment. We had good growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing revenue.
Our Consulting business had another solid quarter with 5% revenue growth, strong signings performance and a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.15 over the last year. We are capitalizing on our continued momentum in the market as we help clients get value from hybrid cloud and AI and leverage our strategic partnerships.
Our Infrastructure revenue was down 3% with growth in zSystems. More and more, we are seeing clients embrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries. This growth was offset by declines in Distributed Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. IBM's revenue growth, together with the good portfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives, generated strong margin, profit and free cash flow performance.
Operating gross margin expanded 160 basis points, and operating pretax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a year-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points. Despite that headwind, our margin expansion was broad-based with improvements in every business segment.
Driving efficiency and productivity has always been part of our operating and financial models. These ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application environment to digitally transforming our business processes by applying AI at scale. We are ahead of pace to achieve our target of $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do, I am pleased with our progress.
The combination of our revenue and margin performance yielded strong profit growth. Operating pretax profit was up 17% to $2.3 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and over $5 billion year-to-date, which is up $1 billion versus last year. Free cash flow growth through the first 3 quarters was primarily driven by cash sourced from our operating profit performance. We also had working capital efficiencies driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year.
In terms of cash uses, year-to-date, we spent about $5 billion in acquisitions and returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our resulting cash balance at the end of September was $11 billion. That's up over $2 billion from year-end, but with the acquisition of Apptio in the third quarter, cash is down over $5 billion from June. Our debt balance is now $55 billion, also down from June.
Putting this all together, our business fundamentals are solid with sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business into the future.
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6% with contribution from Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual software revenue.
In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 7% with growth across Red Hat, Automation and Data & AI as we execute our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Red Hat revenue was up 8%. We continue to deliver good growth in OpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter. Clients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach with annual bookings up 14% in the quarter. This includes double-digit growth across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services.
IT and business automation are top client priorities, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. This quarter, our Automation revenue grew 13% with pervasive growth across all business areas. We had strength in AI ops and management driven by good performance in Instana, Turbonomic and now Apptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity.
Data & AI revenue was up 6%. Growth areas include data fabric and customer care as enterprise clients are both preparing for and adopting generative AI solutions, leveraging watsonx. We also grew in asset and supply chain management as we help enterprises run sustainable operations.
Security revenue declined 3%. We delivered growth in security software driven by data security and identity and access management. This was more than offset by declines in managed security services.
Looking across these businesses, our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR has grown to $14 billion, up 7% since last year. In Transaction Processing, revenue was up 5%. Throughout this year, we've been talking about how the success of the last couple of zSystems cycles is driving demand for this mission-critical software. This, together with price increases, contributed to year-to-date growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in Transaction Processing.
Moving to profit for the Software segment. We expanded gross and pretax margins. Our pretax margin was up 120 basis points, even while absorbing over 2 points of impact from currency. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter.
Our Consulting revenue was up 5% with growth across all 3 lines of business and geographies. With another quarter of strong signings, as I said, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that enable cost savings and productivity. These results are a proof point that we are well positioned to meet these needs in today's complex environment.
IBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI can be used to automate tasks, make better decisions with speed and improve customer experiences. We made a series of AI announcements over the last few months, demonstrated continued advancement of our strategic partnerships. We're providing clients with the opportunity to accelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI responsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners or a combination. Today, our strategic partnerships account for about 40% of Consulting revenue and have continued to grow double digits across revenue and signings.
In aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was up over 40%, and signings essentially doubled year-to-year. Additionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment, has continued to grow at a double-digit rate, with over $1 billion of signings in the quarter.
All of what I just mentioned, from market demand, to how we're positioned and partnering, to our investments to drive growth is reflected in our overall consulting revenue performance. You can see that play out across our 3 lines of business.
In Business Transformation, revenue grew 5%, again, led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth in cloud-based application development and modernization work was partially offset by declines in on-prem application-focused projects.
In Application Operations, revenue grew 7%, driven by both cloud application management and platform engineering services. In platform engineering, we help clients design an application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale.
Moving to Consulting profit. We expanded gross margin 150 basis points. Pretax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10%. Our year-to-year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased labor costs and about 1 point of pretax margin impact from currency.
Moving to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was down 3%. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was flat, while Infrastructure Support declined 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems grew 9% in the seasonally smaller revenue quarter. z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles after 6 quarters of availability. The program strength reflects both growing enterprise workload requirements and the economic value-add scale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation. In fact, installed MIPS capacity for Linux on Z has grown more than fourfold over the last decade. Clients continue to value the security, resiliency and hybrid cloud capabilities of the zSystems platform.
Distributed Infrastructure revenue was down 6% as compared to a strong growth in last year of 21% as we introduced innovation across storage and Power10. This quarter, we had growth in Power, offset by declines in storage.
In the Infrastructure segment, we had strong gross and pretax margin performance. Pretax margin expanded 350 basis points, reflecting benefits from portfolio mix with our zSystems performance and productivity while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency.
Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to talk about our expectations before we go to Q&A. Just about 2 years ago, we introduced today's IBM, a more focused business with a platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Since then, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and our talent base and drive productivity across our business. The result is a business that addresses today's client needs with a stronger financial profile.
Our third quarter performance reinforces this progress with 3.5% revenue growth, gross and pretax margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Now with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are holding our full year view of our 2 primary financial metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5% and free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, that's up $1.2 billion over last year.
We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of software and consulting. We still expect Software revenue growth at the high end of its mid-single-digit model and Consulting revenue in the 6% to 8% range. Infrastructure revenue, of course, reflects product cycle dynamics.
In total, with 1 quarter to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of IBM's 3% to 5% range. We are making great progress in our productivity initiatives. The work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us more nimble by simplifying and streamlining our processes and operations, but it also frees up spend for reinvestment, provides financial flexibility and delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance.
We continue to expect about 0.5 point of operating pretax margin improvement, and we see a mid-teens tax rate for the year. Our free cash flow performance has been driven primarily from our profit performance. Through the first 3 quarters, we're up $1 billion year-to-year, and we delivered nearly 50% of our full year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While as always, we are relying on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve about $10.5 billion for the year.
As I look specifically at the fourth quarter, with the recent currency movements, we now see currency to be neutral to a 1 point headwind to revenue growth. That's nearly $600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. That's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution in software and the large z16 transactional performance in infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business.
Bringing it all together, we've clearly got a higher growth, higher value business with strong cash generation, a business well positioned for the future. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started.",2065

I'm hoping you could spend a little bit of time just talking about when you talk to your customers -- and I'm sure you engage with a lot of the Fortune 500 companies. Given this macro environment, how are they shifting or prioritizing their IT budget dollars? And I fully understand everybody talking about generative AI and how beneficial it's going to be, but given the macro environment, given the constrained IT budgets, I guess, where are they taking money away from to fund these investments? I'd love to just understand the customer feedback you're getting and how is the priority changing as they go forward.",121

And it's actually wonderful to talk about this. So generative AI, just for me to very quickly reiterate the use cases we found that our clients were really climbing on to, on code, on customer service and on, I'll call it, general digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function.
So if you look at code, to a person, every one of the clients said we don't intend to get rid of any developers, but this allows us to take care of the tech debt that we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive. Amit, I'll kind of point out, most enterprises are very quick to realize, if you are more productive, that means you have a competitive advantage to your peers. And if they have a competitive advantage to their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor. That's an incredible long-term competitive advantage.
When you go to customer service, there is a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100%. But there is probably a 20% to 30%. If you can have more calls, more chats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people. So there is both. Also, I'll point out to our audience, AI does not get tired. It doesn't get angry. It doesn't get upset. So there is an NPS improvement to get along with it.
And then on the third one on digital workers, there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4%, 5%, 10%, not 20%, 30%, 40%. So in the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern might have caused a pause in some other environments. The AI side, and to be candid, the hybrid cloud side, offers them a way through that without having to decrease their ambitions for next year.
And I think we are seeing every one of them play to that. And I think that these are more fundamental. These are more core processes than some of the other areas that people were worrying about 2 or 3 years ago, when 2 or 3 years ago, people were worrying a lot about what do I do to keep all our employees happy and can I add up all the tools for that. I think there's much less of a focus on that area.",415

Jim sounded like it was driven partly by consumption-based services that were somewhat weaker. Are you still expecting Red Hat growth in that 11% to 13% range for the year? And can you unpack some of the software elements in the fourth quarter between Red Hat transaction processing and perhaps Apptio?,68
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2023",2023-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3562.0,2926211.0,107856965.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're very pleased overall with our Software segment performance growing 8%, actual 6% at constant currency, really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board, Automation led, Red Hat at 8%, as you said, and I'll come to that in a second, but Data & AI overall. Really underpinning all that is like we said, starting the year, one, a very strong, solid recurring revenue base. High value, 80% of that portfolio, by the way, growing mid-single-digit growth. You see that play out in our Transaction Processing that we call the growth vector. And then also our Hybrid Platform & Solutions business, $14 billion ARR that's growing high-single-digit overall.
Now within that, you see Red Hat. Red Hat, we talked about in the prepared remarks. First of all, Arvind and I would acknowledge, we came in a couple of points below our expectation. And I think that's an execution discussion overall. Embedded in that, where did it come from? It came from -- because I think this is very important. It came from the consumption-based services and offering side of the equation, which, by the way, is about 20% of our portfolio shorter duration overall. And it went from last quarter, high single digit, which is about what the model is, the low single digit overall.
If you look at that and compare that now, let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80%. That is our subscription-based business. That's our RHEL franchise, industry market leader, that's Red Hat OpenShift and that's Ansible. We had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which, again, subscription-based business model. We talked about all year long, where we're going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services, by the way.
If I extract out that 20% portfolio of services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall. 110-plus percent NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40%, with RHEL growing double digits.
So putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now -- when we look at fourth quarter, we're only building into our model. Again, Software at the high end of our segment model, we're only building in high single digit. We have to continue to monitor what happened to us in the third quarter, get the team focused on execution. But I would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in the third quarter, and by the way, another good pipeline in the fourth quarter, we feel very confident in the long-term posture of Red Hat growing double digits. We just got to get through and monitor what's happening to us on the services side. So thanks very much for the question.",483

So I'm wondering if you could, a, confirm if that's sort of the number that you're suggesting. And was there some transactional pull forward in mainframe from Q4 to Q3 this quarter? Or are you expecting some deceleration in Transaction Processing? Maybe you could kind of confirm the number for Q4 and then unpack it a little bit as to why it's below normal seasonality.",112
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2023",2023-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3562.0,2926211.0,107856968.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,13,"Thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it. And I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question, given it's her last call leading and piloting. And we thank her for all her efforts, but we'll have more time to celebrate in January.
But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top line revenue growth, 3% to 5%, albeit, as we said, low end, and that's just practically speaking, given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance, fourth quarter, as we just executed in third quarter, constant currency revenue growth, right?
Let me unpack that to your point. First of all, at the macro level, historically, we would generate quarter-to-quarter about $2.9 billion-ish of revenue. Last year, by the way, we did $2.6 billion, up quarter-to-quarter in revenue. That $17.3 billion number, in that ballpark, you're not too far off, is about equivalent to last year. It's about $2.6 billion. But I would tell you one thing underneath that, Toni, is we've seen a very different dramatic change in the currency FX U.S. dollar strengthening to the tune of about $300 million, if you go look at the math back into '19, 2020, 2021.
So underneath it, pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter performance as last year, which, by the way, I would highlight was the peak of our ELA cycle last year. And it was a strong first fourth quarter in a z16 environment. We're going to match that, even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward.
One last thing that I'll put, and then I'll get into the color, is on a profit basis, although you didn't ask that, historically, profit, we generate somewhere, if I remember correctly, studying over the weekend, about $1.3 billion quarter-to-quarter. You look at our operating pretax margin, which we recommitted to 0.5 point for the year, that puts you in a profit range of, I don't know, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion quarter-to-quarter. So you see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business.
So you put all that together, we still believe we have a very confident year at that 3% to 5%, by the way, led by Software, delivering 3 points of that IBM growth. Consistent, I would say, very good performance competitively in Consulting, driving about 2 points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure around the product cycle downside, we said beginning of the year, and we're consistent, it's about 1 point hurt to IBM. And then you got the divestiture impact of about 0.5 point. You put all that together, I think that's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model.",455

But maybe flipping that a little bit, whether it's through early consulting engagements or customer conversations, where are you seeing some of the choke points that might hold up people from deploying as fast as they want? And whether it's through foundation models or some of your other tools around the governance side, kind of how that's developing your R&D to develop solutions for those problems?",86
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2023",2023-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3562.0,2926211.0,107856971.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,16,"Yes. Thanks. Let me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people have are coming around, are these models accurate? How accurate are they? Do they result in things that may cause long-term liability? People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that, whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's code writers are suing some of the producers of large language models.
You alluded to governance, that comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term. Coupled with this are some people's concerns, if you add their own private data into a model, now what happens to the model? Where is it protected? Where does it stay? Do others learn from it?
So if you begin to unpack all of that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM-produced, we will give you indemnification, meaning we are confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train, what is being used to be output, and we'll stand behind the same indemnification as we provide for all enterprise software.
As you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open-source models. But we believe that, that takes care, and that is why we are so excited about code and customer service to start with, because that's where we believe that people can benefit from this indemnification.
Talking about the governance and the life cycle side, people are also worried about some of the long-term deployment because an enterprise may well deploy a model for 5 or 10 years. So the governance tools that allow you to keep a lineage of the data, use to train a model, and then for those adding private data, we give them a commitment, that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else, helps to mitigate some of the fears and uncertainty around those issues.
I do believe that this is going to play out well over the next few years. But I also want to point out, there are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks. If you're giving a quick website response, you could well use a model that may have some of these risks because the danger in using any of those other areas is small. So that is how it's playing out right now. I expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024, going into full production across the world of whether you use the word large language models or foundation models or generative AI.",439

My question is on Consulting. I was very surprised to see 32% bookings growth after 24% the prior quarter, [ 7 ] the prior quarter. It's really diverging from your perceived rival in consulting, Accenture. And I was just wondering what the reasoning you would say is behind that.
And then, Jim, with regard to those bookings, what does that do for your revenue visibility for consulting, not only for the fourth quarter but for early next year? I would think the good book-to-bill might make you feel pretty confident about that 6% to 8% and continuing?",100

As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in Consulting. Not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6% to 8%, which gives us confidence to reiterate that, but also the fundamentals of that business, right? We talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So all in all, pretty pleased overall.
When you look at the bookings overall, I mean, let's just put some statistics. So let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have about this book of business going forward into fourth quarter and into '24.
We're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation, application modernization and where there's real technology value, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback. Is there pressure on discretionary-based activity and that like? Absolutely.
But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall. But that has enabled us to grow 30-plus percent. By the way, it's the strongest bookings quarter we had in quite a period of time. And now we've got a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.16, I think the strongest in about 2.5 years overall.
Now underneath that, what's going on? One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth. Signings were about 50% year-over-year. Hyperscaler is underneath that, 2x signings. Our hybrid cloud and application modernization, Red Hat, we signed north of $1 billion alone in the quarter. Now that's $10 billion inception to date. We got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely. So I think from that aspect, you look at the top line growth, we feel pretty confident about the 6% to 8% for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth vector of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024.
Now with that said, headwinds-wise, yes. Listen to every other services consulting company, there are macroeconomic challenges, without a doubt, uncertainty. But we got to go and compete every single day here. And duration, I would say not only we had great signings growth, we're monitoring our backlog realization. Our duration by the way this year has went up by a couple of months. But that revenue will play out over time. And all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share. I'm pleased with the team.",453

You didn't change your Software, Consulting guidance ranges for the year. I think you had a minor benefit from Apptio closing earlier -- early in 3Q. But you now expect a full year constant currency revenue growth to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range. And so I'm just wondering, should we now think about Software, Consulting to grow at the lower end of those ranges that you provided earlier, especially now kind of given some of your Red Hat comments? I'm just trying to understand what has changed underlying the different segments to get to the kind of that new view on total revenue in constant currency.",118

Thanks, Erik. I appreciate the question. So similar to -- I think Toni asked something similar to this overall. When you look at IBM, 3% to 5%, just practically speaking, 1 quarter to go, we said it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range.
Now let's talk about it by segment. Software, you dial back 90 days ago. We said that we were very excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio. We said that we expected that to close in early fourth quarter. Team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid-August.
But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually -- given our first half performance, both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also on our transactional book of business, we actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it -- and by the way, we said Apptio would be about 0.5 point on the full year. Now we closed it, what, a month, 1.5 months earlier? Okay. So that 0.5 point of contribution in Apptio might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year.
We still view -- very confident, by the way, through 3 quarters, we're up 6.5%. That's above our midterm model. Yes, we have the peak wrap on ELAs last year, but very interesting, underneath our third quarter year-to-year performance, we're growing transactional revenue, very different profile than what we started out in January, which I think prudently, we said we expect that transactional revenue is going to be a headwind to us.
What's happening? The new innovation we're bringing in the market is actually creating much more volume of new ELA content that, by the way, has contributed about 1.5 points of growth above our expectation. And we're also getting great closing and NRR, up 7 points versus history. So we think like we just finished above our model in third quarter at constant currency on software. We said in the prepared remarks we expect a pretty similar fourth quarter at the high end overall. So we're maintaining Software.
If you look at Consulting, we said 6% to 8% overall. By the way, year-to-date, we're up 6%, and actually 6.4%, to be exact. And we look at fourth quarter overall. We just talked about in Ben's question, our strong bookings, our book-to-bill at 1.16. The tailwinds on hybrid cloud, around strategic partnerships, I think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance.",427

And the question really is, are there any early indications on what nonoperating items could impact free cash flow next year, working capital, cash taxes, et cetera, as well as how restructuring actions this year may flow into earnings and cash flow as well over the next several months?",60

David, thanks for the question overall. We'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow. But I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's 2 important metrics: revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We called out $10.5 billion. By the way, up $1.2 billion this year off of last year, where we grew $2.8 billion year-to-year. And we said that's above our annualized model. Our annualized model is about $750 million per year coming on off the I&E and the business fundamentals.
You look through the third quarter, we're up now $1 billion year-to-year. We're at $5.1 billion. Very high quality, by the way. Of that $1 billion, $700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall. So that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth and our operating leverage and productivity we're driving in this business.
And as I said all year long, I was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now I'll say it again. When we look at that $1.2 billion free cash flow growth year-to-year, we're going to get most of it through cash sourced from profit, read that about $800 million to $900 million. And we said that we would get working capital efficiency this year. Why? Because of our 4Q '22 opportunity gap that we missed. And we called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes. Yes, we're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds.
But you look at the underlying $1.2 billion free cash flow growth, it is a high-quality, fundamentally driven out of our revenue growth and operating leverage. Now you look to '24, we'll spend a lot more time on cash tax. A lot of that is going to be predicated on where we actually finished fourth quarter overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we've got to earn the credibility and discipline here, closing out a free cash flow quarter, by the way, that's $5.4 billion.",379

Could you maybe just take a very high-level approach in how you're seeing customers evaluating adoption and how that might impact the nature of contracts within the Consulting business and feed the watsonx platform? Maybe the adoption -- initial read on adoption rates and view into how Consulting to be the tip of the spear there.",72

Thanks, Brian, for the question. So Consulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only because some clients do have enough expertise inside to do things on their own.
As we approach clients, trying to use, I'll call it, a big public chatbot to perhaps improve some surveys is not where they look to us, and we've been very clear, that's not where we are going to go. And we do not actually serve up any of those services.
However, I'll take some -- maybe some quick examples as I go through. So with a large -- I'll use the word financial services company. They want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers. They actually use their own proprietary languages, not only the common languages that are available outside. They are then asking the question, who can I trust to augment their model, give it to me -- and I don't really want to get into all the details of how I might use it, but I want them to provide the technology.
In this case, Brian, we would work with them to augment the model using their language and their data and their code snippets. We would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100% that, that leaks nowhere else. They will take back the model. It now becomes an as-a-service deployment in their private cloud infrastructure, and we monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software.
I'll take another example that we are building out with Dun & Bradstreet, and I mentioned that briefly on the call. In that case, it is consulting-led. They want to work with consulting to use watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka, helps D&B monetize their data better. So in that case, it is absolutely consulting-led. I think without consulting, we would not have landed that deal.
Let me go to others because there are also examples where our consulting team is using both what's available with Azure OpenAI, as an example, to go win deals because they have built up the expertise. They've also built up expertise on Amazon's Braket platform. And they're going forward with winning deals on those. In that case, they are coming in with a methodology, with knowledge, with the thousands of trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms, and they're working with the clients to go do that. I think these are all examples of what's working.
I think you're trying to also ask, is it going to be Consulting or is it going to be Software? Look, we didn't say much on the call on this topic. We just characterized it as low hundreds of millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else, think of that as maybe half and half between Consulting and Software, which does tell you that a couple of points of growth for both those units came from the generative AI that we've been putting out. And I think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now, and we are certainly expecting and planning that, that will only increase as the quarters go on.
All right. So let me now wrap up the call. This third quarter performance reinforced our confidence in the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients in today's environment. We're excited at the opportunities ahead of us, and I look forward to taking through -- you through our continued progress and our view of 2024 in January. Thank you all.",622
