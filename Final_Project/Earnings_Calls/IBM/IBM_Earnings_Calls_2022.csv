This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. 
I'll remind you the separation of our managed infrastructure services business, Kyndryl, was completed on November 3. As a result, our income statement is presented on a continuing operations basis. Our results also reflect the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. Because this provides a onetime lift to our growth, we will provide the contribution to our revenue growth for the next year. 
In the spirit of providing additional information to investors, our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. 
Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",242

Our fourth quarter results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and model. With solid revenue growth, we are on track to the mid-single-digit trajectory we had laid out in our investor briefing last October. 
The trend we see is clear. Across industries, clients see technology has a major source of competitive advantage. They realize that powerful technologies embedded at the heart of their business can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value. This reality of technology being about a lot more than cost will persist and explains why clients are eager to leverage hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence to move their business forward. 
Our fourth quarter results illustrates the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. IBM Consulting again had double-digit revenue growth as our ecosystem play continues to gain momentum. Software revenue growth reflects strength in Red Hat and our automation offerings. Infrastructure had a good quarter, especially with regards to IBM Z and storage. 
Over the last 1.5 years, we have taken a series of actions to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and improve our revenue profile, optimizing our portfolio, increasing investments, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to market. As we start to yield benefits from these actions, our constant currency performance improved through 2021. 
Our most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl. You will remember we had initially expected the spin by the end of the year, and we completed it in early November. As we discuss our results, we'll focus on the new basis and structure that encompasses today's IBM. As we look to 2022, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year. Both of these are consistent with our medium-term model. 
Let me now spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the market, how we address it and the progress we are making. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Clients are eager to automate as many business class as possible, especially given the new employee demographics. This dynamic is likely to play out over the long term. They are also using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime, already in the billions of dollars, rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. This is why our strategy is focused on helping our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI. 
Hybrid cloud is about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and as-a-service properties that our clients typically have. Our approach is platform-centric, and the platform we have built is open, secure and flexible and it provides a solid base of the multiplier effect across software and services for IBM and our ecosystem partners. 
It starts with Red Hat, which offers clients unique software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software, which has been optimized for that platform, helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to transform and improve their business workflows. Our consultants deliver deep business expertise and they cocreate with our clients to advance their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. 
This strategy, along with the differentiated capabilities we bring to bear to our clients, have led to an increase in platform adoption and new business opportunities across the stack. We now have more than 3,800 hybrid cloud platform clients, which is up 1,000 clients from this time last year. 
IBM Consulting continues to help drive platform adoption, with about 700 Red Hat engagements for the year. Clients like Dun & Bradstreet, National Grid, AIB and Volkswagen have all recently chosen IBM's broad hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to transform their processes and move their business forward. 
As I look back on the year, we had good success in broadening our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and to better respond to client needs. During our investor briefing, we talked about strategic partnerships that will yield billion-dollar businesses within IBM Consulting. As we move towards that, we had more than 50% revenue growth this year in partnerships with AWS, Azure and Salesforce. This adds to the strong strategic partnerships we have with others such as SAP, Oracle and Adobe. 
We're continuing to broaden our ecosystem reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Salesforce to run MuleSoft integration software on Red Hat OpenShift. We also created a host of new consulting services with SAP to help clients accelerate their journey to S/4HANA. Together with Deloitte, we announced DAPPER, an AI-enabled, managed analytics solution. And we have expanded our partnership with EY to help organizations leverage hybrid cloud, AI and automation capabilities to transform HR operations. We have also recently announced a host of new strategic partnerships with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and TELUS, all focused on the deployment of 5G, edge and network automation capabilities. 
During 2021, we have been making changes to increase our focus and agility and build a stronger client-centric culture. This includes putting experiential selling, client engineering and cocreation at the heart of our client engagement model. We have completed thousands of IBM Garage engagements. And today, we have nearly 3,000 active engagements. We've invested in hundreds of customer success managers to help clients capture more value from our solutions. And we have upgraded our skills with fewer generalists and more technical specialists. 
This is resonating well with our clients, and it's starting to contribute to our performance. The most important metric, of course, is revenue growth, but we are also pleased to see our client renewal rates increasing and our recurring revenue base growing. We are starting to see signs of sales productivity improvements, with average productivity per technology seller increasing from the first to the second half. At the same time, innovations that matter to our clients remain a constant focus, and our teams have worked hard to deliver a series of important innovations in the past quarter. 
Starting with AI, we added new natural language processing enhancements to Watson Discovery. We're also combining and integrating products such as Turbonomic, Instana and Watson AIOps to offer a complete set of AI-powered automation software to address the significant demand. This quarter, Red Hat announced that the Ansible automation platform is now available on Microsoft Azure, bringing more flexibility to clients and how they adopt automation. 
In partnership with Samsung Electronics, IBM announced a breakthrough that reorients how transistors are built upon the surface of a chip to enable tremendous increases in energy density. In Quantum, we unveiled Eagle, 127-qubit quantum processor. This is the first quantum chip that breaks the 100-cubic barrier and represents a key milestone on our path towards building a 1,000-cubit processor in 2023. 
While organic innovations are important, we continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio. We made 5 acquisitions in the fourth quarter and a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021. 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Envizi. Many consumers are willing to pay more for products that are made by companies that are more environmentally sustainable. As the world continues to move towards a more circular economy, our clients' need is the ability to manage and measure their progress. Envizi's capabilities complement our own and help us respond to that client demand. 
Sustainability is important across a number of stakeholder groups, including clients, employees and investors. We are continuing to make good progress and are particularly proud of our diversity and inclusion scores, and our ability to attract and retain talent. Our efforts were recently recognized by JUST Capital who named IBM as one of America's most just companies. 
Let me now close by emphasizing once again our fourth quarter results strengthen the conviction that we have in our ability to deliver our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
Jim will take you through the fourth quarter and then provide more color on 2022. Jim, over to you.",1394
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847135.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, 58% operating gross margin, operating pretax income of $3.5 billion and operating EPS of $3.35 for continuing operations. 
Last January, we said we expected performance to improve over the course of 2021 as we start to benefit from the actions we've taken. We have seen progress in our constant currency revenue growth rate every quarter and now again in the fourth. This is the first view of IBM post separation. 
We had solid revenue performance, up nearly 9%. I'll remind you, this includes the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, and we said we would be transparent on the contribution to our revenue growth for the first year. This quarter, our revenue growth includes about 3.5 points from the new relationship. Excluding this, IBM's revenue was up 5%. 
We have aligned our operating model and segment structure to our platform-centric approach. In the fourth quarter, Software was up 10%, and Consulting was up 16%. These are our 2 growth vectors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure, more of a value vector, tends to follow product cycles and was up 2%. The Software and Infrastructure growth each include nearly 5 points from the new Kyndryl relationship while there is no contribution to Consulting's growth. 
Our platform-centric model has attractive economics. For every dollar of hybrid platform revenue, IBM and our ecosystem partners can generate $3 to $5 of software, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of infrastructure revenue. This drives IBM's hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 19% for the year. Post separation, revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from Infrastructure up through Consulting now represents $20 billion of revenue or 35% of our total. 
Looking at our P&L metrics. Our operating gross profit was up 3%, and the $3.5 billion of operating pretax profit was up over 100%. Operating net income and earnings per share also grew. 
Let me highlight a couple of items within our profit performance. First, the year-to-year pretax profit reflects $1.5 billion charge to SG&A last year for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our go-forward position. We're continuing to invest to drive growth. Throughout the year, we have been aggressively hiring, with about 60% of our hires in Consulting. We're scaling resources in Garages, sign engineering centers and customer success managers, all to better serve our clients. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We're ramping investment in our ecosystem, and we acquired 15 companies in 2021 to provide skills and technologies aligned to our strategy, including capabilities to help win client architecture decisions. 
Regarding tax, our fourth quarter operating tax rate was 14%. This was up significantly from last year but roughly 2 to 3 points lower than what we estimated in October due to a number of factors, including the actual product and geographic mix of our income in the quarter. 
Let me spend a minute on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. Our full year consolidated cash from operations was $12.8 billion, and free cash flow was $6.5 billion. These are all-in consolidated results and include 10 months of Kyndryl and the cash paid for the 2020 structural actions and spin charges. IBM's stand-alone or baseline free cash flow for the year was $7.9 billion, which is aligned to our go-forward business. This excludes Kyndryl charges and pre-separation activity but includes the IBM portion of the structural actions. Payments for these IBM-related structural actions and deferred cash tax paid in 2021 contributed to the year-to-year decline in the stand-alone results. 
In terms of uses of cash for the year, we invested over $3 billion in acquisitions. We continue to delever, with debt down nearly $10 billion for the year and over $21 billion since closing the Red Hat acquisition. And we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a year-end cash position of $7.6 billion, including marketable securities and debt of just under $52 billion. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and I'd say the same for our retirement-related plans. You'll remember that over the last years, we've shifted our asset base to a lower risk profile. In 2021, the combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 107%, with the U.S. at 112%. 
Now I'll turn to the details by segment, and I'll remind you we have put in place a simplified management system and segment structure aligned to our platform-centric model. And within the segments, we're now providing new revenue categories and metrics that will provide greater transparency into business trends and drivers. 
IBM Software delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. This was driven by good revenue performance in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the new Kyndryl content. Software is important to our hybrid cloud strategy and our financial model. Our hybrid cloud revenue in software is up 25% for the year to more than $8.5 billion. And subscription and support renewal rates continue to grow again this quarter, contributing to a $700 million increase in the software deferred income balance over the last year. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 9%. This performance is an indication of the strength across the software growth areas focused on hybrid cloud and AI. It's worth mentioning this includes only a point of help from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship. 
Let me highlight some of the trends by business area. Red Hat revenue, all in, was up 21%. Both infrastructure and app dev and emerging tech grew double digits as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprise's critical hybrid cloud requirements. With this performance, we're continuing to take share with our Red Hat offerings. 
Automation delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. As Arvind mentioned, there is strong market demand for automation. We had good performance in AIOps and management this quarter as we address resource management and observability. Clients are realizing rapid time to value from Instana and Turbonomic, 2 of our automation acquisitions. And integration grew with continued traction in Cloud Pak for Integration. 
Data and AI revenue grew 3%. We have particular strength in data fabric, which enables clients to connect siloed data distributed across the hybrid cloud landscape without moving it. You'll recall, we talked about the data fabric opportunity back in October. We also had strong performance in business analytics and weather. Within these solutions, clients are leveraging our AI to ensure AI models are governed to operate in a fair and transparent manner. 
Security revenue declined modestly in the quarter driven by lower performance in data security, while revenue grew 5% for the year. As we called out in our recent investor briefing, security innovation is an integral part of our strategy. In December, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, with further plans to modernize the broader portfolio throughout the year. This quarter, we also completed the acquisition of ReaQta, which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats at the end point. Putting this all together, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now over $13 billion, which is up 8% this quarter. This demonstrates the momentum in our hybrid platform and AI strategy, including Red Hat and our suite of Cloud Paks. 
Moving to transaction processing. Revenue was up 14%. This is above our model driven by a few underlying dynamics. First, all of the growth in transaction processing came from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship, which contributed more than 16 points of growth. Second, I'll remind you that we're wrapping on a very weak performance in the fourth quarter of last year, which was down 26%. And lastly, we had some large perpetual license transactions given the good expansion in the IBM Z capacity we've seen this cycle. While the new capacity is important, what's just as important is the continued strong renewal rates this quarter. These are both good proof points of our clients' commitment to our infrastructure platform and these high-value software offerings. 
Looking at software profit. We expanded pretax margin by 12 points, including nearly 10 points of improvement from last year's structural actions. 
Turning to Consulting. Revenue grew 16% with acceleration across all 3 revenue categories. Complementing this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill was 1.2. Clients are accelerating their business transformations powered by hybrid cloud and AI to drive innovation, increase agility and productivity and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on this journey. They are choosing us for our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which drives adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pulls through key technologies. 
Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 34% in the quarter. For the year, cloud revenue is up 32% to $8 billion. Offerings and application modernization, which are centered on Red Hat, contributed to this growth. The Red Hat-related signings more than doubled this year and are now over $4 billion since inception. This quarter, we added over 150 client engagements, bringing the total since inception to over 1,000. 
Our strategic partnerships also drove our performance. Revenue from these partnerships accelerated as the year progressed and was up solid double digits in the fourth quarter led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure. 
Turning to our business areas. Our Consulting's growth was led by business transformation, which was up 20%. Business transformation brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. To enable this, we leverage skills and capabilities in IBM technologies and with strategic ecosystem partners such as SAP, Salesforce and Adobe. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based growth, reflecting strong demand for these solutions. 
In technology consulting, revenue was up 19%. Technology consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies. We leverage hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift and work with providers, such as AWS and Azure, in addition to IBM Cloud. This quarter, we continue to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications and that modernize existing applications for the cloud. 
Finally, application operations revenue grew 8%. This business line focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. Revenue growth was driven by offerings, which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments. 
Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax income margin expanded about 8 points, including just over 9 points from last year's structural actions. We're in a competitive labor market, and we continue to have increased pressure on labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wages. While we still expect to capture this value in our engagements, it will take a few quarters to appear in our profit profile. 
So now turning to the new Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 2%. The Kyndryl commercial relationship contributed about 5 points of growth, which is higher than we expected in October. In this segment, we brought together hybrid infrastructure with infrastructure support, which was formerly technology support services. This allows us to better manage the life cycle of our hardware platforms and to provide end-to-end value for our clients. 
Hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support revenue were up 2% and 1%, respectively, with pretty consistent contribution from the new Kyndryl relationship. Hybrid infrastructure includes IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. IBM Z revenue performance, now inclusive of both hardware and operating system, is down 4% this quarter. This is the 10th quarter of z15 availability and the combination of security, scalability and reliability continues to resonate with clients. This program continues to outpace the strong z14 program, and we ship more MIPS in the z15 program than any program in our history. Our clients are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. And then in distributed infrastructure, revenue was up 7% driven by pervasive strength across our storage portfolio. 
Looking at infrastructure profit. The pretax margin was up over 9 points but essentially flat, normalizing for last year's structural action. 
Now I'll wrap up with a discussion of how our investments and actions position us for 2022 and the longer term. We've been laser-focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the moves we've been making are all designed to create value through focus for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders. 
We took significant steps during 2021. The most impactful portfolio action was, of course, the separation of Kyndryl. We've also been allocating capital to higher growth areas, investing in skills and innovation and expanding our ecosystem. We've aligned our business to a more platform-centric business model. And we're simplifying and redesigning our go-to-market to better meet client needs and execute on our growth agenda. 
Bottom line, we're exiting 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth, higher value business mix, with over 70% of our revenue in software and services and a significant recurring revenue base dominated by software. This will result in improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity, leading to a higher return on invested capital business. 
We also continue to have attractive shareholder returns through dividends. In October, we laid out a model for IBM's performance over the medium term defined as 2022 through 2024. The model is focused on our 2 most important measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. As we enter the new year, I'll talk about our expectations for 2022 performance along those dimensions. 
Starting with revenue. We expect to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency. That's consistent with the model. On top of that, in 2022, the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl will contribute an additional 3 points of growth spread across the first 3 quarters. 
Currency dynamics, unfortunately, will be a headwind. At current spot rates, currency is roughly a 2-point headwind to reported revenue growth for the year and 3 points in the first quarter. 
For free cash flow, we expect to generate $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. To be clear, this is an all-in free cash flow definition. The adjusted free cash flow view we provided in 2021 was useful given the significant cash impact associated with the separation and structural actions. Now in 2022, despite the fact we still have nearly $0.5 billion of impact from the charges, we're focusing on a traditional free cash flow definition. The $10 billion to $10.5 billion reflects a year-to-year improvement driven by lower payments for the structural actions, a modest tailwind from cash taxes, working capital improvements and profit growth resulting from our higher growth and higher value business mix. With this performance, we're on track to our model. 
So now let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance. Because this is a new segment structure, I'm going to spend a little more time and provide perspective on constant currency revenue growth and pretax margin in the context of our segment models. 
In Software, as we benefit from the investments in innovation and our go-to-market changes, we're seeing progress in our Software growth rate. In 2022, we expect growth at the low end of the mid-single-digit model and then another 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from our external sales to Kyndryl. We expect Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year. 
We have solid momentum in IBM Consulting revenue and expect this to continue into 2022 as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and our book-to-bill ratio support revenue at the high end of our high single-digit model for the year, with double-digit growth in the first half. We expect low double-digit pretax margin for the full year with improving performance through the year as we make progress on price realization. 
Infrastructure revenue performance will vary with product cycle. In 2022, with a new IBM Z introduction late in the first half, we expect performance above the model and a slight contribution to IBM's overall growth. On top of that, we're planning for about 2 to 3 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. This supports a high-teens pretax margin rate for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics will yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax operating margin for the full year and 2 to 3 points in the first quarter. In terms of tax, we expect a mid- to high teens tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. 
Bringing this all together, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year, both in line with our midterm model.

I know there's a lot of moving parts here. So it's more than what I think many had been modeling. And if I think about the Analyst Day framework we have talked about, it was supposed to be a $10 billion free cash flow in '20, adding $750 million, if I remember correctly, annually. So I would put this somewhere in $11.5 billion range, I think, is what I would have expected. So can you just talk about either relative to that, if you want. What is the delta to free cash flow? What are the puts and takes there? That would be really helpful.",125

Amit, thank you very much for the question. First, let's just ground everyone because I want to make sure we have absolute clarity as we're returning to reporting all-in free cash flow to, one, align to our consistency of IBM's post-separation baseline, to your point, the $10 billion in 2020 and, more importantly, to align to our forward-looking guidance, which we talked at Investor Day, with a midterm model of $35 billion cumulatively over 2022 to 2024. For 2022 specifically, as you heard me say, we expect free cash flow to be between $10 billion and $10.5 billion all-in. And that puts us right on track for the $35 billion, mainly, Amit, because it includes still the remaining structural actions charges of about $0.5 billion in 2022. And when you look at that, because of structural actions, you're not going to have linearity in that $35 billion throughout 2022 to 2023 to 2024. 
So let me talk just a little bit so we get clarity around the drivers, to your point, at the heart of your question. First, we do have about $0.5 billion remaining in the cash impacts from the structural charges, as I stated earlier. That means year-to-year, it's about $1 billion, give or take, benefit. Second, we anticipate about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency just based on our AR dynamics around volume. And also, we're entering a mainframe cycle late in the first half. Third, very minimal tailwind with regards to cash tax, which basically means the majority of this has to be delivered on our operational profit and invest less, I should say, investments in capital expenditures. And that's going to come from revenue growth at our model, mid-single digit, before we add on Kyndryl; operating leverage, which we talked about, about 4 points improvement for the year; a mainframe cycle; and us continuing to address the remaining stranded costs from the separation of Kyndryl as we move forward. 
So we feel very comfortable, one, $10 billion to $10.5 billion puts us in position to that $35 billion; and two, more importantly, that this cash provides us with ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and return significant value to our shareholders with our committed dividend.",379

But as you think about the stock market volatility over the last several weeks, is there any reason to believe that there could be some near-term cyclical impact from that volatility? And then maybe if you can also comment on whether the recent pullback in software valuations increases the likelihood that you might look at doing bigger M&A this year.",81

Look, Katy, I mean like if I react to every stock market intraday volatility, that's a full-time occupation. I think today showed that actually these cycles are hard to predict. And if I back up and look at our clients, I think they are not really reacting to these volatilities. We saw this in the middle of 2020 also, not just in 2021 and 2022. For the first time, despite a down business cycle in 2020, we saw people actually decide to keep up their IT spending. 
Now I'll acknowledge in 2020, they did put a break on capital spending within IT, but they all acknowledge that IT spending was critical to how they would come out. And that showed up in 2021 spending, okay? So I suspect -- look, we are not as much expert on this as many of you on this call, but I would suspect that this volatility we are seeing recently will not have much of an impact. Now if it becomes into an overall bear market, correction, that would be different, but I don't think we're anywhere close to that. 
I think in terms of near-term cyclical impacts, I don't really see them. Our clients tend to be people who are in much more -- what we provide technology for is much more in the critical applications. People need them for doing online payments. They need them for authorizations, reservations, retail banking, health care, telecom, within the government for critical applications. So we don't tend to see much of a short-term cyclical impact. 
Now on your last question, valuations. Look, I'm always clear, valuations -- M&A has to have an economic benefit for our company and our shareholders. Has valuations come down? Certainly, some targets may become more approachable that were not previously approachable. And I've said before, look, we have a little over $20 billion of flexibility over the next 3 years. So I'll just leave it at that. That's our total flexibility. As prices come down, certainly, more things come within range.",358

You talked about the year-over-year improvement in PTI of about 4 points. It looks like the year-over-year Kyndryl contribution of $1.8 billion in revenue should come in at extremely high marginal contribution, maybe 70%, and then you're going to have a year-over-year contribution from fewer charges. So maybe you could dimension each of those and talk about whether you believe underlying PTI will improve. And then similarly, if you could just clarify your expectation for the acquisition contribution to revenue in 2022. And you didn't mention the divestiture of Watson Health. How we should think about that? Is that in addition to -- should we be factoring it in on top of the guidance? Or does your guidance include the divestiture of Watson Health's revenues?",129
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847145.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,13,"Toni, I'll take this. Thank you very much for the question. A handful there to address overall. So if I got it correctly, first of all, yes, we talked about our guidance, coming off of a very solid fourth quarter, gives us confidence in the foundation to really build on our midterm model. And we said 2022 would be the next step. We have progress, more work to do, mid-single-digit growth pre the Kyndryl contribution, operating margins up about 4 points and then free cash flow, as I answered Amit, at $10 billion to $10.5 billion. 
So when you look at that operating profit overall, first of all, yes, we're very transparent in our 2 key measures of success. Number one, the contribution of revenue growth. And we said we're going to be up mid-single digit prior to adding the Kyndryl 3 points roughly for the year. And the second key measure, which we've got our entire business, our operating model, aligned to, is free cash flow generation. And we're very transparent in our free cash flow generation that, that is all-in, with a baseline -- IBM post-separation baseline of $7.9 billion we reported in '21 going to $10 billion to $10.5 billion, on its way to delivering $35 billion cumulatively over time. Within that, I gave you the breakout of the bridge on cash flow. No matter how you cut it, we are going to invest more in capital expenditures this year. But when you take out the working capital efficiency of $0.5 billion, a very modest cash tax tailwind, and you take out the $0.5 billion of structural charges, you get substantial operating profit growth. 
And I would tell you, although we're not going to disclose based on commercial competitive reasons around the profitability of Kyndryl overall, and I don't think you would expect us because we don't do that with any strategic partner or client, that, that is a minimal component of the required operational profit improvement for 2022 overall. So we feel pretty good about the confidence in our guidance. It positions us on that midterm model, and it gives us tremendous financial flexibility to continue to invest, to extend our hybrid cloud leadership, invest in innovation to bring on new technology and return significant value back to our shareholders overall. I think that was the first one. 
The second one, acquisition revenue contribution. Obviously, we've got work to do to close this. This won't close until later in the second quarter. And at that point in time, we will disclose information around Watson Health and what the implications are to our guidance overall, and we'll update investors as we always do.",446

As you look into 2023, some of these elements will turn into headwinds, particularly maybe up to 2 points from infrastructure. What are the things that you're looking at that should grow better than 2022 and 2023 to offset some of this to get back to that mid-single trajectory? And Jim, can you address 2022 seasonality for revenue growth and cash flow given the Kyndryl separation and really very different timing on the Z cycle?",120
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847148.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,16,"Yes. So Wamsi, thanks. Let me address the first part of the question, the mid-single-digit growth in 2022 going to 2023. Let me remind you, when we did our Investor Day in early October, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth comes from -- about 2 points of that for IBM comes from the Consulting growth, about between 1 and 2 points comes from the Red Hat growth and then we would get some from Infrastructure, aka mainframe, but there's more than mainframe. There's storage in there, and there's also power product cycles and then organic software. If you put that all together, you would get more than mid-single digit in a given year. 
But we begin to see cycles of that. For example, on mainframe, when we say it comes late in the first half, that means it's really a second half '22 contribution. That carries on then into the first half of '23, maybe until the third quarter, maybe longer, depending on the cycle. If I look at Red Hat, we fully expect that to carry on. If I look at Consulting, we expect that to carry on. So if I look at all the underlying components and then as I bake in the acquisitions into software, those will begin to contribute a bit more and a bit more each year. 
You asked about the overall acquisitions. I think that will give us about a point each year, which is what we had said before. But that is inside what I talked about, the 2 points and the 1 to 2 points and the point and the point. And so that is the thesis here. And by the way, so if you look at what I laid out, '22 and '23 look remarkably similar, not that different. 
Jim, you want to -- the seasonality question?",306
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847149.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,17,"Yes. Wamsi, thank you very much. A very important question when we think about 2022, just building on what Arvind just said right there. If you think about the revenue growth profile and how it's going to play out in 2022, as we stated earlier, we expect the mainframe cycle this year, and that will happen late in the first half. So read that minimal contribution in 2Q and then mostly in the second half. 
But second, really, the big point I want to get out is, you can quite expect, due to the separation of Kyndryl, which was a highly annuitized-based business, I think we're going to have a different business skew throughout 2022 on top of the product cycle that I just talked about earlier. I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, around profit, to be about 40-60 first half, second half. But I would tell you, underneath that 40% in the first half, it's going to be skewed more towards second quarter just given the new introduction of our mainframe cycle. And also last year, we had a very strong first quarter mainframe. We grew over 20%. So we're wrapping on a GA plus 11 quarter at the end of its cycle on the most successful mainframe program we've had, program to date. We're very late in that cycle. So I would expect more of that profit to be in second quarter and again 40 to 60 first half, second half.",244

Looking ahead now, just strategically, my one question is, are we looking at the core company as now it's really time to harvest everything? Or are there still some more transformational or pruning or spinning out going on? And I'm not referring to the Watson Health, I'm talking about more bigger things. It seems like now it's time to start harvesting things, but maybe I'm not hearing your comments correctly.",105

This is Arvind. Look, I think that we have done a lot of the heavy lifting we need. I fundamentally believe that we have the right portfolio and we have the right focus to be delivering on our midterm model. Maybe I didn't quite understand the word harvest. I wouldn't say harvest. We have the correct portfolio to be able to grow where our clients have got demand and where the market has demand. We are now approximately a 30% consulting company, a 70% technology company. It's -- about a little bit under half is software. 
If I look in software, yes, there is a portion that is very much focused on transaction processing. We believe that model is going to be a mid-single-digit decline over the very long term. And if you look at some of the dynamics that Jim Kavanaugh talked about, you kind of see that then if you go over the past couple of years. Then if I look at automation, security, data and AI, I think these play very much into where there is a lot of demand in the market. If I look at consulting, that's how clients are going to go get their projects on digital transformation completed. And then if you look at hybrid infrastructure, we are quite focused in infrastructure on the areas that align to our high-value model. And if I look at both storage and mainframe, they give us a lot of benefit to also help drive the other parts of the portfolio. 
If I got it right, Jim, to your question, no, you should not expect any major strategic divestitures like we just have talked about with Kyndryl. I think those are behind us. Now we have the portfolio that allows us to deliver on our medium-term more.",305

Jim, if we take your revenue growth comments about '22 and the margin comments, it would just seem to yield net income below your free cash flow guide. And obviously, I'm assuming the new model, given the combination of software and professional services, would yield free cash flow of about 1x on a conversion basis. So if that math is right, can you help reconcile the difference between the implied EPS guide to that $10 billion and $10.5 billion of free cash flow?",89
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847155.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,23,"Yes. Well, David, as we've talked, since Arvind has come on and taken over as Chairman and CEO, we have aligned our portfolio. We've aligned our capital investment allocation structure. We've aligned the operating model in this company. And I'm a very big believer in focus. And that focus is around 2 measures: revenue growth and free cash flow. So I am not going to talk about EPS guidance. And by the way, EPS, as you know quite well, there are many ways of getting to an EPS number. 
But I've given the breakout of the revenue growth overall. We've been very transparent mid-single digit. We said we're going to get an operating leverage improvement of about 4 points. When we broke that out by segment, we're going to get Software, we expect, up to mid-20s on our path to approaching 30 in our midterm model. We said around Consulting at the high end of our high single-digit revenue growth model. We're going to approach about 10% coming off of about 8.5 point margin business in 2021. And then Infrastructure, given we've got a product cycle, we expect above model on revenue, as Arvind answered earlier. It'll be a slight contribution to IBM, and we expect the operating margins in Infrastructure to be in the high teens. 
When you take all those components, what I just brought out, and then you do the free cash flow bridge, you get to quite healthy profit contribution to deliver that free cash flow. And I think, David, that is the focus that Arvind has got, 250,000 IBMers mobilized on revenue growth, that operating margin by segment to deliver the product mix and productivity and that free cash flow. And that's what we're going to continue to guide on as we move forward.",299

In the third quarter, I think we stated, even when we finished the third quarter, that we saw a pause on some of the CapEx purchases in Infrastructure because people were digesting what to do around the Kyndryl separation. That particular factor I do not believe is going to show up again. Now that said, as Jim said a bit earlier in an answer to one of the other questions, this is the 11th quarter of mainframe. When we look at that, we do expect softness on mainframe in the first quarter but not in the remaining quarters. I'd say that that's the only critical dynamic that could be different if we look at quarter-to-quarter, but that is expected and baked in, in what we're talking about for the year and what we're talking about in terms of infrastructure performance which, for the year, we do expect it to be better in '22 but more of that in the second half, as Jim pointed out earlier.",171

And I'd love to hear your comments of -- or at least if you can reflect on customer conversations and what those have been like and how you might characterize some of that business activity, whether you feel as though we're in the early stages, maybe the middle innings of technology transformation efforts, how would you frame that business? And how much of that business is a leading indicator for Red Hat and automation growth?",86
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2022",2022-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3829.0,2476525.0,93847161.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,29,"Thank you, Brian, for the question. So to go to the middle part of your comment, I would call it that we are in the early innings, not the middle or late innings, of the growth in Consulting. I wouldn't call it a very first inning, maybe the first inning was 2021, but early innings. So I think we have a long way to go on this. 
Now I think that leads to the first part of yours, what are the anecdotes or what are the customer conversations that lead us there. Everyone is looking on how do you deploy technologies, be it Salesforce, Adobe, cloud technologies, to go improve their processes. It's actually the conversation has changed from 3 years ago. It's not about cost savings. It's actually much more about how can you deploy these technologies to improve a process: is it how do I do omnichannel and multichannel, is it how do I do resilience in my supply chain, is it about how do I use every warehouse and store as a point of delivery not just for physical but for physical or online commerce.
As we begin to look across these topics and then as we look at the added cyber threats that come in, these do create a huge pull from clients on how do you improve the end-to-end customer experience, how do you improve the resilience of their supply chain, how do you improve the experience for employees, how do you begin to use -- I'll use the word bot because I'm a technologist, other than we use the word digital worker, that's probably a more correct word, to take care of all the upcoming -- how do you use our demographics on the skill shortage that is endemic in technology now. And that is sort of playing in. But I don't believe that the skill shortage is because of COVID. I do believe COVID may have exacerbated or created a pull-in of those demographics, but those, I think, are going to last us for the decade. 
Now I think that, that is a leading indicator of automation, Red Hat cybersecurity growth, for sure. I would call it -- it's not identical, meaning you're not going to see the same percentage from one to the other, but you absolutely will see correlation that is significant between those. And when Jim talked about the number of Red Hat engagements and then we talk about the Garage engagements from Consulting, those are then proof points of that correlation. So Brian, thank you for the question. And that is, by the way, why we see a lot of our confidence in the next few years of revenue growth. 
So first, Pat and Jim, thank you, guys, for answering your part of the questions. Let me now make a couple of comments to wrap up. And I'm going to end where I started the call. We've been taking actions that position our business to address attractive hybrid cloud and AI opportunity. Our fourth quarter results and expectations for 2022 are a first glimpse of today's IBM and to reinforce our confidence in our strategy and our model. I hope that all of you are as excited about our future as I am. And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.",556

Our first quarter results reflects the changes we have made to position our business for the future. This solid start to the year reinforces our confidence in our strategy, and we now see revenue growth for 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model. 
What we are hearing from clients is clear. Technology has become a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It is at the very center of how businesses scale and is no longer perceived primarily as a way to cut costs. This is especially true in our current environment. Harnessing the power of technologies such as hybrid cloud and AI remains essential as our clients face a number of strategic challenges and opportunities, whether it's competing for talent, supply chain issues, inflation, cybersecurity or geopolitical instability. 
We continue to see a strong demand environment for both technology and consulting as we help our clients respond to these issues. Over the last 2 years, we have been optimizing our portfolio, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to-market to capture this demand. This quarter, we again had double-digit revenue growth in consulting, and Software growth reflects solid performance across the portfolio. Our Infrastructure business, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. Our revenue performance this quarter is a strong indication that our focus, our investments and our actions are paying off. 
Before we go further, let me say a few words about the war in Ukraine. We are, first and foremost, focused on the safety and security of our employees. IBM is providing help, including relocation assistance and financial support to IBMers in the region and matching donations from our employees around the world to nonprofits. In terms of the business impact from Russia, Jim will quantify but I'll say the impact is measurable but not large. 
Let me now turn to the progress we are making when it comes to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid Cloud is all about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and on-premise properties that our clients typically have. The platform we have built is open, secure and flexible. At its core, it is based on Red Hat, which gives clients powerful software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software has been optimized for that platform and helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to make their business work better. Our global team of consultants offer deep business expertise. They do this by co-creating with clients and finding ways to harness the power of technology to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. 
Our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. This platform-centric strategy is producing solid results. We have more than 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including 200 added in the first quarter. This gives us 2 avenues of growth from the incremental number of clients, but more importantly, it allows us to expand our software, consulting and infrastructure footprint at these clients. 
Clients such as Charles Schwab, Discover Financial and the U.S. Department of Education have all recently chosen IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities to digitally transform and build new and differentiated experiences and services. 
Clients also turned to IBM's AI capabilities to move their employees to higher-value tasks and improve their customer experiences. For instance, IBM is now working with McDonald's to pilot an automated drive-thru experience with Watson Orders. In addition, TD Securities is using IBM's AI-powered virtual assistant in support of their precious metals digital stores. We were recently recognized in this area as a leader in a Gartner Magic Quadrant. These highlight our ability to drive innovation in natural language processing and bring these new capabilities to clients. 
An important element of our platform strategy is our partner ecosystem, where we continue to gain momentum. We see this in IBM Consulting, where signings with our ecosystem partners were up more than 50% to $2 billion this quarter. In the first quarter, we continue to broaden our ecosystem. We announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with SAP, serving as SAP's RISE premium partner to help clients move workloads to the cloud. 
With Adobe, we announced a significant expansion of a partnership around the use of AI-powered weather data on the Adobe Experience Platform. 
We are collaborating with Worley and ABB to build a digitally enabled solution that will help energy companies build and operate green hydrogen facilities more efficiently and at scale. 
We also signed an agreement to join the UAE's network of Industry 4.0 champion, a major public-private partnership designed to accelerate the digital transformation of the country's industrial sector. 
Within IBM, we are making significant changes to the way we work to build a client-centric culture based on technical excellence. Our new client engagement model based on experiential selling, client engineering and co-creation is strongly resonating among clients. Over the last few quarters, sales productivity is rising, renewal rates are increasing and recurring revenue is growing. 
While we are focused on meeting the needs of clients today, we continue to shape the technologies of tomorrow. Most recently, we announced the IBM z16 platform in early April. z16 is designed for cloud native development, cybersecurity resilience and includes an on-chip AI accelerator. This allows clients to reduce fraud within realtime transactions. The z16 exemplifies our ability to drive critical innovations to a platform that remains essential to the world's economy. 
At the same time, we are bullish on the immense potential that automation represents. We firmly believe that our AIOps capabilities are poised to seize the significant opportunity. In the last quarter, we announced a new AIOps solution in collaboration with Flexera that is designed to automate software license compliance. 
Quantum is another example of our commitment to advance the fundamental signs of computing. by deploying the world's first 127-qubit processor, we are the only company to have an actual operational computer that is available on our cloud. Companies and governments around the world are taking steps to prepare for Quantum. As an example, we have recently forged new partnerships with HSBC and the Government of Quebec. 
Delivering organic innovation remains an important and constant focus. At the same time, we continue to make acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and add value to our clients. In line with this thinking, we completed 3 acquisitions in the first quarter, Envizi, Neudesic and Sentaca. 
Clients partners, employees and investors are placing a premium on ESG. As the world moves towards a more circular and sustainable economy, clients need help on their journey. That is why we recently launched the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a social impact program that applies IBM technology and consulting to help populations that are vulnerable to environmental threats. This is just one of the many efforts we have made around ESG, which you can see in IBM Impact, our first integrated ESG report that we released last week. 
I will wrap up by saying the results you are seeing this quarter are a direct reflection of our ability to execute against our strategy. Each quarter, we continue to strengthen our portfolio, expand our partner ecosystem and drive productivity and simplification through the business. IBM is now a very different company. We have, in effect, changed our company's trajectory. And while much remains to be done, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our hard-earned efforts, and we are confident in our trajectory for the year. 
Now let me hand it over to Jim who will share the details of the quarter and our expectations with you.",1265
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078865.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $14.2 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion of operating pretax income, operating earnings per share of $1.40 and $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 
90 days ago, I talked about the first quarter and the full year in the context of our medium-term model, which is to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and about $35 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024. These first quarter results are a solid step toward delivering on the year and that model. Our revenue was up 11%. This includes over 5 points of incremental revenue from the commercial relationship established with Kyndryl last November. 
Our business, entering 2022, reflects a higher growth, higher value mix. It is also a business with more recurring revenue dominated by Software. This quarter, Software revenue was up 15%, and Consulting was up 17%. As we've discussed in the past, these are our 2 growth vectors, and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. 
Infrastructure performance, which is influenced by product cycles, was flat as compared to last year. The Software and Infrastructure performance each include over 8 points from the commercial Kyndryl relationship. As a reminder, there is no incremental contribution to IBM Consulting's growth. 
Our strategy, as Arvind said, is based on a platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Not only do we benefit from the platform itself, but IBM and our partners also generate a multiple of Software and Consulting revenue on that platform. It's an attractive economic model. You can see our success in capturing that value in our hybrid cloud revenue, which was up 17% in the first quarter and over the last 12 months. Revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from infrastructure up through consulting represents $20.8 billion of revenue over the last 12 months or 36% of our total. 
Looking at our P&L metrics. We grew operating gross profit dollars, though margin was down, with improvement in software margin offset by consulting investments and infrastructure mix due to product cycles. 
For operating pretax income, we grew profit dollars and expanded margins by 280 basis points. This profit performance reflects that we're capturing demand in high-value areas like software and profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship. We have taken actions to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model, consistent with our more focused, platform-centric business. With the more streamlined business, we're getting operating leverage from strong revenue performance. 
Our profit dynamics also reflect increasing investments in innovation, our ecosystem and talent. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We're investing in our ecosystem organically and inorganically. For example, one of the 3 acquisitions Arvind mentioned was Neudesic, which adds key hyperscale capabilities to address hybrid multi-cloud demand. 
And as we've discussed, over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively hiring. We're adding capabilities and skills to support our garages and client engineering centers, client success managers to help clients get the most of their IBM solutions and technical talent across our business. Now we're operating in an inflationary environment, and cost, especially the cost to attract and retain talent are escalating. We're addressing this through pricing, which will help over time. 
The other item I'll mention is the impact of a strengthening dollar. We execute hedging programs, with the majority of our hedging gains reported in other income and expense. These gains mitigate the currency impact in revenue and gross profit. 
And then looking at net income, we expanded operating net income margin by 130 basis points. This reflects an operating tax rate of 16% which was up significantly from last year. 
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $1.2 billion in the quarter. I'll remind you, we've gone back to our traditional all-in free cash flow definition, which includes payments for the structural actions initiated at the end of 2020. The $1.2 billion is about 12% of our full year expected range, consistent with history. The anomaly from that historic attainment was last year, with 23% of our full year free cash flow realized in the first quarter due to the unique dynamics of the Kyndryl separation. 
In terms of uses of cash for the quarter, we invested about $700 million in acquisitions, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also issued $4 billion of debt in early February, which supports maturities later in the year. This results in a March cash position of $10.8 billion and debt of over $54 billion. 
Turning to the segments. Software delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. This includes over 8 points from the recurring Kyndryl software revenue, in line with our expectations. Software performance was driven by good growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the Kyndryl content. 
Our software is central to a hybrid cloud value proposition. Within the segment, hybrid cloud revenue is up 25%, now representing $8.8 billion over the last year. And subscription and support renewal rates grew again this quarter, contributing to a software deferred income balance of over $11 billion. 
Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue grew 10% this quarter, inclusive of about 1.5 points contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. We've driven focus within this portfolio around the most strategic hybrid cloud and AI needs of our clients, Red Hat, data and AI, automation and security. Growth was pervasive across all business areas this quarter. 
Red Hat revenue all in was up 21%. Revenue growth continues to be fueled by good performance across the Red Hat portfolio. And we again gained share across both RHEL and OpenShift, the foundational hybrid cloud offerings. 
Red Hat's hybrid cloud offerings continue to transform enterprise IT and deliver new innovations. For example, this quarter, we announced a new partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate AI applications. Automation delivered 5% revenue growth this quarter. Growth was led by AIOps and management and integration. We've invested in AI-powered approach to automation, and our solutions are resonating with clients as they address growing complexity, digital shifts and skill shortages across their businesses. We extended this AI-powered automation strategy this quarter, with the joint Flexera solution Arvind mentioned earlier. 
Data & AI revenue grew 4%. These offerings help our clients accelerate data-driven agendas by connecting and governing all of their data and infusing AI to enhance decision-making. Performance this quarter reflects client demand across the portfolio, including continued adoption of data fabric, expansion of our Data Management footprint, a focus on sustainable operations with Asset & Supply Chain Management and needs for reliable data sharing with Information Exchange. We had growth in solutions like Cloud Pak for Data, Db2 and Maximo Application Suite, just to name a few. 
Security revenue grew 8%, building on strong performance in the first quarter of last year when we were up 14%. With the evolving cybersecurity environment, we delivered growth this quarter in Threat Management and Data Security. We continue to see good client demand for Cloud Pak for Security, an integrated and open security platform that advances client's zero trust strategy while leaving data where it is. And we've been investing in securing innovation, including a new SaaS endpoint solution following the ReaQta acquisition. Looking across the performance of our hybrid platform and solutions, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is up 9% year-to-year. 
Transaction Processing delivered 31% revenue growth this quarter, including 28 points from the Kyndryl content. The overall dynamics are much like last quarter. We wrapped on weak performance in the first quarter of last year, which was down 15%. And we continue to see strong renewals of these critical software offerings, building on the expanded zSystems capacity and traction we've gotten through the strong z15 program. 
Looking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage given the strong and broad-based revenue performance this quarter. Our pretax margin was up 7 points and puts us on track for our full year software margin in the mid-20s. 
Just as in Software, Consulting is capitalizing on strong demand profile, growing both revenue and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Revenue growth accelerated to 17% while bookings were up over 40%. Our book-to-bill remains solid at 1.1 for the quarter and over the last year. 
Clients trust IBM to execute their complex business transformation, leveraging our deep industry expertise and the investments we've been making in skills, capabilities, our ecosystem and in scaling our acquisitions. We are positioned to capture demand and drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. 
Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% on a trailing 12-month basis to $8.3 billion, which makes up 45% of the Consulting business. We continue to see strong demand and momentum in our Red Hat-related engagements this quarter, nearly doubling Red Hat-related signings year-to-year. 
Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships grew solid double digits led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure. 
And now turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 19%, bringing together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. The growth was broad based with particularly strong growth in our practices centered around customer experience, talent, and data transformation as well as supply chain and finance applications. 
In Technology Consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platform and strategies, revenue was up 19%. Growth was pervasive, led by our engagements around developing and modernizing applications for cloud deployments. 
Finally, Application Operations revenue grew 14%. This business line focuses  on the management of applications and cloud platform services required to run hybrid cloud environments. Growth was broad based in this space as well, led by cloud application management. 
Moving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded about 1 point, delivering operating leverage and benefiting from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting gross margin reflects the significant investments we have made over the last year, fueling our revenue growth. We are investing in our partner ecosystem, expanding our reach. We continue to scale the 12 acquisitions we made in the last 18 months, including 2 which closed in the first quarter. And we're investing in talent across our workforce, up-skilling existing resources, adding certifications and bringing in technical skills in areas of hybrid cloud and AI. 
Consulting is where we are most impacted by the competitive and inflationary labor market, which puts pressure on profitability. We expect to capture value through price and our engagements and recognize it will take a few quarters to appear in our margin profile. 
Turning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue performance was flat versus last year. Hybrid infrastructure revenue declined 2%, offset by growth of 4% in infrastructure support. The Kyndryl content contributed over 8 points to Infrastructure with consistent benefit across the 2 business areas. 
Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems revenue was down 18%, and, we're now in the 11th quarter of z15 availability. z15 has been a very strong program, both in revenue performance and capacity. In fact, we shipped more z15 MIPS than in any other program. 
Building on that momentum, we've just announced our newest solution, IBM z16. Arvind commented on the 3 differentiated capabilities of z16: embedded AI at scale; cyber resilience security; and cloud native development for hybrid cloud. 
Distributed Infrastructure delivered 8% revenue growth this quarter. Client demand for S/4HANA data-intensive workloads on our newest Power10 high-end systems fueled this performance. 
Looking at infrastructure profit. The pretax margin was down 3 points, reflecting where we are in our IBM zSystems product cycle. 
Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We focused our business on a platform-centric, hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Over the last couple of years, we've been taking steps to optimize our portfolio, streamline our operations and allocate capital to execute that strategy and improve our financial profile. Our first quarter results reflect these very significant changes and put us on track to our full year expectations for our 2 key measures of revenue growth and free cash flow. 
90 days ago, we expected to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency before the incremental Kyndryl sales. With a strong start to the year, we now see revenue growth at the high end of that mid-single-digit range. On top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth for the year from the commercial relationship of Kyndryl spread over the first 3 quarters. And then looking at currency, with the strengthening U.S. dollar at mid-April spot rates, currency will now be a 3- to 4-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. 
For free cash flow, we continue to expect $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. As I said earlier, this is an all-in free cash flow definition and includes the cash impact associated with our 2020 structural actions. 
Before getting into the segments and color on the second quarter, I'll comment on the business impact of our Russian operations. Our business in Russia is not large, but it's concentrated in high-end infrastructure and software. Last year, business in the country contributed about $300 million of revenue and about $200 million of profit and cash. For this year, we expect no contribution from Russia, which puts us closer to the low end of our free cash flow range. 
Now let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance for the year. In Software, we got off to a good start, and we haven't changed our view of constant currency revenue growth or the contribution from the external sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year. In IBM Consulting, with our first quarter revenue and signings performance, we are taking up our view of Consulting revenue to a low double-digit growth rate for the year. With continued investment in talent and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a pretax margin approaching 10%, which is up a couple of points year-to-year. This reflects improving performance in the second half as we realize price increases in our contracts. 
Our Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. This year, we'd expect performance above the model given the launch of our z16 late in the second quarter. This will contribute to second quarter performance and ramp further in the second half. 
On top of that, we're planning for about 4 to 5 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. We see a mid- to high-teens pretax margin for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics would yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. In terms of tax, we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. 
Let me comment on a couple of items specific to the second quarter. At current spot rates, currency would be a 5-point headwind to revenue growth. We expect to close the sale of the health care software assets with a gain utilized to address stranded costs. And we expect a 4- to 5-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin and a tax rate in the high teens. Based on our solid first quarter performance and view of the year, we are on track to our mid-term model. And now Patricia, let's go to the Q&A.",2578

Great to see the solid revenue performance and the organic growth guide uptick here. Arvind, a lot of investor conversations now are focused around concerns of the economy steering itself into a recession, given the tightening that we're seeing from the Fed. Can you maybe characterize how IBM, which is a pretty defensive portfolio, could fare in a recessionary environment, given that there have been structural portfolio changes? 
And a quick one for Jim. You're maintaining your free cash flow guide despite the incremental headwinds from FX and some of the other macro elements you pointed to, including Russia, Ukraine. Can you maybe just help us think through how you're offsetting free cash flow impact from FX?",118
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078869.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,7,"So just a comment on the economy and I'll call it demand. We are seeing very strong demand. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think technology has shifted from being just one aspect of a business to being the source of competitive advantage. When that happens, Wamsi, we think and we believe, and the past couple of quarters have borne this out, that demand for technology is going to sit at 4 to 5 points above GDP. So even if GDP falls to flat or if there's a quick recession or if it's a very slight recession, we see demand staying strong and continuing. Now I'll acknowledge, if you have something much more catastrophic, that's different. But for all the scenarios that we do outline and we do look at, we see that demand is going to continue in a growth phase for the foreseeable future. 
Jim?",150

Wamsi, thanks for the question. Just to add to Arvind's point, we're upfront about the composition of our portfolio. Now today's new IBM, that composition being much more skewed towards road sectors, software consulting and our solid recurring revenue base that offers us on any economic shocks, and I think that's what you were referencing, Wamsi, and if you look at past economic shocks overall. 
But to your question about free cash flow, let me spend a minute on free cash flow and just to give you a perspective and unpack it a little. We are maintaining our guidance at $10 billion to $10.5 billion for 2022. Again, I'll remind everyone that's an all-in free cash flow, consistent with IBM's post-separation baseline and consistent with our mid-term model of a cumulative about $35 million over the next 3 years. That basically is growing north of $2 billion of free cash flow in 2022. We started out the first quarter. We delivered $1.24 billion in free cash flow. That's about 12% attained. And by the way, that's pretty consistent with where we've been. Arguably, prior to the last 3, 4 years, we were in the high single digits. So we're off to a pretty good start. 
Now I spent time last quarter talking of headwinds and tailwinds. On the tailwind side, we talked about -- hang on. We're doing some technical difficulties here. Thank you very much. Hopefully, that is better and you can hear me. 
I'm going through headwinds and tailwinds on free cash flow overall. When you look at free cash flow, we talked 90 days ago. We've got tailwinds on remaining about $0.5 billion of structural actions in 2022. We've got about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency given our mainframe cycle and volume dynamics. And we've got a couple hundred million with regards to modest cash tax tailwinds overall. The rest of that $2-plus billion of free cash flow generation has to come from operating profit. 
Now when you look at the first quarter, many of those tailwinds are all in front of us. Our operating profit, that's the acceleration in revenue and operating margin by segment. That will continue as we move forward as part of our guidance. Our working capital actually was a use of cash in the first quarter as we prudently built up our inventory position. Just given the supply chain disruption going on in the marketplace, we secured our supply for the anticipated z16. And we also got most of our structural actions behind us. 
So we've got a lot of tailwind forward that gives us confidence in that $10 billion to $10.5 billion. And the only headwind which we called out in the prepared remarks is the unfortunate situation with regards to the war in Ukraine, and we quantified that overall.",471

I guess my question is around you're raising your top line guidance from mid-single digit -- at the higher end of the mid-single-digit range. Could you just talk about what is driving this rate? Is it organic or is it only the deals that you have done that give you a better conviction on the growth trajectory? Is the uplift in guide organic. I want to be able understand that. 
Maybe related to that, there's a lot that's going around what's happening in Europe very specifically and any spillover potentially from Russia. I want to hear what you're seeing in Europe, if anything at all, and Russia as well.",116
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078873.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,11,"Amit, let me begin by answering the question on both pieces. So if we look at it, we have always said our model for acquisition contribution is typically between 1 point to 1.5 points for the year. And so that remains steady in that range. 
We don't really look at that as coming up yet. I'll take it certainly if it gets above that, but that is not the case. So what we are seeing right now is strong demand on what you would call the organic part of the portfolio. And we can see that in the software portfolio, we can see that in the strong Red Hat growth. Consulting is largely, by the way, organic growth that is driving it because we printed 13% at actual, 17% at constant currency, and only a few points of that was acquired growth. So I would say much more organic than acquired. Acquired is in the range that we have called out before. So when you talk about here, Jim quantified, certainly, Russia is direct. And we quantified its impact in direct terms, that $300 million we don't really expect to see this year at all. 
Now when we look at overall growth in Europe, we are still seeing, and it is likely because we are a much more, I'll call it, mission critical applications. We are much more in fundamental transformations at our clients. And with the focus on financial volumes, on critical systems, on telecoms, utilities, health care, government, we tend to see that right now, the demand profile in Europe is staying strong. And so we are not seeing, at least at this point, that demand profile coming down. 
As things go on, that could evolve. As I've said before, it's our jobs to be concerned about all of these things, and we've been watching them very carefully. But with our book-to-bill ratios in consulting, which is kind of a leading edge, we see right now that the demand profile is continuing and has not slowed down at this point.",342

So you beat relative to expectations on revenue but not on EPS. You've raised your full year guidance for revenue but not on free cash flow. So I just want to explore the dynamics there. Are you seeing incremental pressure just in Consulting? And are there other areas? 
And then I was hoping you can answer 2 very specific clarifications. One is your operating margin expansion was 280 basis points year-over-year. But obviously, you had very high-margin Kyndryl contribution. So if we ex out the Kyndryl contribution, what was the change in operating profit of PTI percentage year-over-year? And then secondly, how much is the health care asset sale gain? And it sounds like that will be included in free cash flow. Could you confirm that as well?",142

So health care, yes, as we talked about 90 days ago, we still expect to close on the Watson Health divestiture late in the second quarter. It is embedded in our forward-looking guidance. As you know, it is now consistent with what we've been doing with all divestitures. It is now in our other segment. By the way, history has been restated, so our Software segment and our other segment are apples-to-apples year-to-year with regards to this. 
We do expect the lost profit in the second half and the lost revenue, but we do expect a modest gain in the second quarter, and we will utilize that gain to address stranded costs. So it's embedded in our guidance. No impact to the second quarter. But obviously, we're dealing with the lost revenue top line in the second half. And in light of that, we still took up our guidance to the high mid-single digit overall. It is -- in our free cash flow, there's no impact to that overall either. 
So on operating margins, you asked about 280 basis points. Yes, we are very pleased with our performance. Solid start to the year; progress, more to do, as Arvind and I have always said, this is a journey. We've given a mid-term model. You all understand our mid-term model. 
But let me put the profit margin contribution in perspective because, yes, as we've been transparent both in revenue -- and by the way, in free cash flow because our free cash flow is a post-IBM separation baseline, we've got to grow $2-plus billion of free cash flow. Both of those normalize out Kyndryl. But let's talk about the Kyndryl contribution because you're right to pretax income and pretax margin, there's a benefit from the Kyndryl sales. 
And there's also -- hopefully, we could take care of the technical difficulty. Echo sounds like it went away. 
But when you take a look at the top line revenue growth, we grew IBM overall 11% at constant currency, all in. We said within that constant currency, about a little over 5 points is due to the Kyndryl external sales. So call that about 50% of our contribution, growth came from Kyndryl, and about 50% of our contribution came from our broader client segments overall. IBM grew revenue in the first quarter by $1 billion externally from last year, so about $500 million of Kyndryl contribution, give or take, round numbers and about $500 million from our broader set of clients. 
You apply standard margins because, as you can all appreciate, for competitive commercial reasons, we're not going to give exact profitability of any client overall. But if you apply standard margins against that, you get against our $500 million of profit contribution, you get about 2/3 of it coming from Kyndryl sales and about 1/3 of it coming from IBM. And I'll remind you, we're on the back end of a very successful mainframe cycle. And that back end, we were down a couple of hundred dollars million in infrastructure profit. 
So growing IBM both with incremental sales at Kyndryl and with our broader client base on the back end of a mainframe product cycle, we're pretty pleased with the operating leverage we see in our business, and that gives us the confidence in that free cash flow guidance in $10 billion to $10.5 billion.",594

But maybe if you could just take us a little deeper and help us understand really the puts and takes for each of the software businesses, what surprised you in the quarter, what was more challenged. And then lastly, just what was the growth contribution from acquisitions in Software in the quarter?",84

So Erik, this is Arvind. Let me start with addressing some of these, and Jim will help with some of the precise quantification. So if you look at this overall contribution that you're going through in all of these, let me first address the Kyndryl piece because that may be in some of your -- behind some of your questions. 
The Kyndryl contribution was largely in our mainframe Software segment, in the TPP segment. So I'll put it there and then we pointed it out. I think 28% of the 31% comes from Kyndryl. By the way, as an absolute amount, we expect that to stay going into next year, but obviously, it won't contribute to growth going forward after this October. 
Now as we look at some of the others, a lot of it comes down to the focus and nimbleness in which we are now operating the company, where we have a technology segment and a Consulting segment. I believe that, that is what contributed. Certainly, there was demand in the market for security because you asked that question, but the nimbleness and the focus of our teams now allows us to go fulfill that demand. And that is why you saw that growth rate come up by 7% to 8% between the fourth quarter, just looking at quarter-to-quarter dynamics. 
Then when you look at Red Hat, I think execution was very good. But Red Hat has been in the upper teens, and that is where we expect it to keep performing for the rest of this year. And that speaks to both the quality of the portfolio and the demand that's in the market. Of course, we always have to keep executing against that demand. So I think no real puts and takes in there in these 3. 
Now when we come to the data and AI and automation, I do believe that with some of the acquisitions we did last year and being able to fulfill the demand against those, that led to the second half of last year having an accelerated growth rate in automation. And we do expect it to remain within our model. Our model calls for mid-single-digit growth in both automation and data and AI. 
That said, let me tell you that my instinct from listening to our clients, from seeing what they want to do and from looking at all the shifts happening in demographics, meaning tech skills are very hard to get, I anticipate that for the market at large, there will be more and more demand in both in automation and in AI. Now the execution is on us to go fulfill against that demand.",447

I would just add, Arvind. Erik, thank you very much for the question. Software is obviously an integral part to our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis overall, and Arvind went through the portfolio and the dynamics. 
But let me add some of the KPIs to that, so it gives you some of the fundamentals underneath the pervasive growth across Red Hat at 21%, automation at 5%, data and AI grown 4% and security with a nice rebound, delivering return on the new innovation we brought to market. 
But when you look underneath that, our hybrid platform and solution, our growth vector, which is about 75% of our Software segment, nice growth, double digits overall. Underneath that, we've got an ARR now a subscription book of business, about $13 billion. That's now accelerating, growing 9% overall from an ARR perspective. We see nice acceleration in Cloud Pak portfolio underneath that. With a flywheel effect, we're getting NRRs that are north of 100%. I think this quarter is about 105%. So we've had now 3 or 4 consecutive quarters of that flywheel effect. And we're seeing strong renewals across the early parts of our ELA cycle, which is just beginning. And that strong renewal is leading to a record deferred income balance north of $11 billion right now and growing nicely. So we feel pretty good about our Software portfolio, a lot of execution in front of us though.",237

I believe earlier in the call, you said that it would take a few quarters to get the benefit. But then you mentioned that second half '22, Consulting margins will improve based on the pricing coming in. So should we expect better pricing helps Q3? And is there any way you can quantify how many points of margin you might get back by the end of the year?",110
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078883.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Yes. Thanks, Kyle. Arvind, I'll take this one overall. Yes, Kyle, great question. I mean we're obviously operating in an environment of accelerated demand in the consulting space, and I think you see we are capitalizing on that. And we've been talking about this. So into the second half, when we were looking at all of our indicators across the portfolio and our enterprise clients, we saw a pretty robust demand environment. And we made a conscious strategy to invest in building out skills capabilities, ecosystem partnerships. And we started, if you remember, beginning of 2021 investing significantly in acquisitions to build out scale for our hybrid cloud adoption overall. 
Now you couple that with a highly inflationary environment right now that we started seeing play out in the latter half of 2021. And we said at that point in time that when you couple the investments we've been making, which is conscious, to build that capability because Consulting, as I've always said, is the tip of the spear that provides tremendous value in pulling IBM technology in driving scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform, that you couple that with the inflationary environment, you're seeing the pressure on our gross margins. 
Now I will tell you, let me try to quantify a little bit of this. When you look at our gross margins, we were down about 350 basis points in Consulting. Arguably, off the toughest compare that we'll face in 2022, the compares get easier. So we'll acknowledge that right off the bat. 
Number two, when you look at the inflationary environment, we've been seeing within that 350 basis points, about 150 basis points is due to the accelerating cost of talent acquisition. The remaining 2 points or so is about 1 point of acquisition, which, as you know, as you get ramp and scale, those become very quick accretive. We expect that to be accretive as we get into latter half of second quarter and into third quarter. 
And then we've been investing. When we saw that robust demand environment, we invested a significant amount of capability and capacity. In the early innings of that, you have underutilization. We knew that. That's why we had to get after our G&A structure to optimize and streamline. By the way, reinventing IBM through automation, digitization, everything our clients are doing, we've been doing inside IBM. That's been mitigating the profit impact overall. 
So I think you'll start seeing improvement as we get into third quarter, but we'll make sequential improvement here in the second quarter overall. But I will tell you, again, gross margin improvement will turn accretive in third quarter in the second half. But on a pretax operating margin, we've guided to approaching 10%, that's up a couple of points, we'll see that improvement throughout the year.",471

But I guess on the consulting side, Arvind, maybe I'd love your perspective or perhaps you can share some of what you've heard from conversations regarding the sustainability or durability of digital transformation and consulting spend. 
And maybe to pivot on Wamsi's question earlier, we all know consulting tends to be discretionary in nature, but I would love your view on your portfolio of Consulting business and how that might fare in a more, I guess, difficult macro environment where customers may kind of sharpen the pencils on their budgets. Is it different than, say, system integration, application engineering consulting spend?",114
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078886.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,24,"Yes. Brian, thank you for the question. And it is one that we think a lot about and we talk a lot to our clients about to understand where they are. So if you look at the makeup of our Consulting portfolio, and that is we have very little of what I would call the infrastructure services. So those all went with Kyndryl. So what we have left is helping clients, and Jim talked about the very high growth rates with some of our ecosystem partners that is consulting around topics like Salesforce and Adobe and public clouds. Even in difficult environments, we believe that the adoption of those platforms is going to continue with all of our clients. 
Second, as we look at digitalization, so digitalization is not just taking something, I'll call it, and just coloring it and making it digital. But if we look at it as being one of the primary ways to address the labor demographics issue, meaning the shortage of high-skill labor that is there pretty much globally, then we believe that, that actually continues even in a difficult environment because it gives our clients a way to go address that. I mean if I take, for example, airline scheduling, if you take rebooking of passengers, if I take quote-to-cash, where you cut across all of the silos, if I take much more real-time impact of revenue and omnichannel, these are all examples of our consulting projects which we see carrying on even through a difficult environment. 
So when I look at that, that tells me there's sustainability and durability. I don't see the number of trained people and experts coming up suddenly. And so consequently, I think that because of that, because there is a shortage of technical talent in the world, it will continue to go well even in a constrained economic. 
But Brian, let me acknowledge, when I say constrained, I mean if we enter what I'll call a mild recession or a quick recession. If you get something deep and sustained, I'll put my comments a little bit to the side, and we'll have to then go look at that again. But I think that because of the makeup of our portfolio, I think it will actually fare quite well.",380

Historically, GBS has operate at a lower gross margin than its peers with the difference somewhere in the kind of 400 to 500 basis point range. And I appreciate all of your commentary about GBS margins including the cyclical items and the investments that are impacting margins currently. 
However, looking beyond that, are there structural differences that explain that dynamic? Or with many of the strategic changes and investments in the business that are underway, is the peer group margin achievable? And if you think it is, what time frame do you think you can achieve that?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078889.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,27,"Yes, why don't I address that? Thank you, David, for the question overall. When you take a look at the Consulting margin, let's just take a step back and market in to your point. The competitive benchmark right now, I would say, is probably low to mid-teens. We're not going to be a pure-play industry -- or excuse me, India consulting-based company that has a very different value proposition. But if you look at some of the peers that we benchmark, you're in the low to mid-teens. 
We've talked about our mid-term model. Now that mid-term model, as we put out, aligns to an integrated IBM thesis of hybrid cloud as a platform-centric business built on the foundation of Red Hat. GBS -- or excuse me, Consulting has an integral role of not only being a pure-play competitor, but they play a very essential role in driving the scale and adoption of our software portfolio and also pulling through our technology. And by the way, we've talked many times about how well they are doing and building up a Red Hat practice, I think inception to date, about a $4.5 billion book of business on top of our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis. And they drive about, depending on any quarter, 20% to 30% to 40% of our Cloud Paks. 
But we talked about our mid-term model that we would get in the low double-digit margin range. That is a 3-year picture. So I think we've already given that at high single-digit revenue growth, the investments we're going to make, the integrated value it delivers to IBM. You take that high single-digit revenue growth, you take low double-digit approach into the low teens, we're in a competitive playing field, and it's an integral part of IBM that drives that software portfolio and net profit. So we feel pretty comfortable that, that mid-term model answers your question.",315

A lot of time has already been spent talking about the various segments, except really not your mainframe segment. So maybe I'll take a question on that is you laid out 3 really nice enhancements to mainframe. Is that enough you think to make mainframe be growing over past cycles or competitive with past cycles? Because people have been calling through the death of mainframe for a decade, and that death has been greatly exaggerated. I was just kind of thinking about these enhancements can it actually be more. 
And then on the profit side of mainframe, companies like Citigroup-wide work, we order mainframes well in advance, but the components have changed with pricing. Is there anything we should be conscious of for the profitability of the new Z mainframe rolls out?",141
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078892.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,30,"Yes. So Jim, let me start with answering your question on the capabilities of mainframe driving growth in mainframe and then ask Jim to address the profitability side. 
So if I look at the demand side on mainframe, a lot of our clients are seeing additional volumes because the mainframe serves really well as a system of record as that transactional engine that helps drive our clients' business. So if there is volatility in the markets, if there is 10%, 20%, 30% volume increases, which we are sensing many of our clients see, that is the primary driver of growth. 
And the second driver of growth where we talked about resiliency is everybody is now wanting to be 24/7. And because of all of the issues around not just resiliency due to physical issues or software errors but also because of cyber, people are much more concerned that, that drives additional capacity where people want to make sure that there is a working copy of their application and data set available at some other places. And that is why you heard us talk about that. 
Then as the volumes go up, we know that there is always an indication of fraud that can go up. And because of the fraud, we embedded AI into the processor, so you can now make your fraud decision in line with the transaction decision. And you can imagine, whether it's processing credit cards, whether it's moving money, all of those capabilities are going to drive that. 
So if I pack all of that and then unpack it, Jim, I will tell you that we saw over the last 3 years more growth and better adoption of mainframe than we have seen in prior cycles. We expect from early signals that we're going to see that continue over the next couple of years. That said, we got to go out and execute. We got to make sure that our clients actually are able to quickly deploy these applications that they use, and that will allow us to grow the mainframe over this coming cycle as well.",351
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2022",2022-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4178.0,2540100.0,96078893.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,31,"And I'll just wrap it up, Jim. Thank you very much for the question. Mainframe is obviously an essential element of our innovation and value strategy overall. We operate the mainframe as a platform-centric model. So on top of that mainframe, we have mission-critical software, as you know quite well. We have storage high-end attached. We have maintenance that goes to it. 
When you look at the z15 cycle, we actually -- it's the first time in a few cycles, our profitability of that stack is actually increased really due to where Arvind ended, which is the most successful ship MIPS cycle that we've ever had from a program. Our installed MIPS capacity now is up over 45% from the prior programs. We got roughly about 80 million MIPS that are out there today. That's our opportunity set to deliver tremendous value to our clients but also monetize that value in many different ways. 
But you touched on something, and I just want to wrap up because I want to talk a little bit about how mainframe plays into second quarter. And in the summary in the prepared remarks, we talked about the high level of second quarter. But when you look at second quarter from a top line revenue perspective, mainframe is going to have a major contribution in a historical quarter-to-quarter. If I look at it from a history of the last 3 years, we typically do about $900 million of revenue quarter-to-quarter, 1Q to 2Q, all in. And by the way, that excludes the Kyndryl component of this. 
But when you take a look at this year, we expect 2Q to be a couple of hundred dollars million above that historical quarter-to-quarter of $900 million. So call it about $1.1 billion, a little bit more. Underneath that, mainframe is going to be a substantial contributor to that, albeit shipped late in second quarter and also that underlying fundamental business performance is offsetting, as I said in prepared remarks, the continued dollar strengthening. So currency versus history will be a hurt against that. So we'll more than offset that currency and that dollar strengthening with a better-than-historical 2Q revenue compare, and mainframe is going to be a very big piece of it. 
So Arvind, let me turn it back over to you then.",386

In the second quarter, we drove solid results reflecting the investments and changes we have been making to execute our strategy. With this performance, we continue to deliver on our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
Technology plays an important role in today's business environment. In fact, nearly every client I speak to believes that technology serves as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It serves as both a deflationary force and a force multiplier and is especially critical as clients face challenges on multiple fronts from supply chain bottlenecks to demographic shifts. 
Given its ability to boost innovation, productivity, resilience and help organizations scale, IT has become a high priority in our company's budget. As such, there is every reason to believe technology spending in the B2B space will continue to surpass GDP growth. 
With this demand backdrop, we are executing our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We have made changes to our portfolio and focused investments in our offerings, technical talent, our ecosystem and go-to-market model. 
Demand for our solutions remains strong. We continue to have double-digit performance in IBM Consulting, broad-based trend in software. And with the z16 platform launch, our infrastructure business had a good quarter. By integrating technology and expertise from IBM and our partners, our clients will continue to see our hybrid cloud and AI solutions as a crucial source of business opportunity and growth. 
Let me now delve a little bit deeper into the progress and the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties, all the way to the edge. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume powerful software capabilities driven by open source innovation. Our software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and the security capabilities our clients need. Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise and cocreates with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. 
As a testament to the success of our strategy, we continue to increase adoption of our platform with over 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including more than 250 added in this past quarter alone. Apart from working with a greater number of clients, those who adopt our platform tend to consume more of our solutions across software, consulting and infrastructure, expanding our footprint within those clients. Recently, clients such as [ P&C ], Barclays and Citi have chosen our hybrid cloud capabilities to unlock more business value and meet rapidly changing client demands. 
Organizations everywhere are also under intense pressure to fast track their digital transformation and harness the power of the data. With the world now creating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, artificial intelligence, or AI, is the only way to process this enormous amount of data from hybrid cloud environments all the way to the edge. That is why AI adoption is steadily on the rise. 
According to a new study released by IBM last quarter, 35% of companies are now using some form of AI in their business. Many of those companies are using AI and automation to address demographic shifts and move their employees to higher value work. This is one of the many reasons we are investing heavily in both AI and automation. These investments are paying off. 
In addition to the strong revenue performance in automation and data and AI software, we recently received 2 important recognitions. We were named as a leader in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM and Observability and in The Forrester Data Fabric Wave for our Cloud Pak for data. 
Over the last several quarters, I've highlighted the importance of the growing ecosystem of partners to our platform-centric strategy with leading firms like SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle, Microsoft and AWS. This quarter, we continue to expand and extend our partnerships. I'll expand on just 2. 
We announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to offer a broad array of our software catalog on AWS. This includes capabilities that span Automation, Data & AI, Security and Sustainability. Second, with Tech Mahindra, we launched synergy lounges to empower businesses with the innovation technologies and services for key industries such as telecommunications, manufacturing, banking, health care, energy and utilities. The first synergy lounge was established in Bengaluru with a focus on edge, 5G and software-defined networking solutions with hybrid cloud. This will be followed by the opening of 3 more centers in London, Seattle and Melbourne. 
Clients aren't just simply buying software or hardware. They're entering a relationship with the company that's going to help them navigate the future of technology. This is why innovation and our ability to invent what's next remains so important. 
Quantum is a great example of our commitment to advance the future of technology. Building on our progress of 127 qubit Quantum computer currently in our cloud, we have committed to demonstrate the first 400-plus qubit system before year-end. This will help us move forward towards our road map to deliver 1,000-plus qubit system next year and a 4,000-plus qubit system in 2025. 
One of the implications of quantum computing will be the need to change how information is encrypted. We are proud that technology developed by IBM and our collaborators has been selected by NIST as the basis of the next generation of quantum-safe encryption protocols. 
In another example of innovation, our new z16 system became generally available in the second quarter. The z16 is designed for cloud native development; server security resilience; quantum-safe encryption; and includes an on-chip accelerator, which allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions. 
Given the importance of cybersecurity, in this past quarter, we also acquired Randori, a leading attack surface management and offensive cybersecurity provider. This builds on the recent acquisition of ReaQta and the launch of QRadar XDR. It's one of 2 acquisitions in the second quarter and over 25% in the last 2 years. 
Another major focus area across all stakeholders is ESG, which isn't just a regulatory requirement or about being a good corporate citizen. It's also a business opportunity. A poll conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that 50% of CEOs see sustainability as one of their highest priorities, and over 80% of CEOs believe their company's sustainability investments will improve business results and accelerate growth. To accomplish this, companies need to leverage AI and to turn the mountains of data they collect into sustainable action. 
SL Green Realty Corporation, Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a recent example. They are using Envizi, an IBM solution to manage their easy indicators across their extensive real estate operations, including energy use, carbon emissions and environmental and social responsibility metrics. 
Let me wrap up by saying that given the strength of our portfolio, the need for our technology and expertise with the benefits we're yielding from any actions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenue in 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model. 
Now let me hand it over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our second quarter performance and add color on our expectations for the balance of the year.",1223
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2022",2022-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3838.0,2600554.0,98066989.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, which is a margin of 16.2%; and operating earnings per share of $2.31. In the first half of the year, we generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 16%. This includes nearly 5 points of incremental revenue from Kyndryl. 
As always, we discussed revenue growth at constant currency. But given the focus on the sharply strengthening dollar, I'll mention that currency translation impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points of growth or $900 million. That's over $200 million more than the spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. 
Today's IBM has a higher growth profile driven by our growth vectors of software and consulting. More than half of our annual revenue is recurring, with about 2/3 of that in high-value software. Software revenue this past quarter was up 12%; and Consulting, up 18%. Infrastructure performance, which reflects a good start to our z16 product cycle, was up 25%. Software and infrastructure each include about 7 points of growth from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl. 
These results reflect the investments we've been making in innovation, our ecosystem and talent, all aligned to our strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI. We integrate consulting and technology to deliver these hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Our platform approach not only benefits our clients but also provides an attractive economic model for IBM and our partners with a multiple of software and consulting revenue generated for every dollar of platform revenue. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure was up 19% over the last year. It has grown to $21.7 billion or 36% of our total revenue. 
Looking at our P&L metrics. Operating gross profit dollars were up driven by strong revenue performance in our high-value businesses. Our year-to-year gross margin decline reflects escalating labor and component costs. We're addressing this through pricing, though it takes some time to show up in our margin profile, especially in consulting. Our operating pretax income was up, and we expanded margin by 420 basis points. We had an operating tax rate of about 16.5%, which is up about 2 points versus last year, and our operating net income margin expanded 330 basis points. 
Let me comment on a few dynamics within our profit performance. Our pretax profit reflects the benefit from actions we've taken to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model as well as profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship post separation. 
Our profit this quarter also reflects recent portfolio actions. At the end of June, we closed on the divestiture of our health care software assets, generating a pretax gain of about $230 million in the period. Mitigating that benefit to our overall profit results, we took charges to address stranded costs associated with the divestiture and absorbed operating losses related to the health business, together, over $75 million. 
We also announced the orderly wind down of our Russian operations, resulting in incremental charges in the quarter. Together with the year-to-year loss business due to the wind down, Russia impacted our profit results by another roughly $100 million. 
I also want to comment on the impact of currency. I mentioned that over the last 90 days, we've dealt with a sharply strengthening dollar. We execute hedge programs that cover the majority but not all of the currency exposure. The combination of the rate and velocity of movement this quarter and the fact that we don't hedge 100% results in a currency impact to our profit and cash flow. 
Turning to free cash flow. We generated over $2 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion for the first half with good working capital performance. This first half free cash flow is about 33% of our full year expected range, consistent with the average of the last few years. I'll remind you the $1 billion plus of proceeds from the health divestiture is reflected in cash from investing activities versus in our free cash flow. 
In terms of uses of cash for the first half, we invested nearly $1 billion in acquisitions with 5 closed this year, and we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a June cash position of nearly $8 billion, which is up slightly from year-end. And our debt of just over $50 billion is down about $1.5 billion over the same period. 
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 12%. This includes about 7 points from the Kyndryl software content. Growth was driven by our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. Hybrid cloud revenue for the segment now represents $9 billion over the last year, up 23%. 
Software subscription and support renewal rates were up again this quarter. This contributes to our solid and growing recurring revenue base, which represents about 80% of software. From a revenue category perspective, our software growth vector of Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 9%. This includes about 1.5 points benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. 
We again drove pervasive growth across Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Security. Red Hat revenue all in grew 17%. Revenue growth was fueled by new adoption and expansion of RHEL and OpenShift as both solutions continue to take share. These key offerings address hybrid cloud requirements in industries like financial services, public sector and telecommunications, across environments and out to the edge. 
Automation revenue was up 8%. Solid performance in both AI ops and management and integration demonstrates the importance of automation in the IT journeys of our clients. We had strength in offerings like Turbonomic and Instana for observability; Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps; and our modern integration platform, Cloud Pak for Integration. 
Data & AI revenue grew 4%. This growth was led by demand for data fabric, data management and asset and supply chain management solutions. We also just expanded our Data Fabric portfolio with the acquisition of Databand.ai, which helps organizations with data observability. 
Security revenue was up 5% with growth in threat management and identity as enterprises continue to adopt a Zero Trust security strategy and implement additional identity controls. We're continuing to invest in our security capabilities, having completed 2 acquisitions in the threat management space over the last few quarters. 
Across the 4 Hybrid Platform & Solution business areas, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is nearly $12.9 billion, up 8%. 
Turning to our software value vector, transaction processing, revenue grew 19%, including 22 points from the Kyndryl content. We continue to have strong renewal rates for this mission-critical software and performed in line with our expectations this quarter. 
Looking at software profit. We delivered operating leverage given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up 4 points and keeps us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s. 
Moving on to Consulting. We again saw pervasive growth with double-digit revenue growth across all business lines and geographies. Revenue was up 18% compared to 8% growth a year ago. We maintained a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 on a trailing 12-month basis as clients are choosing to co-create with IBM, trusting our deep industry expertise. 
The expansion of our skills, capabilities and ecosystems are enabling us to capture demand as we drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and help clients with their digital transformations. Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% over the last year to $8.6 billion. Momentum behind our Red Hat practice remains strong. We nearly doubled our Red Hat consulting revenue in the quarter and continued solid Red Hat bookings, which now exceeds $6 billion inception to date. 
Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships continue to grow solid double digits, led by Azure, AWS and SAP and Salesforce. 
Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation grew 16%. Its clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive and led by our offerings focused on customer experience transformation, data transformation and our SAP practices. 
In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 23%. Cloud modernization and cloud application development led a significant portion of the growth, with on-prem modernization also contributing to the strong revenue performance in the quarter. 
Application operations revenue grew 17%. Growth was solid across our cloud offerings, mitigated by declines in the on-prem space. In this business, we are optimizing the management of applications and providing cloud platform services required to run our clients' hybrid cloud environments. 
Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded 1 point as we deliver operating leverage and benefit from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting margins reflect the significant investments we have been making to capture demand and fuel our revenue growth. We continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, scale acquisitions and add skills. 
Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the inflationary labor market and increasing labor cost as we bring and increase capacity. We are starting to capture the reality of these higher costs in our pricing. But given the time from contract signing to revenue realization, it's taking some time to see it in our margins. 
Turning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 25%, including about 7 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue grew 41%. And infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 7 and 8 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. 
Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 77%. This reflects solid execution around our z16 program, building on the momentum from z15. As Arvind mentioned, z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. We are seeing growth in new workloads like Linux and demand for AI capabilities like real-time fraud detection, leveraging the on-chip AI accelerator. Clients are investing in zSystems platform as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. 
Distributed infrastructure revenue grew 17% this quarter. This growth was led by storage, driven by both high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and distributed storage. We also had good performance in high-end Power10. Just last week, we announced the expansion of our Power10 server family as we deliver flexible and secure infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments. 
Looking at infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 4 points year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems, mitigated by the impact of increased component cost and supplier premiums. 
Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We've taken actions and made investments over the last couple of years to execute a platform-centric hybrid cloud and AI strategy. IBM is now a more focused, faster-growing and higher value company. And while there is always more work to do, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth. 
Our first half results were solid. We continue to see constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model for the full year. And on top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth from the Kyndryl sales spread over the first 3 quarters. 
I mentioned the impact of currency to our 2Q results. With the significant movement of the U.S. dollar as compared to nearly every currency, at mid-July spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 6-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. That's a degradation of about $1.5 billion from April's rates with most of that incremental impact still ahead of us in the second half. 
Currency is one unique issue we're dealing with. The other is the impact of exiting our Russia operation. Together, these are putting some pressure on our near-term results, and we now expect free cash flow of about $10 billion for the year. These are exogenous issues. Importantly, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. You see this in our segment expectations. Halfway through the year, there's no change to our full year view of software. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. 
Our IBM consulting revenue growth has been strong, and we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth rate for the year, which is above our model. With continued investment in skills and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a consulting pretax margin of 9% to 10%, which is up over 1 point year-to-year. This reflects improving margin performance in the second half as we increase utilization of the resources we've added and price realization starts to flow to revenue. 
Our infrastructure revenue in any period reflects product cycle dynamics. We had a very strong launch of our z16 platform in the second quarter. This will drive infrastructure revenue performance above the model level for the year. On top of that, we're planning for about 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from the sales to Kyndryl in 2022. Despite some of the pressures from component cost increases and supplier premiums, we continue to see mid- to high-teens pretax margin for infrastructure for the full year. 
These segment revenue and margin dynamics yield about a 3.5 point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. And we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. You'll recall that back in January, we expected a 40-60 first half/second half profit SKU. Now after a solid start to the year, our view hasn't changed, and we still see 60% of the full year profit in the second half. 
Looking at the third quarter, we expect all in constant currency revenue growth in the high single-digit range and about a 2-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin. I want to mention 2 specific items on the third quarter. First, at current spot rates, currency translation has increased to about an 8-point headwind to revenue growth, impacting our reported revenue, profit and cash. Second, we haven't had a zSystems product introduction in our large transactional second quarter in about 20 years. This unique timing, coupled with the strong start to the cycle, will result in a larger second to third quarter impact than typical seasonality. So to be clear, we expect a strong year-to-year growth in zSystems. 
In closing, these are interesting times, and we see technology as a way to help our enterprise clients capture today's opportunities and navigate challenges. We feel good about the strategy we are executing and the fundamentals of our business.

Let me start off by just -- we feel very good about the Red Hat business, and we see very strong demand continuing. That said, we had said late last year that we expect growth in Red Hat to be in the upper teens. We continue to make that expectation. It's what we are going to continue with. Erik, I think I heard you start to say deferred revenue. That accounts for the bulk of what has been the difference in the growth rates and coming down from last year to this year, and I'll let Jim add a bit of color on to that.",111

Just building on what Arvind said, 17% growth overall, taking share both in our core RHEL but also in our hybrid cloud platform-centric foundation, Red Hat OpenShift. By the way, Red Hat OpenShift, 4.5x now the revenue pre-acquisition. We had very strong bookings overall in Red Hat here in the quarter. Large deals were up 50%. Red Hat OpenShift bookings were up over 50%, which positions us very well with our backlog and a strong NRR. So we feel pretty good about our Red Hat portfolio overall. 
Arvind indicated, our model is high teens. We delivered on that in the quarter. And by the way, the deferred revenue, we talked about entering January this year that, that was going to lessen throughout the year. And we're pretty much through that. I mean there's some small round-up here in the third quarter, but that's pretty much behind us. And remember, we're 3 years into this acquisition right now. and we couldn't be more pleased as we move forward.",170

One of the things that always comes up there -- I'm just going to look at the numbers right there. Revenue seems to be doing better than what most folks thought it was 90 days ago, I think at the start of the year event. But the free cash flow number, I think, it is $10 billion at this point, it was $10 billion to $10.5 billion initially. Maybe just talk on what are the puts and takes you see on free cash flow because that would be helpful to kind of understand? And then maybe just related to that, you've been very explicit on the FX headwinds on your top line. I'm assuming given how volatile this movement was, there might be an impact to your EPS and free cash flow. So maybe you can just flush out what's the picture on free cash flow and how is the FX impacting being below the top line? That would be helpful.",173

So let's take a moment to go through this because I think it's very important when you look at our 2 key measures of success. You talked about it. Revenue growth Arvind's put in place to run this company and free cash flow growth. 
We started out the year guiding at $10 billion to $10.5 billion. And now coming through the first half, we have now moved it to the low end of that guidance at about $10 billion. 
Before I get into the puts and takes at the heart of your question, let's take a step back and put this into perspective. That $10 billion of free cash flow is growing $3.5 billion year-to-year, and it's even growing north of $2 billion against our 2021 IBM post-separation baseline that we gave to all of our investors. Remember, we're very transparent on the revenue growth of the Kyndryl contribution, and we have given each of you the pro forma baseline. But on either case, that is very strong free cash flow growth overall. 
There's 2 pieces that I talked about in the summary of the prepared remarks. Number one, given the unfortunate humanitarian crisis in the war in Russia, we made the right decision to exit that business here in the second quarter. And that was a very highly profitable business for us, and that's going to cost a couple -- $100 million worth of free cash flow and profit, by the way, in 2022. The second is what's been happening with the rate and pace of the U.S. dollar appreciation. And that right now, we are not immune to that as we move forward. 
But let me talk a little bit about the go-forward free cash flow. We achieved $3.3 billion through the first half. That is actually slightly above our historical attainment over the last 5 years. And when we look at the second half, we see continued revenue growth. We see continued operating leverage out of our business. We've had good performance on our working capital management here through the first half. And given the volume dynamics and now our mainframe cycle, which we got off to a good start, should provide leverage. And then as I talked about in January, we do have a modest cash tax headwind -- or excuse me, tailwind for the year. So that kind of wraps up free cash flow overall.",406

And then you mentioned that revenue sequentially would be a little lighter than usual in Q3 because of the mainframe. I think you're typically down about $850 million. The mainframe is like $500 million to $700 million a quarter. So maybe it's a $100 million headwind. So is that sort of the dimension that you're thinking about for Q3? Or are there other factors at work?,93

We are absolutely committed to our $35 billion total free cash flow cumulative over '22 through '24. And we still see very good signs, and we have confidence in delivering that number. And so with that, you said the bridge to that and then the 2Q to 3Q dynamics, I'll hand it to Jim for those.",77
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2022",2022-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3838.0,2600554.0,98067001.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Yes. Thanks, Toni. If you go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, we typically -- I think the number is actually about $1 billion sequentially in revenue, Toni, overall. But we've actually given pretty explicit guidance on third quarter. We said that we were going to be all in high single digit at constant currency here in the second quarter. So let me address your question from that dynamic because we gave -- we've given that explicit quarter-to-quarter and what's going to happen to constant currency total revenue. 
So if you look at second quarter, we delivered mid-teens. By the way, I wouldn't make the point -- that is the strongest constant currency growth that we've had in 20 years in this company, well above our mid-single-digit model and an acceleration from second quarter. By the way, acceleration in revenue growth, acceleration in operating profit margin of 420 basis points and acceleration in free cash flow. But if you look at constant currency, we're going from mid-teens in second quarter to high single digit. Let me call that 9% to 10%. That's about 6 points worth of what I'll call ""deceleration."" Two points right off the bat is coming from our health care software asset divestiture. We closed that at the end of June. 
That's about $200 million a quarter. That's 2 points of the 6. The remaining 4 points is the dynamic of us for the first time in 20 years coming out with a new mainframe cycle in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter of second quarter. We did extremely well. Remember, 90 days ago, we took up our second quarter revenue guidance by $200 million versus the normal seasonality. We actually beat that in the second quarter. 
Now when you look at second half and get into third quarter, I think it's imprudent in this environment for us only to guide at what a normal cycle would be. And given the normal cycle, that's going to cost us about 4 points in a 2Q to 3Q given the announcement in the second quarter. And I'll wrap it up just saying that, Toni, I talked about upfront that we still see 40% to 60% SKU in our operating profit for the year. That hasn't changed since January. This is really a dynamic between the third quarter and the fourth quarter now given how we announced the new Z cycle, which we're very excited about here in the second half.",412

And if I could, Jim, can you help sort through the PTI change year-over-year in the second half of the year? It seems like you had significant improvement in PTI, 400-plus basis points in the second quarter. You're guiding to about 200 basis points in the third quarter. Does it mean that there is a catch-up of sort of PTI in the fourth quarter? Or is this -- and how much of that is FX versus mainframe timing-related? Because you alluded to both of those when you were talking about the revenue impact.",128

So Wamsi, let me address the first part of your question. We had very balanced performance in constant currency across geographies and actually across the different businesses. Now because of currency, the actual performance will be different in different geographies, but double-digit performance in the Americas, in Europe as well as in Asia Pacific. 
Jim laid out the numbers on the different business performances. He talked about at constant currency, 12% in software, 18% in consulting, 19% in infrastructure. Those are really strong performances, I believe. As we go forward, you should expect to see us maintain, and we said, we talked about we'll remain in the mid-single digits on software. We will get towards the low end of double digits in consulting, which is actually up from our previous high single-digit margin, and infrastructure will benefit from the Z cycle. So all in, that's very balanced across the portfolio and across the geographies, and that then contributes towards our confidence in the revenue profile for the rest of the year.",172

Let me give you a step back from an overall perspective, and then I'll come into the third quarter. We maintained the guidance to your question about high single-digit -- or excuse me, high end of our mid-single-digit revenue growth before the incremental Kyndryl contribution for the year. Arvind just went through the portfolio dynamics of that. 
By the way, the currency change that now we expect about 6 points impact beyond that constant currency strong performance, that went up from about 3 to 4 points 90 days ago. So that's about $1.5 billion. I've seen some people quoting $3.5 billion. It's about $1.5 billion overall change from what we said here in April. But with that revenue growth, we expect about $10 billion of free cash flow and operating profit margins up a strong 350 basis points year-over-year. 
When you look at that by segment, we really haven't changed our software segment. We feel pretty comfortable and confident in our first half trajectory that we're still going to grow mid-single digit overall in software, operating margins approaching mid-20s. Remember, that's 5 to 6 points of an operating margin. Infrastructure segment, we still think, given the product cycle dynamics, it will be well in excess of its model and have operating margins around mid- to high teens. And then consulting, we see strong demand in consulting. We took up our model on revenue growth 90 days ago, and now that's low double digit. And our margin now, we took down to [ $9 billion ] to [ $10 billion ]. That's the one change that's happening. 
And what we're seeing is it's taking longer for our price optimization to play through to our margin. We still expect margin increase year-over-year for the full year between that [ $9 billion ] and [ $10 billion ] absolute PTI. And that will actually be -- as we wrap on easier comparison in the second half, that will be some nice margin accretion here in our consulting business in the second half overall. 
Now third quarter, similar to how I answered Toni's question on revenue growth overall, our operating margins are typically flat quarter-to-quarter. When you look at the dynamics of mainframe coming out for the first time in 20 years in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter and you look at then a prudent guidance on the third quarter, that is about a 4-point margin impact. And by the way, our third quarter, we guided to be up 2. So when you look at the dynamics, it's entirely even more so driven by the mainframe dynamics. And to your question, Wamsi, that comes back to us here in the fourth quarter, so we'll just have a very different SKU given the new introduction in the second quarter.",469

I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit there. I appreciate kind of the pricing dynamics you discussed. But I think if we look at this from both the demand side and the supply side, could you share any thoughts on what you're seeing if there's -- if anything is changing there? So from the supply side, hiring, attrition, wage inflation changing or stabilizing. On demand side, I noticed that it's great to see the improvement in constant currency growth sequentially. Nice to see the acceleration, but it looks like business transformation moderated a little bit while we have improvement in technology consulting and application operations. So maybe if we could walk through supply dynamics and the demand dynamics to see what's changing within that business and what's driving your confidence in the performance for the rest of the year?",162
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2022",2022-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3838.0,2600554.0,98067008.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,22,"Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Great question. So let's take a minute here to go through this, right? We continue -- I'm going to start with the demand side of the equation because in a human capital-based business, the way we manage this is our source of cost, our value ROI indicators, the human capital to go drive that demand and capture it. So we continue to see a strong demand profile, and we're capturing it by raising our guidance here and seeing the accelerated consulting performance in the quarter, up 18%, by the way, on a plus 8% last year overall. So I think that's driven by what Arvind has been talking about, and that is the value of technology being a sustainable competitive advantage in this environment as clients in every industry are moving and accelerating their digital transformation and journey in the cloud. 
Consulting is also a very integral part to our hybrid cloud platform thesis. I've talked every quarter about being the tip of the spirit to drive the scale adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pull through IBM's technology overall. So we saw this. If you remember, dial back a year ago, we were entering second half '21 in a very different dynamic coming off of the pandemic. And I think Arvind was very explicit about the demand indicators that we saw that we were going to take a conscious strategy to now I'm on your supply side to invest in skills and capabilities, in ecosystem expansion and in acquisitions because we saw the robust demand growth that was going to be out there. 
And I think we've been capitalizing on that growing consistent double digit. And by the way, another solid signings quarter with the trailing 12-month book-to-bill north of 1.1, we feel pretty good even as we enter the second half. But you take that conscious strategy of driving incremental skill capability capacity on the supply side and then you couple that with a highly-inflationary environment that started to play out in the second half, and you see that, that's been impacting our gross profit margins. 
And we talked about as we came into 2022 that we were going to go take the appropriate actions around our price optimization but that, that would take time to get rolled through our P&L, and that's what we kind of expect in the second half of this year. So when we look at all in, demand still see solid. The supply side of the equation, we've been optimized with a very disciplined, strategic investment process. And when we look at second half, we are looking at: one, easier comps; two, scaling the acquisitive accretion of our acquisitions, where actually we saw some good green shoots here in the second quarter; three, getting effective increase in utilization of our capacity; and four, price optimization continue to play through. So we saw nice improvement in our price margins that will play out in the second half as we move forward. So hopefully, that gets you a little perspective.",512

So are you able to size how much that demand-related impact might be, which would actually make your reiterated guidance for the high end of your mid-single-digit range for the full year for the core look even a bit better? Also connected to that, what is your sense if you have some perspective on how well international customers are positioned to be able to absorb the currency fluctuations?",87

Thank you. I'll take this, Arvind. Let me spend a few minutes on currency since it seems to be a theme here across the questions and really how we manage it within our business and how it impacts our business model. So while we have a robust hedging program, as I indicated earlier, we're not immune over the long term, the currency impacts, especially when currencies move at the rate, breadth and magnitude that we've seen. 
Let me give you some stats as we've been going through here in the month of June and the early part of July. One, the U.S. dollar index is up 13% year-to-date, a 20-year high against the euro, 25-year high against the yen. The velocity of the strengthening is the sharpest that we've seen in over a decade. And it's been a broad-based dollar story, as you all know. All the currencies we hedge, over half of them are down double digits against the U.S. dollar this year. So it's kind of, I would say, ""unprecedented"" in what we've seen in the rate, the breadth of magnitude. 
Now to your question, Kyle. Our business profile, we operate in 170 countries around the world. That's in excess of over 100 currencies. The strong dollar definitely has an impact. And to your point, from an absolute revenue profile, I would agree with you completely. It even makes our constant currency revenue growth guidance even stronger in us capturing what's happening in the marketplace with regards to that acceleration of digitization and transformation and journey to cloud. 
But our robust hedging program, there's 2 important points I'd like to make. Number one, we don't hedge 100 currencies. One, it's not economically viable; and two, you can't hedge revenue per GAAP accounting. You can only hedge where you have cash proxies in countries. So we only hedge, give or take, about 35 currencies around the world out of the 100 plus that we're in. And also important, if not more important, we only hedge 12 months out. We don't do multiyear hedging in this business. We're not speculative. 
So when you look at the lasting relevance of a U.S. dollar appreciation, eventually, what hedging does is, it mitigates volatility in the near term. It does not eliminate currency. It allows you time to address your business model for price, for source, for labor pools and for cost structures. 
Now also important, and this is where you see the dynamics playing out in our business model. Currency impacts a human capital-based business, very different than a product-based business, and I've talked about this many times over the years. In a human capital-based business, if you think about it, a large portion of your cost structure is a natural hedge because it's in local currency. Very different in a product-based business where a large portion of your cost structure is U.S. dollar-denominated. So as the dollar at rate and pace and magnitude appreciates, it has a disproportional impact on our high-value, product-based businesses, read that, software and infrastructure. And you saw that play on the second quarter at the gross margin level. 
Remember, our hedges end up in expense. Gross margin, you see the revenue and the margin implications. So we understand how to manage currency. We have a robust hedging program in place. We've taken the appropriate cost structure and the appropriate pricing as we deal with that going forward, and you see all that taken into account in our guidance.",584

You mentioned Russia had some losses. You mentioned the health care software divestiture. I don't know if there are any more. And perhaps beyond that, could you weave that dynamic into how it impacts free cash flow growth in the next year or 2, given your 2024 target really implies a fairly meaningful increase in free cash conversion over the next 2 years?",94
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2022",2022-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3838.0,2600554.0,98067014.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,28,"Yes, David, thank you very much for the question. At its core, we actually took some conscious strategy back in fourth quarter '20, if you remember. At the time, we announced the intent to spin off Kyndryl that we were going to try to get out in front of stranded costs. And as you see now, we've executed on additional portfolio actions with the divestiture and closure of our health care software assets across the board. 
If you look at 2022, there's about $500 million to $600 million, $700 million, give or take, in that range around structural action cash charges that will still impact us. And by the way, that's embedded in our about $10 billion overall. So now when you think to the core of your question about how that [ then ] plays out for '23 and '24, that actually turns into tailwinds in '23 and '24 because we're depressed in our free cash flow guidance. 
And again, I'll remind you, that's up $3.5 billion year-to-year and up over $2 billion against our post-separation baseline. That depresses 2022's free cash flow. And we get that return, not only on the cash charges that we won't have in 2023, but also on the incremental ROI of getting rid of that stranded cost as we move forward. So both pieces, it kind of gives you a double benefit as we move forward.",233

I? wanted to see if you could look out over the horizon a little bit longer. Some of the software companies have talked about some of the pipelines in a deep sales cycle are starting to extend and I just wanted to see if you're seeing any economic impact. And then more specifically, I wanted to see if you could comment, historically, consulting has been highly correlated to economic cycles. And this is going back last 15, 20 years. And I just wanted to see as we're heading into late '22 and more importantly '23, how do you think the consulting business is prepared for some potential economic downturns? Or just more broadly, how do you think about the growth potential there? 
And Jim, if I could just sneak in one thing for you real quick, if you could just talk about what the M&A contribution is this year? You mentioned some recent deals. Just if you could provide an update, that would be great.",176
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2022",2022-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3838.0,2600554.0,98067017.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,31,"Okay. So Keith, a lot to unpack in that question. If I look at our pipelines, our pipelines are remaining pretty healthy. So I would tell you that right now, what we are seeing is that the second half at this point, looks pretty consistent to the first half. When we look at our pipelines, whether it's in Red Hat or mainframe software or Automation, Data & AI, Security and by geography. 
So this is a little bit different, which is why you've heard me often say I'm a bit more optimistic than many of my peers, both within the industry and across the board because we see that technology, and Jim has also said this as of I, is deflationary. So in an inflationary environment when clients take our technology, deploy it, leverage our consulting. It acts as a counterbalance to all of the inflation and all of the labor demographics that people are facing all over the globe. So that is the reason on software. 
Second, on consulting correlated to the economic cycle, and maybe we see much less of that this time around because of the nature of our consulting. If you look at it, a lot of our consulting is around deploying back-office applications, critical applications, supply chain resilience, worrying about cash conversion, worrying about optimization of our -- of the costs within our clients. Those tend to get more attention actually in, I'll call it, at least a slight down cycle. They're not. 
Third, Look, consulting is very labor-based. Jim talked a lot about the demand and the supply. But to be completely clear, in a business where you do hire tens of thousands of people because of the scale of it, you do churn in the neighborhood of tens of thousands each year. That gives you an automatic way to hit a pause in some of the profit controls because if you don't see the demand coming, you're going to slow down your supply side. And it -- you get kind of at least a 10% to 20% impact that you can pretty quickly control, not in a given month, but certainly within a half year or thereabouts. 
On M&A, actually, I'll say it before Jim will. We have said that our model is about 1 point to 1.5 points each year based on M&A. And if you look at last year, that was pretty consistent. If you look at this year, look, the year is not over, but you should expect it to stay in that range. And it's a mix between consulting acquisitions and software acquisitions, and the multiples that we've been getting them at still imply that range. So I think we'll give you that answer, and we expect it to stay there. 
So let me wrap up the call. So let me just say, we are very pleased with our solid first half performance. As we look to the second half, we are going to focus on the execution of our strategy, delivering sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.",522

The results we delivered in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on the execution of our strategy with over $14 billion of revenue and strong growth across the portfolio. Technology remains a fundamental source of competitive advantage, and we continue to see solid demand for our hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Continued double-digit revenue growth in IBM Consulting, capturing client demand for digital transformations. Software revenue performance was also strong with growth across all categories. And our Infrastructure business had another high-growth quarter in both zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure. Our revenue strength was broad-based geographically as well. 
When I talk with clients, it's clear there's a real opportunity to help businesses leverage technology in today's environment. Clients are dealing with everything from inflation to demographic shifts, from supply chain bottlenecks to sustainability efforts. By deploying powerful hybrid cloud and AI technologies, IBM is helping businesses seize new opportunities, overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger. 
We, too, are building a stronger company that is closely aligned to the needs of our clients. In line with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we have continued to focus our portfolio, invest in our offerings, technical talent and ecosystem and streamline our go-to-market model. With strong performance through the first 3 quarters, we are taking up our revenue expectations for the year and now expect 2022 revenue above our mid-single-digit model. 
Let me now turn to the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our point of view is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the 2 most transformational enterprise technologies of our time. Hybrid cloud is already becoming the dominant architecture for enterprise. According to a recent survey by the Harris Poll, 77% of businesses surveyed that they have adopted hybrid cloud for their organizations with data located across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can drive value across these different environments. 
Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume software driven by open source innovation. IBM's software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and security capabilities. Our consultants offer deep business expertise and co-create with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of a hybrid cloud environment. 
Our platform-centric strategy continues to have good momentum, adding a couple of hundred hybrid cloud platform clients in the third quarter. We see more and more clients consuming across our portfolio of Software, Consulting and Infrastructure capabilities. This quarter, clients such as Bank of America, Bharti Airtel and Samsung Electronics have chosen IBM to realize the full potential of a hybrid cloud computing model. 
Let me now say a few words about our AI capabilities. As demographic shifts continue to add pressure to modern economies, coupled with wage inflation, companies are eager to deploy AI and automation capabilities at scale to boost their levels of productivity. That is what IBM is helping companies bring to bear. In the context of enterprise, we are seeing 4 main use cases emerge: AI to interact and converse; AI to automate IT processes; AI to extract knowledge and insights; and finally, AI to automate business workflows such as HR, supply chains and financial reporting. We are working to bring these capabilities to clients across all industries. 
For instance, this quarter, IBM Consulting partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to automate business workflows related to the delivery of pension benefits. This helps free up valuable time of VA staff and speed up the processing of claims made by the veterans most in need. Our partner ecosystem is a crucial element of our strategy. Each quarter, we continue to expand the work we do with partners to serve our joint clients. For instance, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with VMware to help clients in regulated industries more easily move workloads to the cloud, with IBM Consulting now serving as a GSI partner for VMware. 
We announced that Red Hat and Dell are launching a set of containerized solutions aimed at simplifying the management of multi-cloud environments on-premise. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 90% of organizations will use containers. These actions represent another step in our efforts to seize this opportunity through ecosystem relationships and our technology offerings. 
We are actively working to introduce new innovations and shape the technologies of the future. Most recently, we unveiled the next generation of our LinuxONE server, a Linux and Kubernetes-based platform designed to support thousands of workloads within the footprint of a single system. As an example, Citibank is hosting MongoDB on IBM LinuxONE, leveraging the platform's security, resiliency and elastic capacity and helping Citi lower its overall carbon footprint. 
We also continue to make progress in quantum computing. We remain on track towards our goal of building a 1,000-qubit system by 2023. To advance the security of our communication networks, IBM alongside Vodafone recently joined the GSMA Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce. This task force aims to introduce a framework for the telco industry to adopt new quantum-safe approaches. 
Complementing our organic innovation, we recently acquired Dialexa. This brings our total number of acquisitions this year to 7, adding new capabilities in areas like hybrid cloud services, security, data observability and sustainability. As the world takes on the challenge of sustainability and building a more circular economy, IBM has been building a portfolio of solutions to help companies make progress on this journey. 
This quarter, we received recognition, highlighting our sustainability efforts. The analyst firm HFS Research and Forbes both recognized IBM for its capabilities in the area of sustainability, including Envizi and our Environmental Intelligence Suite software. 
Let me conclude by reminding you that last October and just prior to the separation of Kyndryl, we held our investor briefing, laying out priorities for our portfolio and growth. Over the last 4 quarters, we have driven constant currency revenue growth at or above our mid-single-digit model with solid free cash flow. And while there is always more to do, we are pleased with our first year's progress. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategy and execution and feel we are well positioned to address today's client needs. 
Let me now turn it over to Jim, who will provide more details on the quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year.",1077
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033370.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights. In the third quarter, we delivered $14.1 billion in revenue, $2 billion of operating pretax income and a margin of nearly 14%, and operating earnings per share of $1.81. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated over $4 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 15%, which includes about 5 points of contribution from sales to Kyndryl. While we'll discuss our results today at constant currency, I'll mention that with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, currency translation impacted our reported revenue growth by more than 8 points or nearly $1.1 billion. 
As Arvind said, our revenue growth this quarter was pervasive. Software revenue was up 14% and Consulting up 16%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 23%, reflecting solid product cycle dynamics. Software and Infrastructure include about 8 and 9 points of growth, respectively, from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl. More than half of our revenue is recurring, and this annuity content, which is driven by software, continues to grow. 
Performance was also broad-based by geography. Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific revenue were all up double digits, and we gained share overall. These revenue results reflect the execution of more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy based on a platform-centric approach and leveraging a broad ecosystem of partners. Our full stack capabilities across Software, Consulting and Infrastructure delivered 20% growth in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year to over $22 billion. 
Looking at our profit metrics, operating pretax income was up and margin expanded by 180 basis points year-to-year. These profit dynamics reflect our portfolio shift toward higher value led by software. This mix shift is contributing to profit and margin. Our pretax profit also includes the contribution from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Like our clients, we are focused on digitally transforming our own operations, applying AI and automation to drive productivity and efficiency in the spend base. This provides flexibility to continue to invest in talent, innovation and our ecosystem in an inflationary environment. 
90 days ago, we spent some time talking about currency dynamics. I'll remind you of a few of the key points. A stronger dollar impacts our revenue and gross profit dollars. We execute a hedging program, which defers versus eliminates the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense. But with the rate and magnitude of the movements and because we don't hedge all currencies, we do have a currency impact to our overall profit and cash flow. 
Wrapping up the discussion on profit dynamics. The currency impacts and a good amount of investments are in gross profit. While the mitigating hedging benefits and operational productivity are reflected primarily in expense. As a result, pretax income is a better indicator of our profit performance. Our operating tax rate was about 16%. Compared to last year, tax is a significant year-to-year headwind to operating net income and operating EPS growth, which were both down modestly year-to-year. 
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $4.1 billion in the first 3 quarters. That's up over $900 million year-to-year. We're wrapping on payments related to the Kyndryl separation and the 2020 structural action and driving working capital efficiencies. In terms of uses of cash in the first 3 quarters, we invested over $1 billion in acquisitions, which was more than offset by proceeds from divested businesses. And we returned nearly $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we issued debt in July to prudently get ahead of our 2023 maturities. Our debt balance is up since June but down nearly $1 billion since December. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with cash of $9.7 billion. This is up over $2 billion from year-end and well in excess of the minimum cash required for our business. 
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 14%. This includes about 8 points of Kyndryl contribution, both of our revenue categories, Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing through this quarter. This performance reflects our strong and growing recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual Software revenue. And Software's hybrid cloud revenue is now $9.2 billion over the last year, up 20%. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 8%, including about 1.5 points contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. 
The growth was broad-based. Red Hat revenue all-in grew 18%. As a leader in open source technologies for the enterprise, Red Hat's performance was again fueled by market share gains across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible this quarter. With our enterprise incumbency and global scale, we continue to see an increase in large deals as well as strong cross-sell and upsell across Red Hat solutions. 
Automation revenue grew 3%. This quarter's performance reflects continued adoption in areas like AIOps and management and integration, while we're also wrapping a strong acquisition content from last year. We're bringing innovation to our clients this quarter such as new Instana observability capabilities for zSystems in a hybrid cloud environment. In data and AI, revenue was up 4%. Let me highlight just a few of the growth areas this quarter. Data management fuels advanced analytics. Data fabric helps clients discover and unlock the value of their data wherever it resides, and information exchange enables the timely and secure flow of complex B2B information. And offerings like Envizi and Environmental Intelligence Suite are resonating with clients as they prioritize sustainability efforts. 
Security revenue was up 6%, with growth in both data security and threat management. In data security, we're seeing adoption of Guardium Insights as we continue to deliver new product innovation. Threat management growth was led by Cloud Pak for Security, which helps clients prevent and respond to modern threats across disparate security feeds. Across Hybrid Platform & Solutions, the annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now $13 billion and up 9%. Transaction Processing revenue was up 33%, including about 26 points of Kyndryl contribution. The increase in zSystems' installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and continued strong renewal rates are recognition of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, the transaction processing annuity base is now growing. 
Looking at Software profit, we delivered operating leverage, given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up more than 4 points over last year. Consulting revenue grew 16%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This strong performance was again broad-based with revenue growing at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Over the last year, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.05. Clients trust IBM's deep industry expertise and co-creation approach throughout their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys. 
As IBM Consulting designs and enables enterprise hybrid cloud strategies, this business delivered $8.9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year. That's up 28%. Our Red Hat consulting practice continues to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth, growing strong double digits as we add new engagements. Since IBM acquired Red Hat just over 3 years ago, Consulting has led nearly 1,400 Red Hat engagements with over $6.5 billion in aggregate bookings. Strategic partnerships also contributed to performance, continuing to grow revenue at a double-digit rate. 
Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 14% as clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive, driven by supply chain, finance, data and client experience transformations. Working with our partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe, we help our clients optimize their operations and improve the way they engage with their customers. 
In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 17%. Once again, growth was led by cloud application development and cloud modernization, including our Red Hat practice, which as I mentioned, grew strong double digits. Application operations revenue grew 17%. IBM helps clients optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of clients' applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. We leverage AI to help predict problems before they happen and monitor our clients' different environments with dashboards, enabling action to be taken quickly. 
Moving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin of about 10% is down year-to-year though up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As we've discussed in prior quarters, Consulting is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. Those dynamics continue to put pressure on the margin profile. However, coming out of the third quarter, we are seeing signs of progress. Our utilization rates are improving as we exited the quarter, our acquisitions are scaling and are on a path to margin accretion, and we've seen 2 quarters of price margin improvement year-over-year that will benefit our margin profile going forward. 
Moving to our Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 23%. This includes about 9 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 41% and infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 11 and 7 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. Looking at hybrid infrastructure, z System's revenue nearly doubled, driven by continued adoption of our newest program, z16. This latest program combines embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security. In fact, z16 is the industry's first quantum-safe system, delivering 25 billion encrypted transactions per day for clients. 
And as Arvind mentioned, we just introduced our newest LinuxONE server, a highly scalable Linux and Kubernetes-based platform with capabilities to reduce clients' energy consumption. zSystems remains an enduring platform, playing an important role in a hybrid cloud environment. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 21%. Recent innovation across the portfolio enabled broad-based growth within both storage and power. These include the expansion of our Power10 server family earlier this quarter and refreshes to the flash storage solutions throughout this year. Looking at Infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 1 point year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems. 
Now let me take it back up to the IBM level, and I'll shift the focus to the full year and the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we've continued to invest and make portfolio changes to advance our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, streamline our go-to-market and digitally transform our own operations. Our more focused strategy and portfolio is aligned to client needs. Our revenue performance so far this year demonstrates that. And based on this revenue performance in the first 3 quarters, as Arvind said, we now see constant currency revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model for the year. 
On top of that, Kyndryl sales add about 3.5 points of growth, primarily in the first 3 quarters of the year so it's essentially behind us. U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. And at mid-October spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 7-point headwind to growth for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this impacts profit and free cash flow as well. 
Looking at free cash flow, our other key metric, we continue to expect to generate about $10 billion for the year. That's up over $3 billion from last year. A large part of that growth comes from the wrap on the Kyndryl spin-related and structural payments. But we're also driving working capital efficiency and improving operating profit profile. We expect strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter while we continue to face some external headwinds, including appreciation of the U.S. dollar and exit of our Russia operations. 
In terms of segment performance for 2022, our view of Software has been consistent all year. We continue to expect revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. And we still see Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. Our IBM Consulting revenue growth has been great, and we're taking our view up to a mid-teens revenue growth rate for the year. While we're still operating in a competitive labor environment, we see some encouraging signs in our Consulting margin profile exiting the third quarter. We now expect a Consulting pretax margin for the year at the low end of our previous 9% to 10% range, which is up about 1 point year-to-year. 
Our Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. With the strong launch of our z16 earlier this year, Infrastructure revenue performance will be above the model level for the year, and that's before the 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We expect Infrastructure pretax margin in the mid-teens. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, we expect all-in constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. At current spot rates, currency translation has increased to an 8- to 9-point headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That's up 2 to 3 points from 90 days ago. And then I'll remind you, in a couple of weeks, we'll reach the anniversary of our separation of Kyndryl. While the external sales to Kyndryl will remain in our revenue and profit base, we've essentially wrapped around the year-to-year contribution to our revenue and profit growth and margin expansion. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out our first calendar year of today's IBM. As always, we'll provide a view of 2023 during our fourth quarter earnings report in January. Patricia, now let's go on to the Q&A.",2252

I guess, Arvind, maybe the question is for you, but there's a lot of anxiety, I think, among investors in the markets in terms of what the macro situation is and what it means for IT spending going forward. I'd love to get your perspective. What are you hearing from your customers as they think about their IT budgets going forward? How does that look? And are they focusing on different things going forward versus what they've done historically from an IBM's portfolio perspective? Would love to just get a sense on what are you hearing from your customers in aggregate. And then if you could even -- how does Consulting shake up in a more challenging macro environment, it will be really helpful because the growth rate so far there has been well above the long-term trends.",152

Amit, thank you. Thank you both for the comment and those questions. So let me answer the first part, how do we feel about revenue and demand going forward? First, if you just look at the data going backwards, we see pretty strong demand and we saw double-digit growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Asia and double-digit growth in the Americas. 
But let me add some color on that as we look forward. And it is with a couple of contextual elements, as you said, on your portfolio. One, we are B2B. We have almost no B2C business, as if almost no, I could say none, but there is the weather business which has got a little bit of element of B2C in it, but it's tiny. So one is B2B. 
Second, we've done a lot of work over the last 3 years, and our portfolio is largely in mission-critical areas, areas that are around automation, areas that are about leveraging AI for enterprise productivity. And I think that, that productivity theme is going to play out over actually not just this remaining part of this year but for the next half decade, maybe the full decade. 
Color. In the Americas, I find a very robust business environment. I find that most enterprises want to invest. They are leveraging technology to scale their business. If I go to Asia, it's very similar. Very little change from the past, I think going into the next few months, at least. In Europe, I think we shouldn't put our head in the sand. I think that with the mixture of energy and inflation, you can sense that there is some caution creeping into the conversations, albeit not in the data and not yet in what we are doing as business there. But we'd be foolish not to prepare that there could be a bit of a downturn in Europe only. 
But let me now put all of that back into context. So you're saying Americas, Asia, fine. If I get to Europe, Western Europe, ballpark 20% of global GDP. Even if you have a massive impact, 5% to 10%, that's a 1% to 2% impact on a global level all-in. Technology is typically 3% to 4% ahead of GDP growth. That says there's still a robust technology environment in there. So I think, Amit, that's the sort of the 2 parts of your question that we're addressing with that.",407

And I'm wondering whether you saw some strong ELAs in the quarter and maybe you could put that in context in terms of what ELA percentage was in Transaction Processing. And then separately, Arvind, given how strong the cycle is and given your comments about Europe, are you still comfortable about delivering mid-single-digit growth in 2023?",83
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033377.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,10,"Okay. Toni, this is Jim. I'll take the first part of the question. Arvind can wrap up about our portfolio and the confidence we have in positioning 2023. When you take a look at our third quarter performance, we're obviously very pleased with the entire IBM team and what we've been able to execute, continuing to instantiate the value of today's IBM, which is a very focused hybrid cloud and AI platform company.
But let's dial back 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we said all in, we were going to be at high single-digit revenue growth, and we were going to generate about 200 basis points of operating leverage. When you now play that picture of what played out in the third quarter, we are capitalizing on that focused IBM hybrid cloud AI strategy and capitalizing on the accelerated demand from our clients that Arvind talked about up front. And we're getting revenue dollar contribution that is falling to the bottom line. With regards to profit, our profit's up 23%. 
Now with that said, when you look at the profile of the contribution, it was very pervasive and broad-based. It was double-digit growth across all 3 of our major segments and double-digit growth across all of our markets around the world. And within that, Software contributed about 3 points of growth ex Red Hat to IBM, Consulting delivered about 5 points of growth, and Infrastructure delivered about 3 points of growth to IBM. 
And within Infrastructure, to your question on mainframe, mainframe basically came in about exactly what we guided to 90 days ago. Remember, we talked about at length the first time in 20 years that we announced a mainframe, new innovation in a second quarter and how it was going to change the seasonality of that business. And we had a very strong second quarter, which by the way, we took up revenue guidance in April 4. We talked about 90 days ago how third quarter was going to play out and fourth quarter, and we pretty much executed to that. So we feel pretty good about our book of business. So Arvind, turning over to you.",360
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033378.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,11,"Yes. Thanks, Jim. So turning to sort of address the questions. Last October, we talked about that we are going to be in a mid-single-digit revenue growth model, and that we'll be increasing cash flow each year. And we have set out a target of $10 billion for this year and $35 billion over the period. There is nothing that we see right now to alter us from where we had said at that time. So I'm going to say that those projections stay in place.
As Jim pointed out, for 2022, we are saying that we will be above our revenue model. And that, we believe, will play out with the demand that you heard me talk about and then Jim just reinforced. Just a little thought, the third quarter is not typically a big ELA quarter, so we should just be -- it's kind of the normal seasonality. ELAs are really second and fourth, much more than first and third. 
So just to give you a little bit of color and add to what you asked and what Jim said, mainframe hardware has had a strong start, so you would expect the capacity increases. As the capacity increases, you expect that to follow with a tiny lag, sometimes a month, sometimes 3 months into our Transaction Processing portfolio. And that's why you kind of see the strength there.",230

Arvind, can you talk about what you're seeing in the more transactional parts of the business in the context of particularly Q4, which is your largest transactional quarter? Any change in pipeline or conversion rates of that pipeline? Any color there would be helpful. And if I could, maybe, Jim, on the cumulative free cash flow that you guys just endorsed. How should we think about the step-up in cash flow? And what would be the key drivers of that outside of the top line growth conversion? What are the other moving pieces that would help in bridging that gap?",105
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033381.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,14,"So Wamsi, let me start and then give it to Jim, but I'm also going to reinforce a couple of points that Jim made in his prepared remarks. On transactional business, look, I can't speak to the yield. I can speak to the yield about 10 weeks from now. The yield will come in over the next 10 weeks as opposed to right now.
If I look at our pipeline, pipeline indicates the strength that we are seeing. That does give us confidence to say that we see revenue coming in above our mid-single-digit growth model. We see the pipelines are strong across software and hardware. So the very strong hardware growth in the third quarter that is captured in the Infrastructure business, I think that all reflects the demand that is there and across geographies, so not any particular single market being strong. 
If I look at the software, I expect that the overall growth will remain strong, but there'll be some puts and takes in a couple of small countries that's possible. But that is the advantage of having a business that goes across 170 countries where that tends to get absorbed into the overall. Right now, I'll tell you, good pipeline. Based on the first 9 months of the year, we expect yields to remain good or even better than before, and that's the space. 
And I'll just make a comment. I would like to say, as Jim pointed out in his prepared remarks, that there is an impact on FX. That is probably the biggest impact to what we are seeing right now. I certainly, I'll say, hope that we are seeing the end of the dollar strengthening as opposed to another significant change.",288

So Wamsi, to that point, as you know, our 2 key measures of success since Arvind has taken over as Chairman and CEO has been revenue growth profile, converting this portfolio into a sustainable growth orientation; and second, free cash flow generation, so we can have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business. And on that, we said maintaining guidance of about $10 billion. 
I'll remind everyone, that $10 billion is up over $3 billion year-to-year, first. And it's up $2 billion from what we published as IBM's post-separation baseline when you normalize out all the Kyndryl-related activity. So as we spoke about and Arvind just kind of concluded before he turned it over to me, 90 days ago, this takes into account the external headwinds we've been talking about this year: one, being the orderly wind down and the exit of our Russia business, which we've already taken into account and we've been transforming our business and cost structure to take into account losing that high-value profit and cash; and second is the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Now the latter, let's be honest, it definitely puts pressure on our midterm outlook. But we're 3 quarters into that midterm outlook right now. We do have a robust hedging program as we are not immune. I mean, we do business in 170 countries around the world, over 100 currencies. As we talked about 90 days ago, we do not hedge 100% of our currencies. And second, we don't hedge out more than 12 months, very important point. So currency is a real impact to profit and cash overall. 
Now we hedge to provide us time to take the operational actions. That's price, that's sourcing strategies, that's cost structure and the productivity initiatives that Arvind and I have put within the business. So right now, it's early in this midterm outlook. We've got a headwind on the U.S. dollar until it stabilizes. We are taking the appropriate actions. But let's be honest, we are all focused on completing 2022.
We have a very big fourth quarter in front of us. We've got to do roughly $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's about 60% of our free cash flow. By the way, to put that in perspective, from 2017 to 2020, we did at or better than $6 billion of free cash flow. So we've got the right portfolio, we've got the right set of operational actions and that's what we're focused on. Where are we going to get that headwind/tailwind? 
One, we completed our structural action, so that's all behind us, and we'll continue to get the Kyndryl tailwind for the next 3 months. Second, we expect a very solid working capital quarter with regards to the mainframe cycle and the pure volume dynamics of what's happening with our accelerated revenue growth profile. And third, we're going to continue driving a higher revenue profile, get operating cash out of that by driving operating leverage in our business.

I wanted to talk about the Consulting business. I thought margins held up better than expected in the quarter. So can you maybe just elaborate on where you found success repricing contracts, where you've maybe had some challenges, either by end market or by geography? Are those pricing increases keeping pace with dollar strength? Would love if you could just double-click on some of the pricing actions and the success that you're having and where and why and how.",86

Erik, thank you very much. I appreciate the question and I appreciate the compliments, and I'm sure the entire IBM team has worked extremely hard. Pleased with this quarter. But let's talk about Consulting. We talked all year long. Remember, you dialed back to January. We were talking about what we were seeing in the marketplace about an accelerating demand profile driven by our clients' digital transformations journey to cloud and that we were going to invest up front and get ahead of that demand profile, both in skills, capabilities, ecosystems, acquisitions. 
Why? Because Consulting plays an integral part to our hybrid cloud thesis. It is that tip of the spear. It drives the multiplier effect. It drags the scale and adoption to our hybrid cloud platform and it pulls our IBM technology. Now with that said, when you look at it, that investment profile, coupled with a highly inflationary environment, we've seen pressure on our gross margin level throughout the year. But we've been making that up on an operating pretax margin because Consulting, along with our Infrastructure and Software, are yielding the benefits of a much more focused streamlined G&A structure now post-separation of Kyndryl, and a much more effective and aligned streamlined go-to-market model that's playing out. 
But when you look at it, 3Q year-to-date, our revenue profile is growing high teens. We're getting dollar contribution and we're seeing 3Q year-to-date about 30 basis points' worth of margin. Now as I said in the prepared remarks, we talked about 3 core actions throughout the year: acquisitions, utilization, price. And around those, we saw green shoots exiting third quarter. Our acquisitions right now, we're on a steady state where they're going to be margin accretive in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we exited the quarter in a pretty challenging seasonal quarter of a third quarter with higher utilization. That's a great sign. And third, for the second quarter in a row, we got price optimization and price margins that are up. That has led to our sequential improvement in margins from 2Q to 3Q by 3 points, and by the way, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter, margins up sequentially and year-to-year. 
And that price optimization really, as you would expect, always translates back into the value proposition of your offerings. Where we have value in application modernization, Red Hat, our hyperscaler and strategic partnerships, we're seeing a nice margin accretion that's playing out, and that's going to fuel the fourth quarter here and first half of 2023.",423

How are you thinking about maybe a larger acquisition? It's been a while since obviously with Red Hat. And almost more importantly, I'm wondering, as you think about your capital allocation, and I know you committed to what you -- the $10 billion for this year, but how do you -- how does the higher interest rate environment play into how you're thinking about what you might do and how you expect your balance sheet to look on a longer-term basis.",100
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033388.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,21,"Shannon, let me start by this thing. First, let me explain our rationale and our principles for acquisitions because it's important to understand that it's not so much size. Number one, they've got to fit our strategy, our strategy being hybrid cloud and AI, and in Consulting, those which add to our ecosystem growth and our talent. So that limits the universe of what we would look at. 
Two, especially if it's going to be larger, it's got to be accretive. Whether we talk about at the end of the first year or definitely in the second year, it's got to be accretive to cash flow. Three, there's got to be synergy with IBM. Like Jim mentioned about the $6 billion in inception-to-date signings and the 1,400 projects that Consulting did with Red Hat, that's synergy, meaning that we would not have gotten that revenue and that book of business if we had not done that acquisition. 
So then if I say that those are criteria, those will be a criteria that would open up if there is something that is larger, with the correct valuation and the correct economic returns for the company. Now to your point on interest rates. Certainly, interest rates have an impact, but we'd also like to say there are multiple vehicles on how to raise cash because the overall FINFLEX, and we had talked about, about $20 billion of FINFLEX over the period, but there are other vehicles for also raising cash when we are an attractive target for the acquisition to come into.

No, I would just add to the last point on the interest rate environment. Shannon, as you saw during this year, we've been prudent, I think, in hindsight now. It's always better to be lucky and opportunistic because we went out to the market and basically have pre-funded all of our requirements, for the most part, in 2023 already. We issued $4 billion of debt in February. And just recently in July, we issued $3.25 billion worth of debt. So we feel pretty good about our capital structure. 2023 is pretty much taken care of, which is our largest maturity tower when you think about $6.4 billion and then it steps down from there in 2024 and 2025. So we feel pretty good about that.",126

Jim, I just wanted to see if you could provide a clarification. What was the M&A contribution this quarter? And if you could give any distinction on the M&A contribution to Software. And then my broader question is -- relates to going back to services. The signings was down about 2% in constant currency for the quarter. How do you anticipate signings unfolding? And what does that portend for next year's growth, particularly as we look at a bumpier economy, particularly in Europe? 
And so Arvind, you mentioned that you're affirming the mid-single-digit total revenue growth. But if you could just talk a little bit about the services business, in particular, which I think is -- perhaps has a bit more risk associated with some of the Consulting activities in a tougher economic climate.",142
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033392.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,25,"Keith, I'll take the front end of this, and then Arvind can talk about the environment and our services portfolio overall. Really getting right to it, our inorganic contribution in the quarter to IBM was about 1 point worth of growth overall. When you take a look at that, we grew 6.5 at actual rates, roughly 15% at constant currency, 5 points of that being Kyndryl year-to-year contribution, so read that, about 10 points worth of growth. One point of that came out of acquisitions. 
Underneath that, it's still about 2 points in Consulting, which we're seeing nice scale of the Consulting acquisitions. And again, as I said on the previous question, we do see margin accretion as we kind of get to a stabilized level of our acquisition. And to Software basically rounded to 0. It's all organic growth. Software had a very strong quarter, 14% growth at constant currency. About 8 points of that being Kyndryl. That is all organic because we wrapped on our Turbonomic acquisition, which, by the way, still has done extremely well. So the currency, the -- or excuse me, the inorganic component is pretty much on a sustainable basis right now overall. 
Before I turn it over to Arvind, let's just talk a little bit about what we see underneath signings. First of all, we still have, we believe, a solid book-to-bill on a trailing 12 months. It's 1.05. And remember, that's maintaining a book-to-bill in excess of 1 on very strong revenue contribution, 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. And year-to-date, we're up in the high teens overall. 
So what are we seeing underneath? Because I think as I've said many times before, all signings are not alike and they all don't translate to revenue the same way. When we look at our strong demand, it's driven by application modernization, strategic partnerships. By the way, the velocity of our strategic partnership signings are up trailing 12 months, almost 25% to 30%, and it's about 40% of our business now. We're capturing that. 
Red Hat inception to date, $6.6 billion, but it's really the small deal momentum. We're seeing the durations of our backlog come down a couple of months because our small deals, that's the volume-based business for 6 consecutive quarters in a row, we've had double-digit growth. And what does that mean? That has high revenue-yielding contribution end period. And that's what gives us the confidence, when we look at that backlog realization and how it plays out for fourth quarter, for us to commit the low double-digit revenue growth.",429
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033393.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,26,"Yes. Thanks, Jim. So Keith, let me just maybe use the opportunity to remind everybody of what we had talked about as our midterm model, which was sort of the 3-year model that we laid out last October. We had said that we expect Software to grow in mid-single digits, so think 4% to 6%. And we had said Consulting to grow in high single digits, and we had said that Infrastructure will be about flat. This year will be a good year because of the product cycle and then probably somewhere in late '23 or '24, we'll get the flip side of that, up from this year.
So then you get into Consulting, our long-term model was not in the teens, which it has done this year. It was in the high single digits. So the book-to-bill, combined with the shorter-term signings, gives us confidence that we will be able to maintain that model. Look, I think Consulting to the point, I think you're all trying to ask, the nature of our Consulting business is very different than some others. The bulk of our Consulting business is in digital transformation, helping our clients move to cloud, not just our cloud, but AWS and Azure amongst it. 
It's on properties that I think are fairly essential to our clients. SAP, CRM, Adobe are great examples. As you begin to wrap around, help them move to cloud, both public and hybrid, help them do digital transformation, help them take advantage of these massive productivity SaaS properties that I just named. Even in an inflationary environment, even when the economy is not doing well, these tend to be the projects that stay the course, but maybe the signings come in smaller chunks, and as long as we deliver well, then people tend to sign up more and more going forward. And that's sort of a bit of color on what we're seeing play out already this year and we expect that to maybe increase next year.",334

And Jim, you've done a very good job of summarizing how you're going to get to that $10 billion of free cash flow for the year. I was wondering if I could just follow 1 thing up there though. Last quarter, I think you talked about $500 million to $700 million of structural actions, I think, in the 2022 free cash flow guide, if I'm remembering right, which should not reoccur. And I think we need to add to that the exit from Russia and FX, which I think you highlighted both. However, any chance you could help to mention those last 2 items so we could get just a better baseline going into next year?",126
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2022",2022-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3807.0,2659290.0,100033397.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,30,"Yes, David, thank you, and thanks for the compliments. Really goes out to the entire IBM team overall. When you take a look at our free cash flow posture, one, I think we have quantified back in, earlier this year in April, about our Russia business. Orderly wind down, right decision, unfortunate humanitarian crisis that continues right now. But that was about a $300 million revenue profile and about a $200 million profit and cash profile overall.
As I said, yes, that's been an impact this year, which is one of the reasons why we went down to about $10 billion as we stated. But again, we've been taking -- knowing that decision, we've been taking the right operational actions to drive the productivity knowing that '23 and '24, we won't have that. So that's point number one. 
Point number two, the structural actions, yes, north of $500 million. It's behind us this year. Remember, that becomes a tailwind in 2023 and 2024. That's why I've said multiple times before, free cash flow is not going to be linear when we look at 2022, 2023, 2024. One, we will have the wrap on that in '23, plus second, the exit cost of getting rid of that stranded cost, you get ROI on that activity overall. 
The big wildcard, if you want to use it, is what's going to happen to the U.S. dollar. Now you see what's happened to us this year. This year, third quarter, let's put it in perspective. As I said, a little over 8-point gap between constant currency and actual rates, as you've seen in our backup charts, it's about a $1.1 billion revenue. By the way, that's about a $0.15 profit and EPS impact in the quarter that we've had to overcome operationally. 
Now that, again, will continue to the extent the U.S. dollar doesn't devalue over time. We are taking the appropriate measures. We're running our scenario models. We're stress-testing our business. We've got a long path into '23 and '24, but it's going to come from the actions I talked about: price, sourcing and cost structure. Each of those pieces are going to have to overcome that. And the beauty of our hedging program is it buys us time to smooth out the volatility of earnings right now. So we are focused on that. We'll talk a lot more about where we see the U.S. dollar 90 days from now and what that means for 2023 cash as we go forward. 
Now one last thing I want to put in place. That fourth quarter cash is very important, that $6 billion, give or take, in us delivering that about $10 billion. That is going to come out predominantly out of our operational profit driven by: one, that revenue growth at the high end of our model all in. By the way, anniversary of Kyndryl, we got 2 more weeks and we anniversary that. That is offset by basically Watson Health. So all-in, high single-digit model is a good representation of today's IBM. 
Second, we expect 2.5 points of operating margin in the fourth quarter. Why is that important? Yes, it's going to deliver that free cash flow in the fourth quarter, but it also gives the investor a perspective now that we're basically anniversary-ing the year-to-year contribution of Kyndryl, you see the healthy operating leverage at this portfolio now that we reposition can deliver. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patricia.",581
