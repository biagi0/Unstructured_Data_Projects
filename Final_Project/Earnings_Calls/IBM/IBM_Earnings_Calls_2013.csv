112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3445.0,404066.0,19062344.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,2,"Thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we improved our year-to-year revenue growth rate, primarily in higher-margin areas, driving significant margin expansion and profit growth. We delivered operating earnings per share of $5.39, which is up 14% year-to-year, and generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we delivered revenue of $104.5 billion and expanded gross, pretax and net margins. Our operating EPS for the year was up 13% to $15.25, and we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow. That's up over $1.5 billion year-to-year. 
Now let me put this full year EPS and cash flow performance in perspective. This is the 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, so a decade at a double-digit pace. And $18.2 billion of free cash flow is $12 billion higher than a decade ago. That's an increase in the cash flow we generate in a year, not a cumulative increase.
Looking at our fourth quarter by segment, our performance was led by continued momentum in our growth initiatives and successful product launches in our high-end systems, both of which drive a more profitable mix. We had another good quarter in software. The performance was broad-based, driven by business analytics, Smarter Commerce and cloud, with strength in several of the emerging areas where we've been targeting our investments, like social business, mobile and security. 
Our new hardware product introductions really performed in the quarter. We had excellent acceptance of our new mainframe and our System z revenue was up 56% year-to-year, so it's been a very successful launch not only in major markets, but in growth markets where we were up 65%. And we had significant growth in our mainframe specialty engines, led by Linux. This is a good indicator not only of new workloads moving on to the platform, but also the value of a vertically integrated system. 
The year-to-year revenue performance in our Total Services business was fairly consistent with last quarter. Once again, we had strength in all of our growth initiatives, which are becoming a larger part of the business.
While IBM's revenue was down 1% at actual rates, it was up 1% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of our Retail Store Solutions business. That's a 2-point improvement from last quarter's constant currency growth rate. Consistent with our business model to move to higher value areas, we had revenue growth in our higher margin businesses. The improving business mix and our productivity initiatives drove 10% growth in operating pretax and net income. 
Now looking at the margin dynamics. We expanded operating gross margins by over 2 points, with improvement across our major segments and a continued mix to software. With our ongoing focus on expense productivity, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.6 points. This quarter, our operating tax rate was flat year-to-year, and we continue to expect an operating effective tax rate in the range of 25% for 2013. Our net income margin was up almost 2 points. And with $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. 
When you pull this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $5.39, which is up 14%. For the year, operating EPS is up 13% to $15.25. Our strong earnings performance drove $9.5 billion of free cash flow, terrific performance for the quarter; and for the year, over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM. 
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand our margins, grow profit, generate cash and deliver shareholder value. And in 2013, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 of operating earnings per share for the year, keeping us on track to our objective of at least $20 in 2015. 
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, Americas revenue was up 1%, led by terrific growth in Latin America. The U.S. revenue was down 1%, a 3-point improvement in the year-to-year growth rate compared to third quarter. Canada was down 9%, off of last year's very strong growth of 13%. EMEA's revenue decline of 3% reflects the macroeconomic climate in the region. It was more challenging this quarter in the U.K. and Germany, but we did see an improvement in Italy. Asia Pacific growth improved to 5%, led by Japan. Early in 2012, we said that we expected our performance in Japan to stabilize in the second half of the year and, in fact, we returned to growth this quarter. So we had great performance from the team in Japan.
Across all of the geographies, our growth markets delivered 7 points of growth, outpacing major markets by 9 points. The BRIC countries delivered 14% growth, the strongest quarter of the year. Brazil contributed to almost 20% growth in Latin America. 
We also had good performance in Africa, led by South Africa and the Middle East. In fact, across all of our growth markets, we had double-digit growth in over 30 growth market countries, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Year-to-year revenue performance in our combined services businesses was fairly consistent with the third quarter. At constant currency, Global Business Services year-to-year performance improved modestly, while Global Technology Services revenue growth slowed a bit. We had good results across our software business, with growth in all of the key brands, and particular strength and share gains in WebSphere, Lotus and Rational. In Systems Technology, we returned to growth adjusting for the divested RSS business. This was driven by powerful performance in System z. 
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margin improved 2.1 points to 52.3%, driven by a combination of the strong mainframe growth, good margin expansion in both services segments and improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. Finally, our Global Financing business delivered over 40% return on equity.
So now let's take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 2%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. The year-to-year benefit from currency translation and hedging moderated this quarter, contributing about a point of expense decline. Consequently, our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was better by 3 points. 
Turning to the expense items that have more significant year-to-year profit impacts, I'll comment on just one item. Our accounts receivable provision was about $20 million in the quarter, an improvement of almost $70 million from last year when we increased the provisions to reflect the European credit environment. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter, there was effectively no period or year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs. 
So now let me get into the segments. In the quarter, the 2 services segments delivered $15 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit 4% and expanded pretax margin by a point. Total backlog was $140 billion, up $1 billion year-to-year at constant currency, driven by growth in the transactional businesses. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets backlog was up 15% at constant currency. 
For the year, the combined services business grew profit 10% and expanded margin by nearly 2 points, excluding workforce rebalancing charges in the third quarter. 
Turning to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.3 billion, down 2% as reported and flat at constant currency. There were 2 major categories within the major markets that affected revenue growth. First, we did a tremendous amount of work to address a number of low-margin contracts to improve the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio. We see the benefits of that work in our profit and our margin performance, though it does have some impact on revenue. This quarter, the impact was a point of revenue growth to GTS and to services in total. Second, we saw a decline in revenue from sales and volumes into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economically sensitive. 
You can see the impact of these in our GTS outsourcing revenue, which was down 2% at constant currency. In outsourcing, we continue to have strong performance in growth markets, with revenue up 8% and backlog up 9%, both at constant currency. This backlog growth reflects an ongoing trend as our clients are building out their infrastructures and scaling to meet the growth objectives of their businesses. 
In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 3% at constant currency, with the growth markets up double digits at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered 5% pretax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pretax margin by over a point. This quarter, margin expansion resulted from increased efficiency and productivity from our focus on automation and processes, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, which is down 3% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets turned in solid performance, and the recovery in Japan continued as they grew for the second consecutive quarter.
Looking at the GBS businesses by offering, the growth initiatives continue to drive strong performance. We had solid double-digit growth in business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. And for the year, these initiatives now represent over 1/3 of our total GBS revenue. 
So as we retool the GBS business and mix to higher value work, these larger, more complex engagements are having a positive effect on GBS backlog. In fact, GBS backlog has now grown for the fourth consecutive year at constant currency, though mixing to longer duration engagements. And as I stated last quarter, we've been taking actions to address the more traditional packaged application work. We've added partners to this base and have increased sales capability. We've targeted and closed large transformation opportunities in the growth markets, and we've already seen some success in building the backlog in those areas this quarter. 
Turning to profit. GBS pretax income was flat year-to-year, and pretax margin expanded 0.5 point. Improved utilization and service delivery helped to overcome the impact from revenue. 
For total services, we are providing you with additional detail around the projected total services revenue run-out from backlog in 2013. This includes the impact to revenue from the work we've done to restructure a number of lower margin contracts in our outsourcing business, primarily in the U.S. Now keep in mind, the revenue generated from backlog is approximately 70% of total revenue in any year, with the remainder coming from transactional signings in the year and sales and volumes in our existing client base. 
In 2013, the projected revenue generated from backlog is up 1%. This includes 2% growth from the backlog and a 1% hurt from those restructured contracts. But despite the impact to revenue growth, these restructured contracts have lifted the profitability of the portfolio. They provide substantial year-to-year gross profit improvement in 2012, which carries through to 2013 and will contribute modest profit growth in 2013 off this higher profit base.
So for Total Services, as we enter 2013, we will continue to drive our key plays and shift towards higher value content. We'll continue to invest in the growth markets, which now represent over 20% of Total Services revenue and is where we see the most opportunity for growth. We'll continue to be aggressive in transforming our portfolio to higher value content and away from the more commoditizing labor-based content. 
Our profit and margin performance will continue to benefit from the work we're doing with research and software to infuse more and more IP into our offerings. In addition, services is the primary beneficiary of our focus on enterprise productivity. Overall, we think we have a good set of opportunities to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion in 2013. 
Software revenue of $7.9 billion was up 3% or 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware grew 6% at constant currency and gained share as we continue to be the clear leader in the middleware market. We had continued momentum in our growth initiatives, with strong performance in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and cloud. These initiatives cross all of our software brands. 
Our results reflect the sustained investments in our strategic branded software. In addition to our organic investments, acquisitions provided additional capabilities while leveraging the existing portfolio of offerings. For example, in the first quarter of 2012, we acquired Worklight, a provider of mobile software, which enables enterprises to manage and secure mobile applications. Worklight is now an important addition to our mobile strategy and has accelerated from $1 million-a-year business, when it was acquired, to generating tens of millions for the year. Worklight is just one example of our ability to leverage and grow acquired businesses. Looking across our software portfolio, we grew the pre-IBM transactional revenue of our 2012 acquisitions by nearly 5x. 
Now let me take you through the revenue drivers from a brand perspective. WebSphere grew 11% and continued to gain share. We continued to expand our portfolio to capture the emerging opportunity around mobile computing and saw a significant uplift in some of our core WebSphere offerings, such as application servers and commerce. As a result, we're well positioned to continue to help enterprises build, connect, run and manage their mobile applications. 
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. We had strong performance, in Information Integration and predictive analytics, both driven by Big Data. Tivoli software was up 5% at constant currency and held share. Performance was led by our storage and our security offerings. 
Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 13% at constant currency, reflecting the value of storage software. Tivoli security was up 16% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs, which provides next-generation security intelligence. 
We continue to transform the Lotus portfolio to the faster-growing social business offerings. And consequently, we had 9% growth in Lotus revenue, gained share and had a great quarter. This is driven by strong performance from our existing social business offerings and the recent acquisition of Kenexa, which we closed in December. Kenexa, a leading provider of recruiting and talent management solutions, helps clients create a more efficient and effective workforce and brings a unique combination of cloud-based technology and consulting services to an already extensive portfolio of social business solutions. 
Rational posted double-digit growth of 12% and gained share. Software had a solid quarter, with revenue up 4% at constant currency, pretax income up 8% and pretax margins up 2.4 points. The fourth quarter rounds out another good year for our software business.
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $5.8 billion, up 4%, adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions. This performance was driven by our new mainframe and momentum in PureSystems, our expert integrated system. In fact, in its introductory year, we have already sold more than 2,300 PureSystems in more than 70 countries. 
System z revenue grew 56%, driven by our first full quarter of our new mainframe. MIPS grew 66% year-to-year. This was the largest quarter of MIPS shipments in history. About half of these MIPS were specialty engines, which were up 80% year-to-year, driven by Linux workloads, a good indicator of new workloads moving to the platform. 
Growth in z was up 50% in the major markets and up over 65% in the growth markets. In the growth markets, we had strong sales to our established, as well as new mainframe customers. This performance reflects the technology leadership and value of our vertically integrated stack that IBM's new flagship server is delivering to our customers. It is simply the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date. 
Turning to POWER, while revenue was down 19%, our new P7+ midrange and high-end POWER servers performed well. We will continue the refresh of the POWER portfolio in the first half of 2013. Our success in competitive takeouts continued in the fourth quarter. We had over 350 competitive displacements, resulting in over $335 million of business, about half of which came from Oracle/Sun and half from HP. For the year, we had nearly 1,200 competitive displacements, resulting in over $1 billion of business. 
Our storage hardware revenue was down 5%, driven by tape. Disk was flat. Within disk, we announced the new high-end DS8870 in October and it was sold out in the quarter. This will continue to ramp in the first quarter. 
Our Systems and Technology pretax income was up 23% year-to-year, driven by new product introductions in mainframe, POWER, storage and, of course, PureSystems. 
Across all of our segments, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. These are not stand-alone offerings but integrated into our client offerings and included within our segment results. 
In the growth markets, our revenue was up 7% at constant currency, and these countries now represent 24% of IBM's geographic revenue. That's up 8 points since 2006 when we introduced our 2010 roadmap. So we've been very successful in capturing the opportunity in these faster growing markets. We're doing this by continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. 
To drive market expansion in 2012, we accelerated our opening of new branch offices. This year, we doubled the number of face-to-face branches, bringing the total number of face-to-face and virtual branches in the growth markets to almost 450, so this is tremendous growth.
Our business analytics initiative continues to expand, allowing clients to make informed decisions everywhere in their organization, to improve outcomes and to manage risk. We made significant strides and expanded our leadership position in a number of strategic areas, including risk management, price and promotion optimization and sales performance management, just to name a few. Our value proposition in business analytics uniquely leverages the integration between our software portfolio and GBS consulting expertise. This year, business analytics grew 13%, led by our GBS consulting practice. 
Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. We've seen continued strong demand for our foundational offerings in hardware and software that help companies build and run their private clouds, as well as for cloud-based solutions like our SaaS offerings. With strong global growth, our cloud revenue for the year was up 80%. In 2012, we launched our family of PureSystems expert integrated systems, as well as our SmartCloud enterprise-plus public and managed private cloud offerings for large enterprises. These offerings further extend our cloud capabilities.
We saw tremendous expansion of our Smarter Planet growth initiative over the last 12 months, measured in terms of offerings, markets, customers and revenue. Our clients are leveraging our growing capabilities in areas like Smarter Commerce, where acquisitions, such as Emptoris, DemandTec and Tealeaf, helped fuel growth in new market segments; Social Business, where industry-leading social platform and Kenexa come together in a powerful combination to allow our clients to engage a smarter, more effective workforce; Smarter Cities, which includes a portfolio of solutions ranging from public safety to social services to intelligent water systems; and finally, our next-generation analytics systems like Watson, which are helping tackle some of the most complex challenges facing our customers. For the year, our Smarter Planet solutions generated more than 25% revenue growth. 
When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half our revenue is software. So as these offerings become larger parts of the IBM business, they're driving a higher quality revenue stream, improving our mix and our margin. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up almost $600 million year-to-year. In line with past years, about half of our annual cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.6 billion over last year. 
Within our strong free cash flow performance, our capital investments are up by almost $250 million. The year-to-year improvement in free cash flow reflects our growth in net income, and as you'll recall, the fact that our 2011 cash flow was impacted by income tax payments for audit settlement activity in the first quarter of last year. 
When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we continued to return significant value to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends, and we bought back 61 million shares for $12 billion. Net of the cash received from options and employee stock-related transactions, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $10.5 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In addition, we spent $3.7 billion to acquire 11 companies. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Kenexa. Over the course of the year, we acquired DemandTec, Emptoris, Platform Computing, Tealeaf and Texas Memory Systems, to name a few, to add to our capabilities and analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. We also acquired Vivisimo, which expands the breadth of IBM's Big Data capabilities and creates the most complete end-to-end Big Data solution for our clients. Over the last 3 years, we've spent $11.5 billion for acquisitions. 
To wrap up the cash dynamics for the year, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow and spent $18 billion on acquisitions, net share repurchase and dividends. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $33.3 billion, of which $24.5 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.8 billion, down $1.6 billion for the third quarter and up $800 million from a year ago. 
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market conditions in 2012, we had good returns on global assets, exceeding our expected return on assets in the U.S. and on a global basis. But the discount rate environment remained challenging, resulting in a $5 billion impact to equity at the end of the year due to the pension liability remeasurement. As a result, our debt to cap ended the year at 36%, up 4 points year-to-year, including a 6-point impact from the pension remeasurement. 
At the end of 2012, our defined benefit-qualified plans continued to be well funded, and our cash requirements remain stable. We have included supplemental charts to cover ongoing dynamics in our pension plans. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility.
So now let me wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our total revenue performance had little impact on our profit growth, but we did have good revenue growth in our higher margin areas, which significantly contributed to margin expansion and profit growth. You see this in our margin expansion, which was the largest contributor, driving $0.47 of EPS growth through a combination of gross margin improvements and expense productivity. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.24. Bottom line, we delivered 14% EPS growth in the quarter and 13% for the year. As you can see, the profile for the full year is very similar to the fourth quarter. 
Our results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustained basis. In 2012, we continued to deliver value to our clients and capitalize on key trends. We had strong performance in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet, key initiatives that leverage our software portfolio and contribute to our margin expansion. We continued to expand our capabilities and build-out infrastructures in emerging markets. This year, our growth markets revenue outpaced major markets by 8 points. 
We continued to invest for innovation. Our investments supported the introduction of our new System z mainframe, our PureSystems offerings and our new storage and POWER7+ products. And we just were named #1 in U.S. patents for the 20th consecutive year, with many of the patents issued this year in key areas like analytics and Big Data, cybersecurity, cloud, mobile, social networking and software-defined environments. 
We invested almost $4 billion in 2012 to acquire 11 companies, adding significant capabilities to support our growth initiatives. At the same time, we divested our Retail Store Solutions business as we focused our Smarter Commerce portfolio on the higher value IP-based opportunities. 
So as you can see, in 2012, we continued the transformation of the business, shifting to higher value areas and improving our structure. This results in a higher quality revenue stream. So while our overall revenue performance was modest, we had 8% growth in our operating net income and expanded net income margin by 1.6 points, well above our model level. And we delivered operating EPS growth of 13% for a decade of double-digit EPS growth; and over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM. This demonstrates the flexibility of the IBM business model.
In 2013, we'll continue this transformation. We'll acquire key capabilities, divest of businesses, rebalance our workforce and invest in innovation. Bottom line, we're continuing to retool our skills and our offerings to shift to higher value and meet our clients' needs. We've taken all of this into account in our view of 2013. We expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year, with the first half growth rate slightly higher than the second. And now, 2 years into our 2015 roadmap, we are well on track to our objective of at least $20 of operating earnings per share.

Really, if you look at the monthly performance across the quarter, it was really pretty constant. We saw good performance through the quarter. Obviously, within that, we feel very, very good about the performance we saw in our software business with Key Branded Middleware, up 6%; a breakout performance from our z series content, revenue up 56% within that. The growth market is up, I think, a spectacular 65%. MIPS up 66%, the biggest MIPS performance in the history of the IBM Corporation. And so ongoing contribution from our base businesses. And with all that to generate half our free cash flow in the quarter and a total of $18.2 billion, the largest ever, up $1.6 billion year-to-year. I think that was just a very, very strong quarter. But if you look at the -- across the months, it was fairly constant month-to-month.",146

The reason that I ask is, I think on the fourth quarter call last year, you talked about getting about 3 points of revenue growth from your backlog-driven businesses and you ended up with services at constant currency about flat this year, suggesting that non-backlog revenue growth was down about 6% in the year. So if you're looking at backlog revenue growth or revenue from backlog only growing about 1% this year and, again, you struggled and had weak current period revenue growth this year, why shouldn't we be thinking about revenue growth being down in 2013 in the services business overall?",118
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3445.0,404066.0,19062351.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Yes, sir. So very good question. Let's start by looking at our GBS business. So the GBS business, if you look at the backlog over the last 4 years, they've actually been growing that backlog each year as they move into 2013. Now within that, as we explained in our third quarter call dynamics, you see a retooling, if you will, or a mix shift into these higher value initiatives that are so important to the IBM Corporation because those growth initiatives drive about 50% software in their mix. And so they have very high profit for the corporation. But if you look at that retooling from the GBS perspective, they tend to be longer duration. And so as we look at that duration and 4 years of backlog growth, both transactional and in total for GBS, we feel that as we enter 2013, GBS should once again return to revenue growth. If you look at the point that you had made on backlog run out, we included that very discrete chart for the following reason. If you look at the backlog content moving into the year, we were impacted to some degree by the contracts that we restructured as we went through the end of 2011 to 2012. And that magnitude was about a point. Now that's the point on revenue. How did that perform on a gross profit basis? The fact is it was a substantial improvement in our gross profit dollars in 2012. We had a lot of growth in our GTS business driven by that. But that improvement in gross profit dollars, in a sense, Toni, it raises the waterline and continues into 2013. And that's a very big point, that improvement that we saw across those contracts. Because we maintain about 80% of the revenue within those contracts, generally drove a much higher level of gross profit dollars in the ongoing base that we'll enjoy this year. And in fact, we'll see some modest improvement in the year-to-year gross profit dollars from those contracts moving into next year. So net-net, the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog are much stronger because of that, so we expect the overall performance of gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog to be more typical of, say, a 2% backlog growth or necessarily a 1%. It had 2% very close to the dynamic we saw last year. And with that dynamic, the services businesses did a good job of driving to the model. And I think the last point that I would make in this rollout, we had about $3 billion worth of very strong contracts roll out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We've already closed $1 billion of this. And if you look at the complexion of those contracts, they come in the -- many of them in the growth markets where we're having real success on that operation deliverable. And the value-add that we're showing our customer base, you see it reflected really in the backlog in our growth markets, which for Total Services base, that backlog is up 15%. So really strong performance on that basis. You put all that together, we feel very confident as we go into 2013, that the profit generation from our services business in total should meet our model expectations. And frankly, if you look at the first quarter 2013, we think that the services business are to generate double-digit profit growth.",577

Your tone sounds a lot better than 3 months ago. You've grown EPS over the last 3 years in the mid-teens, maybe 14% average or so and 13.5% this year. And in order to make the roadmap, all you have to do is grow 9.5% the next 3 years to get there, so that would be slower than you've been doing. Can you talk about your confidence and overachievement and maybe preview some of the tone and what you may say at your Analyst Day coming up soon?",99
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3445.0,404066.0,19062354.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,12,"Sure. Well, I think when you look at it, that at least number for 2013 at $16.70, I would have said that -- Ben, that rounds to 10%. But at any rate, at $16.70, that's the at least number for the beginning of the year. And I think if you look at that relative position, that's pretty consistent with what we said at the last couple of years. Additionally, I'd point out, when you look at the generation of value from the corporation, I think it's worth stepping back and just recognizing that the performance that we saw in 2012 was, in fact, the 10th year of double-digit EPS growth out of this place. That is a pretty big number. So underneath that, to drive that, we've driven this business to big growth opportunities in the high value, higher margin spaces. Stepping back again, you think about since 2010, alone, we've invested $19 billion in R&D, $12 billion in 34 acquisitions. If you look at the enterprise productivity initiatives that we're driving for $8 billion over the roadmap, fully about 60% of that is driven to reinvest in growth initiatives like GMUs, Smarter Planet, cloud and business analytics. So from my perspective, to drive that level of performance, we are plowing investments hand over fist back into the business. Now what are the results? Are we seeing this? Well, let's look at software. Since 2000, software has gone from $2.4 billion annually; 2012, we did $4 billion in the fourth quarter alone and $11 billion for the year. Free cash flow, that $18.2 billion that we talked about it, 2000 was $6.7 million. And at fourth quarter '12, we had the largest MIPS shipment in the history of the corporation, with our GMU content going from 16% of our business mix to 24% since the 2006 initiation of the business model. So I think, as we look forward, those growth initiatives, the effects that they're having, their ability to continue to move that higher value content and continue that growth, gives us a lot of confidence not only in what we'd see in 2013, but the remaining roadmap to 2015.",360

I guess the 19% decline, I was a little surprised at, particularly since you had indicated you had a new high-end product. Is the UNIX business finally kind of turning over like everybody else's? And I was also curious, how much of your PureSystems -- what's sort of the hardware breakout there, x86 versus POWER?",60

And you've seen that in the performance that we've generated in this fourth quarter. Frankly, in a POWER systems announcement, many of those volumes go to our customers in product test evaluations before that customer goes to volume shipment. And so generally in a POWER announcement, volume shipment, especially for a midrange and high-end, which we had in our announcement, that will lag by a couple of quarters. So I wouldn't really expect to see the volume shipment against those announcements until we get into the second quarter of 2013. Now with that, POWER once again had a very strong competitive replacement during the 30 customers, over $300 million, and if you look at mix, about half from HP and half from Oracle/Sun. So -- but the effect of that overall volume shipment really we'll see about the second quarter 2013.",184

Obviously, the focus on margin impacts revenue growth. So how should we really think about this trade-off as we go forward through the roadmap. As revenue growth accelerates, should we prepare it for margin expansion to moderate even though we're getting some benefit from mix?",57

First of all, let's look at the operational model-driven plays to drive margin. And if you look at our -- maybe one way to look at it, let's look at the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter PTI margin expanded by 2.1 points. That's about $2 billion, and I would attribute about half of that to the ongoing effect of the model-driven initiatives for margin and those 2 model-driven initiatives are continuing to mix to higher margin categories like the software business. And then the second category would be all of the spend takeout that we see and kind of a -- the support structures around the business that we call the globally integrated enterprise. Well, I don't think either of those impact your go-to-market pricing content that you see in your business. That go-to-market pricing content is really going to dependent on the competitiveness of your offerings at the client, not the spend structure in your back office enterprise nor would that margin improvement impact revenue growth simply by mixing into this higher margin spaces like software. And I think if you look at that 2.1 points of margin growth in the fourth quarter, I would attribute about half of that those go ongoing initiatives we have to drive performance in margin for the business units. The other half were the unique items that we drove during the year. So a good example of unique item that did drive real profitability was the work we did on those contracts we did in services to restructure them with our customers. We maintain about 80% of the revenue, but the profit generation out of it was quite significant. And that play alone produced about 1/3 of that balance of a point of margin growth about -- in the $1 billion. That generation is going to continue into 2013 because, once again, I would describe that as if we raise the water level on the ongoing contract performance.",334

So I think they did a pretty strong job here as they went through the quarter. Let's just go through some of the elements. Lotus, up 9% gained share. IDC now ranks them #1 in bringing social software to the business environment. Tivoli grew 5% against strength in the overall storage offerings. Rational, 12% gained share; WebSphere, 11% gained share; Information Management, up 3%. So if you look across that base of businesses, we had very strong performance across the board. I thought they did a very nice job in transitioning from the third quarter.

As we think about 2013, you've done a great job in terms of optimizing the operating margin profile. How should we think about the various kind of rates of contribution for 2013 in terms of incremental contributions to margin, in terms of, a, is it really going to be really from a mix driven up to software? Or b, is it going to be an increasing level of optimization of software and less labor in services? Or c, it will be more about just OpEx, reductions in general?",93

I mean, again, the best example of that would be the tremendous progress, I think, we've made on our software business. Again, I gave earlier the statistic. But I think it's kind of remarkable that in 2000, we're doing $2.4 billion. Last year, we did $11 billion. So that ongoing mix to software, we think, should continue. And then supplementing that will be all the work that we have ongoing in that $8 billion of focused spend that we talked about in our globally integrated enterprise initiative. Now one point I want to make clear in that $8 billion, we do work to drive about 40% of that to the bottom line. But the other 60% is firmly dedicated to remixing our spend profile and our resources so there is higher growth, higher margin initiatives like business analytics, Smarter Planet, Cloud Computing. And if you look at the business mix within those, about 50% of the revenue mix within those initiatives is software. So much higher software mix than we see in the base business. That, too, should help propel our mix into higher margin content.",238

Let's -- I think the best framework I can give you on the services side -- now I'm going to walk through each of the elements. But on the services side, we built that view of backlog run out in the presentation and that covers about 70% of the revenue that we realized in the year. So another way to look at it, we already 70% of revenue as we enter the year. But in that, the math would say, it's up 1%, but the point I was making as we're more explicit about the dynamics is really from a profit standpoint, it should perform more like a business that has a backlog run out of closer to 2%. Now the dynamics underneath that, just given the backlog growth that we run our GBS business, should move GBS into positive revenue performance as we go through the year. But I think the more important aspect of that is that revenue performance, that better mix of contract profile within the business, closing out on those $3 billion of deals that rolled across the dateline. That should generate a model-level profit performance out of our services business. And as I said earlier, we would think it would drive kind of double-digit profit as we go into the first quarter. From a hardware standpoint, as we go into 2013, that first half is really going to be defined by the zSeries momentum that we have going. And we would expect that, that would help us drive double-digit profit in the first half as well. And on the software base of business, with Key Branded Middleware at 6% in the fourth quarter, we expect, as we had said earlier, mid-single digit revenue performance and a very strong profit contribution as well. So all those things put together give us confidence in the at least $16.70 of earnings per share that we pointed out for the year.",323

I believe in earlier comments, you indicated earnings will be a little bit more front-half loaded than second half loaded. Can you talk through the dynamics that would drive that type of unusual seasonality in 2013?",44
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3445.0,404066.0,19062375.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,33,"Yes, absolutely. So let's -- when you look at the seasonality in the year, I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, the year-to-year performance across the quarters is relatively similar, but will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. And that's really driven by kind of the zSeries content and the zSeries dynamic. Remember, by the time we get to fourth quarter of next year, we'll be facing the big announcement in the rearview mirror. So I do expect that the first half of the year should be better growth than we see in the second half, but we still expect to have a good second half. Now within the first quarter, the additional comment I would make is really we kind of expect to see a little better performance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. And that comes down to Easter. This year, Easter falls in that last week of March. And we've seen that in the -- especially in countries where Easter is a major holiday, that tends to move that business because you just have more difficulty getting hold of your clients and your customer base at the end of the quarter, and those contracts will generally roll to April. So once again, a little strong performance in the first half and the second half but a good second half of that. And within the first half, a little more strength in the second quarter than we would see in the first quarter based on the calendar date for Easter.
So with that, let me take the opportunity to wrap up the call. Our 2012 results demonstrated the flexibility of IBM's business model. We had strong performance in our growth initiatives, especially in our higher value areas. We expanded our margins and had excellent profit growth, which drove our 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. And we generated over $18 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.6 billion year-to-year and a record for IBM. 
So in 2013, we'll continue to move our business forward, shifting to higher value and improving efficiency. We're going to buy businesses. We're going to sell businesses. We're going to rebalance our resources, align those to opportunities and continue to invest in innovation. Now all of this is captured in our view of 2013. We're confident in our ability to deliver at least $16.70 for the year, on our way to our objective of at least $20 in 2015.

In the first quarter, we reported $23.4 billion in revenue, expanded gross, pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $3, which is up 8% year-to-year. But this quarter certainly didn't close the way it started. We had solid profit performance in January. But as the quarter ended, hundreds of millions of dollars of very profitable software and Systems z mainframe deals fell short of the goal line. This impacted the first quarter close, but the rollover of these deals positions us for a strong start in our software and mainframe business in the second quarter. Taking full consideration of our first quarter performance and the number of actions to improve this performance, we continue to expect operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year.
Now let me make 4 points about what we saw in our business this quarter. First, our Total Services business performed as expected, with year-to-year constant currency revenue growth in line with last quarter and pretax profit up 10%. Our backlog was up 1% year-to-year, or 5% at constant currency, driven by a lot of new business in the quarter.
Second, we had a shortfall in sales execution in our software and mainframe businesses. But with a good list of rollover transactions coupled with improved execution, we've got a strong hand going into the second quarter in these businesses.
Third, in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet was up over 25% and cloud over 70%. Business analytics was up 7%, led by double-digit growth in GBS. But our growth markets revenue was up 1% at constant currency, clearly not what we expected or what we needed. Across IBM, we delivered strong growth in several of our offerings to address market trends like SaaS and mobile, where we grew over 50%, leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. As these become a larger part of our business, they'll contribute more to our growth.
Finally, there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming, like elements of our power, x and storage product lines that showed disappointing performance in the first quarter. Here, we're going to take substantial actions.
Now let me describe how this impacts the year. With the improved execution in our software and mainframe businesses, we would expect the operating EPS growth in the second quarter to be similar to that of the first. However, given our first quarter performance, we now expect to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions for the year in the second quarter, as opposed to last year when it was distributed across the quarters. Though we certainly don't have a specific approved action, this will result in a charge that will additionally impact the operating EPS we report.
Like all years, we have a number of actions planned to improve the business for the long term, acquiring and divesting businesses and rebalancing our resources. This will result in charges in the second quarter and gains in the second half, which we expect will roughly offset for the year.
By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance, benefits from the workforce rebalancing activity and gains in charges, we're confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year.
Let me now walk you through the financial metrics for the first quarter. In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was down 3%. We entered the quarter with a modest currency headwind, but became more pronounced due to currency movements over the last 90 days, especially in the yen. When you look at the reported revenue for the quarter, currency impacted our revenue growth by 2 points.
Turning to the profit metrics, our ongoing focus on productivity and our shift to higher value contributed to our margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by 1 point, led by services and an improving mix. And we expanded operating pretax margin by 8/10. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, down approximately 3 points year-to-year. The lower tax rate is primarily due to benefits recorded to reflect changes in tax law enacted during the quarter, including the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012. We expect our ongoing operating tax rate for the next 3 quarters to be in the range of 25%.
Our operating net income grew 3%, and our margin was up over 1 point. With nearly $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you bring all of this together, we delivered operating EPS of $3, which is up 8%.
Turning to cash, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion. 
Now I'll get into the results, starting with revenue and gross margin by segment.
Year-to-year constant currency revenue performance in our combined Services businesses was consistent with the fourth quarter. At constant currency, GBS performance improved a couple of points, while GTS revenue growth slowed due to continued pressure on sales into existing accounts and actions taken to restructure the low-margin outsourcing contracts.
In Software, we had good performance in several key areas, such as Smarter Commerce, Social Business, security and storage management. But our growth rate was impacted by the inability to close some large transactions at the end of the quarter. 
In Systems and Technology, while we're delivering good performance in System z mainframe despite the slipped deals and in our PureSystems offerings, weakness in power, System x and storage resulted in overall declines.
Looking at our gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix.
Looking at revenue by geography on a constant currency basis, Americas revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada, mitigated by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. Our EMEA revenue was down 4% year-to-year, about 0.5 point lower than last quarter. Most of the major countries declined, though Spain returned to modest growth. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 1%. Within that, Japan revenue was up 3%. This was the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan, reflecting the stabilization of our business in that country. The balance of AP, which is part of our growth markets, declined.
Across all geographies, our growth markets revenue was up a disappointing 1%, though 5 points faster than the major markets. BRICs were up 3%, led by Brazil, but China and Russia posted modest declines. China's performance was impacted by weakness in large deals and a slowdown in our low-end and midrange products.
Now let's take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 4%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. Currency contributed 1 point of expense decline, driven almost entirely by translation. Consequently, our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was better by 5 points.
I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. First, workforce rebalancing was better by about $200 million year-to-year, driven by a charge in last year's results. Second, our IP income was down over $70 million year-to-year.
Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. In first quarter, the hedge activity was neutral year-to-year with very modest gains in both periods. In the quarter, we were impacted by significant depreciation of the yen. As our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to local services, the ability to hedge cross-border cash flows is low compared to most other countries. This had a profit impact in the quarter, which would continue at current spot rates.
So now, let me go into the segments. This quarter, the 2 Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit 10% and expanded pretax margin by 2 points. Total backlog was $141 billion, up 1% at spot rates but up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both the transactional and outsourcing businesses. In fact, we had 22 deals greater than $100 million. We closed large transformational deals in every geography, but we had particularly good performance in our major markets, where the vast majority of these 22 deals were done, and nearly half of those were new Services contracts. These deals contributed to our major markets backlog, which was up 3% at constant currency, and grew for the first time since the end of 2010.
Turning to the 2 segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.6 billion, down 4% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. There were 2 major categories affecting revenue growth. The first was a continuation of the decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economically sensitive. And as expected, GTS revenue continued to be impacted by the work we've done to improve profitability of the restructured low-margin outsourcing contracts. That initiative has helped improve our margin performance again this quarter, but does reduce the top line. We estimate that impact to be about 1 point of revenue growth to GTS and to Services in total. These 2 items were reflected primarily in GTS outsourcing revenue, which was down 3% at constant currency.
In the Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 2% at constant currency led by continued strength in the growth markets and the third consecutive quarter of growth in Japan.
GTS delivered 7% pretax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pretax margins by about 2 points. This quarter, margin expansion was driven by continued efficiency improvements, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives, and lower workforce rebalancing charges.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 3% as reported and flat at constant currency. This represents an improvement of 2 points quarter-to-quarter at constant currency.
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets in Japan drove the strongest performance, while North America slowed its rate of decline versus last quarter.
Looking at the GBS business by offering, we had good results in our solutions that address the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives: business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. As these become a larger part of GBS, they'll contribute more to the top line performance. And as we address the globally integrated enterprise, our traditional back-office solutions, we're continuing to focus on improving our performance in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.
Turning to profit. GBS pretax income improved 17% year-to-year, and pretax margin expanded 3 points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were a continued benefit from our enterprise productivity initiatives, lower workforce rebalancing charges and improved contract performance.
So to wrap up Services, we grew backlog 5% at constant currency with the major markets up for the first time since the end of 2010. Growth initiatives continued to perform well. We're continuing to improve in transition areas, like traditional packaged application implementations, and we expanded profit margins and delivered 10% growth in our pretax income.
Software revenue of $5.6 billion was flat year-to-year or up 1% at constant currency. Pretax income was up 4% year-to-year, and pretax margin is up 1.2 points to 31.5%. 
As I stated up front, Software growth was impacted by a number of large transactions that rolled into the second quarter. e-branded middleware grew 1%, or 2% at constant currency. 
Now let me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance. WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency. For the 12th consecutive year, Gartner designated IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application, infrastructure and middleware segment. In the quarter, we had strong, double-digit growth in Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities, leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. Our SaaS offerings contributed to this strong performance. To address the emerging opportunity around enterprise mobile computing, in the first quarter, we introduced MobileFirst, which combined deep mobile expertise with cloud-based services. Information Management was down 1% at constant currency, the brand most impacted by the large rollover transactions. However, we did hold share. 
Tivoli was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage. Security was up 15% at constant currency, driven by Security Intelligence and identity and access management products segment. Security Intelligence, which more than doubled this quarter, provides solutions to help clients identify threats more quickly, prioritize risk more effectively and automate compliance activities. Identity and access management was up double digits, allowing organizations to mitigate risk by controlling and monitoring users' access, which is even more critical as IT infrastructures become more interconnected.
Tivoli Storage, which enables customers to manage their rapidly growing data, grew 11% at constant currency.
Social Workforce Solutions, which includes our recently acquired Kenexa business, grew 9% at constant currency. We began building a Social Business platform several years ago, and we've been ranked as the #1 enterprise social software vendor for 3 consecutive years by IDC.
Across the software brands, as we close the transactions that rolled over, we should deliver double-digit growth in key branded middleware in the second quarter.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.1 billion was down 17% year-to-year, or 13% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions. System z grew 8% at constant currency. MIPS were up 27%, and more than half of the MIPS were from specialty engines, which were up more than 65%. Within that, Java was up 70%, database 24% and Linux nearly doubled.
Like Software, as we close the large transactions that rolled over from the first quarter, we should be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our System z business in the second quarter.
We're also continuing to see traction in PureSystems, our expert integrated systems. We completed our first 12 months of operations for PureSystems and have sold over 4,000 systems in over 90 countries.
Power revenue was down 31% at constant currency. Our declines were driven by both the high-performance computing segment, where we had a strong performance last year, and the impact of the transition to POWER7+.
Let me step back and provide a broader perspective. We are, by far, the market leader in UNIX. We're expanding our POWER platform to go after the Linux opportunity. This opportunity is of similar size to UNIX but growing faster. We've already had some key successes, with wins this quarter in China and in Europe. And in fact, Watson is based on POWER Linux. Though this will take time to mature, it provides a real opportunity for future growth.
System x is down 8% at constant currency, and our storage revenue was down 10% at constant currency. We had strong growth in our new midrange products. Storage gross profit was up, as our organic Storwize products grew over 50% and replaced older OEM products. The value in storage continues to shift to software. Our storage software, which is reported in Tivoli, grew 11% at constant currency.
For Systems and Technology, this is not the quarter we expected. Our performance was impacted by product transitions and our own execution. We expect to improve our revenue performance in the second quarter and return to profitability, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, down almost $200 million year-to-year. The year-to-year performance was driven by a decline in our accounts receivable clearance rate and an increase in cash tax payments. These were mitigated by a year-to-year benefit associated with the timing change of funding our 401(k) and a lower level of CapEx.
Looking at the uses of cash, we closed 2 smaller acquisitions this quarter, StoredIQ and Star Analytics. We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including almost $950 million in dividends and $2.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 12.3 million shares in the quarter. And at the end of March, we had $6.2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion, up $900 million from year end. Total debt was $33.4 billion, of which over $25 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7.2:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.2 billion, down $600 million from year end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 34%, down 2 points from year end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
And now, let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our revenue decline impacted our earnings growth by $0.14. The contribution from margin was $0.23, with gross, pretax and net margins all up year-to-year, driven by our mix to higher value, margin expansion in Services and a lower tax rate resulting from changes in tax law during the quarter. A lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed an additional $0.13.
For the quarter, we delivered 8% operating earnings per share growth. As I said at the beginning of the call, the quarter didn't end the way it started, so we're going to roll up our sleeves and get this back on track. 
First, by improving our sales execution, to close the rollover deals in software and mainframe and recover our position in the growth markets. Next, by taking the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions in the second quarter, we'll start to get the benefits from those actions earlier in the second half. Finally, by taking actions to improve our underperforming businesses, including expanding our POWER platform to address the Linux opportunity and leveraging our investments in flash and midrange storage solutions. Some of these actions will yield benefits quickly, while others will play out over time.
And of course, we're going to continue to deliver on the core elements of our business model as we continue to shift to higher value, leverage our key growth initiatives, drive productivity across the enterprise, invest in innovation and return value to shareholders. Now we've got a lot of work to do, but we know how to get it done.
By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance, benefits from workforce rebalancing activity and gains in charges, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. All of this is consistent with our objective to achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.

So I think you said that operating EPS growth would be similar in Q2 to Q1, which I think was about 3.5%. I'm surprised that, that's not dramatically higher than it was in Q1, because you have a much easier comparison and also because you're suggesting that you had several hundred million dollars in pushed out revenues that's high margin. In fact, I think if you work backwards from consensus, you missed revenues by $1.4 billion. If you take out currency, you missed by almost $1 billion. If you really were on plan, other than slipped deals, that would suggest that you should have $1 billion of high-margin incremental deals next quarter. And I'm not sure why your pretax -- why your EPS growth wouldn't be a lot higher. And related to that, are you expecting any EPS growth after your restructuring charges in fiscal Q2?",173
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3435.0,444009.0,20770056.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Okay, let me talk through that. First of all, when you look at the second quarter, in your comments on the second quarter, we have a very good set of rollover transactions going into second, as you correctly pointed out. And if you look at that composite that rolled over the dateline for us, we're talking about more than $400 million of mainframe, software and intellectual property. Now -- so that does give us confidence in the second quarter. But Toni, I did not mean to indicate that all else would also be on the original performance track. So in fact, I still believe there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming that also were disappointing, that are going to take some time to recover. So let me do a couple of things to help clarify that. If we look at the first quarter, I think our Total Services business did perform as expected on an I&E basis. Revenue was about what we saw in the fourth quarter. Pretax profit was up 10%. The real positive news out of the Services business in the first was in fact backlog performance. So backlog was up 5% at constant currency. And I'm sure you've looked at all the supplementals. We've really had a great quarter for bookings, up almost 50%. So that drove a lot of new business in the quarter. That backlog performance is well distributed. Major markets backlog is up 3%, growth markets backlog is up 10%. If you look at the other elements through the different axis, outsourcing backlog up 4%, transactional up 9%. So I think the teams in Services delivered on their objectives on profit, and they did sign a lot of new business. And I would tell you, when you look at the content of the deals that they, too, have rolling into the second quarter, they've got a very strong lineup. So with that, I think that for both of the Services businesses, by the time we get into the second half, they should be growing at low single digit, and I'd peg that at about 2% at constant currency for both of them. We'll start to see this backlog really improve their performance. Second, as you did point out, and I quite agree with your comments, we had a shortfall in the sales execution in our software and mainframe businesses. Those should roll over, and they should present us with very good performance in the second quarter. Now by that, I mean, in that over $400 million of mainframe, software and intellectual property that rolled over, we should see our strategic middleware, I think, in kind of a double-digit framework, which would give us total Software in mid-single-digits. We should see our mainframe business at double digit as well. So with that performance, really our STG business should return to profit in the second quarter. Third, when you look at our growth initiatives, I think that, to be quite clear about it, it was mixed. Smarter Planet, I think, did well, up 25%. Our cloud business, up 70%. I thought they did well. And it came across content that we sell to our customers, so they can set up a private cloud. That was up more than 75%. Managing that content for our customers in private cloud doubled. Our software as a service business was up 65%. So all those elements, I thought, performed well. But on the other side, our growth markets revenue was up only 1%. So they need to get that back to that mid-single-digit characteristic that we're looking for in the second quarter. If you looked at their metrics today and put them on the table, they'd be pointing at mid-single-digit performance. But I think to your -- to the point I was making earlier, there certainly are parts of our business that I'd put in the category of underperforming, and they did disappoint us in the quarter, Power, storage products within that. And I do think in Power, if you look at their performance in that opportunity of UNIX space, once again they picked up share. But it doesn't mean much if you're declining at double digits. Now part of that was compare based on high-performance computing, but easy to substract that -- their double-digit decline. So new products are going to take some time to improve their performance, by, say, 6 to 9 months. But they also need to move into new opportunities, spaces like Linux, in a bigger way. We do have some real successes there. And the Linux market, right now, is as big really as the UNIX market and growing more rapidly. And then the storage products, we need to take advantage of the flash memory content that we've built up and that we reviewed in Almaden. If you look at the second quarter, flash memory could have improved that storage growth rate by about 1.5 points, and by the time we get to the fourth quarter, by 3 to 4 points. But those elements are going to take more time than I think we would originally have thought. The other point that I'd tell you about the second quarter, I want to be clear about, is the yen. So the yen had an impact -- total currency had an impact of about 1.5 points in the first quarter. Then we see about 2 points in the second quarter. And the current spot rates, that's -- it will lead to a year of about 2 points impact. A lot of that impact is frankly the yen, and you've seen how much the yen has moved in a short period of time. Now when we hedge free cash flow, we hedge the underlying cross-border cash flows. So you tend to have royalties for software, you have costs for our hardware content really related to the big export business that we do. But on Services, you don't have that underlying cross-border cash flow to hedge. And most of that is done on a local basis with local resources, local competition. Not many cross-border cash flow is in a lot of that content, especially in Japan. And in Japan, the lion's share of the business, and, I mean, we're talking 75%, 80%, is Services content. So when we get hit by the yen in our largest country, without the ability to hedge that free cash flow on a cross-border basis, that does fall to the bottom line. And we'd look at the impact in the quarter at about $0.10.",1097

Are you excluding that from your operating earnings guidance? Or is that somehow in there? In the past, you've often been able to find gains to offset that. But it sounds like you're kind of excluding that. And then I just wondered if you'd comment on the environment. You had some execution problems in the third quarter last year. You've apparently got some in the first quarter. It sounds like either you need to maybe swap out some managers or, more likely, everybody's missing enterprise numbers this quarter. What do you think is going on? Is it macro? Is it people looking at their cloud architectures and just delaying things? And why particularly at the end of the quarter?",133
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3435.0,444009.0,20770059.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Okay. Let me take both of those questions, but I'm going to start with your first. First, let me put this in context. So when we gave our original guidance in January this year, we said that this year would be like other years in that we're going to buy and sell businesses, we're going to record gains in charges, we're going to invest in innovation and continue to rebalance our workforce to future opportunities. And we said that in an all-in basis, we felt confident with an at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the full year, and that is still the case. Now in the first quarter, we recorded 8% EPS growth. And as we look at our book of business, especially the strength of the rollover deals for software and mainframe, we should see similar year-to-year EPS growth in the second quarter, just as we had the conversation around Tony's question. However, this will be further impacted by workforce rebalancing charges, which I will come back to. So in the second half of the year, we would expect our EPS growth to improve in the third quarter, and further improve in the fourth quarter to double digits. So even excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge and second half gains, we feel that -- very confident, we can achieve the 9.5% EPS growth for the year to drive at least $16.70 of EPS. Now remember, last year, we had about $800 million in workforce rebalancing charges spread across the year. This year, we expect the workforce rebalancing charges to be closer to $1 billion and concentrated in the second quarter, though we really haven't finished the work for a specific action yet. But like last year, we expect the bulk of that charge to be outside the U.S. And with that, on an all-in basis, including all gains and charges, we're confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year, just as we said in January. Now on your second question regarding the first quarter, let me give you a view on a kind of our side of the table, the IBM Corporation, and then I'll give you a feeling for some of the macro issues that we also faced. So I think, as we explained in the prepared remarks, that by and large, this is an execution problem. I mean, we should have closed on those rollover deals, and we thought we had them right up to the end. And we put a lot of work into how to build that pipeline and our execution against it, to compensate in a way for Easter at the end of the quarter. And the last time we had an Easter in March was 1Q '05, and that was also a very disappointing quarter for us. But were those deals affected by Easter? Well, the bulk of that $400-plus million of deals that closed across the dateline, the bulk of them, I mean, really by far the majority, were in Europe, and they were in the U.S. So it's hard to imagine that we weren't affected by Easter. Secondly, if you look at the U.S., was there effect of the -- some effect of the sequester? Well, it's hard to measure. I can tell you that our U.S. federal business was down 13%, which was certainly a drag on the U.S. performance. But I think the other element, that in a way we kind of misjudged, the change in the Chinese Government really ripples down all the way to the provinces and state-owned businesses. And as we went through that -- I mean, we're talking about once-every-10-year event. As we went through that with the team, I don't think we've fully accounted for the impact that would have. And then the last point I would make is the yen. So once again, I want to return to the point that had we simply closed on those deals at the end of the quarter, we would have certainly had sufficient business to close the first and enter the second with strength.",685

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3435.0,444009.0,20770062.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,12,"Sure. First of all, let's talk about cash and the implications for cash. So if you look at the first quarter, our free cash flow was $1.7 billion. And as we pointed out, that's down $200 million. Now there were 2 very distinct implications to that, that I'll cover now. The first is the impact of cash taxes. And the second, sales cycle working capital. So let's take cash taxes first. If you look at cash taxes, in fact, on a year-to-year basis in the first quarter, cash taxes were an impact of about $200 million. And as we face the second quarter, there'll be an impact of about $900 million. And for the year, as much as $2.4 billion. So if you look at our free cash flow performance in the year, excluding that cash tax implication, I feel confident that we'll be growing our free cash flow outside of that, but we're not going to overcome $2.4 billion of additional taxes in the year. If you look at that as a percentage against the booked tax rate in the first quarter of about 17% on an operating basis, actually our cash tax rate was about 30%. And if you roll that out through the quarters for the year, this year would be -- cash tax rate and the booked tax rate, we expect to relatively converge on a full year basis. Now let's talk about sales cycle working capital. That, too, was an impact of about $200 million in the quarter. Against that, what we did see is a growing propensity for late payments on customers' card [ph]. And frankly, our receivables clearance rate, the rate at which we clear them, was not as good as we had expected either. And then lastly, in the negotiations on deals, a lot of attention on our customers' side, on Ts and Cs affecting the cash flow elements, receivable, payables, in some respects even more than price. So what we saw or what we took from that is a lot of attention to that cash balance and holding on to that cash balance. Now all of this content, however, I want to reassure you, was considered as we went through the view of free cash flow across the road map in that range of $90 billion to $100 billion. And so very, very confident that we're going to complete the $50 billion of share buyback. If you look at it, we've done almost $30 billion to date. $20 billion of acquisitions is a very realistic number, both from cash availability and opportunities, and $20 billion in dividend for a total of $90 billion. And with that, we should still have good flexibility, financial flexibility, at the end of 2015. Secondly, on speculation and rumors, I'm obviously not going to comment on rumors, Ben.",472

And then just curious if you think there's a reasonable explanation for why IBM was able to close so many large Services deals in the quarter, but customers, at the same time, are delaying the big systems and software purchases. Could we be seeing customers taking a step back and reconsidering their IT infrastructure and maybe looking more at the cloud and needing services for that, but delaying their infrastructure purchases?",89
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3435.0,444009.0,20770065.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,15,"So if you look at the $400 million in deals, my experience in this area is, when you close that dateline, you kind of reset to a skew across the quarter. It just doesn't all close as you go into the next month period. Now that said, we have closed some -- the substantial deals in that category. But we'll see those, I think, kind of generally feather in across the quarter, based on our customer buying patterns, not just ours [ph] . Secondly, when you look at the Services content, boy, they just had a great pipeline of deals teed up right from the beginning. And so if you looked at their performance on a week by week by week basis, they just had a head of steam the entire quarter. We look at the software mainframe content. I still think mainframe did a reasonable job, up 8%. But compared to a more typical zSeries cycle, I think they could have done, by our math, another 100, 150, and that kind of is the quantification of deals crossing the dateline into the second quarter. On the Software side of the house, they had a very good list of deals, and I think that was just pure execution. We should have closed those on the sales side. We got to get off to a good start as we go into the second quarter. We had a tremendous number of reviews with the management team in Software and the financial team in Software, and they felt very confident in their position going into the second quarter.",265

Mark, can you clarify the effective tax rate you're assuming for the full year? I know you talked about the next 3 quarters, but your previous guidance coming into this year was for a 25% rate for the full year. And obviously, this quarter, the tax rate was a fairly healthy benefit for EPS. So including that, does your full year guidance imply pretax performance that was quite a bit below what you previously expected? And given the incremental restructuring you're talking about, as well as the closing of some of these slipped deals, can you talk about that shortfall relative to your previous pretax expectations?",115
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3435.0,444009.0,20770068.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,18,"Yes. We would see the balance of the 3 quarters for year at a book rate of relatively 25%. And putting everything into the -- those categories and any unique events that we might have, we think the full year is probably going to be in the range of about 24%. So going through a first quarter, to have that full year view of the business being within about 1% is, I think, pretty reasonable. Now when you look at the tax rate, there are really 2 things that really drove that. You've got to recognize, when we get an event within the quarter, we have to recognize that on our tax rate, our book tax rate within the quarter. Like many that are reporting, we took advantage, as we were required to, the tax extenders that was -- including the investment tax credit was, in a sense, the retrospective reinstatement, and that affected our tax rate. But there was also, within the quarter, change in tax law within New York State that also had an effect. So really, that change in the tax rate was due to a change in tax law within the quarter, and the change in New York State was at March 29.",207

And I know you mentioned China as being a surprise or an issue in the quarter. But were there any other things that you can talk about that impacted growth in the growth markets? And help us understand what kind of visibility, if any, you have on improvement as we go into the second half of the year.",86

So if you look at the content within the growth markets and you look at it by the business categories, about 20% of the business in the growth markets is the hardware STG content, a little -- slightly over 20%. So if you look at about 1/5 of it and look at the balance of the business, the balance of the business in the Software and Services content really performed in that kind of mid-single-digit framework that we discussed. Now underneath that, we certainly weren't satisfied with that hardware content. But I think outside of the hardware content, they did come through in that mid-single-digit category that was consistent with their objectives. Now if you look at GMU from kind of a category, really Latin America did a great job, up 14%. When we look at Central Europe and Russia, they tend to be transactional deals, more volatile. We've had in the CEO [ph] of Russia, pretty broad swings within a quarter. So the issue that we saw really was the growth market content in Asia. And with Asia, it was pretty much specifically China. So China needs to do a good job responding from that going into the second quarter. They do have tough compares in the rearview mirror for the second and third quarter. They were up mid-20s and 19% in the third. But I think they, too, have had a good record on hardware content. We're not solely dependent on that hardware content. And if you look at, even from a Services standpoint, the backlog growth in growth markets was up 10%, which should give them some opportunity there as well.",275

That's why, when we look at the margin along those key initiatives axis, they tend to be really high, because that mix of software tends to be about 50%. So when you look at Smarter Planet and business analytics, the missing ingredient there was the software content. Again, that kind of got hung up at the end of the quarter. Actually, the GBS team did a very, very good job on both. And frankly, if you look underneath the GBS profile and break it down to the component parts, they did a great job in the parts of their business aligned with those growth initiatives. There was still some impact in some categories on those traditional packaged apps. Those traditional packaged apps tend to have been more rapid turnover. But the content and [ph]  their backlog that they're building along these growth initiatives should be sustaining and long term with, I think, good margin performance. But when I look at the growth initiatives in the first quarter, the impact that was more material, I think, was the Software performance. The Services performance did very, very well, and it's that Software performance that drives the margin content within them.",244

In the past, you've been reluctant to provide top line expectations, and you indicated that you thought both GTS and GBS would have positive growth in the second half of the year, and I think you even called out kind of 2% constant currency. Could you distill that a little bit, because the signings were very strong, but particularly in outsourcing? So I'd be surprised if that really helped as early as the September quarter. Was there other things like the -- you're not losing share in the market as you, I think, have been over the last couple of quarters, as you get more selective, there's something on going on there. In addition, if you could just talk about what the pipeline looks like after the $17 billion in signings this quarter.",148

And on a constant currency basis, our outsourcing backlog was up 4%, but our transactional backlog was up 9%. So we're now seeing the GBS business, as an example, that they've been piling up backlog growth now for 4 years, and that is going to materialize. They just tended to be, as we did further analysis, those are longer-term contracts. But mathematically, as we went through it with the teams, if they can continue this rate that we've seen, and they do have a very good deal structure going into the second quarter, simply the math would suggest that they should be able to get back to this low single-digit, kind of 2% constant currency revenue growth. And with that, with all of the work that they have done on their cost base, which they do so well, they should get a lot of leverage off that capability in the second half.",173

So the key ingredient, I think, to continue with that margin performance is getting back to revenue performance in the second half of the year. I don't know if I'd say we've turned the corner on growth. I think we've got to get to the second half to see the growth, but it's pretty encouraging. If you can see 5% growth in the constant currency backlog when you're talking about $141 billion of -- I mean, that's a lot of backlog to move in a quarter. So that's the number one point I would make on that. But number two, we had a lot of deals in the Services side of the business cross that dateline as well in the [ph]  second quarter. So they certainly did not bleed the pipe just establishing this level of performance in the first quarter. They should have, based on the deals that they -- on that trajectory, a lot of opportunities to have another very good quarter. Now, obviously, within this, whether it's mainframe or it's Software or it's Services, you have to close the deals. You got to win and you got to win in the customer's office. So there's that dimension, of course. But within that, the opportunity to do well in the second quarter, I think, is certainly there, and that should drive second quarter revenue performance.",257

We had 22 deals over $100 million. So boy, there was a lot of flow in those deals. And there was a lot of flow on the GTS side, there was a lot of flow on the GBS side. So no, this was not just one deal. It was well distributed. We had 22 deals over $100 million. That's a lot of deals over $100 million, and it was across the geographies. So I think that was good performance.
So now, let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. 
Now we're clearly not immune from changes in the global economy. We have a good set of plans and actions to achieve our objective of at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. First, our sales team need to close those rollover transactions that we discussed. Second, we're going to regain our position in the growth markets, and the growth markets team need to lead that. I mean, if you look at the metrics right now, it clearly points in GMU to that mid-single-digit constant currency performance, and they need to get that back on track. Third, we're going to rebalance our workforce to better align our resources to opportunity. Fourth, reposition Power to address the Linux space. And five, capitalize on our flash technologies and storage now. So clearly, those last 2 will take some time. It's not all going to pop back in the second quarter, but it should give us a better trajectory as we go through the year.
We're managing our business to be successful over the long term. So not only do these actions support our view of the year, but they're part of our model of continuous transformation as we move towards our 2015 road map objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. 
So thanks again for joining us. And now, as always, it's back to work.",341

In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $24.9 billion and operating earnings per share of $3.22. Our EPS includes a $1 billion charge for workforce rebalancing. Excluding workforce rebalancing activity in both years, our operating EPS was $3.91, up 8% year-to-year. We had good performance in our high-value, higher-margin businesses, contributing to sequential improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance and to margin expansion. 
Software returned to mid-single-digit growth. In fact, this was the best constant currency Software growth since the first quarter of 2012. Performance was led by 10% growth at constant currency in our Key Branded Middleware, and we gained share in all 5 brands. 
In Services, GBS improved revenue performance and returned the growth at constant currency, while GTS revenue growth was consistent with last quarter. With a significant amount of new business in the quarter, our total Services backlog was up 7% at constant currency or 3% at spot rates, to $141 billion.
Our Hardware performance was mixed. We had strong performance in System z mainframe, which generated double-digit revenue growth at constant currency. Power and Storage had some modest improvement in year-to-year performance, though it still declined. Across our segments, Smarter Planet was up over 25%, and cloud over 70% for the first half. Business Analytics growth improved this quarter to 11%, with good performance across GBS and Software. These initiatives addressed key market trends like mobile, social and Big Data. 
From a geographic perspective, our growth market performance was consistent with first quarter, at 1% constant currency growth. Major markets declined year-to-year, though improved from last quarter's rate. 
Overall, we improved our performance in several areas of the business this quarter, and our first half operating EPS is nearly flat, and that's after fully absorbing the $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge. This puts us on a good footing as we enter the second half.
So let me spend a minute on our view of the full year. 90 days ago, when we made our first quarter earnings announcement, we said that on an all-in basis, we expected at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the full year. We also said that excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge and second half gain, we felt confident that we could achieve at least $16.70 of EPS for the year. As you'll see, we're taking this view of our business up $0.20. 
So let me update this statement for new information. First of all, the substantial second half gain that we were counting on in our all-in view of EPS will not likely close by the end of this year, but we're still in active discussions. As you know, we have a very disciplined M&A process. We're not going to underprice or rush a divestiture, simply to close within 2013. Consequently, we need to fully absorb the workforce rebalancing charge in the all-in view without offset from this gain. The value of this charge is roughly $0.65.
Based on our performance in the second quarter, our solid prospects for growth initiatives, tough decisions on spend management and potential tax settlements, we're increasing our full year view of operating EPS, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge, by $0.20, to at least $16.90. And I think this is a pretty positive statement given that currencies have moved significantly against us in the last couple of weeks, especially in those that are largely unhedged, such as the yen and emerging market currencies.
With that, we've updated our all-in view of the year to at least $16.25, with a net impact of $0.45 driven by the elongated discussions for a larger divestiture project. We're driving to our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on an all-in basis. And in our current view, we'll establish our 2014 trajectory off the 2013 base of $16.90. In other words, we will position the all-in view as if we closed the divestiture transaction to establish our future trajectory. Since fundamentally, whether we close the large divestiture this year or not will not have any effect on our ability to achieve our 2015 objective of at least $20 per share on an all-in basis.
So now turning back to the second quarter, I'll walk through the financial metrics. Our revenue growth at constant currency was down 1%. This is a 2-point improvement from the first quarter rate, driven by Services, Software and Hardware. We entered the quarter with a modest currency headwind, but it became more pronounced with the strengthening of the dollar. When you look at the reported revenue for the quarter, currency impacted our revenue growth by 2 points, and at current spot rates, this increases to a 3-point impact in the second half. 
Turning to profit metrics. We expanded operating gross margin nearly 1.5 points, led by Services and mix to more profitable segments. The $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge impacts our PTI and net income dynamics. Excluding the workforce rebalancing activity in both years for comparison purposes, our operating PTI was flat year-to-year, with margin up 
0.8 points.
Now within this profit performance, we absorbed a significant impact from currency movements. This is a greater impact to us when the yen devalued sharply because of the limited cross-border cash flow that we can hedge. At current spot rates, the currency impact will continue. IBM's tax rate in the quarter includes a discrete benefit associated with a tax ruling received this quarter. And so our operating net income, excluding the impact of the workforce rebalancing activity, was up 3%, with margin expansion of 1.1 points. 
With over $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you look at the major year-to-year drivers of our second quarter operating EPS performance, the 3% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted our earnings growth by $0.12. The contribution for margin, excluding this year's charge, was $0.24, but this was more than offset by a $0.59 year-to-year impact from higher workforce rebalancing charges. The lower share count contributed an additional $0.18. So operating EPS of $3.22 was down 8%.
You can see the operating EPS, excluding workforce rebalancing, is $3.91, which is up 8% year-to-year on a comparable basis. 
Now I'll get into the results, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada, though both improved the growth rate slightly from last quarter. But once again, we had really strong performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. Our EMEA revenue was down 1%. That's 3 points better than our growth rate in the first quarter. 
We had improvement in the growth rate of several of the major countries. U.K. and Spain not only improved, but grew in the quarter. In Asia Pacific, revenue was flat. Within that, Japan's revenue was up 3%, with good performance across Hardware, Software and Services. This was the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, so clearly, the team in Japan has done a great job to return the business to growth. 
Growth markets revenue was up 1%. In the first half, we've had strength in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa region, but declines in some of our larger markets, like China and Australia, have impacted the overall performance.
Turning to revenue by segment. Year-to-year constant currency revenue performance in our combined services business improved from the first quarter. At constant currency, GBS performance improved a couple of points, led by consulting and systems integration, while GTS revenue growth was unchanged. 
In Software, we had broad-based strength across our strategic brands, led by our offerings in Smarter Commerce, Social Business, Security and Storage Management. 
In Systems and Technology, we had good performance in System z mainframe. While we had some improvements in Power and Storage, they continued to decline. 
Looking at our gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved almost 1.5 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in Services and Software and improving segment mix. 
Now let's take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 11%, or down 1% excluding the year-to-year impact of workforce rebalancing charges. So well-managed on an operating view. 
Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 1 point of expense growth. Currency contributed 1 point of expense decline, driven almost entirely by translation. Consequently, our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was better by 2 points, excluding the charges. The workforce rebalancing is the 1 item in expense that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit. This year's charge was about $1 billion, in line with what we told you back in April. 
This compares to last year's rebalancing charge of about $150 million, so about an $850 million impact to profit year-to-year. We'll see some of the benefits from the rebalancing activity in the second half. 
Now I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the second quarter, the hedge activity was fairly neutral year-to-year, with modest gains in both periods. The dollar strengthened against many currencies, but we were significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen. Because our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to local services, we have less ability to hedge cross-border cash flows as compared to most other countries. I mentioned this last quarter, but the year-to-year profit impact was much larger in the second quarter. This would continue at current spot rates through the rest of the year. We saw a similar trend in other growth market currencies.
So now let me go into the segments. This quarter, the 2 Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue. Pretax profit was down 17%, reflecting the impact of the workforce rebalancing charge. Excluding workforce rebalancing in both years, profit was up 2% and pretax margin expanded just over 1 point. 
Total backlog was $141 billion, up 3% at spot rates, but up 7% at constant currency. Backlog again grew in both the transactional and Outsourcing businesses, and in fact, we had the best growth of our book of business at constant currency in 4 years. 
Within that, both major markets and growth markets grew backlog this quarter, and our major markets accelerated their growth at constant currency from last quarter. We had 15 deals over $100 million, including a megadeal in Europe. 
Turning to the 2 segments. Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 5% or down 2% at constant currency. Our Outsourcing business was down 3% at constant currency, with the bulk of this decline driven by previous actions to restructure lower margin contracts. While this impacted revenue, it raised the profitability of the Outsourcing portfolio. 
We'll wrap on the year-to-year dynamics in the second half, though the business will continue to operate at this higher profit base. For the quarter, we estimate the impact to revenue to be about 1.5 points to GTS and 1 point to Services in total.
In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 1% at constant currency, led by Japan with its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Last week, we closed the acquisition of SoftLayer technologies, the world's largest, privately-held cloud computing infrastructure provider. As businesses add public cloud capabilities to their on-premise IT systems, they need enterprise-grade reliability, security and management. IBM has built a portfolio of high-value private, public and hybrid cloud offerings. With SoftLayer, IBM will accelerate the buildout of our public cloud infrastructure to give clients the broadest choice of cloud offerings to drive business innovation. 
This quarter, GTS pretax profit declined, but adjusting for the workforce rebalancing activity, profit was up 3% and pretax margin was higher year-to-year by 1.3 points. On this basis, margin expansion reflects improved efficiency and productivity, as well as tough-minded spend actions. 
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 1% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. This represents an improvement of 2 points at constant currency from last quarter's year-to-year rate. 
From a geographic perspective, North America led the improvement and was up mid-single-digits. Growth markets in Japan continued to drive solid performance and Europe slowed its rate of decline versus last quarter. 
Looking at the GBS business by our 2 major categories, we had good results across the portfolio. Within the digital front office, we again delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives: Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. And within our back office solution that we call the Globally Integrated Enterprise, we returned to growth in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications. 
Turning to profit. Adjusting for workforce rebalancing activity, GBS profit grew 2% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 0.5 point. 
So to wrap up Services, growth initiatives continued to perform well and we're investing to accelerate our transformation. We've made good progress in transition areas like traditional packaged application implementations, and have largely wrapped on the outsourcing contract restructuring. And we're entering the second half with the strongest backlog growth at constant currency in years. 
Software revenue of $6.4 billion was up 4% year-to-year or 5% at constant currency. Software PTI was down 2% year-to-year, or on an adjusted basis, was up 6% to $2.7 billion.
Key Branded Middleware, which was over 2/3 of total Software revenue, grew 9% or 10% at constant currency. 
Each of the 5 key brands gained share in the second quarter, and 4 of the 5 grew double digits at constant currency. We have built a portfolio of solutions that target the faster growing segments of the market, including mobile, social and security. Differentiated by Advanced Analytics, these solutions provide value a new set of IT buyers in the front office and many of these are delivered through our SaaS offerings, which were up over 50% this quarter. 
Now let me take you through the key brands. WebSphere grew 10% at constant currency. Within WebSphere, the key contributors, Smarter Commerce and Mobile, grew double digits. IBM's Smarter Commerce initiative helps our clients transform their business processes to rapidly respond to shifting customer demands in today's digitally-transformed marketplace. 
Our mobile portfolio, led by MobileFirst, combined security, analytics and app development software to manage clients' mobile infrastructure, regardless of device. Information Management software grew 6% at constant currency. 
Analytics runs through our portfolio of solutions, enabling clients to develop and execute a Big Data strategy that connects their existing business data to new data sources, delivering business insights in real time. 
Tivoli software was up 14% at constant currency, with growth in each of the 3 key business areas. 
Our security business had a great quarter with growth of 20% at constant currency. 
In the age of mobile access, security intelligence is critical to safeguarding data, transactions and everyday business operations. 
Within Tivoli, Storage was up 17% at constant currency. Storage software delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Social Workforce Solutions grew 23% at constant currency, driven by the recent acquisition of Kenexa and our existing Smarter Workforce offerings. 
In the second quarter, IBM was ranked #1 in enterprise social software for the fourth consecutive year by IDC. Across-the-board, Software had a good quarter with solid top line 
[Audio Gap] 
12% year-to-year or 7% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions. System z grew 11% at constant currency. 
MIPS were up 23% year-to-year and we continue to have more than half of the MIPS from specialty engines, which were up double digits. 
Last week, we announced an agreement to acquire CSL International, which expands System z's cloud capabilities, including simplified management of virtualized Linux on z. 
In PureSystems, we've now sold over 6,000 systems in over 100 countries in the 5 quarters since announced. 
While POWER revenue was down 24% at constant currency, this does represent a 7-point improvement from last quarter's rate. POWER continued to outperform the UNIX competition and gained share again this quarter, and we continue to expand our POWER platform to go after the Linux opportunity. We expect the sequential improvement in POWER will continue in the second half as adoption of our new POWER7+ products continues. 
System x was down 10% at constant currency. Storage hardware revenue was down 6% at constant currency, but flat including storage software, which is reported in Tivoli. 
Strong double-digit growth in our midrange Storewize products was offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings and softness in the high-end. 
Our flash products offerings contributed 2 points of year-to-year growth to total storage. 
Systems and Technology returned to profitability in the second quarter, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, and we expect to remain profitable for the full year.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $2.7 billion of free cash flow, down about $1 billion year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.4 billion was down about the same. The first half year-to-year performance was impacted by a significant increase in cash taxes and lower accounts receivable collections. 
This was mitigated by a year-to-year benefit from lower capital expenditures and the benefit associated with the timing change of funding our 401(k).
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we acquired 3 smaller companies: StoredIQ, Star Analytics and UrbanCode. In the first week of July, we closed the larger SoftLayer acquisition. We returned just over $8 billion to shareholders. Of that, $6.1 billion was in share repurchases, and at the end of June, we had $7.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
We took our dividend up 12% in April, and through June, we paid out $2 billion. This is the 18th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and the 10th year in a row of double-digit increases. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.4 billion. Total debt was $34.1 billion, of which nearly $25 billion was in support of our financing business, which was leveraged at a ratio of 7.2:1. 
Our non-financing debt was $9.3 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 39%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So let me wrap up the quarter. We had good performance in our higher-margin businesses, like Software and System z mainframe. And we had continued strong performance in our growth initiatives of Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and cloud. We returned to growth in Global Business Services, led by consulting and systems integration. And for Total Services, we had the strongest backlog growth at constant currency in years. 
At the same time, we took actions to better position our business for the future. We rebalanced the workforce to align resources to the best opportunities, and we announced and recently closed the acquisition of SoftLayer to enhance our capabilities in cloud. 
As we move into the second half, we expect to continue our progress in areas like Analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet, leverage the benefit from our workforce rebalancing activity, capture additional opportunities in cost and expense through net income, and of course, continue to return value to shareholders. At the same time, we're dealing with a more challenging currency environment. 
Taking all of this into consideration, we are increasing our full year view of operating EPS, excluding the $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge, to at least $16.90. This is a $0.20 increase from our previous view. And because we are no longer counting on a gain from a large divestiture in the second half, our all-in view of operating EPS is now at least $16.25.
All of this is consistent with our objective to achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.

It would seem that basically, without the benefit of the tax rate, the operational increase was really $0.05 or so from what you thought previously. I just wanted to also be clear on that. And what gives you confidence that you can hit those numbers, perhaps the specifics around how the charge flows through in terms of cost saves, and then what segments could possibly grow where you see some leverage?",80
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366703.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Okay, Ben, very good question. Maybe the best way for me to answer that is to take a look at it in kind of a headwinds, tailwinds basis. So if you look at the second half of the year, obviously, we have a headwind on currency and more specifically, within that, the yen. We pointed out in the attachment that even though currency was an impact of 2% in the first half, we see it about 3% in the second half. Our Hardware business has been an impact to us in the first half of the year and we're obviously dependent on the Asian GMU economy, which has been challenging in the first half. But I'll tell you, as we look at the second half, we have some very, very distinct tailwinds that we have driven to drive our performance. So first of all, Software pipeline, we've got a very good Software pipeline going into the second half of the year. And if you look at that Software performance in the second quarter, boy, they really hit the ball. So not only did Software grow the total by 5%, but that Key Branded Middleware was up 10% and we gained share in every single one of the sub-brands in that Software business. So we see real momentum going from that second quarter into the second half of the year. Secondly, very, very important, we have Services backlog growth on a constant currency basis of 7%. That is the best backlog growth positioning we've had in 4 years going into the second half. 3% at actual, but that 7% of constant currency, the best we've seen in 4 years. Now against that, in the second quarter, break it down by service lines, GBS returned to growth in the second quarter. They should further profit on that improvement in the entering backlog, and I would expect GBS to be firmly in that mid single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. Likewise, on our GTS business, GTS was down in on the second quarter about 2%, but they had about 1.5 points impact from those restructured contracts last year that we've spent a lot of time talking about in last year's earnings call. So if you adjust for that, they came very close to a neutral performance in the second quarter, and with that, I would expect GTS to return to low single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter as well. So now we've had good performance flow through to the second half from our Software business, better performance from our GTS and GBS businesses driving performance. Our workforce rebalancing yield, we did a great job closing that right on the $1 billion that we had advised you of as we closed the first quarter. That will begin to yield in the third quarter of the year and we'll get a full quarter's benefit in the fourth quarter, and I think that is quite significant. I clearly alluded to the potential tax settlements that we would see being a positive impact in our fourth quarter. But along with that, we've had real strength in our growth initiatives. Cloud through the first half of the year, very, very strong. We had very good positioning at Business Analytics in the second quarter, up 11%, strong performance in our Smarter Planet content, and we've taken a very tough position on spending. So you put all that together, I think we have the ingredients for that second half of the year, and it was based on all of that, in aggregate, that gave us the confidence, along with the second quarter performance to drive that additional $0.20 to $16.90, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.",619

I'm hoping you can clarify, because it's a little nebulous about whether you're changing your guidance definition of operating earnings or not. So the traditional metric of operating earnings would include the rebalancing charge in there, and then guidance would be $16.25 at least for the year. Is that what we should be putting in our models or are you changing the definition and saying, well, we're going to exclude these kinds of charges this year and on a go-forward basis, and $16.90 should be what analysts put in your model? And so if you could address that, and I'd also like to understand to the degree that -- what checks and balances to the degree that you may include -- continue to include them but not match them in a given quarter, what checks and balances are there going to be that offsetting -- that gains and charges are ultimately offsetting as they have been historically?",179
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366706.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Okay, very, very good question, Toni. First of all, I want to be very, very clear that when we attach our objective for 2015 of $20, that at least $20 is on an all-in basis. And I think in this earnings announcement, I hope to be very clear on the basis for performance in the year. So if you look at the performance that we would view for the year, we've been clear on the all-in basis and we've also been clear excluding the gains in charge. Now let me provide some distinction on that basis, why I think both of those are very important. First of all, on an all-in basis, we had said that, that second quarter workforce rebalancing charge would be offset by a future divestiture gain. And, frankly, as we look at it now, we are in active discussions, but very likely on a time line basis, it's unlikely that it simply closes in 2013. So that would impact that original view of our business on an all-in basis of at least $16.70 by $0.65. And then you would add the improvement of $0.20 to that. That gives us a $16.25. But I want to say that on the other view of our business, excluding gains and charges, that now would be $16.90, and I am reassuring you and the investors that it's that $16.90 that we will be using as our starting point to set our objectives for 2014 on an all-in basis and 2015 on an all-in basis, so in other words, as if we had closed that divestiture. Now why do I think that's important? I think that's important because whether we close that divestiture this year or not would not impact that operational performance, exactly as we've always defined it, in 2014 and 2015. And number two, I wanted to be very clear to investors that when we start to position that trajectory for performance going from '13 to '14 to '15, that number starts at $16.90, not $16.25. So from my perspective, the view of our business to best establish the trajectory we're on, going from '13 to '14 to '15, is an end state of $16.90 increased by $0.20 from our original $16.70 view of the business. Given that, that large divestiture has moved out of the year, we would assess the all-in at $16.25. But we're certainly working on other divestiture content, and if that lands, we will be adding that to our basis at will. But to reiterate, assessing this trajectory for this year I think is best evaluated excluding the second quarter charge. And at $16.90, that will now be the basis for establishing that trajectory for our 2014 and '15, and achieving our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on an all-in basis.",468

And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you start to run into the comps issue, where you're sort of getting beyond all that in the back part of the year. But I'm just curious as to sort of how you see impact of that playing out for the rest of the year?",105
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366709.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,12,"Well, I think on that view of the business, on our contracts negotiations with customers, the biggest reference point is really those restructured contracts that we drove in 2012. And as I said for GTS, that was an impact of about 1.5 points to their growth rate. So outside of that, they would have been down about 0.5 point. And now with the improved backlog performance and starting point, going into the third quarter, we would expect that our GTS business should be returning to growth in the third quarter in low-single digits. So if you're looking at the impact of those restructured businesses on our year-to-year growth rate this year, by the third quarter, it's less than 1 point and it's fully wrapped by the time we get to the fourth quarter. So the really strong signings performance we've seen from our 2 Services businesses and the positive impact that's had on backlog now, as I've said earlier, up 7% on a constant currency basis, 3% on actuals, should give them a very good starting point as we go into third quarter. And that restructured contract impact on growth rates should start to ameliorate in third quarter and fully ramp in the fourth.",204

Did those close in Q2? And just looking at some simple math, assuming half of those deals did close in the Software business in Q2 or were assigned to Software, it implies the underlying demand of growth of Software really wasn't all that robust. It was pretty tepid, maybe flat to up 1% or so. So can you comment on how those deals closed and what the underlying demand looks like for your Software products, excluding the timing of those deals?",103
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366712.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,15,"Yes, very, very good question. So if you look at those rollover deals that we had as we exited the first quarter, they frankly distributed across the months within the quarter on kind of a typical rollover basis, and we closed a little less than half of them, which is also kind of a typical closure rate. So it really did not provide within the quarter kind of a spike, if you will, and assume kind of a normal profile for rollover deals as we went through the quarter. Now as you look at it going into the third quarter, especially within that Software business, which is very high margin content for us, we actually have even more rollover content going for our Software business from the second quarter to the third quarter. And if you just look at kind of the firm pipeline that we've had for the third quarter compared to the second, we're actually in a little better shape going into the third than we were even in the second. So I think that the performance that we saw out of Software in the second quarter is a good indication of the kind of performance we ought to see from our Software business going to the third quarter. And I think that when you look at the mainframe business, that we also had a very strong performance from in the quarter, we should expect another double-digit quarter from mainframe in the third as well.",247

I mean, very, very strong there. Shouldn't that equate to some pretty meaningful revenue growth for IBM? And if so, when? Or am I missing something about are there some larger contracts that are rolling off? And how should we think about multiple quarters of back-to-back strength you've had in that metric that we use, along with others?",86
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366715.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,18,"Well, very good question. When you look at that Services content, the great thing about our Services business is you sign those contracts that give you lift and that give you lift over many, many years, right? So an advantage, I think, that we built into our business equation is that long string annuity content from the Services base of business, so you're not so dependent on the volatility of that transactional business. So when you look at that improvement in backlog entering a given quarter, that is distributed over a number of years, but you've started to see the impact and the benefit of that even in the second quarter. So again, I'd reiterate, in the second quarter, our GBS business returned to growth. And as we look at the additional backlog performance we have going into the third, they should now be back to mid single-digit growth. Our GTS business was impacted by the restructured contracts in the rearview mirror. But adjusting for that, we think they were very close to kind of flat performance on an adjusted basis, so that gives us confidence as we go into the third quarter that our GTS business should also return to growth in low-single digits. Now we did sign in the second quarter, 50 deals over $100 million and we signed a multibillion-dollar mega Outsourcing deal in Europe. Now the European deal is a very interesting one in itself because IBM, for this customer, will transform the underlying technology, including new analytics and cloud models, enabling business innovation for the client. So this is a great example of how the Outsourcing business is evolving as clients look to IBM for supporting and leveraging new technologies such as cloud. So as you pointed out, 2 quarters of very good signings performance. As we've always said, the proof in the pudding is going to be in the backlog, and sure enough the backlog did show up as we entered the second half. And we're going to see that revenue impact as we start to move that glacier north with positive revenue performance from GTS, low-single digits, and mid-single-digit revenue performance from GBS.",360

Mark, you had mentioned that you had a tax benefit as well coming in the second half. Is that additional to the tax benefit you had this quarter? And I believe your guidance before was pointing towards roughly a 25% rate and that's what's in most models. So how do we think about the tax rate in the second half relative to that and how that drives the earnings guidance for the full year?",96

Now we did get a tax benefit in the second quarter that we recognized, which will relatively improve that rate. And if you look on a forward-looking basis regarding tax settlements, we do have a number of audits and disputes around the world, including the 2008 to 2010 U.S. Federal Tax audit. We expect to conclude some of these audits and disputes later this year, that could result in a favorable settlement in the fourth quarter.",103

And also talk about whether the weaker cash generation impacts your flexibility to step-up buybacks or make acquisitions to help hit the $20 2015 target if needed?",61
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366721.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,24,"Okay. When you look at the first half of 2013, our cash flow was down $1.1 billion. Now within that decline, we had a substantial increase in our cash tax payments of $700 million. In addition, we had a deterioration of our accounts receivable days outstanding by over 1.5 days, and that comes at a metric of about $250 million per day. So we should have done better there and we certainly could have done better in our profit performance from the business. Now when you go look on a forward-looking basis, I fully expect that we'll improve on that receivables equation and pull that cash back into business. And we should have better profitability from unit performance as we go into the second half as well. But I got to say that on a full year basis, we do have a cash tax headwind of $2 billion and I don't think we're going to overcome that on a year-to-year basis. Now even with that positioning however, I feel very confident in the overall positioning for the roadmap of $50 billion in share repurchase, $20 billion in dividends and the opportunity for $20 billion in overall acquisitions. And if you kind of gauged our performance against those metrics, given this is kind of the half point of the model, we've done $33 billion of share repurchase of the $50 billion, we've done $6 billion of the $20 billion in overall acquisitions, $9 billion of the $20 billion in dividends, which puts us just reasonably ahead of pace. So I think we're in a good position there. We do have a cash tax headwind this year, but I do not think it's going to impact our ability to complete the expenditures on share repurchase, acquisitions and dividends through the 2015 roadmap.",300

Can you kind of quantify, Mark, what the quarterly EPS benefit in the fourth quarter is going to be due to the workforce restructuring?",56
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366724.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,27,"Well, if you look at the workforce restructuring, let me give you a little -- that workforce rebalancing, let me give you a little color behind that. Now if you look at the workforce rebalancing, as we pointed out, that concluded about $1 billion. In that $1 billion, the vast majority of that is spent overseas, outside the U.S. that has longer paybacks. Now from a business unit standpoint, you could see that in the math that we've provided to you, about $600 million of that would be benefiting the Services business and about $200 million each for the Hardware and Software businesses. That will distribute across the third quarter and fourth quarter, as well as the first 2 quarters of 2014. Now given that it's generally world trade driven, we're not going to pay back that $1 billion in the year, but we will see the first increment of a contribution from it in the third quarter. And we're going to see a full quarter of contribution in the fourth quarter this year, and then ongoing contribution in the first and second quarters of 2014.",186

Sales are obviously a little light, you did well on margins. But just what are customers spending on now and how are they feeling about spending in the second half of the year?",53
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366727.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,30,"Yes, I think if you look at overall spending, let's look at it from a couple of perspectives. First of all, just based on the dynamics we see in our business, the major market's performance actually improved for IBM in the second quarter compared to the first quarter by about 2 points. Within that, as I'd said earlier, Japan did a great job in this, but I thought Europe, as well, did a pretty good job in a difficult environment. But we do see, when you look at the growth market business, they are moving more from kind of infrastructure-based offerings to offerings with real solutions capability like Business Analytics and Smarter Planet capabilities, as they improve performance. So as we see that spending profile and as it exhibits itself for IBM, we see improved prospects for our Services revenue base as we go into the third quarter, ongoing strength in our Software base. We do think that Hardware will still be a challenging equation, but it certainly will be a mix of demand patterns mapped to our capabilities to support our objectives for the third and fourth quarter. And right now, we would look at the third quarter, that analyst models are reasonable as we see higher double-digit performance in the fourth on our way to achieve that $16.90 at least for the year, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.",232

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3263.0,484528.0,22366730.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,33,"Yes, absolutely. So if you look at our GMU performance in the second quarter, it did prove to be more challenging. Again, 1% growth in the second quarter, as we saw in the first quarter. But underneath, there was a mix. So we actually had very strong performance, I think, in Latin America, up 12%. And within Latin America, Brazil was up 16%. So the whole Latin America content I would count as a real plus for us. Middle East, Africa, likewise. We had 11% growth. So good performance there as well. The areas that we had more difficulty in our growth markets, frankly, can be, I think, best attributed to kind of 3 large countries: China, Australia and Russia. And they account for about 40% of the GMU base of business. Without those 3 countries, GMU frankly, would have been up 7%. Now within those 3 countries, I'll tell you that China and Russia, who were both down in the second quarter of '13, had a very, very big comp to overcome. Last year, China achieved 24% growth in the second quarter of 2012, and Russia had 39% growth in the second quarter of 2012. So very big compares. Now, that said, we will remain cautious as we go into the second half of the year on GMU until we start to see more demand pattern driving that more typical performance level that we've seen in the past. 
So let me -- with that, let me wrap up the call. So first of all, we're exiting the quarter stronger than we entered, with good growth in our high-margin businesses, a better book of business in services, and we executed a workforce rebalancing action that will start to yield in the third quarter. We have some opportunities I mentioned earlier, but also some headwinds. But all of this was considered in our decision to take up our expectation for EPS by $0.20, excluding the workforce rebalancing charge, with the second half increase in the fourth quarter. 
Now earnings per share of $16.90 will provide the base for operational trajectory into 2014, consistent with our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on an all-in basis. 
So once again, thanks again for joining us today. And now, as always, it's back to work.",382

For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2013 expectation for operating EPS of at least $16.25 on an all-in basis or $16.90 excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.
Looking at the results by business, our Total Services business returned to modest revenue growth at constant currency, led by 5% growth in GBS. Our backlog was up 2% or 6% at constant currency with another strong performance from GBS. Software delivered mid-single-digit growth at constant currency in Key Branded Middleware. In hardware, growth in System z mainframe was more than offset by declines in POWER, System x and storage. 2/3 of the overall hardware decline was driven by the growth markets.
Across IBM, we delivered strong performance in our growth initiatives that address key market trends: Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud, leveraging both organic investments and acquisitions. Our Smarter Planet solutions are up more than 20% through September and business analytics is up 8% year-to-date. In cloud, we closed the acquisition of SoftLayer in July, which significantly improves our capabilities in public and hybrid cloud. For the first time, we delivered more than $1 billion of cloud revenue in a quarter, of which, $460 million is delivered as a cloud service. Through the first 3 quarters, our cloud revenue was up more than 70% year-to-year.
From a geographic perspective, our challenge this quarter was in growth markets, where revenue was down 9% or 5% at constant currency. Our performance in growth markets has historically outpaced major markets by 8 to 10 points, but this quarter, for the first time, the growth markets trailed the majors. I'll get into the specifics and actions later in the call.
For the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 4% or down about 1.5 points at constant currency. So the currency impact to revenue was about 2.5 points. Currency also impacted our profit performance. As we've discussed in the past, a weakening yen drops largely to the bottom line.
This quarter, we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by 1 point, driven by an improvement in services margins and the relative strength of software and mainframe. The net margin improvement also reflects savings from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity, tough-minded spending actions and a better tax rate.
There are 3 drivers for the lower tax rate: first, discrete benefits associated with recent foreign tax audits; second, a reduction in the ongoing effective tax rate, which we now expect to be in the range of 23% for the year and through 2014; and third, last year's tax included a higher rate on the gain from the divestiture of our RSS business.
Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.99, which was up 10% year-to-year. Now I'll get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
I'll start with a few comments by major geography and then provide a perspective on the major versus growth markets. Americas revenue was flat year-to-year, which is a 3-point improvement from last quarter's rate. The improvement came equally from the U.S. and Canada. And once again, we had strong performance in Latin America. Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Western Europe, in particular, showed some stability while Eastern Europe, led by Russia, had double-digit declines.
In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 4%. Within that, Japan's revenue was up 5%, with good performance across hardware, software and services. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth with good execution by the team in Japan. Consequently, the AP decline was driven by the growth market countries.
So now let me comment on the major markets versus growth markets globally. Major markets year-to-year performance improved by almost 2 points from last quarter. In fact, this is the best major market performance since the first quarter of 2012. Our challenge this quarter was in the growth markets, which were down 5%. Though we continue to gain share and deliver strong growth in Latin America, as well as Middle East and Africa. We fell short of our objectives in the market in other regions. Our performance in growth markets was driven about half by execution and half by a pause as China moved through the process to develop its new economic plans.
China was down 22%. We experienced a slowdown in demand across the board, but most significantly, in hardware which was down about 40% and which makes up about 40% of our business in China. While we had some execution problems during the third quarter, we were impacted by the process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan, which will be available mid-November. In the meantime, demand from state-owned enterprises and public sector has slowed significantly as decision-making and procurement cycles lengthened. We believe that changes will take time to implement and do not expect demand in China to pick up until after the first quarter of next year.
Now let me put this in context. The hardware performance in China accounted for all 5 points of the constant currency decline in the growth markets and for 1.2 of the 1.6 points of constant currency decline for all of IBM.
Regarding execution in the growth markets, we understand the issues and have already taken management actions to improve performance. Looking forward, we have confidence that we can get this back on track. We expect a change in trajectory starting in the fourth quarter, and we'll be back to growth early in 2014.
Turning now to IBM's revenue by segment. In GBS, we improved our year-to-year constant currency growth rate to 5%, led by Consulting and Systems Integration. Our GTS performance is a modest improvement from last quarter's rate, reflecting the addition of SoftLayer to our portfolio. Our software revenue grew 2% at constant currency, led by Key Branded Middleware at 4%. Performance was stronger in the infrastructure layer, including solutions for data management, application server, security, mobile and Rational development tools. As I said earlier, in Systems and Technology, the deceleration in our performance was primarily driven by the growth markets.
In Global Financing, we had growth in both financing revenue, which is driven by client asset growth, as well as new sales. The return on equity in our financing business was 38% this quarter.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was flat year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. Currency contributed 1 point of decline driven by translation. So consequently, our base expense was better by 2 points.
Now I'll comment on a few items that had year-to-year impacts. Last year, we had a significant charge for workforce rebalancing activity. We also had a significant gain from the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business.
So looking at the year-to-year dynamics, in SG&A, workforce rebalancing is down nearly $400 million year-to-year, and in other income and expense, divestiture gains are down over $450 million.
Next, parts of our business didn't perform as expected, and as you know, IBM has a pay-for-performance culture. Accordingly, performance-related compensation across both cost and expense was down about $175 million year-to-year.
Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the third quarter, the hedge activity was fairly neutral in the period, though on a year-to-year basis, hedging gains were down about $80 million, with about 3/4 in expense and the balance in cost. While there have been a number of currency movements year-to-year, we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen. Because our business in Japan is dominated by local services without cross-border cash flows to hedge, the impact falls largely to the bottom line. The year-to-year profit impact was more significant in the third quarter and would continue at current spot rates through the first quarter of next year.
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Services. This quarter, the 2 Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, declining 3% as reported, but, at constant currency, returned to growth of 1%. Pretax profit was up 17% and pretax margin expanded by 3.3 points. Total backlog was $141 billion, up 2% at spot rates, and up 6% at constant currency. Backlog again grew across both the transactional and outsourcing businesses.
Turning to the 2 segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency. This represents a 1 point improvement over last quarter's year-to-year performance. In outsourcing, we continue to see a decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts and from the structural work we did previously on low-margin contracts. Our Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 2% at constant currency and grew in both major and growth markets.
GTS delivered 12% pretax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pretax margin by 2.8 points. Margin expansion was driven by lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges and some savings from second quarter rebalancing action, along with tough-minded spend actions and continued efficiency improvements.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue of $4.6 billion was flat as reported and up 5% at constant currency. That's up from 2% last quarter. With this performance, GBS gained share.
From a geographic perspective, there is growth across the portfolio, led by North America and Japan. Europe returned to growth for the first time since the beginning of 2012.
Looking at the GBS business by our 2 major categories, we had good results across the portfolio. Within the digital front office, we delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives: business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. And within our back office solutions that we call the Globally Integrated Enterprise, we again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.
Turning to profit, GBS grew 28% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 4.4 points. The year-to-year profit drivers included: lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges, savings from second quarter rebalancing and tough-minded spend actions.
So to wrap up Services, we returned to revenue growth this quarter; our growth initiatives continued to perform; we grew pretax profit and expanded profit margins and we're entering the next quarter with solid backlog growth, up 6% at constant currency.
Software Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 1% or 2% at constant currency. Segment pretax income of $2.4 billion was up 2%. Our strategic Key Branded Middleware revenue grew 3% or 4% at constant currency and held share. I'll take you through the drivers by brand.
WebSphere was up 1% at constant currency. Within WebSphere, we saw strength in mobile and good performance in application server. Information Management software grew 3% at constant currency. Our distributed database had a good quarter with double-digit growth. Tivoli software was up 3% at constant currency, driven by storage growth in our portfolio of security solutions. Our security business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. The acquisition of Trusteer in the third quarter extends our data security capabilities further into cloud and mobile environments. Rational grew 14% at constant currency. Rational's DevOp solution leverages IBM's cloud capabilities for the rapid and iterative deployment of software. Social Workforce Solutions grew 15% driven by Kenexa, which provides cloud-based recruiting and talent management.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we have a strong pipeline in Software. Consequently, we expect improvement in Software revenue growth and double-digit growth in profit.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.2 billion was down 17%. The growth markets' performance drove 2/3 of the revenue decline, about half of which was China. This impacted each of the hardware brands.
System z grew 7% at constant currency, with double-digit growth in the major markets. MIPS were up 56%, driven again by specialty engines, which were up more than 90%. During the quarter, we successfully launched the new zEnterprise midrange server, with over 50% more capacity than its predecessor.
POWER revenue was down 37% at constant currency. High-performance computing accounted for 10 points of the decline. To improve future performance, we're continuing to invest to expand our POWER platform to go after the Linux opportunity, which is now larger than UNIX and growing more rapidly. System x was down 16% at constant currency.
Storage hardware revenue was down 10% at constant currency. The decline was driven by the growth markets. In the major markets, storage revenue was up. Our Storwize products again delivered double-digit growth, and we also continue to grow our flash solutions. These were offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings and softness in the high end.
PureSystems continue to gain momentum. In the major markets, we grew more than 30% sequentially. Globally, we shipped over 2,000 systems in the third quarter, with over 8,000 total shipments since announcement.
Moving on to the cash flow analysis. We discuss our free cash flow performance excluding the change in Global Financing receivables. We do this because we consider the financing receivables as an investment to generate returns, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. As I mentioned earlier, our Global Financing business is delivering a terrific return on equity.
This quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, down $900 million year-to-year. There were 3 key drivers of the year-to-year decline: higher workforce rebalancing payments for the second quarter program; changes in sales cycle working capital; and our operational performance. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated $6.6 billion, which is down $2 billion year-to-year. Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.6 billion to acquire 7 companies, including 4 in the third quarter, the largest of which was SoftLayer.
We've returned just over $11 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out $3 billion in dividends and spent over $8 billion in gross share repurchase to buy back almost 40 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.2 billion. Total debt was $36.2 billion, of which $25.8 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $10.4 billion, effectively flat year-to-year, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 39%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet to support our business objectives.
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 4% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.15 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, we had positive contribution from gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, mitigated by a higher E/R. Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
So to wrap up, in the third quarter, the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas, better business mix, yield from productivity initiatives, reductions in spending and compensation, discrete tax benefits and effective use of cash all enabled us to deliver 10% operating EPS growth. Clearly, we need to improve performance, predominantly in the growth markets. And keep in mind that we're dealing with a couple of substantial headwinds. We absorbed a significant impact from currency in these results and are affected by the pause during the development of China's new economic plans.
As far as the growth markets are concerned, we will be dealing with the China impact for another couple of quarters. More broadly, in growth markets, we are taking management actions to improve execution and are confident we can get it back on track and improve our performance starting in the fourth quarter, driving to mid-single-digit performance in growth markets in 2014.
Looking to the future, we expect continued strong performance in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud. These not only address key market trends, but they drive a higher mix of software and, consequently, a higher margin. We'll continue our transformation over the long term to a higher margin annuity base and even stronger business profile. And so with this improved operational performance, continued momentum in our growth initiatives and the flexibility in the financial model, we're maintaining our view of at least $16.25 of operating EPS in 2013 and remain confident in our ability to achieve at least $20 in 2015.

Coming into the quarter, Mark, you talked about mid-single-digit revenue growth in software and somewhat stronger services growth than you posted. So even aside from the hardware issues in China, it seems like things are a bit weaker. Where do you attribute that to? Is it just demand as we're hearing at a lot of enterprise companies? How much of it is execution because in the third quarter last year, you had some software execution problems. You're talking about some growth market execution problems. I guess, how much is under your control, how much isn't?",99

So let's start with software. I agree, we did not have the software quarter we were looking for. If you look historically, both for the IBM Corporation and certainly for the software business, third quarters tend to be difficult for us, fourth quarters tend to be strong. So I would expect based on all of the work we've done to look at their pipeline going into the fourth that we would maintain that relative characteristic and see our Key Branded Middleware with growth rates in kind of mid-single digits and double-digit profitability in the fourth quarter. If you look at the characteristics, once we get to the end of the year, obviously, quotas close out December 31, so there's an awful lot of energy in the sales organization as we close the year. But we have typically had the same pattern as you have seen, if you go back the last number of years, with the difficult third followed by a stronger fourth quarter. And I think that has a lot to do with our overall software performance. Now when you go to the services organization, however, I would say that, first of all, with backlog up 6%, that's pretty good performance. And if you look at the GTS business, I mean GTS did improve revenue, albeit on a more marginal base, but the GTS are long-extended contracts. It is kind of the battleship to turn here. On the other hand, GBS at 5%, I think that's pretty good. And if we look back on the GBS profile over the last 4 quarters, they've taken that business from minus 2% to a plus 5%. And as we look at their strength as they have built that backlog, we see closer to plus 7% as we go into the fourth quarter. And in both cases, returning services, as we had said, to growth in the third quarter and both third and fourth generating double-digit profitability. So I do think we saw the kind of cadenced improvement on our services business. I think on the software side, we wrestled with this kind of typically weaker third followed by a, what we are looking to be, stronger fourth.",381

I understand some of the specific issues this quarter around China. But if we kind of step back and think about what's been happening at IBM over a longer period recently. You've had 6 straight quarters where revenue growth has been negative. You've missed consensus revenue expectations for 7 straight quarters. If it weren't for a huge tax benefit this quarter, it would've been a very significant EPS miss, which has occurred to IBM in the last couple of quarters and hadn't occurred in 7 or 8 years. So if we step back beyond the current quarter, we see a pattern of financial performance that is way out of whack with your historical model, lower revenue growth and operating profit growth that is dramatically lower, but has been buttressed by tax rate and not including workforce rebalancing charges. So my simple question is, what's changed in the last 6 or 7 quarters? Has there been a -- less of a focus on execution that had to do with the change in leadership at the top? Are you seeing new secular forces? I think it's very easy to explain away a given quarter, but 6, 7, 8 quarters in a row begins to make a trend. And so perhaps you can try and address what you think is happening more broadly and whether we should be thinking about a financial model that is more like 0% revenue growth and something less than double-digit earnings growth on a sustained basis.",262

Toni, it's always a very good question. Let me answer your question by giving you a framework for how I would look at that in 2013, then moving into 2014 to -- your framework for the dynamics and how we intend to deal with them. So first of all, to state the obvious, I mean, we never said that the roadmap progression would be a straight line. And we're assessing our progress on a year-to-year basis versus the $16.25, at least for the year. I will say that to me, and I think we have stated this repeatedly, that tax and shares are operational cadence for us, but I do not debate your point that we have had some very discrete difficulties as we've gone through the quarters, which I want to address now. Now I would say broadly that plus or minus, the software and services portion of our business has been marching down the field in kind of the structure that we're looking for. We talked a little bit earlier, GBS has made very good progress. We got backlog up at 6% at constant currency. We did get some lift in our GTS business, both generating profitability. So I don't think the services business have shown a substantially different vector and, in fact, are improving as we go forward. Software, I agree with the point, a difficult third quarter. I got to say, in that software organization, just like for the broader IBM, we tend to have more difficulty in third quarters and stronger fourth quarters. But to be specific to your question, what's changed, we had 2 major headwinds that really hit us hard this year. So on a year-to-date basis, we had $1 billion of year-to-date decline in profitability from our hardware business. Now that is quite substantial. That is quite substantial as a headwind. And on top of that $1 billion of profit decline in our hardware business, we had a $500 million year-to-date -- year-to-year impact from currency. Now that's clearly the theoretical upper limit. But given the fact that the bulk of that impact is from the movement of unhedged currencies, like the impact from the yen, that presented us with a pretty stiff challenge. So in a way, if you look at the bottom line performance in 2013, the elements of financial flexibility, whether that be tax, both the discrete items that we recognized in the third quarter or the improvement of the rate, which extends through 2014 or the benefit of share repurchase, has helped, along with the operational performance that we did see from software and services, helped mitigate, absorb and partially offset this very strong headwind we had in the hardware business. In the currency now, if you look at currency, currency at current spot rates should right itself as we go into the second quarter of next year. Now obviously, we'll all be tracking that over time. That's what the math would say. So that leaves us with the impact from hardware. So if you look at the hardware content, the point we were making in the third quarter performance that in that hardware base of business, the kind of nexus of erosion that we had was really in China. Now China, broadly in a year, accounts for about 5% of IBM and about 40% of that business is hardware. But the hardware business across those elements of the product line, excepting zSeries performance, it was down substantially. And we were talking 40%, 50%, enormous reductions on a year-to-year basis, in a geography where we tended to see growth rates. You can see that in the compare we had for China last year, up 19%. So up 19% last year driven heavily by really strong performance in our hardware-based business, this year, down. And you got to look at that and say, what significantly accounts for that? And I would say, quite honestly, if you look at the elements in China, and as we have worked with the team in China, there simply has been a substantial impact as the process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan takes shape. And that is going to be announced and available, we think, in November or probably would take some time to implement. So I think we're looking at a couple of quarters. But once that economic plan is announced, adds clarity to the market, we should see, I think, and certainly within our team, a recovery in the demand pattern for state-owned enterprises and public sector. Now if you look at the profile that we would be counting on that generating next year, we'd be looking for the growth markets with that new economic plan in China to recover and generate something mid-single digits. And in fact, if you took that hardware impact that we saw in China, I mean frankly, that hardware impact in China is all of the decline in our growth markets unit. So I think that's a rational set of objectives. And with that performance in our growth markets unit next year, again back the mid-single digits as we get the better definition on the economic plan in China and improved performance across the other regions in GMU, that, too, should help us suspend the erosion that we're seeing in our hardware business. So on a year-to-year basis, I frankly think we have set a pretty low bar to establish our financial structure and our operations objectives for the other business units, expecting only flat year-to-year profitability which clearly, this year is a loss. Now one would think we could be doing better than that. But on a flat basis, for the STG business in 2014 compared to 2013 with our new pSeries POWER8 product set to address the Linux opportunity, which you know is largest than UNIX opportunity and growing, better growth in volume behind our PureFlex business, which is picking up steam and broader exposure to our flash memory content within storage, that should help us rightsize it, even though in the mainframe side of the house, we'll be driving more towards a microcode upgrade part of the zSeries cycle. All of that clearly complemented in 2014 by the benefit on a year-to-year basis of the workforce rebalancing yield that we've already taken, which in '14, will be more than enough to offset the year-to-year challenge from the tax discrete items that we saw this year, complemented additionally by the financial flexibility that we have to drive share repurchase.",1089

And I think when we look at this longer term, given how sharp some of the downturn or how sharp some of the shortfalls are in this segment for you, what gives you confidence that the problems in Asia-Pac, in the growth markets specifically, aren't secular in nature for IBM?",101

I think let me give this framework for the explanation. First of all, if you look at the performance that we saw this quarter in growth markets, revenue at constant currency down 5% compared to the IT growth rate in the growth markets of plus 5%, we've got about a 10-point gap there. So we did a very kind of simple back of the envelope analysis on that to distinguish what was macro and what was execution. And we said, well, if we took that big STG erosion that we saw in China that we would conclude is highly related to the process of developing the Chinese economic policy, if we snap that out, the growth markets would've been flat. And so to us, that sounds like about 5 of that 10-point gap to the industry coming from a macro environment issue. The other 5, we think, is pure execution. Now I would argue that you've seen our ability to put leadership teams on the ground to turn our performance in geographic. Now the hallmark in that respect for us is Japan. Japan has really turned around in a very big way under the leadership of Martin Jetter and his team that engage quite broadly and we've seen that perform quarter after quarter with that leadership capability. So in the growth markets organization, the leadership team that established that to begin with and drove that organization is now back in the cockpit led by Bruno Di Leo and his leadership team. They know how to get this done. They helped build this to begin with. So I think that's an explanation on the macro environment impact that we saw that we would say accounted for about half that differential to the industry, as well as the leadership differential and the actions that IBM has taken to address those on the execution element.",313

Is the free cash flow year-to-date in your view a good proxy for the 2013 decline, or do you think you go up or down in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, are you still comfortable given where we are and where the fundamentals of the business are with the free cash flow target outlined in the 2015 roadmap?",74

Let me address that starting with where we see ourselves in 3Q and year-to-date basis. So year-to-date, we are down $2 billion in free cash flow. And if you look at the drivers behind that, that would be broken down into the operational performance, obviously, of the business, our performance on sales cycle, working capital. Those 2, I would say, are execution-based. And then the complement being the impact that we've seen on cash tax. We do see that now as more in a little over $1 billion range. We recently saw it more like $2 billion. We now think it's more like $1 billion in the cash side of our workforce rebalancing. But that's only the elements of that year-to-date performance. I think more importantly is how we see that full year 2013 free cash flow, which will be down on a year-to-year basis, how we see that moving through the roadmap to 2014 and 2015. So in 2014, based on that same kind of structured model that I described to you, we would see our free cash flow, accepting the impact of cash taxes, growing at a rate of about 15% to 20%. Now cash taxes, we believe, now in 2014 will be a headwind of about $2 billion. But even including cash taxes, we would see our free cash flow growing by a little over $1 billion. So the operational profile within that, in that 15% to 20% range, and on that basis, free cash flow growing faster than net income. Going to '15, we would see that free cash flow, now including the inclusion of cash taxes, growing at about 15% to 20%. Again, free cash flow growing more rapidly than net income. And in '15, that cash taxes should be a tailwind as opposed to the headwind that we've been wrestling with in '14 and '15. Now if you took that back and say, well, let's structure that around the financial roadmap. As you remember, the roadmap, we detailed what we saw in the usage of free cash flow and said we expected to spend about $90 billion between share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions. That $90 billion on a gross basis is about $85 billion, $86 billion on a net basis. And the free cash flow that we see across the roadmap is also in that range of $85 billion plus or minus. So over the roadmap, those 2 relatively balanced, and that's not including cash inflow that we would think would be likely from potential divestitures. So with that basis, even though we had a disappointing free cash flow performance this year, we still see the overall construct through the roadmap supporting those original objectives. Now across those elements of share buyback, dividends and acquisitions, there is fungibility, right? You've seen that even in our to-date performance on the first 2.5 years of the roadmap, more share repurchase, a little less acquisition. So I don't think the category or the cadence across the years will be linear. But I think the aggregate is still very, very relevant and the best guide for you to use as you look at our usage of free cash flow.",537

I think what our challenge tonight is going to be, when we go back to investors and we look at the base of 2013 and we exclude all the tax benefits, we're talking about a number that might be around $16 and we're talking about trailing free cash flow of around $14.60. So eventually, free cash flow and earnings tend to migrate to each other and then let's just forget free cash flow and start at the $16 base. You got to grow 12% each year to get to $20. And I'm just thinking, with the acceleration that we got to convince people that you're getting there. So I'm wondering, what is the confidence level in the $20 based on that, based on that kind of a conversation that we need to have with investors to get you there and how do we get them there?

Really, the basis for that trajectory to 2015 involves: Number one, in 2014, stabilizing our STG, our hardware business, on a profitability basis to be relatively flat on a year-to-year basis, we've absorbed this year that $1 billion decline on a year-to-year basis, and I showed how I thought that really did correlate based on the work the team has done to the issues we had in China. But we believe it should be a very reasonable objective to stabilize on a year-to-year basis relatively flat profitability with STG. And if we're able to do that, the vehicle for that being new product announcements across our STG businesses, as well as returning growth markets to mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. Once we get through this process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan, those 2 capabilities are the primary elements to stop the erosion in profitability in that part of our business and then have the operational profile for software and services show through the bottom line. Additionally, this impact that we've wrestled with on currency. Again, Ben, on a year-to-date basis, a $500 million headwind that's kind of a theoretical limit, that should reverse and actually be a tailwind in the second quarter of next year. And then lastly, if you look at the complement to help offset the year-to-year headwind from the discrete tax benefits that we have in 2013, really, the flow-through of the workforce rebalancing yield that we've already completed should be more than enough to neutralize that and allow us to take really the financial flexibility or the strength of the balance sheet to complement that operational performance and maintain that trajectory in '14 on our way to at least $20 in '15.",293

First of all, on the hardware base, my point was to drive the STG hardware business to flat profitability, I agree with you. I don't think that's going to be necessarily flat revenue, but flat profitably based on all the work that we've done. Now I will say in that skew in 2014 for our hardware business, that would probably be driving in the first half down a couple of hundred million, and the second half up a couple of hundred million. But relatively flat profitability, not revenue on the STG side of the business. Now if I can I'd point out that's a relatively low bar given the level of profitability that the hardware business will have generated in 2013. On the services side, I mean, I do think it's worth clearly recognizing the real contribution that the GBS team has driven by constantly improving that backlog performance and then yielding that backlog outperformance right in the revenue line. And let's go back on that 4-quarter march that they've been on. They've been kind of methodically driving a couple of points improvement every quarter. That's why we feel it's a very confident basis for us to look at 7% revenue growth for GBS in the fourth quarter. And if we have 7% revenue growth for that platform with ongoing improvement in the backlog, given the momentum they've been able to drive, with the faster take-up of backlog to revenue for GBS, that should really assist us as we go into 2014. But I think within that, the linchpin assumptions that we need to drive for '14, and '14 being the platform for moving into '15, is stabilize that STG business at the low level of profitability we see this year, return GMU back to mid-single-digit growth as we get through the process surrounding China's development of their broad-based economic reform plan, allowing the improving momentum we see on the services business, as well as a return to their more consistent profile in software business to help drive that operational performance.",342

And then specifically just on the software side, I think it was up 1% year-over-year. I would've thought it would be up more like 4% or 5%. Was there any China-centric headwinds on the software side as well for you this quarter?",101

The China issue was predominantly an impact to our hardware business. The software issue, I think, is this ongoing challenge that we typically have in third quarters going into a stronger fourth quarter. So that's the way I would look at this. Now if you look at the magnitude of improvement that we're looking at for our growth markets content going into the fourth quarter and then into next year, that profile going into 2014, remember about 1/2 of it we said we thought was macro driven that should resolve itself, we believe, as China establishes its broad-based economic reform plan in March of '14. And the second half of that, really driven by the leadership. And we do need to see that trajectory improve as we go into the fourth quarter to get back to mid-single-digit performance in 2014, consistent with the industry.",157

Does it change the look of GTS? And particularly, given that it's coming at the same time, you also announced the planned divestiture anyway of the customer care BPO business for a relatively low multiple. I mean, when you combine those 2 things, I mean, are you sort of driving a more aggressive change to the look of GTS or is it just the fact that one's high-growth, high multiple; one's low growth, low multiple?",123

I mean, the divestiture was really a divestiture that was complementary to IBM and to the partner that we're working with. For us, it was an area that we thought we could get better capability, the partner and the partners' capability and then we would apply our energies to broader intellectual property capability. If you look at the cloud content and the SoftLayer content that we see within cloud, we crossed kind of a milestone for us this quarter with over $1 billion of cloud revenue. The content within that, about $610 million of it was the hardware and software and implementation services for us to establish cloud-based operations within our customer set, and then $460 million of that was cloud-delivered services and solutions, including SoftLayer. Now if you look underneath the dynamics in that cloud-delivered services and solutions content, most of those customer engagements for us turned out to be incremental. And you remember, when we started the roadmap content to drive cloud to be about $7 billion by 2015, we said that we thought only about $3 billion of that would be incremental due to the cannibalization of base. And so we're always using that as kind of a checkpoint. Actually, we didn't see that in our own profile. Most of that content was indeed new and incremental. So it does provide a very strong platform for us within GTS and a platform for moving to the market for other business units. I will tell you that since we have made that acquisition, I have heard nothing but very positive statements from our business units on the capability and the added dimension that it applies to IBM and to GTS.",287

Let me talk about that explicitly. So if you look at our U.S. federal business, Katy, our U.S. federal business is a little less than 3% of our total revenue mix. So as you look at the risk within that 3%, it turns out that really, the bulk of our federal business is either not exposed or even if it is in a category that is exposed, it's been deemed essential. So as we look at it, it's kind of a time dimension. So if we close on that issue in October, it really shouldn't be much of an impact to IBM. If it extends through to November, then it will be an issue, but something we ought to be able to deal with and manage through. If this extends into December, then it's going to get to be a meaningful number, say, around $0.05 that we would probably not be able to contain. But it is kind of a time-based exposure that we're tracking quite carefully. The advantage that we do have to keep that total down is to how much of our business is, in fact, deemed essential.",191

You mentioned tax rate of 23%. Is that what you mean going forward for every quarter of kind of for the full year, which means that Q4 then have to go up to something like 30%? But the bigger question is, following up on the last question about the federal government, did that also impact your signings and bookings in new businesses coming in also? I would imagine there's kind of a big pause there of new business being handed out.",86

Let's take the bookings issue first. If you look at the business unit that would be most impacted by that exposure, it would be our GBS business. But I have nothing but very positive observations to their performance, both on driving performance on a global basis, generating profitability from that growth and increasing their backlog. So though that would be the area most exposed, you sure wouldn't see it in the results. As far as the tax rate, what I'm referencing is the average tax rate that we would assume before discrete items. And that tax rate would be the tax rate for the year and for the quarter going forward for 2013 as well as 2014. But again, that's the tax rate before discrete items.
So let me now just take the opportunity to wrap up. I want to thank you for the questions and the time on the call. Obviously, this was a tough quarter for us, especially in STG and the growth markets. But we're on track to deliver at least $16.25 for the year on an all-in basis. And we believe with the actions we're taking, we'll have stronger operational performance as we go into 2014. In STG, we're going to wrestle with the mainframe. We're up in the first half of next year, but should return to profitable growth in the second half and stabilize hardware profit on a year-to-year basis for the year. That's the game plan. And in growth markets, we'll improve the trajectory to get back to mid-single-digit performance for the 2014 full year, especially after we get through the broad-based economic reform plan that's developing in China, consistent, I think, on a trajectory basis for the growth markets, consistent with the overall industry.
We'll continue to use the overall flexibility of our financial model, including productivity and share repurchase. And I think we're going to see that ongoing operational performance in our software and services business show through then to drive the bottom line. So this keeps us on track to our 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. I want to thank you, again, for joining us. And now as always, it's back to work.",368
