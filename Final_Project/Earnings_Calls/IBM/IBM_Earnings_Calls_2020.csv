We had a solid finish to 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue at actual rates, and it was up 3% at constant currency, excluding divestitures. Our operating gross margin was up over 2 points, which is the best margin expansion in some time. We delivered $4.2 billion of operating net income and $6 billion of free cash flow, and we had $4.71 of operating earnings per share. We also reduced our debt balance by another $3 billion in the quarter for a total reduction of $10 billion since the end of June. This caps off the year with $77 billion of revenue, $12.81 of operating earnings per share and about $12 billion of free cash flow, in line with our expectations.
In 2019, we took a number of actions to strengthen our foundation for the next chapter of our clients' digital reinventions. We acquired Red Hat with the #1 Linux operating system, RHEL, and the leading hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift. We modernized our software portfolio, making it cloud native and optimized for OpenShift. We announced the industry's first public cloud designed specifically for financial services. We expanded our services offerings and skills for the cloud journey, including consulting and technology services for Red Hat and multi-cloud management. We expanded the reach of our Watson AI offerings. And we are leading the industry in our approach to trust and transparency for data and AI. We continue to deliver innovation in areas like our new z15 mainframe and Quantum, and we divested select software and services businesses as we continue to prioritize our investments and optimize our portfolio. With 3% revenue growth, we started to see the benefits in our fourth quarter results.
Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue was up 9%. We had growth in all 3 lines of business, reflecting demand across our software portfolio. We had good adoption of our Cloud Paks, continued growth of Security, and Red Hat again posted strong performance.
In Global Business Services, we had continued growth in Consulting and in application modernization projects as we help our clients on their digital journeys. We're also seeing this in our GBS signings this quarter, including acceleration in new Red Hat engagements.
Global Technology Services revenue was down 4%, in line with the expectations we discussed last quarter. We expanded Global Technology Services gross margin, consistent with our focus on managing the business for margin and profit. And in Systems, we had a good start to our z15 cycle and growth in high-end storage, resulting in double-digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion in this segment.
Across our segments, our cloud revenue growth improved to 23% this quarter, and our cloud revenue for the year was $21 billion. By leveraging our technology, incumbency and expertise to help our clients with their journeys to cloud, it now represents 27% of our revenue.
We know there's a lot of interest in our hybrid cloud approach, including Red Hat, so I'll focus on that upfront. As we've said, the next chapter of cloud will be driven by mission-critical workloads managed in a hybrid multi-cloud environment. This will be based on a foundation of Linux with Containers and Kubernetes.
This quarter, we had strong performance in RHEL and OpenShift. Red Hat's normalized revenue was up 24%, eclipsing $1 billion in a quarter for the first time. In August, we introduced Cloud Paks, cloud-native software that simplifies deployment, reduces operational costs and allows clients to build once and run anywhere. Cloud Paks bring together IBM's middleware, AI, management and security and Red Hat's OpenShift platform. Our strong performance in Cloud Paks this quarter is an example of the synergy from the IBM and Red Hat combination.
As we look forward, the largest hybrid cloud opportunity is in services, advising clients on architectural choices, moving workloads, building new applications and, of course, managing them. With IBM's services expertise in digital reinventions and managing mission-critical workloads, we are well positioned to help our clients on this journey. And now in the fourth quarter, demand for our cloud capabilities continue to ramp, and we're starting to realize the synergies across IBM and Red Hat. We see it in our total cloud revenue which, as I said, was up 23%, and we see it in our combined software revenue growth of 9%.
Across GBS and GTS, we nearly doubled the number of new services engagements, leveraging Red Hat versus last quarter. We're continuing to expand our client base and now have over 2,000 clients using Red Hat and IBM container solutions, and we doubled the number of Red Hat large deals versus the previous quarter with 21 customers with deals greater than $10 million. And as I said, Red Hat's normalized revenue is up 24%. Within that, infrastructure revenue, which is predominantly RHEL, was again up double digits and a point higher than last quarter's rate. We're continuing to take share with RHEL as clients put more of their enterprise workloads on Linux.
Revenue in Application Development and emerging technologies was up over 50% this quarter driven by OpenShift and Ansible. As I mentioned, IBM's Cloud Paks include the OpenShift platform. And so as we sell Cloud Paks, this drives additional Red Hat OpenShift revenue. The transactional nature of Cloud Paks sales accelerated the revenue growth of OpenShift and total Red Hat, reflecting IBM's seasonally strongest quarter.
Our partners also see the value of IBM and Red Hat. For example, we're expanding IBM's partnership with Workday, one of our most important enterprise-wide business platform providers. As Workday grows, it is committed to using the Red Hat portfolio as a key component of a service delivery infrastructure. Workday is also expanding its use of the IBM cloud.
We're also extending our partnership with Box. Box has chosen Red Hat to help power its IT infrastructure and Watson as its preferred AI provider for intelligent business processes. IBM and Box are also working together to deliver joint solutions focused on governance, security and AI. And so we're off to a great start with Red Hat with solid revenue trajectory and expanding client base, both good indicators of our clients' confidence in the value of IBM and Red Hat together.
So let me turn to IBM's key financial metrics. Similar to last quarter, IBM's revenue, profit and operating earnings per share reflect the impact of Red Hat's noncash transaction-related activity and adjustments. Our revenue of $21.8 billion was up more than $3.7 billion sequentially. That's above the high end of the range we discussed in October. Strong transactional performance drove our 3% year-to-year revenue growth. With the contribution from our high-value software and systems, our operating gross margin was up 230 basis points, and our gross profit dollars were up 5%.
Our operating expense was up 15%, reflecting the impact of Red Hat and significant investments we're making to strengthen our foundation for chapter 2 and deliver sustainable revenue growth. The majority of the increase, 10 of the 15 points, is driven by acquisitions and divestitures. This includes Red Hat's operational spending and higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on. The 10-point increase also reflects a year-to-year benefit from divested businesses, including a gain of about $135 million associated with a divestiture completed in the fourth quarter. But to be clear, the benefit from the divestiture gain is more than offset by the investments we're making in innovation and in go-to-market capabilities.
Over the last couple of quarters, we've had higher spending for our z15 launch, for the containerization of our software and for research in areas like Quantum. And you see that in higher base expense across SG&A, research and development, which, together with lower IP income, drove 4 points of our expense increase. Our operating tax rate in the quarter reflects a full year rate of about 9% versus the all-in operating tax rate of 9% to 10% we previously discussed.
Looking at our free cash flow, as I said earlier, we generated $6 billion in the quarter and nearly $12 billion for the year. That's 126% of GAAP net income. Our strong cash generation and focus on capital allocation leaves us with a stronger balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of about $9 billion and improved debt profile with $10 billion of debt reduction in the second half.
So now I'll turn to the segment results, starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software, which was up 9% this quarter. We had growth across all 3 lines of business of Cloud & Data Platforms, Cognitive Applications and Transaction Processing Platforms. And cloud revenue in this segment was up over 75%, demonstrating good adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions, including Red Hat and Cloud Paks.
Looking at the business areas, Cloud & Data Platforms revenue was up 20% this quarter. This is one area we're starting to see the synergies of bringing IBM and Red Hat together. We had broad-based traction across a suite of Cloud Paks that addresses workloads from automation to data to integration. Clients are realizing the benefits of hybrid cloud with this containerized middleware and data platform software portfolio, including faster deployment and improved automation.
Cognitive Applications grew this quarter, reflecting the strength of our AI-led software solutions, including areas like security and IoT. We are continuing to drive new innovation in these areas. In November, we launched a Cloud Pak for Security, and early client reaction has been positive. This offering allows clients to integrate their security tools and connect to existing data sources, enabling them to resolve security incidents more quickly using open standards. This is the way we believe companies will effectively handle security in the hybrid cloud era and get more value for what they've already invested in cybersecurity.
In IoT, we announced Maximo Asset Monitor. This is a new AI-powered monitoring solution designed to help maintenance and operations leaders better understand and improve the performance of their high-value physical assets. This new offering extends the Maximo suite deployed in nearly 100 countries and recognized by IDC as a leader for enterprise asset management applications.
And then in Transaction Processing Platforms, revenue also grew this quarter. This performance reflects the value we provide clients managing critical workloads and their preference for predictability in IT spend. While not directly correlated, new innovation like the z15 mainframe bolsters clients' confidence and drives commitment to our platform for the longer term.
Looking at profit for this segment, the decline in pretax margin was driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition. We are pleased with the momentum in Cloud & Cognitive Software in 2019. Revenue was up 6% for the year driven by the hybrid cloud strategy, modernization of our software portfolio and the strength of IBM and Red Hat together.
Moving to Global Business Services. Our revenue was flat in the quarter and up for the year. In GBS, we bring together industry and technical expertise to help clients with their digital reinventions. As we enter chapter 2, clients are making architectural choices and embarking on application-led transformations. We've been investing in offerings and capabilities to help advise clients and move their applications to a hybrid multi-cloud.
Against this backdrop, our Consulting revenue grew 4% driven by services that enable each phase of our clients' digital journey. We again had growth in application modernization and development, next-generation enterprise applications, like S/4HANA and Salesforce, and in offerings that use AI to unlock new opportunities and realize productivity improvements. We see this at ExxonMobil where GBS iX partnered with a client to create its recently announced Exxon Mobil Rewards+, the all-in-one loyalty and payment application, which is hosted on the IBM Cloud.
Our Application Management performance reflects continued revenue growth across the offerings that build and manage cloud applications. The year-to-year decline in AMS reflects strong prior year performance driven by the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. In Global Process Services, revenue declined as demand is shifting from traditional BPO offerings to new business platforms around intelligent workflows.
Overall, we had good signings performance across all 3 lines of business in GBS with strong demand in Digital Strategy and iX, cloud application development and modernization and offerings around intelligent workflows. We more than doubled our Red Hat signings sequentially and had 50 new client engagements in the quarter with companies such as Honda, Toyota and Vodafone.
Turning to profit, GBS gross margin was 27%. While this is flat year-to-year, we had margin contribution from yield on our contract delivery improvements, mix shift to higher-value content and currency benefit from leveraging our global delivery resource footprint. This was offset by investments we're making in capacity and offerings to capture the market opportunity. Overall, GBS had another solid year with full year revenue growth of 2% and gross margins expanding by almost 1 point.
In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 4%, consistent with our expectations as we came into the quarter. We again had year-to-year declines due to lower client business volumes, impacting some of the more traditional labor-based managed services. We are taking actions to accelerate the shift to higher-value segments of the market opportunity. We are introducing new managed services offerings for public and private cloud in areas like cybersecurity, data management and hybrid orchestration. We are investing in joint services offerings across GBS and GTS and deploying joint go-to-market capability as clients look for solutions across applications and infrastructure. We are expanding our cloud data center footprint, and we are taking structural actions to improve our cost competitiveness while deploying a more asset-based delivery model.
Our incumbency is a huge differentiator as the shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud accelerates given our intimate knowledge of our clients' industry, business and regulatory requirements. An example is the first financial services-ready public cloud that I mentioned earlier. We developed this in collaboration with Bank of America, leveraging our knowledge of the financial services industry environment to address the requirements for regulatory compliance, security and resiliency.
We continue to have solid growth in our cloud offerings in GTS with 13% growth in cloud revenue and double-digit growth in cloud signings. This quarter, clients such as Banco Sabadell and Broadridge are turning to IBM to enable their transition to cloud. At Banco Sabadell, IBM will modernize the bank's IT environment. We're bringing together IBM services and Red Hat OpenShift to deploy new cloud-native applications and modernize existing ones while meeting the bank's security and regulatory requirements. And at Broadridge, we are moving their mission-critical workloads to the cloud. This solution will leverage our deep financial services industry expertise and open source capabilities to allow Broadridge to provide industry-leading solutions.
Turning to profit. We had good gross margin performance in GTS. Our year-to-year gross margin expansion of 20 basis points was driven by continued scale-out of our public cloud, the mix of our portfolio and our productivity actions. We had the largest sequential improvement in pretax margin in some time.
In Systems, revenue was up 16% this quarter. Growth in IBM Z and Storage was mitigated by a decline in Power. IBM Z was up a strong 63%. The performance reflects our first full quarter of z15 and demonstrates the client demand for technology that addresses data privacy and resiliency across hybrid cloud. We shipped the highest MIPS in history this quarter driven by growth in new workloads, and we've already seen broad adoption of the new mainframe across a number of industries and countries. For example, we see large financial institutions migrating their global mainframe footprint to z15 as a critical backbone of their environment and cloud-native strategy. Cloud-native development simplifies building new applications and modernizing existing ones. This gives developers a consistent way to deploy their applications across public and private clouds while taking advantage of the underlying performance, resiliency and security of IBM Z.
And in October, we announced Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Z, bringing together the industry's most comprehensive enterprise container and Kubernetes platform with the enterprise server platforms of IBM Z and LinuxONE. With these unique innovations, IBM Z continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform for our clients.
In the fourth quarter, Power declined. I'll remind you that last year, we launched our next-generation POWER9 processors in the high end as well as completed the rollout of our supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy.
Storage revenue was up 3% led by growth in the high end. In November, we launched the next-generation high-end storage system, DS8900. This new system, tightly integrated with the z15 mainframe, offers industry-leading response times, availability and pervasive end-to-end encryption.
Looking at profit, our Systems pretax margin was up more than 5 points, reflecting the benefit from new hardware launches. New innovation is fundamental to this segment, and we've accomplished a lot this year with the release of both the new z15 mainframe and DS8900 high-end storage.
Now turning to cash. We generated $6.7 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and $6 billion of free cash flow. This capped off a year with $14.3 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing receivables. Our net capital expenditures were $2.4 billion. The year-to-year decline reflects our strategy to deemphasize lower-value content across our services and financing portfolios. It also includes a benefit from real estate sales, which reduced our net CapEx.
We generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion in 2019, in line with our view from the beginning of the year, and our free cash flow realization was 126%. I'll remind you, our free cash flow reflects a few headwinds we've discussed, including the headwind in cash taxes predominantly in the second half; the impact from Red Hat, including pre-closing financing costs; and the impacts of actions we've taken on our portfolio.
Looking at uses of cash. Of course, our largest was the acquisition of Red Hat. We also returned over $7 billion to shareholders this year. This includes $5.7 billion in dividends. We've now increased our dividend per share for 24 consecutive years, and we remain committed to growing our dividend. We also spent $1.4 billion on share repurchases prior to the closing of Red Hat.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with a cash balance of $9 billion. That's down $3 billion from a year ago when we were increasing our cash balance in advance of the Red Hat acquisition.
Now let me spend a minute on our debt profile. With the additional debt we took on to fund the Red Hat transaction, we had $73 billion in debt at the end of June: a combination of Global Financing debt and nonfinancing or, what I'll call, core debt. We suspended our share repurchases at the time of the Red Hat acquisition, allowing us to focus our strong cash generation on debt repayment. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our debt by $3 billion, contributing to a $10 billion reduction in IBM's core debt since June. Our total debt now stands at $63 billion, of which core debt is $38 billion. This puts us on track to achieve a leverage ratio consistent with the mid- to high-single A rating within a couple of years.
I also want to comment on our Global Financing debt, which is fully supported by financing assets with a leverage ratio of 9:1. While there is no meaningful change to debt levels in the second half, we reduced our Global Financing debt by $6.5 billion since the beginning of the year. In February, we announced the wind-down of our OEM commercial financing operations, which we essentially completed by the end of the year. In addition to reducing our debt levels, this improved the overall credit quality of our receivables, which ended the year at a 62% investment grade.
And as we typically do in January, I want to provide an update on the performance of our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen since 2008. And over the last several years, we moved our asset base to a lower-risk, lower-return profile. We had strong returns this year with just under 15% return on assets, well ahead of our expected returns. At the end of 2019, in aggregate, our worldwide-qualified plans are funded at 102%, with the U.S. at 107%. That's up 3 and 2 points, respectively, from a year ago. You can see our retirement-related plans continue to be well funded.
Now let me wrap up with a few comments on 2019 and how this positions us for 2020. We've been focused on the next chapter of our clients' digital reinventions. Upfront, I talked about what we've done in 2019 to strengthen our foundation for chapter 2. We acquired Red Hat, modernized our software portfolio and brought these together to create the leading hybrid cloud platform. We are introducing joint GBS and GTS offerings to help clients on their cloud journeys. We brought new innovations to market. I mentioned the Cloud Paks, the financial services public cloud, z15 and high-end storage. We also have a leadership position in Quantum. And again, we're the leader in U.S. patents. At the same time, we divested some businesses that weren't important to our success in chapter 2.
And now in the fourth quarter, we had good transactional performance across our high-value software and systems. We're starting to realize the synergies from the combination of IBM and Red Hat in Cloud Paks, in services engagements and in Red Hat itself. And in services, we're seeing good growth across GBS and GTS in the services to advise, migrate, build and manage hybrid cloud environments, along with some pressure in the traditional labor-based services.
All together, we delivered revenue growth of 3% this quarter. With our high-value mix and focus on productivity, we expanded our gross margin, and we had strong free cash flow generation. With this trajectory, in 2020, we expect to grow revenue, operating earnings per share and free cash flow and expand operating gross margin. Within that, we'll maintain a high level of investment focused on hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities. We'll drive productivity and take structural actions, especially in our GTS business. And remember, we'll continue to face year-to-year headwinds from the divested businesses, especially in the first half. And our P&L will also still have an impact from the Red Hat noncash purchase accounting adjustments, though less than 2019.
Looking at tax. We expect an operating tax rate in the range of 7% to 9%. Like 2019, that's an all-in rate, including an estimate of discrete items. Putting all this together, we expect to deliver at least $13.35 of operating earnings per share for the year.
Turning to free cash flow. We expect about $12.5 billion in 2020. Within that, we're expecting growth in CapEx as we continue to build out cloud capacity. And as we said back in August, we expect Red Hat to be accretive to free cash flow, and that's net of the incremental interest expense.
With that, let me turn it back over to Patricia for the Q&A.",3856

I know you don't explicitly guide revenues, but can you help, at a high level, bridge the big items that we should be thinking about in 2020 relative to 2019 for revenues and then do the same for free cash flow? I know you touched a little bit on CapEx. But if you could maybe break it down between core business, Red Hat, tax, pension, what are some of the larger puts and takes that we should think about embedded in that $500 million increase year-to-year, that would be great.",105

Thank you, Wamsi, and I appreciate the compliment to all the IBM-ers around that are -- who have been working hard. Let me start out, as we always talk about our guidance, it's the first time we're coming out with 2020 guidance overall. And as we always do, we take into account multiple scenarios, trajectory of our business, operational indices, business plans, et cetera, and all that gives us confidence in the expectation we went out with, with regards to $13.35 at least on EPS and approximately $12.5 billion.
But there are a couple of things underneath that and some of them which you talked about, let me just share some of the color. So first, around currency. Currency, we expect on a full year to be pretty de minimis between 0 and 1 point of headwind, a little bit different with what we've been challenged with the last few years. But most of that's going to be here in the first half and in the first quarter at current spot rates. Second, we've done a lot of work around our portfolio optimization, divested noncore assets, that is going to be about a 1-point impact on the year and a 2-point impact in the first half, very similar to what we just finished in second half of the year. Three, we're continuing to deal with the deferred revenue impairment, and we were very transparent on Investor Day, we gave you the fourth quarter rollout, and that's predominantly a first half statement. Second half, it's lessened. And four, embedded in our results, as we talked about in prepared remarks, we'll go through -- in GTS, we are going to take aggressive structural actions to reposition the business overall.
I would tell you, if you look at the last few years, that we'll probably be on the high end of that. And when you take a look at our guidance on tax, which, again, to be fully transparent, 7% to 9%, that is all-in, including discretes, we expect a tax discrete benefit in the first quarter that will pretty much offset the charge and, on a full year basis, be immaterial. So that's some of the color behind the overall.
Now when you talk about the full year. I mean you look at our guidance in the full year, we will grow revenue, we will grow operating earnings per share, we will grow free cash flow and we will continue to expand margins nicely. And embedded in that will be continued acceleration of our cloud business and continued good growth out of the IBM plus Red Hat together.",437

And again, I know you can't give too much on segment thoughts, but with GTS, signing's down, the short-cycle stuff was an issue last quarter. I'm curious just to your visibility, your confidence in delivering the revenue growth against that what you see with GTS, again, recognizing that you also have some structural actions to do.",69
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137727.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Yes. Well, let's talk about it since we were asked twice. And again, Tien-Tsin, thank you for the question. Overall, as I said, at the IBM level, we expect to grow revenue, operating earnings per share, free cash flow and continue to expand margins. Within that, when you look at it by segment, let me give you some of the colors from a segment. Number one, we continue to have a very strong portfolio and offering lineup in our software base of business. Complemented now with the Red Hat acquisition, you're seeing in our results the synergistic value we're bringing to our clients of bringing IBM and Red Hat together, and we see consistent performance in that segment.
GBS overall, we actually finished pretty strong in GBS, very strong signings in the quarter. We returned that business for the first time in years back to backlog growth, and we're pretty optimistic about accelerated growth in 2020. GTS, to your question, we talked about it 90 days ago. Fourth quarter played out pretty consistent with the guidance we gave 90 days ago. And when you look at our backlog position and where we ended and you look into 2020, we are going to take actions around high-value portfolio optimization around offerings, around go-to-market models, around incentives and changing our operating model in light of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I would see an improving trend in GTS as we move through the year, predominantly in the second half.
And then if you look at Systems, we're off to a very good start. That segment has always been predicated based on bringing new innovation and value to market. Our z15 and new high-end storage, which we brought to market, both grew nicely, value proposition resonating. We expect a very strong first half in both of those. And we'll see, as we get into the second half, how this cycle plays out.",321

Thanks, Matt. I appreciate the question. GBS overall, first of all, we talked about 90 days ago, we were facing a very difficult compare. When you look at fourth quarter last year, I think I'm going off from memory, we grew high single-digit overall. We were double-digit Consulting growth. We returned apps -- Application Management to mid-single-digit growth. And we talked at that time that we had done a lot of work about improving the quality of our delivery and we had achieved significant milestones that were contributing to fourth quarter last year. And oh, by the way, if I remember correctly, our pretax income was up 30% to 40% fourth quarter last year. So we knew what we were entering here in the fourth quarter.
But I'll tell you, overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the GBS base of business for the full year, second year in a row, consistent revenue growth. We grew operating gross profit margins by 90 basis points. We continue to reposition this business to capture the growth in our clients' digital reinventions and journey to cloud. We're seeing nice acceleration in both. And as I just said on the prior question, we finished the year pretty strong in GBS with regards to signings growth, returning overall backlog back to growth, and we see an accelerated GBS positioning going into 2020.
And to your question, that's really led by -- we've talked about the rationale of chapter 2 around hybrid cloud, around a large portion of mission-critical workloads that are going to move to the cloud as we move forward, and hybrid is going to be that destination. I think what you're seeing is the natural early innings of that playing out. And that is represented more so in project-based businesses around cloud advisory, cloud application migration and advisory services. So Consulting is leading the way. But to me, that's the tip of the arrow that's going to lead then AMS. And then eventually, as that matures, our GTS managed services going forward.",340

Is there a risk that that pulled forward any revenue from 2020? And I think you talked about 4% to 5% revenue growth on your August call for 2020, is that something we should still be thinking about?
And then on cash flow, I know a number of people have asked, but maybe you can just draw a bridge between this year and next year. You're up about $0.5 billion. I think you've said Red Hat alone will contribute $0.5 billion. That implies that everything ex Red Hat is flat despite the fact that margins appear to be going up, and you seem quite confident in some of the businesses, so maybe you can also just help with that bridge as well.",141
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137733.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Toni, appreciate the questions overall. Let me try to take each of these in piece parts. First of all, fourth quarter, yes, if you dial back 90 days ago, we talked about our seasonality in our business, and we were looking for a transactional quarter that would take our sequential growth up about $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we achieved above that high end. Now truth be told, all transparency, currency got a little bit better in the quarter. But even with that, we still beat the high end of our guidance overall and, most importantly, returned IBM back to revenue growth.
Now when you look underneath the transactional performance, I would tell you, one, our mainframe, we're off to a normal cycle here in the quarter. We had a very good start, our first full quarter, growing 63%, our highest MIPS shipped in history. So I would tell you that's less about a pull-forward from 2020, that's kind of a normal cycle. And when you get underneath software, we've got good momentum. We spent a lot to invest and modernize our software portfolio, containerize our offerings, make them cloud native and optimize on OpenShift with Red Hat to play out the synergistic value of IBM plus Red Hat. And I think we're seeing very good momentum and adoption in our Cloud Paks here in the fourth quarter.
The only area I would call out, and we've talked about this many times, and that is our Transaction Processing Platforms. We run mission-critical workloads on our systems for our clients. It's high value for our clients. It's high value for IBM. And there's always volatility in that portfolio on when clients choose to commit to our platform for the long term. And you saw in the fourth quarter, we actually did better than our internal expectation. So we're taking a prudent view of that in 2020. But I think that's another instantiation of the innovative value we bring to the marketplace with our systems offerings overall. So that's what I would say with regards to your first question. I'm trying to remember all of them.
Let me go to free cash flow. Very important, we said approximately $12.5 billion. And when you look underneath that, yes, during the Investor Day, we said, over the next 2 years, Red Hat and IBM will deliver $1.5 billion of free cash flow. And oh, by the way, that Red Hat will be free cash flow accretive in year 1, and we are well on our path for that. So when you look at the dynamics of our free cash flow, it's really in a couple of different buckets, a couple of headwinds, a couple of tailwinds. On the tailwinds side, we're going to have operational profit, and we're going to have Red Hat contribution, all-in, net of incremental interest expense, retention, et cetera, will be accretive in year 1. On the tailwind -- or excuse me, the headwinds side, we are going to invest. In 2019, our capital, we were driving a balanced capital allocation process, driving efficiencies out of that. That will wrap in 2019, and we will have a headwind in CapEx in the investing in our business, and we will also have a headwind in cash tax overall.
And when you take a look to your last question around revenue, I would tell you right now, we said in August that Red Hat -- IBM plus Red Hat together would deliver 4 to 5 points. When I look at where the current estimate is and consensus in The Street, I think The Street's pretty reasonable. It's 3% overall. You add at constant currency, with the headwind on the currency at a stronger dollar and you look at our divestitures, we're at mid-single-digit growth. So I think the current estimates out there are reasonable.",644

I was wondering if you could just touch on, this Q1, a time for 17%, 18% of full year's EPS again? Or does that math change a little bit with Red Hat? And then secondly, on the tax rate, just so I get this clear, the delta between the 8% tax rate that you're guiding for versus the 11%, 12% that I think people have in their models, that's essentially all the discrete benefit we get in Q1. Is that fair?",120
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137736.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,18,"Yes, thanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. And let me take each of them. Just quickly, net, you're right, on color on first quarter, it is a little different just given the Red Hat. And if you go back to how we were transparent, and hopefully everyone appreciates this as I go out and talk to investors, we've given you the deferred revenue impairment charge for the first 4 quarters after the closure of the Red Hat transaction. But really, when you look at our first quarter, first, on EPS, we expect EPS from a SKU perspective to be between 14% and 15% of the full year. Underneath that, that is basically, on a historical trajectory, less the Red Hat deferred revenue impairment, which, as we told you, is about $400 million. So a pretty normal SKU, taking into account the Red Hat deferred element.
In terms of revenue, we look at revenue and we see -- again, can't predict currency, we're calling currency between a small impact to about a point impact right now. All that varies depending on our geographic and product mix. But we're seeing right now, at a constant currency level, accelerated growth of about 0.5 point here from fourth quarter to first quarter at constant currency.
And when you take a look at tax rate, very good question. We printed in 2019 8.5% all-in. We guided pretty much right between that, 7% to 9% overall. That does include discretes as we're trying to give you increased transparency in what's in our expectation. But very important to note, as I talked about, we will be taking structural actions to reposition our GTS business from a cost-competitiveness perspective in light of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And unlike last year where we had a funding event with regards to a gain that offset a charge, this year, we're taking a charge and we're going to absorb that through the return of that, so we really don't see a benefit overall as we go forward.",338

First, Jim, you mentioned the possibility of taking structural actions in GTS this year. What might that entail? And then back in August, you had outlined about $1.65 billion of potential revenue synergies post Red Hat. Any context around how much of that you have captured? Should we think about the 4-point acceleration in Red Hat pro forma growth as signaling the type of revenue synergies that you've been able to capture?",75
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137739.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Yes, so let me take the second one first, and we'll talk about synergies. So obviously, as I stated upfront, we're very pleased with the first 6 months here of bringing IBM and Red Hat together. And I think you could see, based on the performance and the acceleration, that we are truly better together. We're delivering the synergistic value to our clients overall. The best way when I look at it -- first of all, the accelerated revenue in Red Hat, up 24% year-over-year is one instantiation.
The second -- and I know many of you out there have been writing and have different models of trying to figure out what's IBM's organic revenue number and so forth, and I've been spending a lot of time with our investors. And let me give you the way we look at it and how we're managing to ensure that we drive the synergistic value of the technology architecture decisions we're making and the go-to-market leverage of our scale and large enterprise presence, which gets at your $1.6-plus billion of synergistic effect. When we look at our business overall, we're looking for the lift and the growth and the acceleration of our overall software business. And when we look at the operational performance of this segment, we look at it on an all-in, historical, normalized basis. And at that level, our software growth accelerated all-in to 3%.
Now what does this reflect, to your question, it reflects, in my opinion, the true demand of our software demand from our clients, including Red Hat, then adjusting out the deferred revenue impairment impact and Red Hat's stand-alone revenue last year. So when you look at what we talked about in Investor Day, we talked about sell more blue, IBM; and we talked about sell more red. The sell more red was our global presence and our scale to accelerate Red Hat overall. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing great progress. We had 21 deals above $10 million, up 2x year-over-year, and half -- over half of those deals were large IBM enterprise clients. So we are seeing the instantiation of the leverage of the IBM side.
And around sell more IBM, I just told you about accelerating software revenue, we have now over 2,000 clients on OpenShift and Cloud Paks. And around services, we've signed hundreds of services, Red Hat engagement deals overall, including several design wins in network cloud providers around 5G that will play out as we go through 2020.",422

And what underlies your confidence that growth should improve as the year progresses given that the GTS turnaround, really truth be told, is probably 8 or 9 quarters in already and taking longer than you anticipated?",57
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137742.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,24,"Okay, David, thank you very much for the question. And let me start with providing some overall context because I think it's important to share what are we seeing in the market and then how that informs our actions. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we printed down 4%, consistent with our expectations and what we talked about 90 days ago as we experienced lower client base business volumes. But it's important to note, GTS, one, has the industry-leading market share position; two, has a global footprint in scale; and three, most importantly, has a very integral role into the integrated value proposition of IBM overall as we run the mission-critical workloads for many of our clients overall. And by the way, you see that playing out in our cloud-based performance in GTS where over on the trailing 12 months, we got over $8.5 billion book of business that's growing double digits. And you heard the significant wins we had in the quarter: Broadridge, Banco Sabadell, Bank of America public cloud, in addition to several Red Hat wins, including what I just said about some design wins with network providers.
But I'll tell you what we're seeing in the marketplace, David, to your point, is clients are making architectural choices. They're embarking on application-led transformation. And we see this opportunity really playing out, as I said earlier, in project-based services: the advice, the build, the migrate, which is very aligned to our GBS business. And by the way, that's why we feel pretty confident in where we ended 2019 and our opportunity in 2020 around GTS. Now if you look at as client adoption matures and it moves through the advisory phase and the application modernization phase, this will naturally extend to our GTS-aligned managed services space, which should scale up over time. And that's why I said more of a second half play as we go forward.
So in light of that, what we're seeing in the marketplace, we are going to take aggressive actions around our GTS business model. We are going to reposition this business for hybrid cloud, investing jointly, integrating GTS and GBS offerings around advice, build, move and manage. We are creating and building skills and investing. And where we see the growth right in front of us, that's starting to scale around cybersecurity management, trust and compliance services, multi-cloud management and, of course, managed services around OpenShift. And second, we are going to integrate our go to market with GBS and our global account teams at the large enterprise level. We're going to take these integrated offerings, leverage now the integrated value and breadth of IBM that can play across the continuum as clients move their journey to the cloud, and we're going to go drive that hard. And in addition, I would tell you, we're going to prove the cost-competitive structure of this business with the actions we're going to take here early in 2020.",493

Now I have one question, and it's probably because I'm just definitely not the smartest one out there, and that's on the signings numbers. That number appears, if my number looks right in the calculation, that it was down year-over-year. Are there some features going on, like maybe larger contracts rolling off or something with timing we should be aware of? Or at some point, shouldn't that revert to be positive? Or if not, why? Kind of what's going on about why everything else is going so well, but the signings number just looks like it just didn't materialize to be up?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137745.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,27,"Sure, Jim. Thanks for your question, appreciate it. And no, you got the numbers right. So let me talk a little bit about signings overall. And more importantly, as I've always said before, signings vary. They're not all equal how they impact backlog, how they impact realization. But if you look at our signings overall, we delivered $14.4 billion. I would tell you internally, that was actually above our expectations. Why? To your point, we were coming off of a very difficult compare last year. Signings are down 9% overall. And when you look underneath it, to my point about all signings are not equal, and you break out large deals from smaller deals, and let me just use $100 million as I've been for the last few quarters here, our large deal signings greater than $100 million were down 34%. That was coming off of last year where we had 19 deals above $100 million predominantly in our GTS base of business, of which many of those were natural extensions and not new logos. That's the point about signings not being equal.
But our smaller deals, less than $100 million, by the way, which is still big, were up double digits both for the quarter and for the half and across both businesses, GTS and GBS. Back to David Grossman's question, I think you're seeing the natural evolution of the early innings of this journey to cloud as we move forward. Now the interesting thing is underneath, we posted over $112 billion worth of backlog, and that backlog was actually up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter. That's one of our largest sequential 3Q-to-4Q backlog increase, by the way, with and without currency, that we've had in quite some time. So I would tell you in that answer, tough compare, large deal focus, but the health of the underlying portfolio growing substantially double digits, both GTS, GBS in less than $100 million.",320

And the clarification is, if you could go once again through the delta on EPS given the tax rate, it does seem as though many of us had expected 3-or-so points higher on the tax, and that works out to be $0.40. So that's a big increase in OpEx. I just want to make sure I've tied that correctly. And then bigger picture, to what extent do you think any of the -- or how much of the changes in the macroeconomic picture affected your outlook for 2020? And that could include trade or what have you.",112
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2020",2020-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,1893253.0,74137748.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,30,"Thank you, Jeffrey, appreciate the question. On the 2020 guidance, we'll reiterate it just to make sure there's absolute clarity here for everyone. When you look at our tax rate, our tax rate in 2019, 8.5%. Our tax rate in 2020, we said 7% to 9%, pretty much right in the middle. So tax year-to-year is not a benefit. We're growing operating EPS year-over-year. When you look at that tax rate, and I'm not going to talk to what each of you have in your own model, but underneath that, we, as we said, are going to take structural actions to reposition our GTS business for the hybrid cloud world. Those structural actions are going to flow through to profit. And when I said those structural actions upfront, I said, if you look at the last few years, we are going to be at the high end of that range of that total charge. There is no coverage for that charge. We are going to absorb the return in our fiscal 2020 and still grow operating earnings per share to at least $13.35, coming off of what we just finished at $12.81. So that's the first question.
Was there a part two? Macro environment. I would tell you, Jeffrey, if you ask me from 90 days ago to today, we've obviously had some clarity around some of the uncertainty that was out there with regards to at least Phase 1 on trade, around Brexit and a few other areas. I have always said, when you have high-value, innovative technology that you can bring to market that creates differentiated competitive advantage for your clients, spending will occur. If anything -- and by the way, I don't think this is a change we've seen throughout '19. CFOs that I talk to, everyone's focused on more so productivity, ROI and predictability of spend. Everyone's trying to lock in what their spend rates are as they move forward. But when you have strong technology like the mainframe that brings differentiated value, people are buying that to actually deliver differentiation for them in a marketplace to win.
So as always, let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. 2019 was an important year for IBM. We had a good end to the year, and we're pleased with the strength and the positioning exiting the year. The acceleration in Red Hat, strong adoption of our Cloud Paks, growth in our cloud-based services, all validate the actions we've taken to position us for growth in 2020.
So I want to thank all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue.",442

First, consistent with our last 2 quarters, IBM's revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily noncash. 
Second, our segment structure for 2020 remains consistent with 2019. So at the beginning of this year, we realigned a couple of offerings between segments, resulting in very modest adjustments. Our results reflect this realignment, and we're providing a view of first quarter 2019 on that recast basis in today's supplemental slides and 2 years of historical recast data on our website. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",319

As you all know, we are in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis. I'd like to pause for a moment and say that my heart goes out to all those dealing with COVID-19. One of the first commitments I made was to be transparent and open, not just with our employees and our clients and partners, but with our investment community as well. In that spirit, I will participate, not just today, but in earnings calls from now on. 
There are a few topics I'd like to cover with you today: first, I'll revisit areas I've talked about; second, I'll tell you about what we have accomplished in the last 2 weeks; and finally, I'll tell you about areas I intend to focus on in the near future, and then I'll quickly touch upon our Q1 results. Let's start with the areas I've talked about. 
I have told our teams, it is essential that we deepen our understanding of our clients' journey to hybrid cloud and AI, which will result in hybrid cloud as the fourth platform. We remain obsessed with continually delighting clients, and we further established IBM as the gold standard for good tech. All these are underpinned by our culture that fosters growth and an entrepreneurial mindset. I see these as our collective priorities.  
I'll move on to what's been done in the last few weeks. Despite the challenges we are facing as a result of the global crisis, we remained steadfast in our commitment to employees, clients and society at large. More than 95% of our 350,000 IBM-ers are working remotely now. In addition, about 8,000 of them remain at essential sites to carry out mission-critical work. As our clients adjust to this new normal, they need a partner they can trust. IBM is that partner. This isn't just about helping our clients navigate the crisis but to ensure that they emerge stronger and more resilient. To that end, we have taken concrete steps to bundle existing offerings to address the shifting needs of clients such as leveraging hybrid cloud, using AI for automation and enabling remote work. 
Another area we've been focusing on has been to mobilize IBM and IBM-ers to help with the global battle against COVID-19. Here are some examples: The computing power, over 360 petaflops that we have helped convene for researchers; the weather channels, COVID-19, country-by-country map, which saw more than 40 million visits in the first week of launch; the AI assistance that can answer citizens' questions about COVID-19, 21 of them live today and nearly 90 being rolled out; and the educational resources available to anyone anywhere. We are doing great work helping the city of New York and are delivering 300,000 tablets with educational software and free cellular data connections that can help students learn remotely. 
When we add this all up, we have done the math. In just a few weeks, we have already committed over $200 million in terms of contribution and volunteer time. I'm extremely proud of IBM's response to COVID-19. 
Now I want to tell you about some areas of focus for the near future. I want to be clear, the ultimate outcome that I am absolutely committed to is growth for our company as we emerge from the pandemic. A key area of focus is to ensure that IBM leads into 2 major transformational journeys our clients are on: cloud and AI. IBM has already built 3 enduring platforms: mainframe, services and middleware. The fourth one is hybrid cloud. Clients, however, need more than a platform. They need our deep industry expertise. This is why the services that clients rely on to build and manage the hybrid cloud platform is a massive opportunity for IBM. It's nearly half of the $1.2 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity. 
IBM, together with Red Hat, have unique sources of competitive advantage we can leverage to win the architectural battle for cloud. There's our open-source and security leadership, our deep expertise and trust, but also the fact that we give clients the unique ability to build mission-critical applications once and run them anywhere. Together with Red Hat, we are establishing Linux, containers and Kubernetes as the new standard. This is winning the architectural battle for hybrid cloud. 
Let's talk a little bit on how we take this to clients. I want IBM-ers to lead with a more technical approach. I want our teams to showcase the value of our solutions as early as possible. Likewise, there must be a relentless focus on quality. Our products must speak for themselves in terms of user experience, design and ease of use. My approach is straightforward: I am going to focus on growing the value of the company. This includes better aligning our portfolio around hybrid cloud and AI to meet the evolving needs of the market. We will continue investing, including acquisitions. As you have seen, we have divested parts of software and services that did not align with our focus areas. This will continue. The past few weeks have catapulted us into the world of virtual selling and remote delivery. These entails new ways of working. This is a reminder we should always be asking ourselves, ""is there a better way to do this?"" If you don't question why you're doing things, you'll never evolve into something better. What's clear is our confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. 
Before turning to Jim, I want to comment on our results. In the first quarter, we had modest revenue growth, that's net of currency and divestitures. We entered the quarter in a good position with momentum from the end of last year. However, in the last few weeks, we faced a shift in client priorities towards the preservation of capital. This impacted software disproportionately, and Jim will comment more on this later. The other parts of our business maintained modest momentum. We're entering this challenging environment from a relative position of strength. Our clients are enterprises that run the most essential processes of the world. Our balance sheet is strong, and Jim is going to take you through that. 
I believe that what we are going through today, with the shift to remote work, automation, application modernization, will accelerate our client shift to hybrid cloud. This gives me immense confidence in our future. So I will turn it over to Jim to take you through the quarter, and then we'll come back at the end for Q&A.",1089

I want to start out by expressing my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by this health crisis, and deep gratitude to the incredible people who have been helping IBM, our clients and the world to deal with this crisis, especially those on the front line. 
Now turning to our first quarter. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue, with modest growth net of currency and divestitures. We had good gross margin expansion, operating earnings per share of $1.84 and continued solid free cash flow. Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, in light of the current environment, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on a few areas. First, on our client base, our portfolio and our financial profile, which you'll see provides some stability to our business. Second, what we saw at the end of the quarter. And then finally, add on to Arvind's comments on what we're doing with our own business to address the current environment. 
IBM has always focused on the enterprise space, and within that, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises. For decades, we have run our clients' most critical processes like core banking systems, supply chains and claims processing. From an industry perspective, the majority of our revenue comes from clients in financial services, telecom and the public sector, including government and health care. We have long-term relationships with these clients in the form of multiyear services contracts, recurring software streams and financing arrangements. As a result, when you look at our business mix, about 60% of our annual revenue is in recurring businesses. While we're not immune in this environment to disruptions in the transactional content and volume reductions, our client profile and annuity base provides some level of stability, not only in our revenue, but also in profit and cash as we manage through these challenging times. 
Looking at the first quarter, through February, we were tracking roughly in line with our expectations. As we got into March, the health situation and resulting social distancing became more widespread. As you would expect, we saw a noticeable change in client priorities. With that, there was effectively a pause as clients understandably dealt with their most pressing needs. This was most pronounced in our software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically close in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. For those clients that did engage at the end of the quarter, there was a noticeable change in priorities, where focus very quickly shifted to the stability of their operations and preservation of cash. They moved ahead with spending that addressed immediate and essential needs including running mission-critical processes and securing a remote workforce. 
For example, we increased infrastructure capacity and services to meet unprecedented demands on critical banking functions, for banks in countries ranging from Italy and Spain, to the United States, to Australia and Singapore. In Brazil, we developed a platform in a single week to connect patients to doctors via telemedicine. And at a major U.S. insurance company, we helped 40,000 employees to work remote when they had absolutely no work-at-home capabilities just 2 weeks earlier. At the same time, the last few weeks have only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses for the new world, and cloud and AI are at the core of their digital reinventions. With our hybrid cloud and AI platforms, together with our expertise in running critical processes, we're ideally positioned to guide clients on their journeys. 
Anthem is a great example of a company accelerating their digital reinvention in today's COVID-19 environment. We're helping them to operate with more agility and provide greater quality of service by leveraging data and deep insights to enhance the experience of their 41 million members. We're doing this on a secure, open platform run on Red Hat and the IBM cloud. 
Now in parallel, we've taken actions within our own business to help IBM better operate in this environment and emerge stronger. For example, we're aligning investments to the key offering areas Arvind mentioned. We took structural actions to improve the competitiveness of our Global Technology Services business and enable new ways of working across our operations. Our actions will deliver annualized gross savings of nearly $2 billion. 
We are accelerating our own digital transformation from demand generation to further ramping up our digital sales capability. And in our supply chain, we are leveraging AI, blockchain and IoT technologies to drive faster and smarter decisions with our suppliers. We also enhance health and safety measures at our sites to maintain our manufacturing operations at required capacity to meet our customers' needs. This caps off a lot of work over the last few years to make our supply chain more flexible and resilient. 
While we're supporting our clients and improving the flexibility and competitive position of our operations, we're also taking actions to enhance IBM's balance sheet strength and liquidity position. We accessed the debt market in early February with a $4 billion issuance, while reducing $4.5 billion of current and 2021 refinancing needs. In addition, while we do not rely on commercial paper for our funding needs, we thought it was prudent to take advantage of our access to the CP market. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper, which increased both our debt and cash balances. As a result, we ended March with a cash balance of $12 billion, which is up $3 billion from year-end. Our total debt of $64 billion includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is in support of IBM product and services and has a stable credit portfolio. 
Finally, as we discussed in January, our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2019, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 102%. While we typically don't provide a status during the year, I can say that our overall pension-funded status in March was fairly consistent with year-end, and we do not see a change to our expected plan contributions in 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in the business. 
We'll continue to be opportunistic in the capital markets, while remaining fully committed to our mid to high A credit rating and our targeted leverage ratio. I'll remind you, we also have over $15 billion of unused credit facilities. And while we have no plans to draw on the facilities, they're available as back-up liquidity, and our debt covenants are well within the required levels. And with our share repurchase program suspended since the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level, and we remain fully committed to our dividend. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me focus on a few highlights in the quarter before getting into the segments. We had strong cloud performance again this quarter with cloud revenue up 23%. By bringing together our technology and expertise to help our clients accelerate their journeys to cloud, our cloud revenue has grown to $22 billion over the last 12 months. Arvind talked about winning the cloud architecture of Linux, containers and Kubernetes, and the acquisition and integration of Red Hat bolsters our position in hybrid cloud. 
Red Hat momentum continued this quarter with normalized revenue growth of 20% and strong bookings and backlog growth. RHEL has proved to be mission-critical for many customers, particularly in this environment, and infrastructure revenue was again up double digits. Application development and emerging technologies was up nearly 40% this quarter, driven by OpenShift and Ansible. The number of Red Hat large deals was up from the fourth quarter and up about 50% over last year. Red Hat signed the 2 largest deals in its history, leveraging IBM's deep client relationships. This is a great proof point of the value of IBM and Red Hat together. We see it in the larger Red Hat deals, in the pipeline of IBM services engagements based on Red Hat's technologies and in the number of clients now using Red Hat and IBM's container solutions. This has grown to over 2,200 as Red Hat and IBM have emerged as the leading container platform. The contribution of Red Hat, together with strong margin performance in our services businesses contributed to our 150 basis points of operating gross margin expansion. 
Our pretax income reflects charges of nearly $900 million, primarily for the structural actions to improve our competitiveness in GTS and accelerate our shift to a cognitive enterprise. The charges for these actions were more than offset by noncash discrete tax benefits. You'll recall, I mentioned both the structural actions and the discrete tax benefits back on our call in January, and so these had been planned for some time. Our cash and balance sheet strength are fueled by healthy free cash flow. This quarter, we generated $2.1 billion of cash from operations, and $1.4 billion of free cash flow, both excluding our financing receivables. There is a lot of seasonality in our free cash flow, and over the last year, we generated $11.6 billion, which is about 125% of GAAP net income. And a final comment on Red Hat's contribution to our free cash flow. When we closed Red Hat back in July, we expected Red Hat, net of interest expense, to be accretive to free cash flow by the end of the first year. With Red Hat's strong performance after 3 quarters, we've now achieved that milestone. 
Now let me turn to the segment results, starting with cloud and cognitive software, which grew 7% this quarter. We had strong performance in Red Hat, IoT and data and AI and in our security services. Just as I did for overall IBM, I'll start with a view of software dynamics as we move through the quarter. 
We entered the year with a robust offering portfolio and solid pipeline, and we had double-digit revenue growth through February. In March, our software transaction stalled nearly overnight as our clients shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. We saw those dynamics play out most notably in cognitive applications where many transformational deals were paused, especially in the retail industry. And in transaction processing platforms, given cash concerns, clients traded off CapEx for OpEx. These are typically large engagements. And in this environment, clients elected to defer purchases, impacting perpetual license sales late in the quarter. More than offsetting that, we continue to have good growth in cloud and data platforms, led by Red Hat and the synergies we're realizing by bringing together Red Hat and IBM's software. Given the shifting software demands we've seen in some parts of the business, we are focused on a number of initiatives heading into the second quarter. We're doubling down on areas that facilitate the shift to cloud, including Red Hat and other cloud and data platform offerings, Cloud Paks for operational efficiency and QRadar on cloud for security threats. Our go-to-market teams are accelerating their shifts to digital channels, and we're now leveraging our partner ecosystem to expand our reach into critical industries and markets. 
To sum it up, our portfolio in cloud and cognitive software is aligned to the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity. We modernized our software to be cloud-native and optimized on OpenShift, which provides a compelling hybrid cloud platform for clients on their digital journeys to cloud. While we expect near-term pressure on transactions, we continue to invest in new development and innovation for our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. 
Turning to Global Business Services, we entered the year with a good momentum in revenue, gross profit and signings, and our backlog returned to growth. This growing backlog and the revenue we expected to yield from it gave us confidence that GBS revenue performance would accelerate as the year progressed. We had solid performance in GBS in the first quarter, with revenue growth of 1% and gross profit margin expansion of 100 basis points. Our consulting revenue grew 5%, led by offerings that helped clients with their digital reinventions such as cloud advisory and application modernization and offerings that leverage AI to inject intelligence into business processes. These offerings enabled clients to reengineer their business processes and IT environments for speed, flexibility and efficiency to better serve their end users. 
We have standardized our cloud application modernization offerings on OpenShift, and built the world's largest Red Hat consulting practice. We are now working with over 100 clients on Red Hat technologies, such as Anthem, Procter & Gamble, USAA, Santander and Horizon Health Care, just to name a few. In the first quarter, we also had good growth in many of the transformational offerings like next-generation enterprise applications. But as the impact of COVID-19 intensified in March, clients began to deprioritize some of these projects. 
In this environment, we are aligning our go-to-market and delivery resources to the near-term opportunity, addressing challenges like engaging customers virtually, modernizing and migrating applications to the cloud, empowering a remote workforce and cybersecurity and IT resiliency. 
Internally, we have shifted from a predominantly face-to-face engagement model to a virtual one. Now with almost 100% of our GBS delivery resources not only working remotely but productively working to support our clients. Over the last few weeks, we've gotten questions from investors on our ability to support clients given the shutdown in some countries. I can tell you that in India, we had over 98% of our practitioners working remotely within 48 hours of lockdown. As we look forward, we have a solid base of business and a growing backlog, though in the near term, we expect customers to continue to delay and replan some projects. We're going to continue to prudently manage the business by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, to ensure utilization is balanced with the rate and pace of backlog consumption and new deals. And we're going to continue to build skills and practices so that as the demand returns to more normal levels, we're ready to address it. 
Turning to Global Technology Services, our revenue decline of 4% was fairly consistent with last quarter's performance. And we expanded gross profit margin by 30 basis points. As I've said in the past, we are managing this business for margin and cash contribution. Last quarter, I talked about the actions to accelerate the shift to higher value segments of the market and improve our cost competitiveness, so let me start with a quick update on our progress. 
A significant portion of the first quarter structural actions address GTS. This improves our position for the future but impacted our PTI in the first quarter. In this dynamic environment, we're going to continue to evaluate the cost competitiveness of this portfolio and we'll take further actions as required. We also advanced our joint offerings and go-to-market capabilities with GBS. As clients shift their mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they are looking for integration across the application and infrastructure stack. By more tightly integrating GBS and GTS, we're providing a differentiated solution. While we are in the initial stages of this work, we see some early indications of progress in our signings this quarter. Both total signings and our cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate. This includes significant engagement at CaixaBank and Anthem. Strong signings contributed to an improved total services backlog, which is now roughly flat year-to-year. Within that, cloud now represents over 40% of our outsourcing backlog. This fuels our GTS cloud revenue, which was up 12% this quarter. In the current environment, enterprises are focused on infrastructure solutions, which enhance IT resiliency and business continuity, address new cybersecurity risk and reconfigure their IT environments for cost efficiency and business agility. We are prioritizing our resources and our management system to these opportunities, focusing on offerings like unified communications, business continuity and resiliency, workplace virtualization and enabling remote working. 
At the same time, we're adopting alternative delivery models as we continue to support mission-critical workloads without service interruption. In fact, almost 100% of our employees in our GTS global delivery centers are now working remotely. While in this environment, we expect to have some impact due to lower business volumes. This will ultimately lead to an acceleration in the shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And as I've said, this will be a hybrid multi-cloud environment built on open standards. IBM services will leverage our incumbency, our industry, regulatory and business process expertise and, of course, Red Hat, to capture this opportunity. 
And so now looking at Systems, revenue was up 4% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. In an environment where client behavior shifted at the end of the quarter, our hardware portfolio held up well. This reflects the importance of IBM Z and high-end storage for mission-critical operations as well as product cycle dynamics. These are high-end systems, and client value in this segment is driven by new innovation. We see that in the z15 mainframe. And we see it in storage, with the high-end DS8900 introduced at the end of 2019. And more recently, a new and simplified distributed storage portfolio, which supports hybrid multi-cloud deployments. In the second full quarter of availability, z15 proved to be a crucial backbone of enterprise operations, providing a stable, secure and scalable platform. 
Our financial services clients were able to scale up their capacity to meet the significant demands from unprecedented spikes in market volatility without touching their physical infrastructure. And in high-end storage, which is tightly integrated with the mainframe, we had a good quarter, especially in support of mission-critical banking workloads. The growth in Z and storage was partially offset by a decline in power. This reflects where we are in our product cycle as well as the fact that power is more skewed to smaller enterprises, which were more impacted by the dynamics in March. 
We're continuing to adapt our operations to meet the needs of clients most effectively, especially in this changing environment. We're expanding the digital sales channel for both the storage and power business, and we're leveraging technology to proactively manage our globally diversified supply chain. 
Now after going through the segments, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level and talk about what this means going forward. First and foremost, we have confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Nothing we've seen over the last 2 months causes us to waver from these priorities. In fact, as Arvind said upfront, we believe the challenges clients are facing today will speed their transitions to digital. That bodes well for us. But there is obviously some dislocation in the near term. In this environment, we've taken quick and prudent actions to manage our cost and expense, further improve our liquidity position and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running a number of scenarios based on various assumptions. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the health crisis and the rate and pace of economic recovery, there's a wide range of outcomes for the year, which we are prepared for. But to assign probabilities to the assumptions during these unprecedented times just isn't valuable. As a result, it is prudent to withdraw our expectations for full year 2020, and we will reassess at the end of the second quarter. Though to be clear, under the various scenarios we ran, we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to support our business and secure our dividend. 
Before turning back to Arvind, I want to provide some perspective on how we're entering the second quarter. Over the last few years, our software transactional content in the second quarter is about 20% to 25% of our software revenue. We have a solid pipeline of deals, but in the end, our software performance will depend on how we yield against that pipeline. If we continue to see the same client buying behavior, it's reasonable to expect the second quarter will be more challenging. Systems hardware is essentially all transactional. Here, too, we have a good pipeline in IBM Z and storage. While the current environment is expected to impact closure rates, I would expect less of an impact to Z and storage, given the essential nature of the purchases and the additional capacity requirements, especially in certain industries. 
In services, we made real progress in the backlog. And for the first time in a while, we ended the quarter with services backlog essentially flat versus last year. That's with GBS up and GTS down modestly. About 80% of the GBS revenue and 90% of the GTS revenue in a quarter has historically come from the opening backlog, though our contracts adjust for flexible volumes in our clients' businesses. As mentioned earlier, close to 100% of our people in our service delivery centers are working remotely. 
Looking at our cost and expense, we're closely managing our spending and capitalizing on new and efficient ways of operating. The savings from structural actions will start to yield in the second half. We are likely to take additional actions in the second quarter. I'll remind you that we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective and remain focused on driving our free cash flow, including robust working capital management. 
For years, we have been talking about our high-value portfolio and business model. And in times like these, that really matters. This is why our liquidity position is naturally strong, and our pension plan is well funded coming into this environment. So we're prepared for this environment, have a strong financial position and compelling value propositions for clients. But our near-term performance will ultimately be influenced by client buying patterns in this economic environment. 
Arvind, I'll turn it back over to you.",3650

And how do you go about that organic versus inorganic? Would just love to understand, when you think of investments, which way you're going to skew as you go forward.

Thanks, Amit. Let me start with talking about the portfolio and your questions on investment. So look, obviously, the portfolio is something I evaluate deeply. We do it all the time and continuously. But I do want to caution that in the immediate period, which is right now, we've got to focus and put our priority on supporting our employees and clients. 
Now investment to us encompasses both. It encompasses both organic investments and inorganic or acquisitions. We've been clear that we will acquire when we find properties that are both attractive but that fit our strategy. And hybrid cloud and AI are the focus of our business moving forward. But when we talk about hybrid cloud, it is an all-in. And I'll just give a quick reflection on Red Hat. We had Linux at the core. We had OpenShift surrounding it. We put all of our middleware on OpenShift. We have hundreds of GBS projects already leveraging both the Cloud Paks and OpenShift to make application modernization. And then eventually, we'll find services also running those modernized applications for our clients. You'll find there are many, many properties in that -- in my broader definition of hybrid cloud that will fit that, and did too data on AI, where AI should be looked upon as the way to get the value out of the data that people collect, both their internal data and external data.
Now I don't want to over comment on big or small. Size is not a strategy. It's about being thoughtful and strategic. And so you should expect that over time, more time meaning just that it get passed the next few months, we will get back to an acquisitive strategy. Jim?",288

To your point around hybrid cloud, data AI, we've got enough firepower with regards to a strong balance sheet, solid free cash flow generation, solid investment grade, a good access to market, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, that gives us ample free cash flow and flexibility to invest in our business while also returning value to our shareholder and securing that dividend that we talked about upfront. And that acquisition component is a very big, important part of our capital allocation strategy, and that hasn't changed.",120

You mentioned some changes in go-to-market in your prepared remarks, leading perhaps with a more technical bend. I wonder if you can elaborate there a bit. And Jim, I appreciate you're not providing explicit guidance at this point, but maybe can you address the levers the company has in responding to the pandemic in the context of preserving cash flows. You alluded to a few things in your prepared comments as well. But last call, you had mentioned several puts and takes to the cash flows, those tailwinds and headwinds. And just wondering if you could maybe recast those again.",108

With respect to a more technical approach to selling, it's a journey we have been on -- well actually, the current crisis, in effect, catapulted us or accelerated what we are doing. And I'll touch on sort of 3 elements. We have always wanted to have our product teams do a lot of demonstrations and proof of concepts that we are now going to do them virtually where we stand the properties up on our public cloud and then allow the clients to sort of play around with them. And so you take away the weeks of doing it in a more traditional manner. 
Second, in our services teams, they're doing a lot of what they call virtual garages. So a garage used to be that we would have our consultants and our implementers sit side-by-side with a client and go do those. But when you do have social distancing, and it's not just us, our clients don't really want us on-premise either, we have now become -- begun virtual garages, but there's an advantage there, by the way. A bigger advantage is it allows you to actually get access to skills that are around the globe, not just those that may be physically coresident at a client. And that is, again, a much more technical approach. 
And then third, with a lot of remote delivery happening in the GTS part of the business, they're also bringing a much more technical solution to bear through this. So those are the elements that I mentioned. But you can expect us to do more and more of this as we go along. And Jim, I'll give it to you for the second part.",287

Hello, Wamsi, thanks for the question. I mean, because this is important. As you can imagine, given the unfortunate and unprecedented situation, everyone around the world is dealing with right here with COVID 19, we have been spending a lot of time on our business profile, our business model, stress testing it, running multiple scenarios, as I said in the prepared remarks. But when you look at it, it's always been done around, one, the long-term sustainability of the IBM company to deliver value for our clients and for our investors. And that means you've got to have a strong balance sheet. You've got to have ample liquidity to give you flexibility to continue to invest so that we emerge stronger as we get through this pandemic when we move forward. And that really, simplistically, if you take a step back, is 2 levers. One is on the top line and revenue, and the other is on the fundamentals of your operating leverage in the business. Both of those deliver that free cash flow and net cash. And in that latter part, I would put in there optimization of your balance sheet. And we've looked at our revenue portfolio. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we believe we are differentiated. Although we're not immune from what's happening in the marketplace, we do have some level of stability in our revenue, our profit, our cash, and that's driven by all of the work that we've done over time to transform this company transform and optimize our portfolio. We went from -- in 2008 at the last recession, we were only about 45%, 47% annuity. We are now north of 60%. 
We have always been focused on large enterprise versus consumer SMB, and that is playing out well. Our industry concentration, as I said on the prepared remarks, over 70% of our revenue sits in industries, based on IDC and Gartner, that are going to be either moderately or minimally impacted by COVID-19. So we are diversified along geographic dimensions, market dimensions, industry dimensions, client dimensions that gives us that strong annuity content to move forward. 
And then on the margin and balance sheet, we're going to optimize, as we've always done, the portfolio shift in the higher value, the structural actions we just got done here in the first quarter, $900 million that impacted our PTI in the first quarter. That, by the way, will give us an annualized return of over 2x, and we'll keep watching our credit portfolio on the quality, our deferred revenue and also our DPO and DSO, which is in very good shapes. So net of that is, we feel confident around ample financial flexibility, ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business as we move forward and secure that dividend.",469

I was wondering if you could maybe define or articulate on a scale of 1 to 10, how different do you think IBM's portfolio of businesses will be 2 years from now. I recognize change is not going to happen imminently. But 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely different, where would you place that? And then, Jim, if you could just very quickly, you talked a lot about the stability of IBM's portfolio, but it looks like, year-over-year, pretax income went from over $2.2 billion to under $1.6 billion if I back out the restructuring and charge. So even though revenues weren't impacted, PTI, adjusted for the restructuring, was down nearly 30%, and this is your lowest transactional quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about changes to profit going forward? Or was there something unique about this quarter where we saw more negative leverage?",157
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737657.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,16,"Thanks, Toni. Look, Toni, if you look at our industry, it's a fast-moving industry with a lot of change that goes on all the time. If I look at where we were 5 years ago, and if I fast forward to today, Red Hat was not there, Cloud Paks were not there, our cloud backlog inside services was a tiny fraction of what it is today. And I would look at all of that and say, it looks like, in aggregate, likely about half our business has changed in the last 5 to 7 years. That's, I think, the hallmark of a successful company, where you begin to change it. It takes advantage of the relationship, the value, the incumbency we have with our clients, but it also takes advantage of the fast-moving nature of technology.
Now the question you didn't ask, but I'll sort of put in there, is the question of the focus. I think the focus is going to be much more around what we've been talking about, is going to be around, in the near term, is going to be around hybrid cloud and AI, with likely quantum coming down the road, which I do believe has $0.5 trillion worth of value to give back to our clients since you gave me the 5-year horizon, not just a 1- or 2-year horizon. So let me sort of begin with that and say -- and that -- and it's hard to put that on a scale of 1 to 10 because you didn't tell me how much of a change is in 10, but I gave you the sense that probably half the things change. Jim?",279
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737658.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,17,"Yes. And Toni, thank you very much for the question because operating leverage is obviously one of the core fundamental pillars of our high-value based thesis and high-value based business model overall. But let me just cut to the chase with regards to your question overall. You asked about it from a pretax income, I'll take it down to an EPS level, which was similar to net income. We were down 18% overall. That EPS was down $0.41 year-to-year. Yes, it includes the $900 million worth of restructuring. And the structural charges also includes, as we guided back in January, a discrete tax event. But the thing that you're missing in that equation is all of the Red Hat integration and noncash-related purchase accounting implications that are in our EPS and in our profit number.
Now as we close that transaction, by the way, less than 3 quarters ago, and we feel very confident about the health and the profile of our Red Hat business overall, we took a substantial write-down with regards to that deferred revenue, $2.2 billion overall. And we talked about Red Hat being free cash flow accretive year 1 and being operating EPS accretive at the end of year 2. We already hit the milestone on the first metric, and we're well on our way delivering the progress on the second metric. 
And just to bring this all home, the EPS of $1.84, down $0.41 year-over-year, about $0.35 to $0.38 of that $0.41 is the Red Hat noncash deferred revenue and integration. Why do I bring that up? Because as we said, that will diminish over time. And as we continue to replenish the backlog, which we are and we'll talk about, and we wrap around those expenses, that's where you're going to get even more substantial operating leverage going forward in the future.",308

I appreciate the commentary in the prepared remarks about what you guys saw during the month of March. I wonder if you can extend that a little bit, and just talk about what you've seen so far across the first few weeks of April across the segments. And just the extent to which, if any, you've had customers asking for price concessions, new concern -- new terms even on the more recurring pieces of your business?",81
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737661.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,20,"Okay. Thanks, Matt. Let me start with that because, look, from -- April tends to be a month where, as Jim pointed out, it's not just in the first quarter. In every quarter, larger transactions do tend to get bunched up near the end of the quarter. I'd say that probably is more June than April. And you also asked a question on the annuity side of the business or what I would call subscription. We haven't seen, at least so far, any big change in the subscription side coming into April. Now there is no doubt because as both of us have pointed out, we do tend to run our clients' mission-critical workload. It's not the workload that will be the first to turn off. If anything, it will be amongst the last to get impacted. And so the subscription side, we feel quite good about. 
Now on the transaction side, so far, things are holding up, but it's too early to tell. That's one of the reasons you heard both Jim and I talked about withdrawing guidance because a little bit of progress is not enough to give us a full view into what will happen this quarter. Jim?",201
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737662.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Yes. Matt, thank you very much for the question. So Arvind kind of gave a perspective of what we're seeing here for the first couple of weeks. And as he stated, just given the one transactional versus annuity nature, second quarter, like fourth quarter, is our highest transactional quarter, particularly in our software base of business overall. But let me give you a little perspective around the month of March versus February quarter-to-date because I think it's important for investors to understand the value of our high-value based business model and integrated business model because the unfortunate COVID-19 situation that's impacting economies around the world has a very different profile across our business, whether it's hardware, software and services. And as we've seen coming through February, the IBM company was growing revenue through February, led by strong double-digit growth in software overall. 
In the month of March, as I said in the prepared remarks, as the health crisis intensified, that's where we saw the fundamental shift in client buying behavior, appropriately so, by the way, as we've done in IBM where, first and foremost, you wanted to focus on the operational stability and business continuity of your enterprise and second around the preservation of cash. But when you look at it, it was more pronounced in our software and our GBS business. We actually substantially grew in the month of March in our hardware portfolio, but I would align that more around bring in new innovation to market. We're in the cycle of mainframe, and we did very well with the attach of storage overall. 
And our GTS business, remember, is a strong annuity base and it's running mission-critical work. Our outsourcing IS business actually got better by 1 point quarter-to-quarter. So that's pretty stable. But within GBS and software, interesting around software, our cloud and data platform, 34% growth. Yes, driven by Red Hat. But even on a normalized organic basis, we grew over 3%. And that's really the instantiation of our hybrid cloud thesis with Red Hat overall. So that part of the portfolio is still executing well. And I think that's part of what Arvind said, clients are now even faster, more accelerating their journeys to cloud, and it plays right to that. 
Now where we got hit was in cognitive applications and in transaction processing platform. Two different phenomenons across that portfolio. Our cog apps is much more centered around industry-related content where industries that are getting more impacted disproportionately like retail, like industrial, like automotive. And in TPP, that was a function of just a preservation of cash shifting away from CapEx and OpEx.
And just concluding, GBS, although we're very pleased, remember, 90 days ago, we talked about accelerating momentum in GBS, we turned that business back to backlog growth. We actually delivered growth in the quarter. Strong growth in consulting, strong signings in consulting, but we did see a pullback in the latter part of March, particularly in many European countries, around project-based, transformational-based activity in next-generation applications like S/4HANA, Oracle, Workday, and other people are delaying, and we expect that to continue here in the second quarter.",525

It's great to have you on the call. I wonder if you could start out by just commenting on what the 1 or 2 metrics are that you would like us to measure you and your team on over the next couple of years? And then I wanted to follow-up and ask, either you or Jim can comment, you talked about scenario -- a range of scenarios for this year. Obviously, the most bearish would be social distancing through the remainder of the calendar year, and the most optimistic would be a reopening of economies over this month. What does that translate to in terms of sort of the bearish scenario on EPS and free cash flow and a more optimistic scenario. Just any color as to how wide that range may look like.",139

Look, let me start. You said what KPIs or what metrics should you use. Look, I think I've been clear, we should look at growth as the metric, albeit once we begin to emerge from the pandemic. And it's impossible for me to predict how long this is going to be. You mentioned 2 scenarios, but I listened to all of you and your peers, and I don't have any particular crystal ball on this. The estimates are all over the place in both the depth and the length of the impact. 
Now the other one that I think you should hold us to in metric other than revenue or a pure financial metric, is the number of clients on which we are engaged on hybrid cloud engagements. We talk about it from a product perspective, we talked about 2,200 clients to date. But as you begin to wrap those also with services engagements, I think that's the second metric that is effectively a leading indicator towards the overall revenue metric because that's the pre conditioner for that. And that's where we're driving the entire company to. That's what I'm focused on. I run a war room on that every week, and that's what our sales forces are incented to go get done. 
So Jim, I don't know whether you want to add something. You know the answer to the question [indiscernible]",234
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737666.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,25,"Those are the 2 that are aligned to our business model. But to your second question, Katie, I'm not going to talk to specificity around there. As I said in the prepared remarks, we have done a tremendous amount of work on stress testing, running these scenarios. There's a wide range of outcomes. The key here for investors, I think, are 2 questions. One, in any of those scenarios, do you still have the strength of your cash, your liquidity position to ensure that you can, one, invest in your business to make sure as you come out of this, you can emerge stronger. And two, can you maintain your capital allocation and your commitment to our investors with regards to the dividend. And both of those, emphatically, yes. The second question is around each of these scenarios, how are we actually managing our businesses across the board. And I would tell you, if you break this into a product-based business, in a services-based business, starting with services, it is the safety around having an annuitized based model. GBS entering a quarter is about 80%, GTS is about 95%-plus. That does come down as quarters n plus 1, n plus 2, n plus 3 go out, but it provides us a very solid base to work with as far as stability that drives that profit, that cash and that flexibility. 
But what are we looking at and how we manage our services business right now is where Arvind and I are looking at daily is, one, what's happening to the rate and consumption of our backlog. What are clients doing around projects, around offerings? What's happening to our utilization? Our chargeable billable rates? Our price realization? Each of those are fundamental KPIs that we're looking at in this environment right now to the health of the indicator around a services-based business. Around a product-based business, much more transactional. As Arvind said, software is about 20% to 25% transactional here in the second quarter. Has a strong annuity base. By the way, Red Hat's a subscription-based model, strong annuity base. But the dynamics of how we're managing that are looking at our pipeline, our volume, our deal sizes, our yields, our progression, our renewal rates, our demand capacity for our hardware products and where they're at within their cycle. So we are driving the operational discipline you would expect in this company as we move forward. But at the end, we have enough of that financial flexibility, and cash and liquidity, which I think is the most important message for the investor.",431

I wanted to ask just a quick one, acquisitions for you, Arvind. Just looking beyond the pandemic. I know that's hard to do, but criteria, size, thinking on accretion, dilution you're willing to accept there as you want to move quicker to hybrid cloud and AI. Can you share your thoughts on that?",61
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2020",2020-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4387.0,2012299.0,78737669.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"Hello, Tien-Tsin, good to hear from you. So you asked about criteria, size, accretion and this thing. Look, I think, on all 3, one that is easiest, size. Size is not a criteria, so I'm just going to put that to the side. As Jim has said a couple of times, we have enough inflex to do a fair number of things. And most things that we might eye, I think, are possible for us to be able to get done. So I'll put size aside and say that's not really an issue. 
You asked about accretion and decretion. Jim and I are clear, we manage the business for the long term. So if it becomes accretive after a year or 2, as we described about Red Hat, that's more than sufficient for us. It doesn't have to be accretive on month 1 or day 1. As long as it's a healthy business, provides us the current growth profile and provides us the ability to get sufficient synergy, both for IBM and for the property itself. Both have to be winners. It cannot just be one of us. Otherwise, it's not that attractive.
And then you said about criteria. The criteria is those things that make our clients value us even higher. And the areas we have chosen to be their trusted partner on is hybrid cloud and AI. So that's sort of the criteria, but please take a wide stance on hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud encompasses how we connect private and public, it connects -- it includes how we might secure them. It might include the data that is inside those properties, provides more visibility. And as we shift that out over time, that will widen even more because the definition of what is the cloud market also tends to change over time. So hopefully, that answered your question. But it's something we give a lot of thought to.",320

I would not say because of the pandemic or COVID-19 as we look at this. As you saw last year, we divested in the software portfolio, quite a few things that weren't core to hybrid cloud. They were around marketing properties and as-a-service properties around many of our retail clients. It didn't really necessarily fit or pull along or have synergy with the core hybrid cloud portfolio, so it made sense to divest them. I think we are done with that round, just to be upfront.
Now as we always look and say, does this or does this not bring value? Is it a reason for a client to have both, the core hybrid cloud portfolio and something because we reevaluate that all the time. But I don't have something to name for you that we are trying to do right now. As the quarters go along, as the months go along, we will do it. But I also want to be clear that for the next few months, we have to be focused on the stability of the business, and we have to be focused on making sure that we preserve our liquidity and our balance sheet.

I wanted to ask a little higher-level question. As I think about IBM, there's many constituents, but probably 3 broad ones, shareholders, employees and then customers. And as you think about the stock performance over the last, I don't know, 5 to 7 years, I think, shareholders would conclude that they've been disappointed with IBM's performance. And even from a customer's perspective, if you look at IBM's revenues relative to growth of the many markets you participate in, probably some disappointment there. So as you think about your new leadership and perhaps focusing on the investor side, what do you think you really need to do differently for IBM and its shareholders versus what's happened over the last 5 to 7 years?",138

Look, I think that -- I think we had acknowledged that the markets value growth above other things. So while we have always selected on high value. And to your point on clients, we measure our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which I think is widely regarded as being one of the best metrics of how clients value what they're getting from you. And that has actually improved substantially. I think over 10 points, if I remember, over the last 2 years. So given that the NPS is improving, our clients are much more delighted with what they get from us. 
Now that said, the overall portfolio has to be able to grow to return -- to make investors happier. And that's why we are clear. You noticed me announced a lot of our management team at the beginning. I think this is a team that's going to be able to deliver growth back to the market. As Jim Kavanaugh, of course, and you heard him talk about capital allocation and how he's going to use that twin flex to enable both organic and inorganic investment. Jim Whitehurst, who many of you know well, who has dealt really well, both crises when he was at Delta and a growth when he was at Red Hat. Bridget van Kralingen, who has a strong record of understanding client needs, and we're going to drive some of the go-to-market changes we mentioned. Howard Boville that we're bringing in, who was at Bank of America, who has a deep empathy and understanding for some of our largest clients, but also who drove a lot of efficiency when he was at the bank, and he can bring those attributes to the clients as well. And Mark Foster, who has services and who has a real penchant for growth and for making sure that he brings value to our clients and services. We put all that together, and I think it is a team that can go deliver growth.
But let's also be clear. We can talk about which is important. Is it growth? Or is it only EPS? Or is it only liquidity? Look, liquidity is essential. Without that, no company is going to survive through the next period. And I don't know how long that period is going to be. So I think our obsession with that is going to serve us well in this period. But what you're hearing me say is that growth has to be an equal obsession to other metrics that are there, and we are going to go do that. So it may not be a completely full answer, Keith, but we'll probably get there as the months go on and we get more clarity.
So I think that was the last question, if I remember. So let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. These are truly unprecedented times. Over the coming weeks and months, we're going to continue to focus on our employees, our clients and how we can help broader society. As difficult as this crisis is, it presents an opportunity for IBM as a technology leader and as a trusted partner. Personally, it's an interesting and exciting time to be taking on this role. I look forward to continuing this dialogue with all of you, and we'll update you at the end of the second quarter. Thank you.",576

This is Patricia Murphy, and I want to welcome you to IBM's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. 
Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. 
In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we'll focus on constant currency growth, adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud and our geographic performance. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. 
Finally, consistent with our last few quarters, IBM's revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily noncash. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",240

I'm pleased to be speaking with you again. In April's call, I talked about the impact of the global public health crisis, and I told you about the important work we are carrying out to help the shifting needs of our clients. I also told you about the confidence I have in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud as well as data and AI. All of this continues. 
Today, there are 2 topics I'd like to cover. First, I want to tell you about what we're seeing in the market, and then I want to discuss our priorities and actions we have taken to move them forward. From a market perspective, while the current environment poses certain short-term challenges, it also presents long-term opportunities that IBM will seize as our clients accelerate their shift to hybrid cloud and AI. The essential work that we do in terms of running our clients' mission-critical processes continues. More profoundly, we see that the digital transformation of businesses is accelerating. Our second quarter results demonstrate this with an increase of over 10 points in our cloud revenue growth over last quarter. 
The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks. They want to infuse AI into their workflows and secure their IT infrastructure to fend off growing cybersecurity threats. As a result, we are seeing an increased opportunity of large transformational projects. These are projects where IBM has a unique value proposition, but they are also projects that take time to shape and therefore to close. 
At the same time, we are feeling the impact of austerity measures that businesses have put in place to preserve cash and capital. Our software and services results reflect this reality. Jim will take you through this in more detail. Taken all together, this is the backdrop of our results for this quarter. They reflect the immediate challenges and long-term opportunities of this environment. 
Now let me move on and discuss my priorities moving forward. As I touched upon in our last call, IBM is focused on helping our clients in the 2 major transformational journeys they're on, hybrid cloud as well as data and AI. Hybrid cloud is a dominant force driving change in our industry, but it's far from universal adoption. Only 20% of the workloads have moved to the cloud. The other 80% are mission-critical workloads that are far more difficult to move. There's a massive opportunity in front of us to capture these workloads. 
When I say hybrid cloud, I am talking about an interoperable IT environment across on-premise, private and publicly operated cloud environments, in most cases, from multiple vendors. Why do we believe this is the future rather than a pit stop along the way? Clients find that choosing a hybrid cloud approach is 2.5x more valuable than relying on public cloud alone. This considers factors such as innovation, development time and portfolio optimization. 
Let me spend a minute to describe our hybrid cloud platform. It starts with Linux, which is the de facto operating system standard. We have a tremendous advantage with Red Hat Linux, which is the market share leader. Linux, along with Containers and Kubernetes, provides the architectural foundation of our platform, and OpenShift is our core product that captures all this and more. 
IBM has a vast software and middleware portfolio, which has now been containerized and runs on OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. The family of Cloud Paks we introduced in the second half of last year allows our middleware to run in a cloud-native environment and bridge our clients from the past to the future. This means clients can now deploy our software anywhere OpenShift runs. It is infrastructure-agnostic across not just public and private clouds but also our mainframes and power system platforms. 
OpenShift is also what makes it possible to develop and consume software in a new way. It's what enables DevSecOps and all the subsequent boosts in productivity, security and speed of deployment. Our hybrid cloud platform also includes a set of advanced technologies, such as Watson, analytics, encryption, IoT and many others. What gives our hybrid cloud platform the fuel it needs to accelerate adoption and become pervasive is the large ecosystem of partners we are building. 
We have gone to great lengths to forge a global correlation of best-of-breed ISVs. This includes recent additions like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, Box and Slack. All are using our hybrid cloud platform to help clients modernize mission-critical workloads. We have done the same with major system integrators, Ernst & Young, Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems. All are examples that are helping expand the reach of IBM's hybrid cloud platform. 
Finally, you'll recall that nearly half the hybrid cloud opportunity lies in services. An important part of our platform's value lies in the expertise we provide to help clients on their journey. Whether that's modernizing apps, building cloud-native apps, migrating to the cloud or managing these applications on the public and private cloud infrastructures, we are currently helping hundreds of major clients on these journeys. 
I believe that our strategic vision is taking hold in the marketplace. I mentioned the acceleration in our cloud growth this quarter to over 30%. This hybrid cloud platform generated over $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. I just described the importance of Red Hat Linux and OpenShift to our platform, and Red Hat continued its momentum in the quarter, with the combination of IBM and Red Hat, driving strong revenue and bookings growth. 
Across the board, we are seeing greater demand for Red Hat products. Clients are eager to tap into open source innovation. They want the freedom to securely deploy, run and manage their data and applications on the cloud of their choice, and retaining that choice is critical. Clients such as Bharti Airtel, American Express, Vodafone, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Banco Sabadell and CaixaBank all see the value in a hybrid cloud architecture built by IBM and Red Hat. 
As part of our hybrid cloud strategy, a key focus is to help clients tackle complex and highly regulated workloads. Last year, we launched the financial services-ready public cloud with Bank of America, and we recently created a new program for ISVs and SaaS, Software as a Service, providers. I'm happy to share that we now have 30 ISVs signed up. This happened with great speed, and I am confident that more will join soon. 
So let me pause for a moment and remind you of the 3 priorities I shared with IBMers on my first day as CEO: one, help our clients on their journey to cloud and AI; two, win the architectural battle in cloud with Red Hat; three, continually delight our clients. These priorities remain the same, and you can see how we have made progress in all of them. 
At the same time, we have continued to deliver a series of new innovations in the last quarter. We launched our new edge and telco network cloud solutions built on Red Hat OpenStack and Red Hat OpenShift that enables clients to run workloads anywhere from a data center to multiple clouds to the edge. We also launched our AI for IT offering to give every CIO the ability to automate their IT infrastructure that immediately reduces cost and becomes more resilient. AI for IT runs across any cloud and works in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners that include Slack and Box. 
On quantum computing, we added an additional 4 systems which expands our fleet to 22 quantum computing systems. That includes 8 systems that have demonstrated a quantum volume of 32, a yardstick IBM has proposed to measure the relative power and usefulness of quantum computers. 
I've talked previously about the importance of both organic and inorganic investment to drive innovation. We recently announced 2 acquisitions that will enhance our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. In June, we acquired Spanugo to boost our compliance and cybersecurity capabilities for the hybrid cloud. And in early July, we agreed to acquire WDG Automation that advances AI-infused automation capabilities into our Cloud Paks. 
Needless to say, this is a unique and challenging time for our clients. To continue to be their most trusted partner, we are spending a lot of time and energy to drastically simplify how our teams go to market. We're doing a lot of work on the back end to bring our portfolio together in a more cohesive fashion so our teams can come with simpler and more relevant proposals. We are also focused on changing our culture and operating model so we can make decisions more quickly and make our interaction with clients a lot more experiential. Jim will take you through a few of our more recent actions. 
Moving forward, we will continue to take actions that improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities so that we can emerge stronger. 
Before turning to Jim, let me end by saying a few words on our commitment to corporate social responsibility. This has always been important to IBM. But as you know, with the current events in the United States, there has been a renewed focus to do more. As IBM's CEO, I'm fully committed to ensuring that IBM will continue to lead in this area. But this is also about skills and creating opportunity. Since 2011, IBM has helped to develop and expand a new public education model called P-TECH. P-TECH provides high school students from underserved backgrounds with the skills and credentials they need for competitive jobs in STEM. 
To that end, we recently made a commitment to hire 1,000 interns who come from P-TECH. To put this in context, we hire between 5,000 and 10,000 interns at IBM each year, so this represents more than 10% of our intern base. I'm always happy to expand later on this and other topics relating to our ESG efforts. 
Now back to the quarter and the business. Jim is going to take you through our results. Jim, over to you.",1695
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797164.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. During our first quarter earnings call, I talked about how we're prepared for a wide range of outcomes given the economic uncertainty. Our second quarter results were within that range. We delivered $18.1 billion of revenue, expanded gross margin, reported operating earnings per share of $2.18 and continued to generate solid free cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have ample liquidity. The external dynamics we saw in March continued into the second quarter with varied impacts by region and industry. As we discussed in April, we are not immune to the macroeconomic environment. But our client and our portfolio mix provide some stability in our revenue, profit and free cash flow. We saw that again this quarter. 
Let me remind you of how our business mix provides this stability. From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic. Though as you would expect, we saw more weakness from smaller enterprises this quarter. About 70% of our revenue comes from industries that run the world's most critical processes, and those industries have been less impacted by the current economic and health crisis. We saw that in our results again this quarter and, in fact, grew revenue in financial markets, government and education. 
From a geographic perspective, we have a global footprint of more than 170 countries. This provides a bit of a natural hedge as we continue to see markets experience different impacts from the pandemic over time. And then finally, when you look at our portfolio, about 60% of our revenue comes from recurring revenue streams. While we've adapted quickly to conduct business virtually around the world, as expected, we did have disruptions in transactional performance and volume reductions. Many clients continued to delay projects, defer purchases and favor OpEx over CapEx spending in this environment. This pause in large purchases and discretionary spending was most evident in our perpetual software licenses and project-oriented services. 
While clients remain focused on near-term priorities, running mission-critical processes, operational stability and cash preservation, as Arvind mentioned, the last few months also highlighted the need for clients to accelerate their digital transformations, leveraging hybrid cloud and AI. Across IBM, our cloud revenue grew 34%, which is up from the 23% growth in the first quarter. IBM's hybrid cloud platform generated more than $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. 
With Red Hat, we are positioned to win the hybrid cloud architectural battle and have deployed the most secure, open hybrid cloud platform underpinned by OpenShift. We've brought Red Hat and IBM technology together in our modernized Cloud Pak software solutions, providing the leading hybrid cloud platform. We now have over 2,400 clients using our container solutions and nearly 600 IBM services clients utilizing Red Hat technology. 
Red Hat delivered strong results in the period, with normalized revenue growth of 18%, driven by the synergistic effect of IBM and Red Hat. Last August, we talked about how Red Hat would benefit from IBM's incumbency in large accounts and leverage our global reach to expand into new markets. We're seeing that where IBM and Red Hat come together, clients are making larger-scale architectural commitments and longer-term and more strategic purchases. This quarter, we had a significant increase in the number of Red Hat large deals and expanded Red Hat's presence in underpenetrated focus markets. 
In the second quarter, we took additional steps to better position IBM in this environment and emerge stronger. We announced new offerings, including AI for IT and 5G edge, and we recently added key capabilities in RPA and cloud security through 2 acquisitions. We are also working to fundamentally shift our operating model. We're simplifying the geographic dimension of our go-to-market by consolidating our operations and moving to a streamlined structure for sales teams to be more flexible and responsive to our clients. We've enhanced our virtual selling capabilities, including co-creation with clients on virtual platforms, addressing client needs and solutions with real-time data and shifting to contactless delivery even for the most complex transformation projects. 
We've created a virtual dynamic delivery model to effectively reimagine services delivery, including improved access to expertise and enhanced business resiliency and security. We're transforming key business support functions to simplify our organizational structure and infuse AI into our workflows to deliver faster, better insights. And we're expanding our developer and ISV-centric ecosystem to drive workloads to our hybrid cloud platform. 
The last dimension of our business model I want to spend a minute on is our liquidity and balance sheet profile. We further strengthened our cash and our balance sheet in the second quarter, fueled by solid free cash flow, and we took additional measures to improve our liquidity position. We ended June with a cash balance of over $14 billion, up over $5 billion from the end of last year. We remain opportunistic in the capital markets, issuing $4 billion of debt across multiple tenors with very favorable economics. This provides us with additional liquidity in the short term while we remain committed to our longer-term deleveraging plans. 
Our debt of just under $65 billion was consistent with March as our bond issuance was offset by $4 billion in term debt and commercial paper reductions. Our debt includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is primarily in support of IBM products and services and has a stable credit portfolio. Recently, we also successfully completed our annual renewal of IBM's global credit facilities. We're maintaining over $15 billion in undrawn credit, one of the largest corporate facilities in the S&P. Our high-value business model and strong balance sheet and cash flows gave us the confidence to increase our dividend in this environment, the 25th consecutive year with an increase.
Looking at the key highlights in the quarter. I mentioned our strong growth in cloud and our continued momentum in Red Hat. The combination of Red Hat, our focus on productivity and operational efficiencies and our cloud scale-out drove significant operating gross margin expansion, up 160 basis points. Our balance sheet strength was enhanced by $2.3 billion of free cash flow this quarter. We had strong working capital performance, driven by stable collections and good financing attach rates primarily on IBM Z. This was offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. The CapEx increase was driven by the build-out of our cloud infrastructure and lower proceeds from real estate sales while deemphasizing lower-value services content. 
In the quarter, we also continued to have free cash flow contribution from Red Hat, net of interest expense. Overall, we generated $11.5 billion in free cash flow over the last year, which is about 145% of GAAP net income. These results show solid free cash flow performance and a strong financial profile. 
Now I'll turn to the segment performance, beginning with cloud and cognitive software, where revenue was up 5%, driven by growth in cloud and data platforms. 90 days ago, we highlighted how software transactions stalled in March as clients quickly shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. That focus on resiliency continued into the second quarter and impacted software performance, especially in the first part of the quarter. 
Later in the quarter, demand improved for critical priority areas such as hybrid cloud solutions and some AI applications. We had a sequential improvement in software renewal rates as clients favored subscription models. Perpetual software licenses continue to be impacted, particularly in some of the more troubled industries. 
In cloud and data platforms, revenue was up 30%. This reflects the synergy of bringing IBM and Red Hat together as we standardize on Red Hat OpenShift as our hybrid cloud platform and modernize our software portfolio to run on it. This quarter, we had good performance across Red Hat, including amplified bookings growth in the 30 underpenetrated countries where IBM has helped Red Hat expand go-to-market efforts over the last year. And with further Cloud Pak traction this quarter, clients are embracing a hybrid cloud strategy and increasingly leveraging the OpenShift container platform. These actions all contributed to growth in the number of clients using our container platform to over 2,400. 
Cognitive applications revenue declined as clients in some of the more impacted industries deferred transformational or discretionary spending. We saw this play out in IoT engineering life cycle management, where demand from automotive, electronics and aerospace clients softened this quarter. These industries remain focused on core operations rather than transformational purchases. And our weather consumer business was impacted by general weakness in the advertising market. In transaction processing platforms, client focus on OpEx versus CapEx continued to impact transactions this quarter. Looking at the profit for this segment, the decline in pretax margin was primarily driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition. 
Now turning to our services segments. Global Business Services revenue declined 6%. As we entered the year, GBS had good momentum, and we expected revenue to accelerate throughout the year. But as the pandemic intensified and the macroeconomic climate worsened, clients quickly shifted their focus to operational stability and cash preservation. This resulted in a delay in both the existing projects and new commitments, especially in projects that are more discretionary or with longer time to value, such as next-generation enterprise applications. 
The delays impacted the revenue coming out of backlog, which is about 80% of the quarterly revenue as well as the smaller in-period signings, which yield revenue more quickly. While declines continued in these smaller signings from March through May, the trajectory improved, and we returned to modest growth in June. For the quarter, GBS cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate as clients are prioritizing their digital transformations. Offerings such as cloud strategy consulting, application development and modernization continued to grow revenue in the second quarter. These offerings, standardized on Red Hat's OpenShift platform, enable clients in their cloud journeys. We are working with an additional 60 clients such as Bank of America, Medtronic, Loblaws, Bank of England, Credit Mutuel and Deutsche Telekom to utilize Red Hat technologies to transform their businesses.
Looking at profit, we expanded gross margin in GBS by 240 basis points. We managed the business well in this environment by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, improving price/margin realization and optimizing utilization. We also had a currency benefit, which is fairly consistent with the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we're continuing to invest, building skills and practices through education and hiring. Overall, while we're dealing with some near-term macro challenges, GBS' deep industry expertise, combined with IBM's and now Red Hat's innovative technology play a critical role in the acceleration of clients' digital transformation. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 5%, fairly consistent with the first quarter's performance. We had signings growth in the quarter and strong growth in cloud revenue, but this was offset by continued declines in client business volumes. As we talked about in the past, about 90% of GTS' quarterly revenue comes from contracts in our backlog. While this business has a high mix of recurring revenues, there is some variability in that revenue stream. We provide clients with flexibility in their capacity to deal with volume changes due to their business needs and macroeconomic environment. 
As the pandemic intensified through the end of March and into the second quarter, we experienced lower client-based business volumes, reflecting challenges across industries. While performance in some of these industries, like financial services, was consistent quarter-to-quarter, other industries had a more significant decline. We saw this especially in retail, automotive, consumer goods and travel and transportation. This impacted the revenue coming out of our backlog in the second quarter. At the same time, clients are continuing their infrastructure transformations to hybrid multi-cloud environments. For example, at Daimler, we have expanded our relationship to migrate their global aftersales platform to the IBM cloud. 
And this quarter, we announced Sabadell Mexico, the first 100% mobile bank in Mexico, will host its infrastructure on the IBM cloud and use Red Hat Enterprise Linux to modernize its application. They join other financial institutions like Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Lotte Card and CaixaBank, among others, as they move forward on their cloud journey. These commitments contributed to the signings growth for GTS. And in fact, in the first half, signings grew at a double-digit rate. This results in improved backlog trajectory from where we entered the year. Given the overall duration of the backlog, this will convert to revenue over a longer-term horizon. 
Looking at gross profit, GTS margin declined 30 basis points. This was driven by mix as the high-value TSS business is impacted by the current product cycle. I'll remind you, we have not yet realized the benefits from our first quarter structural actions. 
Turning to systems. Revenue was up 6% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. We again had good growth in both IBM Z and Storage. Clients value the new innovation of the z15 mainframe and high-end storage. Similar to the first quarter, the z15 offered enterprises valuable capabilities, including remote management, security and importantly, scalability. This quarter, clients also increasingly look to IBM Z for resiliency and business continuity to keep mission-critical workloads running smoothly. 
We continue to offer additional hybrid cloud capabilities on z15. We released Red Hat Ansible certified content for IBM Z and launched a new cloud-native development offering, Wazi Workspaces, which allows developers to use industry-standard tools from IBM Z to multi-cloud platforms, optimized on OpenShift. The growth in Z and Storage was partially offset by weaker performance in power, reflective of where we are at in our product cycle and power's client base of smaller enterprises, which are impacted more during this pandemic. 
Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level. I think Arvind summed it up well. The current environment presents some near-term challenges for our clients, but it also provides some longer-term opportunities for us. We have a business profile and business model that provides some stability in the current environment. We have also recently taken a number of actions that strengthen our operating model for today and for the future. We built a robust hybrid cloud platform based on what we firmly believe is the winning architecture. This technology-centric platform, together with our deep industry expertise and ecosystem partners, will enable us to accelerate clients' digital transformations and move more of our clients' mission-critical workloads to the cloud. 
As we enter the second half, we have a compelling set of offerings and a strong pipeline across software, services and systems. How that pipeline yields to revenue will ultimately be tied to the rate and pace of the economic recovery and the resulting client spending confidence. Given the uncertainty in the environment and consistent with our direction from last quarter, we're not going to provide guidance for 2020. But I do want to remind you of a few specific dynamics. Systems performance reflects where we are in a product cycle, and we wrap on the IBM Z launch in September. In software, our transaction versus annuity mix varies by quarter. Historically, we have a lower mix of transactions in the third quarter, and our largest transactional base is in the fourth quarter. 
And then for Red Hat, we anniversaried the acquisition in early July. We're wrapping on a large part but not all of the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment and transaction charges. We also wrap on the divestitures completed in the second quarter of last year. And the savings from our structural actions will start to yield in the second half, providing better cost competitiveness and margin performance, especially in GTS. Finally, we remain confident that we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to invest in our business and return value to shareholders through dividends. Arvind, any final comments?",2654

But just wondering if you'd spend a little bit more time about how we should think about moving into the third quarter versus seasonality, where I think, typically, you're down a little bit over $1 billion sequentially, and maybe just dig a little bit deeper into some of the biggest swing factors we should be thinking about by segment going from 2Q into 3Q.",79

Let me start and then I will give it to Jim for adding a bit more color and a bit more detail. So as both of us said on the call, we're seeing that there is -- it's 2-sided. We see opportunity in hybrid cloud. We see opportunity in digital transformation. We see opportunity in people as they're doing a return to the workplace and projects that all advance those things. Some of those give them long-term benefits, some give them a short-term benefit. That said, we are seeing that there is a negative on things that require CapEx, things that have very long-term payoffs and project-based businesses. 
If we think about the difference between third and fourth quarter, third is a bit lighter on transactions, fourth is very heavy on transactions. If we also look at some of those project-based businesses, we'll likely -- and this is where it's tough to give guidance, but it's likely that we see that the economic recovery is looking to be longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March. And as we see that bouncing ball on the economic recovery, whether it's in the United States, in Brazil, in India, that has an impact on all of these elements. 
But the other thing that is important in some of the remarks that Jim made, we kind of have a 2/3, 1/3 mix, maybe a bit more than that in industries which are less impacted versus industries that are more impacted. And that, of course, will play out in our results as well. But let me give it to Jim to make some of those things more precise.",284
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797170.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and Matt, thank you very much for the question overall. As we stated, wrapping up the prepared remarks, we do have a very strong pipeline across our offering portfolio around systems, around software, around services. But as Arvind just indicated, the yield will be tied directly to the rate and pace of the recovery of the pandemic curves, which, by the way, vary based on market around the world and industry, which tie directly to client spending confidence overall. 
If you look at just macro level dynamics of our business profile, there's a couple of things that I think will play out as we look forward. One is we're going to wrap on divestitures. That's been a 2-point headwind to the IBM company for the last 4 quarters. We wrap as we enter second half. Number two, we're dealing with actually a weaker dollar. And you'll see in the currency back up, that is now flat to about 1 point of a headwind, where we were dealing with about a 2- to 2.5-point headwind over the last few quarters. Three, the dynamics of client buying behavior is really shifting, that acceleration of digital transformation and to cloud, you see it play out in our results. And we actually have a strong pipeline. 
Red Hat had another very good quarter, good pipeline setup, our hybrid cloud solution offerings around Cloud Paks with good momentum. We got a good annuity base of business that we're going to continue to build on with renewal rates. And we've got a systems business that we refreshed with new innovation. 
When you look at services, to your point, we've got structural actions that are going to start yielding as we exit -- or excuse me, as we enter second half. And we got a strong pipeline, as Arvind stated on the call, of large transformational deals. Now those are always binary as to when they close, but they will reposition the emerging stronger theme of our backlog in services overall. In the meantime, we're going to continue to deal with the economic impact around discretionary projects, in particular around GBS.",357

Is there a way to think about just how sustainable do you think this growth is as we go forward? And then when I think of this number, 34%, is there a way to see how much of this growth is from new logos and new wins on the customer side versus perhaps taking existing customers from an on-premise to a hybrid off-premise journey?",100
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797173.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,12,"Okay. Amit, let me start. This is Arvind. And then we'll ask Jim to add a lot more color. So Amit, so clearly, since this is the last quarter where Red Hat was, I'll call it, inorganic, that clearly had an impact on this. That said, we are still actually quite happy with the results despite that, that had accelerated quite a bit from earlier and from both the first quarter and last year. So I'll just say it like that and leave it at that. 
The second part you asked was, are we just moving our people from one side to the other, or are we getting new wins? Amit, the vast majority of this, it is a big core of Red Hat as I described our hybrid cloud platform. That's not a left-to-right shift. That is actually net new. When we think about our wins in telecom, actually, those are places we were never present, actually, either of us, not just one of us. If you think about modernizing people's applications, that's not a shift. That's actually net new work for us. 
You asked about new logos. That may apply to a little bit of services. But for the company at large, look, we have a lot of clients. I mean like almost any enterprise of any size is already our client, especially on the product side of the house. So talking about them being new logos would be unfair. But are we getting into areas within them that we previously did not have access to? I would say we are absolutely doing that, and that's a big part why you see that 34% growth. So with that, let me give it to Jim for adding to that.",290
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797174.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,13,"Yes. Just some color around how that 34% was actually delivered overall. Arvind talked about it from a client perspective and the value we bring around our hybrid cloud differentiated value proposition. But the 34%, Amit, as you indicated, is up about 11 points sequentially quarter-to-quarter with regards to the growth profile. That was driven pervasively across all 4 segments of our business. And in fact, that 11-point sequential year-to-year improvement -- or quarter-to-quarter improvement was entirely organic. Red Hat contributes significantly to the 34% overall. But even on a pro forma organic perspective, we are growing right around 20%. 
We got a GTS business that has over a $9 billion book of business, in our cloud portfolio, that grew 20% this quarter and accelerated from first quarter. Our GBS business, which is about $5.5 billion on a trailing 12 months grew in the mid-teens. And our software business, which is about a $5.5 billion book of business grew well in excess of 100% but grew around 20-plus percent pro forma organically. So I think we're seeing broad-based acceleration, really driven by the client buying behavior shifts that are happening in the marketplace. And to Arvind's prepared remarks, overall, we feel pretty confident about the offering portfolio and the differentiated architecture around our hybrid cloud platform that positions us to continue to capitalize on that going forward.",227

It sounded like software was a little worse in the first half of the quarter and then got a little bit better. I think there was one other business where you referenced things may be looking a little better as the quarter progressed. So could you comment on whether that's a fair observation? And if it is, why shouldn't we be thinking about modeling normal or better-than-normal seasonality from Q2 to Q3? And then separately, could you just comment on GBS signings? It sounds like they were down perhaps 20% year-over-year. And what that might suggest for the GBS business trajectory over the next couple of quarters.",126
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797177.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,16,"Toni, so you're very astute in your observations about linearity in second quarter. So let me just add a little bit of color to that. When we finished the first quarter, we were quite transparent in saying that March was a lot worse than we expected compared to what we see. I wouldn't use the word linear because on the transactional side, the last month of the quarter is a lot more. So I'll just compare to normal maybe as opposed to linear. 
When we entered second quarter, the annuity side of the business yields pretty evenly other than the slight, I'll call it, maybe 4% to 5% in volume that goes up and down. So that side is linear, approximately, and that didn't change. If you look at the transactional side of the business, I would tell you that the month of May was significantly worse than we would normally expect. And we saw that begin to come back in June but not really recover to normal levels. That's why I pause on saying will 3Q be better because -- since May was worse than June but June was still worse than we might have expected last year, so that tells us something about that. And then let me give it to Jim to also comment on the impact of the signings as well as more on the important linearity question.",232
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797178.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,17,"Yes. So thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Toni, for the question. But as you indicated with the heart of your question overall, the dynamics in March that we saw generally played out as we entered the first part of second quarter. Clients have really continued focused on mission-critical operational stability, cash preservation as any company as we were in the midst of the worst pandemic we've seen in quite a period of time. And then I could even tell you as CFO of the IBM company, we were maniacally focused on liquidity. So that was not unexpected. 
But what we see play out as we moved through the quarter is really the demand profile is really correlating to the curves of the pandemic. And that plays out differently around markets around the world, around industries around the world. And that's why we tried to give some color about our geographic diversification, which we believe provides a natural hedge in this environment as many markets are going through different curves and our industry concentration being 70% in industries that are minimally or moderately impacted by the pandemic overall per Gartner and IDC. 
But when you look at it, the rate and pace of that economic recovery, as we said when we conclude the prepared remarks, is really going to follow that pandemic. But when you look at our performance in the second quarter, and not to repeat Arvind but just give a little color by unit, our GBS business really stalled in the month of March after starting very strong through 2 months. That continued through the first 2 months of this quarter. And actually, June, we saw our small transaction volume, which has high-yielding revenue content going forward, actually come back to growth. And it was led by Europe, which stabilized with their pandemic curves, and it was led by Asia Pacific. Actually, the Americas was the exact opposite, both Latin America and U.S. 
We started out pretty strong as the U.S. was getting the pandemic and curve underway. And then when it started bouncing in June, we took a big step back. So that's what happened in GBS. C&C software, very strong conclusion where value and hybrid cloud solutions, certain AI-specific, Red Hat, very strong closure of the quarter. But I'll tell you, one, we came off a very strong second quarter large deal closure last year, so we had a very tough compare. But we didn't grow in the month of June. We were just much better than March in April and May.
Systems finished pretty strong, which is a testament to our value prop. And GTS -- I'll tell you, GTS was kind of a mixed here. 90-plus percent of that business is annuitized. We are dependent on client-based business volumes. That's 70% of industry. We actually saw stability and, for the first time in a while, some growth in like financial markets, government, et cetera, but we are getting impacted in GTS by client-based business volumes, in particular, around airline, travel, transportation and retail.",507

Do you see for IBM a larger opportunity at GBS or GTS? And any additional color on the GTS/GBS mix of those large transformational deals you alluded to in your prepared remarks will be helpful. And if I could, Jim, could you maybe also talk about the seasonality relative to cash flows in second half versus first half this year given the Red Hat contribution in the first half?",81
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797181.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,20,"All right. Thanks, Wamsi. So look, so I mentioned explicitly that half the opportunity is services. When we look at the market, that's a $1.2 trillion market for hybrid cloud, and about $550 billion, you could say maybe a touch more, is the services opportunity. So that's the almost half. Within that, the bulk of the opportunity is in application modernization and improving the end-to-end workflows of our clients' processes. So when you look at those elements and then you look at both private and public cloud, the nature of those operations is much more automated and much more captured in code than traditional infrastructure. That's my -- I guess my technologist's way of saying that the opportunity will be larger in GBS than GTS for those opportunities. 
However, I'll just put a caution that, that said, the run component does remain important. It's not that it goes away. But in terms of pure dollar opportunities, it's shifting more towards the GBS side on that side of the market as opposed to the traditional infrastructure. And we're seeing that play out in the mix of the opportunities because people need to get the work done first in terms of transforming their applications. And that innovation is what is driving their interest. And that's why you see us keep using the word transformational because that is where people see the huge opportunity of these projects. And so with that, Jim?",239
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797182.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Wamsi, thank you for the question overall around free cash flow and seasonality. Through the first half, we delivered $3.6 billion of free cash flow and $5.1 billion of cash from ops. Cash from ops is about flat year-over-year. Our free cash flow is down about $400 million. That positions us, on a trailing 12-month, $11.5 billion, I think, and a very strong free cash flow realization. 
Let me give you some of the underlying dynamics and then I'll give you some color, given we're not giving forward-looking guidance, we're not going to give a free cash flow guidance here on the call. But to your question, I'll give you some color about seasonality and what were some of the headwinds, tailwinds. As we stated when we entered January, very similar, we talked about capital. We're going to continue to invest in this business. Capital through the first 6 months was a headwind of almost $0.5 billion. Our workforce rebalancing payments were a headwind predominantly in the first half. That will diminish as we get into second half. And cash tax was a headwind through the first half already, and that would -- should be pretty consistent as we move forward. 
Offsetting some of that here in the first half is we've had very strong working capital efficiency. Very strong collection rates even in this environment, talking to the testament, I think, of the value and how essential we are to our clients, delivering mission-critical value. And also, we're in a mainframe cycle. So our IGF attach rates are doing quite well, and that is helping our free cash flow overall. 
So I assume as we move into the second half, we'll have similar dynamics around the headwinds. We start now in the second half. As we anniversaried Red Hat, the profitability of Red Hat will start accelerating as we get into the second half. That should help us. We'll start reducing the amount of tailwind on working capital efficiency as we get through our Z cycle overall. And I think with regards to cash tax, as I stated, pretty similar.",351

Is there something different about your business exposure or what you see in the market that is holding you back from providing guidance?

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797185.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,24,"Katy, thanks for the question. I think as to deal -- I can't comment on is the business different or do we see it differently. I can comment on what we see. We have a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment around the globe. And when we look at it by geography, by continent or by industry, there's just so much variability that we can't answer it. In April, when we said that we'll have reevaluated 90 days, maybe we were a little bit optimistic that we would get more stability on the health, which in turn leads to the economic conditions. And that curve will begin to flatten in 3 to 4 months, which was, at that time, a reasonable but turned out to be a misplaced expectation. And so we just can't tell where those go. 
And because those have an impact, not in a month or 2 but over 6 to 9 months, even on portions of the annuity business, as Jim has been very clear, there is -- clients do get the ability to dial volumes up and down in some range. So that creates, for us, the inability to really want to give guidance that we are confident about. And so it's that mixture of confidence and uncertainty in the economics that makes us unwilling to provide guidance.",224

The only thing I would add, Katy, is that it's not a statement of the confidence we have in our portfolio, our offerings, our strategy and our platform of what Arvind is trying to drive as the new CEO of the IBM Company overall. We feel pretty confident in that, and Arvind articulated that in his prepared remarks, around our hybrid cloud strategy, our platform, our architecture and components of our business. As we see play out in the second quarter, this demand profile and the resulting client spending confidence is going to follow the pandemic curves around markets and around industries. And we saw that play out in the second quarter, and we'll see how the world deals with the overall pandemic, the crisis and how we enable our clients and our employees and our communities to move forward. 
So it is not prudent right now in this environment as we're still dealing with it to tie down our flexibility to move forward. We're going to continue to invest in our business. And we have the right liquidity, strength of our balance sheet and investment in fin flex profile to take the right actions in this environment to advance our strategic priorities going forward.",206

I think, Jim, you underlined that a couple of times. I'm just curious how meaningful could this be. I don't know if you can compare it to past cycles. I recognize it's going to hinge a little bit on the world healing, but just trying to get a perspective on the sizing here. And then also, just as a second clarification, you've talked about trading off -- the trade-off of OpEx versus CapEx. Do you have pretty good line of sight at this point on your annuity business? It looks like transaction processing, for example, is pretty stable quarter-to-quarter in terms of the on-year trend. So I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything there.",128

How meaningful can the large transformational projects be? So when we say large, these are typically projects that measure in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in contract value. So Tien-Tsin, you do the P times Q and you say, pick a number, is it $300 million, $400 million, $500 million in total contract value, and you do that, and you say those typically will give their full yield over 5 to 7 years. That's the kind of nature they take. 
And then you say, how many of those are we going to get done? We have a fairly large number of them in the pipeline. What we are hesitant to say is, will it take 3, 6, 9 or 12 months to get closed fully? Though we've been at it for a few months already. And so I think it is quite meaningful if we begin to close them. We will absolutely see the needle move on our services business as those begin to close and yield. 
Relative to past cycles, I think as we came out of past recessions or as we came out of different crises, I'm not sure I can call the dot-com bust, it wasn't quite. Maybe it was a minor recession, but it had definitely impacted the tech industry for sure. And we saw the impact of those kinds of projects, different nature. Now they're about movement to the cloud, journey to cloud, hybrid cloud transformation. Then they were more about perhaps of a nature of outsourcing and beginning to create a lot of efficiency in infrastructure management. So the nature of these projects has changed. And so let me let Jim add color to it and also talk about the annuity business.",295
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797190.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,29,"Yes. I would just -- thanks, Tien-Tsin, for the question. I would just add to your last point. I think the nature and the rate and pace of those large transformational deals right now be much quicker than when we were sitting back in 2008, moving through this. It was a very different recessionary time that impacted industries differently and markets differently. This is more so of a consumer-based, small/medium market-based, industry-specific-based that is getting impacted at least immediately right now. But that time to value will shift over time as we move forward. 
So I think, Tien-Tsin, when we went back and we've done many different stress tests of our business model to ensure our balance sheet, our liquidity position scenarios, we looked at prior recessions, we don't see anything different. The only difference is where that client behavior and now shifting from a managed services years ago to more of a hybrid cloud asset-based differentiation. 
The last thing on your annuity, we feel pretty confident about our annuity base. It's over 60% of our revenue today. It's pretty stable. TPP is a mixture of some annuity -- or most annuity, I should say, some transactional. I think from an annuity perspective, we're performing pretty consistent with the market overall, and we see that continuing to play out here in the second half.",224

You're significantly impacted by volumes, but it looks like you had pretty good signings, in the first half of the year, your duration's up in the backlog, et cetera. So is there any way you could kind of sift through this for us, the cyclical impact so that we can get a better sense of how the transformation of that business is trending, particularly given the ongoing revenue challenges we've had over the last several quarters? 
And perhaps you could reconcile this because, Arvind, you made a comment, seeing a shift to the applications where from GTS to GBS, and maybe it's more informative to look at it on a combined basis. I mean you're managing it under 1 person now and you're trying to meld the 2 together. So maybe you see more acceleration in GBS coming out of this and GTS maybe flattens out. So just trying to get a better sense of how to think about the health of that business now and how it's trending.",181
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797193.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"Okay. David, let me maybe start, and then I'll ask Jim to add color. Look, we should acknowledge that we are never happy when a business is declining even at mid-single digits. So let's just -- we acknowledge that and then say, but then what are the elements under it, which is what you're asking about, what are all the moving parts. And given the large annuity nature of that business, that does reflect signings and commitments from the past, not just within the quarter. So that is there. And that means that you're looking at the revenue impact, that even if you have good signings, the revenue impact takes a long time to sort of make its way through the -- through that business and also in terms of the backlogs that are in that business. 
So when I look through the cyclical impacts there, I think that we want to be careful about trying to say that the trends change dramatically quarter-to-quarter. I think that those are places where it is going to take a while for the revenue trajectory in that business to change. And I'm not sure that looking at it combined, it is important to be able to leverage the parts of the business with each other, and there are some elements that can be leveraged. And that is why you refer to Mark Foster's role where he has both the services teams. However, they are very different businesses, and they are different business models. So I'm not sure that I would say that looking at them combined is a better indicator of how they're trending. Jim?",272
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797194.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,33,"Yes. David, I would just add to the last point you just made. They are fundamentally different business models. While they're both human capital-based, one is a data center managed services-based business model that is highly capital intensive. The other is a strategic capability, industry lens, project-based business that is fundamentally human capital, not physical capital-dependent. So they have different economic equations, different growth profiles. One is a growth engine, GBS; the other is a value-based platform in GTS overall. 
Now with all that said, we've said all along that we've got to leverage at least from an offering capability and, to some extent, at a client lens some leverage between those 2 because clients are making architectural decisions at our application first and infrastructure second. But the GTS business model overall, and I'll echo Arvind's point, we've been doing a ton of work around the portfolio. 
Looking at this backlog, which, by the way, any year, David, as you know quite well, about 80-plus percent of a year's out of that business is under contract. Now we do have variability collars within that, of about 30% of our clients today have that. But this is long annuitized-based contracts that has a duration of probably 5-plus years. So you don't turn that overnight. 
So when you take a look at that business, we've been looking at it by offering, by client, by industry, by contract type, and we've been trying to determine how do we, one, reposition and leverage the value of incumbency and then also two, invest in new transformational services, which is where the growth is coming in managed services, building off of the back of the application side of GTS -- or GBS, I should say. And that is things like cybersecurity managed services, data managed services, compliance services and the like. So we've got our arms around this, but it's going to take time to turn this business overall, especially in the pandemic.",327

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797197.0,Question,Keith Bachman,,Analysts,36,"Jim, I'll direct this to you. I wanted to see if you could talk about cloud and cognitive a little bit. And my question is, how should we be thinking about it? What I really want to dig into is you're going to anniversary Red Hat for the first time, albeit you had some DR write-offs, so it's not a complete anniversary. You're going to go ex mainframe cycle, too. So is there some impact on the transactions processing side or any other part of it? But all else equal, I would think the growth rate over the next couple of quarters is going to drop pretty meaningfully, just given the anniversary of Red Hat, but perhaps combined with the mainframe cycle as well. But what are the puts and takes you want us to think about over the next couple of quarters in cloud and cognitive?",147
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2020",2020-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4374.0,2059947.0,80797198.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,37,"Yes. Thank you very much for the question as we wrap up right now. So let's take the cloud and cognitive business overall, right? I think, first, from a cloud and data platform perspective, we're seeing very good growth overall. Yes, albeit very strong momentum on Red Hat, and we couldn't be more pleased with the synergistic value we're bringing to our clients with regards to IBM and Red Hat better together. 
To your question, we -- Keith, we actually anniversaried that on July 9. So we will now wrap around on the operational performance of Red Hat going forward, still growing nicely at an 18% historically normalized basis here in the second quarter so we'll still get growth off of that. But second, to your other point, we've been dealing with this deferred revenue, noncash purchase accounting adjustment for the last 4 quarters. That now starts lessening over time. So when you look at cloud and cognitive software with regards to Red Hat contribution in the first half of what we've seen to the second half of where we're going forward, it's about a point, or give or take, of a headwind compared, but still a positive contribution to cloud and cognitive software overall. 
The other dynamic I'd bring up, and I think Arvind talked about this earlier, you got to make sure that this business, while 75% annuity, 25%, give or take, in a year, transactional, that transactional SKU varies very differently between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Second quarter and fourth quarter are more like 25% to 35% of a transactional SKU. First and third quarter are more like a 15%. So just based on that dynamic, when you look at 2Q to 3Q, we'll get more of a tailwind. And then as we get into fourth quarter, if the pandemic curves do not lessen over time, then we're still going to have to deal with this large perpetual license, OpEx versus CapEx phenomenon overall. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Arvind.",340

I hope you got that from the remarks that both Jim and I made in the Q&A and in the prepared remarks. 
We have aligned our offerings to the opportunity, the opportunity being that of hybrid cloud as well as AI.

This is Patricia Murphy, and I want to welcome you to IBM's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. 
Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. 
Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, while we have wrapped on the majority of the impacts of the divestitures in 2019, we'll continue to focus on constant currency growth, adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. 
Finally, consistent with our last few quarters, IBM's year-over-year revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related impacts associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",252
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438068.0,Presenter Speech,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. I'm pleased to be speaking with you again just 1.5 weeks after our strategic update on October 8. Today, we'll focus on our third quarter performance, which you see is unchanged from the preliminary results we announced. 
But I want to start with a summary of our strategic discussions. We are redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. Over the last few years, we have built a solid foundation for hybrid cloud. With the acceleration of the Red Hat platform adoption and the changes to clients' needs for application versus infrastructure services, we are separating our Managed Infrastructure Services into a new publicly traded company. The result is 2 market leaders with focused strategies and missions and improved growth trajectories. 
IBM is the #1 hybrid cloud platform and AI company. Newco will become the #1 managed infrastructure services company. As separate businesses, each can capitalize on their respective missions. Both will have more agility to focus on their operating and financial models. Both will have greater freedom to partner with others, and both will align their investment and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. All of this will create value for clients and for you, the investors, with an improved financial profile of both companies. 
Since the announcement, we have had a comprehensive outreach to our clients. In fact, we have spoken to hundreds of our top clients, and I have personally spoken to dozens. The vast majority understands the strategy and are excited about what it means for them, whether they'll be predominantly future IBM clients or newco clients. Our partners have also had a positive response as they see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our go-to-market initiatives in the hybrid cloud, data and AI spaces. 
For IBM, as we look forward, the case for hybrid cloud is clear. Clients see 2.5x more value in a hybrid cloud approach versus a public only. It's a tremendous opportunity valued at $1 trillion, with most of the enterprise opportunity ahead of us. Our approach is platform-centric. It is differentiated by Red Hat OpenShift, which is our market-leading open platform, a vast software portfolio modernized to run cloud-native and our GBS expertise that drives platform adoption and meet clients where they are on their cloud journeys. Over the coming months, we'll further advance our strategy by taking actions to simplify and optimize our model, increase investments in key areas and fostering much more of a growth mindset. All of this will contribute to accelerated growth for our company in the future, and we expect to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth upon completion of the separation of newco. 
Let me shift to some of the recent progress we have made against our hybrid cloud platform strategy from the perspective of our clients, our ecosystem and the innovations we're bringing to market. We have great recent examples of clients making large-scale architectural commitments to our hybrid cloud platform. Schlumberger is using our platform to make their E&P environment accessible across any infrastructure that their global clients use: on-premise, private and public clouds. They'll enable the broader energy community to leverage data analytics and AI to unleash the power of digital innovation in the oil and gas industry. 
We are also extending our relationship with Delta to transform their talent and modernize their IT environment using Red Hat, Cloud Paks and leveraging GBS's expertise. They'll operate with greater speed and realize longer-term business benefits. We are continuing to expand our ecosystem. Last week, I talked about how we have added hundreds of partners to drive workloads to our platform, including best-of-breed GSIs and ISVs. As an example, Ernst & Young is now leveraging our open hybrid cloud platform and AI solutions to help clients transform their businesses. 
Our teams are also providing joint consulting capabilities to drive business outcomes for clients. Late last week, we announced expansion of our partnership with ServiceNow to bring the power of Watson AIOps to their market-leading Now Platform. We're also bringing new innovations to market. I'll highlight just 2 areas: Red Hat and Quantum. Red Hat extended its open hybrid cloud portfolio with several new technology introductions, including: OpenShift virtualization, which enables clients to migrate and run their virtual machines natively within Red Hat OpenShift; and Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, which delivers the industry's most robust, multi-cluster, policy-based compliance and application management system. These capabilities are furthering our clients' abilities to build once, deploy anywhere with a hybrid cloud architecture. 
In Quantum, we announced our road map to reach 1,000-plus qubits by 2023. The road map aims to take today's noisy small-scale devices towards the million-plus qubit devices of the future. This kind of progress is essential to help industry and research organizations tackle important real-world problems that even today's most powerful classical computers cannot tackle. And in making our road map public, we are committing to meet a series of aggressive benchmarks that will help our company maintain its leadership in quantum computing and place our clients on the path to groundbreaking achievements. So we've made good progress with clients, our ecosystem and innovation. 
Regarding today's environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. In the short term, they are focused on operational stability and cash preservation. We see this especially in our largest software license transactions and delays in some services projects. But more of my conversations with CEOs are around how they become digital businesses. How do they tap into open source innovation? How can they securely deploy and manage their data and applications across various clouds? That's what we call hybrid cloud. We see this as a continued momentum in Red Hat and the large client engagements that enable a journey to cloud, leveraging both OpenShift and application modernization. Now I'll turn it over to Jim Kavanaugh, who's going to take you through the results, and then we'll come back at the end for Q&A.",993
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438069.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with a view of our overall performance. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue, expanded gross and pretax margins, reported operating earnings per share of $2.58 and generated solid free cash flow while increasing investments. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have ample liquidity. Our revenue and gross profit performance was fairly consistent with the second quarter and reflects little change in the macroeconomic environment and client demand. As we've previously discussed, our broad geographic footprint and client and portfolio mix provide some stability to our revenue, profit and cash flow.
As Arvind just mentioned, clients' near-term priorities continue to include operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, which tends to favor OpEx over CapEx. This is resulting in some project delays and purchase deferrals, which we see in perpetual software licenses and project-oriented and volume-based services. Our transactional performance this quarter also reflects product cycle dynamics in our systems business. At the same time, the last 7 months have made it very clear that companies need to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal. This is leading to an acceleration in digital transformations. Cloud and AI are at the center of these transformations. And our open platform-centric model delivers greater innovation, higher productivity and more strategic optionality to our clients. 
In the third quarter, client adoption of our platform continued to grow, with approximately 2,600 clients now using our container solutions. We anniversaried the acquisition of Red Hat in early July, and Red Hat again delivered strong results in the period with normalized revenue growth of 16%. Red Hat leverages IBM's global reach and large account incumbency. Not only are the number of large deals increasing but also the size of these engagements is increasing as well, with the total value of these deals doubling over the last 12 months. 
Within services, this quarter, we added about 125 services clients utilizing Red Hat technology. And our GBS cloud-related signings were up over 25%. The platform model delivers compelling economics. Our full stack capabilities drove over $24 billion of cloud revenue over the last 12 months, which is up 25%. We're investing to expand our capabilities, in GBS skills centered on hybrid cloud and intelligent workflows, in Red Hat's go-to-market to drive hybrid cloud adoption, in software, hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, including the Spanugo and WDG Automation acquisitions; in IBM Cloud capital for MZR build-outs; and in our ecosystem to drive adoption of OpenShift and our broader cloud capabilities. These investments will accelerate in 2021, given the additional flexibility from our structural actions. 
This quarter, our portfolio mix with strong software contribution, together with our focus on productivity, drove operating gross margin expansion of 160 basis points and operating pretax margin expansion of 140 basis points. With a 10-point year-to-year headwind in our operating tax rate, our net income margin was essentially flat. Our cash and liquidity positions remained strong, fueled by our cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.8 billion year-to-date, which is down over $1 billion year-to-year. We continue to have strong working capital performance and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. These were offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. 
Over the last year, we generated $10.8 billion of free cash flow, which is 136% of GAAP net income. We ended September with a cash balance of $15.8 billion, which is up $6.7 billion since year-end, while our debt was up $2.5 billion. I'll remind you we issued debt earlier this year out of an abundance of caution in taking advantage of attractive market dynamics. We're in good shape to fund our upcoming maturities, including $4 billion to $5 billion in the fourth quarter. We'll end 2020 with debt down for the year. 
Now I'll turn to the segment performance, beginning with cloud and cognitive software. Revenue was up 6%, driven by cloud and data platforms. This is a sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance despite a 4-point headwind from the wrap of the Red Hat acquisition in early July. Software has a seasonally smaller transactional base in the third quarter. In a challenging transactional environment, this benefited us. Our cloud and data platforms delivered 19% revenue growth. This was led by Red Hat's strong performance, with double-digit growth across both infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies. 
A couple of weeks ago, Red Hat was recognized as the leader in multi-cloud container development platforms in Forrester's latest Wave report. Leveraging this OpenShift container platform, our AI-powered Cloud Paks provide clients with ease of use and the ability to scale and secure operations across a variety of environments. We're expanding and leveraging the IBM and Red Hat ecosystems, with over 180 partners now selling IBM Cloud Paks. We're seeing good penetration in our large accounts. We've now more than tripled the number of clients adopting Cloud Paks versus a year ago and added nearly 200 clients to our container platforms in the third quarter. 
Cognitive applications revenue trajectory improved to flat year-to-year, led by strength in security and supply chain. In security, we had good demand for our threat management software and services as clients transform and manage their security operations. We're driving adoption of our Cloud Pak for Security and QRadar on the cloud, and identity and trust services also had good performance as we're helping clients with their secure digital transformations. Forrester and IDC just named our managed security services as an industry leader based on our integrated product and services capabilities. 
We also had good performance in our supply chain software. Supply chain order management enables the shift to more flexible and scalable digital channels, which is a great value prop to our clients during the pandemic. Looking at the profit for this segment, we had strong profit and margin performance, driven primarily by Red Hat contribution. 
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue declined 6%, consistent with last quarter. As you'll recall, prior to the pandemic, GBS was growing revenue and signings. Since March, our revenue has reflected the economic environment and a change in client priorities, leading to project delays and less demand for more discretionary offerings. But as we pivot our offerings and delivery to address these client needs, GBS posted double-digit signings growth in the third quarter and returned its backlog to growth. This was driven by cloud strategy, application development and modernization and offerings that use data and AI to transform workflows. 
As I mentioned earlier, our GBS cloud signings were up over 25%. We signed a number of large transformational contracts with a total value greater than $100 million, which will yield revenue over time. Our small deal performance generally followed the pandemic curve by geography but returned to growth overall for the quarter. With the expertise and process knowledge gained through our application management incumbency, clients trust us to guide them through architectural decisions and facilitate their transformations, with a particular expertise in application modernization at scale across all on-prem, private and public cloud environments. 
GBS drives adoption of IBM's hybrid cloud platform and is a gateway to bring the wider set of IBM capabilities to enable a client's digital journey. For example, about 1/3 of Cloud Pak revenue results from GBS engagements. And this quarter, we added another 60 Red Hat client engagements with such clients as Delta Airlines, which Arvind mentioned earlier, but also Royal Bank of Canada, ITERGO, Florida Power & Light and Telefónica España.
As our clients are transforming, we are also investing in our GBS business to position for growth in the future. We are continuing to invest in skills, resources, offerings and ecosystems. We have implemented a virtual sales engagement model and are delivering nearly all of our more than 1,500 active paid garage engagements virtually. And we are taking the learnings from our initial shift to remote delivery to establish a new delivery model. Dynamic delivery integrates technical foundations with virtualized methods and practices, enhanced with AI and automation to drive productivity, pace and quality. As we apply the dynamic delivery principles across our client base, in the third quarter, we delivered more than 90% of our services remotely while maintaining stable quality and increasing Net Promoter Score. 
Looking at the profit dynamics, with our focus on high-value offerings, productivity and strong operational discipline, we expanded GBS gross margin by 190 basis points. In Global Technology Services, revenue was down 4%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Infrastructure services continues to experience lower client-based business volumes in the more economically sensitive industries. And TSS performance reflects hardware product cycles and continuing volume impacts due to the pandemic. But many clients are taking a longer-term view and are looking to modernize their infrastructure to create agility and operational efficiency. They turned to GTS' Managed Infrastructure Services business for its deep expertise in managing mission-critical infrastructures and its next-generation service delivery capabilities infused with AI and automation. 
Coca-Cola European Partners is a great example. We recently signed a multiyear agreement to accelerate their modernization journey, will help them to reduce operational expenses, increase IT resiliency and leverage AI to bring enhanced insights and deliver greater service to their customers. GTS's signings were down 1% this quarter but up 12% year-to-date, with 19 deals over $100 million, including 8 this quarter. In addition to new work, clients continue to make long-term commitments with significant contract renewals as we deliver new value. This has resulted in the backlog year-to-year trajectory improving by approximately 2 points from the beginning of the year. 
Turning to GTS profit, gross margin declined by roughly 80 basis points. This was driven by the investments we are making in public cloud and the volume impacts, which come at a high margin. 
Turning to systems. Revenue was down 16%, driven primarily by product cycle dynamics. IBM Z revenue was down 20%. We launched the z15 toward the end of the third quarter last year. We've had widespread adoption of both z15 and LinuxONE across many industries and countries in support of clients' hybrid cloud journeys. IBM Z is seeing record-setting volumes on Linux as clients leverage Red Hat OpenShift, Ansible and our cloud-native DevOps offerings. 
At the same time, this pandemic has impacted our historical IBM Z cycle dynamics, which is playing out differently by industry. This platform has proved invaluable to our clients in areas like banking and financial markets, helping them rapidly and remotely scale up capacity and respond to unprecedented market volatility. As a result, these clients accelerated their adoption of z15 within the cycle. That said, in many other industries, clients remain focused on cash preservation during this pandemic. This dichotomy and client buying behaviors impacted our performance in the third quarter and will lengthen the adoption curve of the z15 cycle. But by the end of this cycle, we have an opportunity to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. I'll remind you, in the fourth quarter, we'll be wrapping on a very strong performance from last year when we were up 63%. These cycle dynamics impacted our storage revenue as well, with performance driven by declines in high-end storage. 
Now as always, before the Q&A, I'll bring it back up to the IBM level. We're seeing tremendous opportunity to help our clients become digital businesses. Our technology-centric hybrid cloud platform, deep industry expertise, and growing ecosystem are enabling us to accelerate these transformations. The value we provide clients is evident this quarter in our cloud revenue growth, in our continued momentum in Red Hat, and in our strong GBS signings, driven by cloud and application modernization offerings. 
And now we're accelerating IBM's hybrid cloud platform strategy with increased focus and investments to drive future growth. We're taking structural actions to simplify and streamline our business. And as we discussed earlier this month, we expect a fourth quarter charge to our operating results of about $2.3 billion. The savings from these actions will be reinvested in areas like hybrid cloud, data and AI, security and emerging technologies. 
With our focused hybrid cloud platform strategy and the increased investments starting now, we expect to drive sustainable mid-single-digit growth after the separation of newco is complete. In the near term, the rate and pace of recovery remains uncertain, and as a consequence, we have not seen a fundamental shift in overall demand levels. Given this uncertainty and consistent with our direction for most of this year, we are not going to provide guidance. But I will remind you, from a historical perspective, the fourth quarter seasonally is our strongest quarter in terms of revenue and operating earnings per share due to our high-value software and hardware transactions. 
Looking at our year-to-year dynamics at the end of 2020, we're wrapping on a strong fourth quarter of 2019 when we had a very strong software performance, our first full quarter of z15 availability and our first full quarter of Red Hat contribution. So going into this fourth quarter, as always, we have a lot of work to do. It's our largest transactional quarter. We'll be focusing our investments in hybrid cloud and AI, and of course, we're starting the detailed work to separate our Managed Infrastructure Services business. We're confident in the focus and direction of our business and what it means for our future. Arvind, let me turn it back over to you.",2233

I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on the health of the wider IT spending landscape you're seeing around the world. And you mentioned delays you're seeing in a couple of areas within the portfolio. Just wondering when you think those deals will start coming through, particularly as we're starting to think about the puts and takes heading into 2021.",74
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438074.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,8,"All right. First, thanks for the question, Matt. So a few comments on -- because you asked about portfolio areas. You also asked about clients, and you also asked about geographies. And it all varies, but we are seeing first from large client deals as well as services projects. Let me just reiterate but add a little bit of color to what both Jim and I said in our prepared remarks. 
While we are seeing very healthy growth in some parts of both software and systems, it's kind of schizophrenic, but we're also seeing people pause. Maybe they're pausing because of their industry or because of geography or because they're into a cash conservation mode. We think it's a pause. We don't believe it's a decline forever. We do believe that some of those deals come back, and we tend to see that. We saw that from the first to the second, second to the third quarter, et cetera. So that's one part. 
Now we have also talked about it, there is about in 70% of the industries that we are in, we are not seeing any pauses. We see clients that are healthy. We see that their business are healthy. About 30%, and that should not be a surprise to anybody on this call, we do tend to see some temporary softness. And when we think about brick-and-mortar retail, you think about airlines, you think about hospitality, I think it's not a surprise that some of those. Now we also tend to be with larger clients, so we don't believe that they have a sustainability issue by and large. It will tend to come back. So that's kind of the flavor under it. 
But then as I begin to look forward, Matt, because you're asking that question also, it's really hard to predict the fourth quarter. That's why Jim and I are pausing on giving guidance here. However, when we look at are people interested in these parts of the software portfolio, whether it's supply chain and security, as Jim mentioned, whether it's cloud and data platform, which includes both of Red Hat and our Cloud Paks and other technologies they find essential, we find that those will come back. We find our Transaction Processing Platform or TPP get somewhat aligned to the mainframe capacity increases. As those go through, you tend to see, I'll call it, an alignment. It's not necessarily identical, but there's some alignment therein. 
And then let's not forget that as our Global Business Services and other SIs do transformation projects, they also tend to pull through software more in cloud and data platform than in other areas. So I'll sort of give you that color sort of across the client set, across the industries and across different parts of the portfolio, Matt.",468

I want to understand, maybe if you don't mind, just this transition from going with a tighter integration of GBS and GTS to the separation now. Could we see services results and bookings maybe weaken in the short term before ticking up again? I know the signings were good here, but just trying to think about this fourth quarter and the first quarter transition given the changeover, if that makes sense.",92

Tien-Tsin, this is Jim. I'll take that one. Let's talk a little bit about the quarter and what we just finished with regards to services signings. We're pretty pleased, given the overall macroeconomic environment and the rate and pace and the continued uncertainty, the team's executed very well. $9.5 billion of signings, up 5%. We've got $108 billion backlog right now. That's flat at actual rates, down 1% at constant currency. And to your point, we saw actually very good progress in large transformational deals. I think 11 in the quarter in excess of $100 million and 8 of those in our GTS Managed Infrastructure Services business, which saw a very strong renewal rate that talks to the value of innovation that they bring to our client set overall. And that has led to year-to-date, I think we said in the prepared remarks, GTS up 12% signings. And I'll remind you, that was off of a third quarter last year where we grew 20%. So we're pretty pleased there. And that's led to a 2-point backlog improvement in our GTS business since January. 
But where we really have seen a marked inflection of some signs of demand change is in GBS. While the revenue kind of played out consistent with 2Q, our signings were up double digits. I think it was our third largest signings quarter almost in history and are both large and small deals overall. And that was really a testament to our GBS capability around application modernization and being our clients' provider of choice for digital transformation and journey to cloud. So we feel pretty good about that. It's good early trends. We got a very nice pipeline of transformational deals here in the fourth quarter. And again, given our announcement 10 days ago, we're spending a lot of time with our clients to make sure we minimize disruption, ensure stability and provide that client value going forward.",322

Typical seasonality might be for revenue up about $3 billion. If demand is not really changing, why shouldn't we assume normal seasonality? And is that kind of the right number or framework? And then Arvind, I'm wondering if you could just comment on capital allocation going forward. Your dividend is $6 billion a year. It's basically been 100% of your free cash flow year-to-date in the last -- you haven't paid down any debt. You haven't done any deals without taking on incremental debt this year. So if you really are managing the business for the long term and growth is a priority, are you considering lowering or suspending the dividend? Or is the dividend safe? And if it is, why wouldn't you be more aggressive in allocating more cash to growth going forward?",154

Toni, this is Jim. Thanks for the question, multi-part. But let me take the first piece around -- color around fourth quarter, and then Arvind can handle the capital allocation discussion around the strategy, and I obviously can handle some of the numbers overall. 
But first, as we talked about in prepared remarks and you indicated, the rate and pace of the recovery we still see as uncertain. And there's no real fundamental change in client buying priorities around cash preservation, around operational stability. And consistent with prior quarters, that has led us to not give guidance. 
But let me give you some color. First, we talked about, at the onset of COVID-19, that this has only accelerated our clients' digital transformation and journey to the cloud. And you see that playing out in our results over the last few quarters with continued very good momentum in our cloud business and in our Red Hat business. And when we look at fourth quarter, we see very healthy pipelines in hybrid cloud, AI solutions, app modernization, cloud transformation services within GBS. Red Hat actual backlog growth is accelerating, up 23% at $4.7 billion. And we see pretty healthy pipelines in our cloud and data platform and in our cognitive apps business, led by Cloud Paks and security. 
The 2 things that we called out though in our prepared remarks that we've talked about the last few quarters and those are headwinds. And first, in particular around TPP, our clients committed to that platform. We had a very strong 2019. And given the environment and the focus on cash preservation, we don't see that coming back in the fourth quarter. It's going to be pretty similar to the first half. And the second is our mainframe cycle, coming off of the significant portion of the growth last year, up 63%. 
So when you look at SKU overall in the fourth quarter, 3Q to 4Q, yes, I mean, there will be no reason not to expect a normal SKU with regards to revenue. Some slight improvement in our software portfolio, offset by TPP, and we'll wrap on the hardware piece. 
Now in terms of EPS, you saw the very strong fundamentals in third quarter. Coming off a strong 2Q, operating gross margins up 160 basis points, operating pretax margin up 140 basis points. We feel very confident in the strength of our balance sheet, our cash and liquidity position to make sure that we can continue to invest in our business. We're starting that immediately here in fourth quarter around technology, around innovation, around skills, around capabilities, and you'll see that play out in addition to the $2.3 billion structural charge. So when you look at EPS, you all know the numbers as well as I do. Over the last X number of years, our 3Q to 4Q pre the $2.3 billion charge has been a nice growth of about 50 -- mid-50s. We should do maybe a little bit better than that but I don't think anything substantial above that. So we see pretty similar dynamics. Arvind, over to you.",519
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438081.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Jim. And Toni, thank you for asking the capital allocation question, a really important piece of our growth strategy going forward. So a couple of points there for context. One, when we acquired and closed on Red Hat, we did commit to pausing share repurchase until we had deleveraged and gotten back to our target ratios of debt-to-EBITDA. We are on track to do that. We fully intend to do that, and we had said that we'll get there by 2022. So that's part 1. And so some of the cash you see on the balance sheet will be used towards that purpose because you said, you're not paying down debt, but you'll see us begin to pay that down to get towards those ratios, part 1. 
Part 2, we are committed to a stable and growing dividend. Given our investors, given that how much they depend upon that and how much we have heard about that on feedback, we intend to keep a stable and growing dividend. That means everything else is up for what is prudent for managing for the long term. And so when we talk about increased investments, and on October 8, I was clear, we are going to both increase expenses organically in order to be able to grow in both software and in GBS, but we are also going to be quite acquisitive in the areas that we have called out. We will be acquisitive in GBS. And we will also be acquisitive in the software areas around hybrid cloud, data, AI, security and in emerging technologies such as Quantum. So when you see us do that, I think we are going to be doing exactly what you're asking. Will we be allocating more cash to growth going forward? I think the simple answer to that is, yes, with no qualifications therein.",309

Can you help us with how much more productivity benefit is yet to come in the fourth quarter? And as you talk about the reinvestment of the savings associated with the actions you just announced last week, can you give us a segment view on that reinvestment, please?",75
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438084.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,18,"Yes. So Wamsi, thank you very much for the question overall. If you look at the structural actions we took as we entered 2020, remember, we talked a lot about this in January pre COVID on how we were going to reposition our businesses as we move forward. You see that actually playing out in our results. I mean our margins in the second quarter were up roughly 150 basis points at gross margin level. And in third quarter, we just came off margins that are up 160 basis points at the gross level and operating margins that are up 140 basis points at the pretax level. 
So I think you're seeing that productivity and the fundamental change in the way we're actually driving and running the business now adapting, given the onset of COVID-19 and the implications to the economic environment. If you take a look at the fourth quarter actions overall, we talked about 10 days ago the strategic action around separating out and creating 2 market-leading companies and creating an independent publicly traded company around our Managed Infrastructure Services business. That was going to be about a $2.3 billion charge. 
And if you remember what I said at the time, and you can kind of think of this as in 1/3 buckets. The first is about 1/3 of that is going to go to help improve the EBITDA growth profile in our newco business to be on a trajectory to achieve, post separation, a double-digit EBITDA growth profile. The second bucket or second 1/3 of that was in any business, when you separate out, you're going to create stranded cost and inefficiency. And we're committed to addressing that in 2021 with this charge. And then the third piece is we are making significant investments to capitalize on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud market opportunity, and the third bucket is going to be used for additional finflex that is going to be centered around technology, innovation, people, skills, capability, ecosystems and also, as Arvind just answered, around inorganic plays overall. So I'll take that one. And then Arvind, do you want to take the second one?",358
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438085.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,19,"Yes. So when you look at the different segments that we're in, Wamsi, so this is straightaway in the 4 areas that we had outlined. Number one, we are going to be increasing investments in GBS in order to get more skills in the areas where we are seeing demand. Second, we're going to be increasing investments in our ecosystem. And in our ecosystem, there are large partners. We just announced ServiceNow last week, but we announced Adobe a couple of months before that. You've seen us with Salesforce. You've seen us with others. So we are going to be increasing our investment and how we work with those. 
But there are also hundreds of ISVs, not just the very large ones, with whom we are also working to get them on our hybrid cloud platform, on our cloud properties. And so how do we invest in that in order to drive growth down the road is the second piece. I'll put that in the ecosystem pocket. Third, we're going to be increasing investments in our core software areas in terms of the hybrid cloud platform itself. And you saw that in some of my prepared remarks on the innovations we are driving into the Red Hat technologies. But in addition to that, in terms of data and AI, in security and others, we're going to drive innovation in there. 
And as you put all those areas together, let's not also forget, newco is also going to be seeing increased investments around automation, around infrastructure modernization against working with different cloud partners. When you think of those 4 buckets, it now goes pretty much across all of IBM segments obviously if you think about it, because we want it to be our current balance. It's not identical growth, but we want all of the segments to be contributing to growth. And so we're going to be driving in terms of organic R&D, in terms of working with certain areas where there's a lot of demand. So you got to get skills in there. And of course, as we add M&A, that's not quite directly from these buckets of money, but the M&A will also add to added expenses. Eventually, the moment you complete an acquisition, it's expense in these different segments.",381

Today, on a pro forma basis with Red Hat, it's declining mid-single digits. Would love your thoughts on why we're not seeing a stronger growth rate. Is it entirely macro-driven? And what are the steps and time line for getting that software business back to pro forma growth, given how important it is to hitting this mid-single-digit longer-term growth target?",83
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2020",2020-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4039.0,2145416.0,84438088.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,22,"Thanks, Katy, and you got it correct. It is a critical part of us getting towards a mid-single-digit growth target. So that is essential. So as we begin to go under it and you look at it for the last few months, I would tell you that some of it is indeed -- macro may be the wrong word, but I think there's 2 elements in there. People are pausing certain large software license transactions, and that is perhaps the macro environment. And then there is the TPP piece, which is inside of the software segment, which is driven more, as I've said before, in terms of the alignment to the mainframe capacity that's in the ground. We saw very good growth in the fourth quarter of last year. We saw that tied to that. And as you begin to see that slow down in the third quarter of this year, we do expect to, I think, see that continue for some time. 
But within that, when I look at our cognitive applications and we look at cloud and data platform, we do see healthy growth there. But I expect to see it continue. As we invest more into that and as we invest more into Red Hat, I would expect that as we get through the next year, we are going to see that, that should be able to more than offset anything that happens inside TPP. 
And just to give a sense of that, Katy, when you begin to look at Red Hat by itself and we see the growth there in the mid- to high teens, and we expect that, that should be able to continue and accelerate, then that, in turn, will give added growth to the whole portfolio, more than enough to offset any weakness in TPP. And then as we are increasing our investment in our ecosystem as well as in internal R&D as well as in acquisitions, while I'll acknowledge that those layers do take multiple quarters to play out, I wish it was quicker, but it is multiple quarters, but I would fully expect that at the same time, as we complete the spin, we should be able to see those growth return in those parts of the portfolio. And you've got a sense of how we'll do it across those various elements.",391

So as you can imagine, this is something in which I think the only word I can use is, we are obsessive about this topic. We had our lists up. We knew exactly what clients might be concerned about. And I wouldn't say that we are 100% perfect, but I think we feel very, very good that we were correct in our estimations of the level of concerns. 
To give you a sense, we serve -- internally, this is not something that we ask or tell the client but based on their reaction, I mentioned that we have already spoken to hundreds. So you can think that now that we're 10 days in, we've already spoken to at least between 200 and 300 of the top clients, where there is a strong intersection, where there is a very heavy spinco revenue base or deals that could be on the table. And from there, we have gotten back over 80%, I would call it, are in the great to good to not really concerned. And I'll come back and give some color on why we believe that's true. 
Then there are some who do enough on both sides that they do have some concerns. Most of those concerns are around who is the team that will be providing service. Who is the person who's going to be on the ground? And we should be very clear that spinco is going to head out on day 1 with $19 billion. The same management team on the ground who runs it from the client up is going to be the team that does it. Yes, there's a corporate structure that we put in place, but that's not the team on the ground, just to be clear. They have very high satisfaction with a majority of their clients. And that is because they bring both service excellence in terms of the service and the uptrend that they provide, but also they bring very deep technical skills, which is kind of gives them permission and the trust to play. 
So when I put all of that together, I think that there's a couple of dozen clients where we just have to make sure that we can tell them who's the team that's going to be servicing them. And as they begin to get comfort on that, I can see the level of anxiety reduce. But as I said, over 80%, they understood what was happening and also many clients or majority on one or the other, naturally for them, there's going to be less of a concern. 
Now to your point of why would they then complete the deal? Look, most of the larger deals are to our clients' benefit. Clients don't do something unless they are going to get a business benefit from that. And in this environment, if you want to go pause that for 3 or 6 months, you're going to defer your benefit for 3 to 6 months. So I think what drives things, and luckily, they have a month to sort of -- on both sides, both our teams and the client, to sort of understand each other, and there's still enough time in the quarter to go get those deals done. So look, the quarter will tell us whether we are right or not. But based on everything I can see, I am confident that actually we'll be able to see most of the deals progress to a satisfactory conclusion.",584

A couple of things in there. Within that, if I find where is our portfolio and our clients today, it's probably more heavily weighted in about 60% of that total as opposed to all of it. And we think that the ability to form many more partnerships as stand-alone is going to allow IS to much more fully participate in the complete market. 
Two, we have stated pretty consistently that we are going to start them off with an investment-grade balance sheet. That would allow them to also make targeted acquisitions as appropriate. We can't speak for that. It will be up to the management team post spin, but that is a place, we're always in a market where it's a scale game. That's definitely a way that you can both grow and gain market share. And so -- two. 
Three, Jim mentioned that 1/3 of the restructuring charge is for also improving the EBITDA profile of the spin company. That is going to allow them to also invest in new offerings in areas such as cloud modernization as well as added offerings in aspects of compliance and security and resilience and also in much more automation, which is going to allow them to deliver even higher service delivery excellence to their clients. 
So when I look across all those, the opportunity is certainly there and freeing them up to do deals which we might not do because the margin may be dilutive to us but it's going to be accretive towards the new company; two, possibly M&A down the road but that's not for some time; and three, in terms of leveraging new offerings and partnerships with other companies who might be doing it but maybe not as wholeheartedly as they would do it with an independent company.",329

I actually wanted to ask a clarification and a question to Jim. Arvind, on the clarification, I wanted to come back to M&A. You seem to be talking more about M&A on this call than in previous calls. And per a previous question, I'm just not sure the financial resources now that you have to be aggressive about M&A in that IBM's typically generate between $12 billion and $13 billion of free cash flow, and if you have $6 billion of dividend payment, it just doesn't leave a lot of room for M&A. So is the message that you may look to get away from an investment-grade rating? I'm just -- I'm not sure how to make the math work when you say impactful. 
And then I'll just ask my question of Jim, if I could. Jim, you talked about GBS and how you're confident of growth there. I certainly think consulting business can improve, particularly next year as we get into presumably better economic cycles. Yet application management and global process have -- were weak before the pandemic hit, and in fact, had not -- had been growth challenges throughout '19. And so I just wanted to hear a little bit about those 2 businesses. What are your expectations on an organic basis when you think about GBS for roughly half the revenues that frankly were pretty growth challenged before the pandemic? That's it.",243

Actually, Arvind, if you don't mind, let me take both because I think part of the first question you've already answered from a strategic capital allocation perspective on what we want to do with regards to our investment profile, both organically and inorganically. But Keith, the heart of your question gets to a mathematical equation. And I think, one, first, you got to recognize that there's always been seasonality in our free cash flow. Albeit we delivered $4.8 billion year-to-date in free cash flow overall, as you all know quite well, well over 50% of our free cash flow in this business comes in the fourth quarter. 
That, coupled with we talked about 2 quarters ago, at the onset of COVID-19, how the business model composition of IBM with its geographic diversification, its industry composition, its client segmentation, be a more large enterprise focus and its annuity content of both high-value software, high-value hardware platform and high-value services piece, provides a natural hedge in this environment to stability around revenue, profit and cash. Now yes, over the last couple of years, we've been driving around $12 billion of free cash flow. In light of the economic challenges due to COVID-19, that number just, trajectory-wise, will be less this year. We'll see how fourth quarter plays out, but we're very confident in our portfolio, in fact, even more confident, given the decision that Arvind and the entire IBM team and our Board made on October 8 around repositioning 2 market-leading companies: one, with an IBM on an accelerated growth profile, with an already very strong EBITDA margin business that is going to generate significant cash; and then two, a lead -- the market-leading infrastructure services business that is 2x the next competitor. And in that business, as you all understand quite well, is a scale economics business. 
So from that aspect, I think when you look at our finflex, our finflex only gets better. And with our disciplined financial capital allocation policy that this company operates on, we feel very comfortable that we got ample free cash flow to invest in our business organically and inorganically, to delever and hit those targeted leverage ratios and also to maintain our return to shareholder program with a secure dividend and sustainable dividend growth policy overall. So that's the first question. 
Second question, when you look at GBS, as I talked about, we did see signs of demand improvement here in the third quarter. And if you remember 90 days ago, we talked about the first half of second quarter and the second half of second quarter in the month of June, and we saw some nice growth in June. Well, that continued into the third quarter. We're double-digit signings growth overall. And by the way, Keith, that was pretty pervasive. That was good growth in consulting, but it was led by large transformational deals around application services in this environment to capitalize on our clients' journey to cloud. That then dragged with it our Global Process Services where clients are now digitally reinventing themselves and how they run their companies around intelligent workflows. So we're seeing that demand inflection move. 
Now to your question, that revenue is more long term as you play out. But when we look at our current backlog and our current backlog runout for our GBS business in 2021, we see GBS getting back to pre-COVID growth rates by midyear, and a big chunk of that is improvement across all of the 3 subsegments.",587

Post all that, is the focus mostly on dividend and M&A, and we should think about stock buyback as being less of a feature compared to past history of IBM where a lot of EPS growth has been driven by stock buyback? But it seems like perhaps maybe the view is that the management and the Board thinks that the stock buyback isn't generating shareholder returns so maybe shifting more towards M&A? Is that the way to kind of read the last 0.5 hour we heard through the Q&A?",135

This is Jim. Let me take that, and then I could wrap it up with Arvind overall. As you know quite well, our disciplined capital allocation process, first and foremost, focuses on how we reinvest back in our business, both organically and inorganically. And we are focused now with the strategic move that we announced, we laid the foundation we talked on October 8, we laid that foundation over the last couple of years, instantiated in the Red Hat acquisition, which was a bold move. We have been building and accelerating that growth. Now we want to capitalize on that $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity. 
Now with that said, just given our investor mix, outside of allocating capital and investment to our own business, when we have excess cash, we're going to return that back to shareholders. That priority right now is our secure dividend and sustainable dividend growth policy. And as we get back to our targeted leverage ratios, at that point in time, we'll reevaluate share repurchase. But there's no need talking about that right now.",180
