The fourth quarter capped off a year where we grew revenue, operating pretax income and operating earnings per share. We stabilized our margin as we moved through the year, and we expanded gross and pretax margin in the fourth quarter. We continued to invest and take actions to shift our business toward higher-value areas like hybrid cloud and AI, including the announcement of our acquisition of Red Hat. And we again generated solid free cash flow, which enables this continued investment and shareholder returns.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered $21.8 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency, though down 3% with the impact of currency translation. As always, I'll focus on constant currency results.
Our operating pretax income was $5 billion, and we had $4.87 of operating earnings per share. We had strong performance in software. And in services, we had revenue growth and gross margin expansion. This was offset by the expected impact of our IBM Z product cycle dynamics. Our total software revenue was up 2%. We entered the quarter with a good pipeline of software opportunities, and we executed well, driven by hybrid cloud adoption and strong demand for analytics and AI offerings. 
Total services revenue was up 2%. We had steady improvement in Global Business Services throughout the year with 6% growth in the fourth quarter and revenue growth and gross margin expansion across all 3 of our GBS business lines.
Global Technology Services had a modest revenue decline with solid gross margin expansion. We had a great signings quarter, reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud implementations and our value prop to deliver productivity.
Our hardware revenue was down. You'll recall in 2017, we had a terrific fourth quarter in IBM Z, and so our decline reflects a wrap on that performance. This continues to be a very successful Z program and remains ahead of our prior cycle. Once again, we had strong growth in Power with POWER9 now introduced throughout our portfolio.
As you know, we provide technology and industry expertise to help run our clients' most important processes, which puts us in a unique position to help them transform their businesses. As we exit 2018, we're continuing to see a few themes across our engagements.
First, our clients continue to look to turn data into competitive advantage by applying analytics and AI with an industry lens. Second, clients are increasingly looking to cloud to drive business value. As they move more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they need to securely move data and workloads across multiple cloud environments, and that requires a hybrid and open-cloud strategy. And third, clients are focused on productivity and predictability in their spend.
Now IT has always been about driving both technology innovation and productivity with the balance shifting over time. We're recently seeing increasing interest in productivity as clients look forward to the next couple of years. And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver innovation and productivity. 
You see this in our strong results in analytics and AI, in our as-a-service cloud revenue and in strong signings in our services business that deliver technology solutions and economic value, all through our integrated value proposition. That's why companies such as Vodafone and BNP Paribas are leveraging the IBM Cloud, where they benefit from our hybrid multi-cloud capabilities and access to the most advanced technologies. And it's why Bradesco Bank made a software, hardware and services multiyear commitment to the IBM Z platform to take them to the next level in AI and hybrid IT with more predictability in their operating costs.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue for the year was up 9% to about $40 billion. Within that, our cloud revenue is over $19 billion, and we exited the year with an annual run rate for cloud delivered as a service of over $12 billion, which is up 21% over last year. This is a solid base of cloud and cognitive capabilities, and we're continuing to deliver innovation in these high-value areas. 
For example, in the fourth quarter, we introduced AI OpenScale, a platform to manage the life cycle of all forms of AI models; and Multicloud Manager, a service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We're adding innovative services like the world's first commercial quantum computer available on the IBM Cloud. You may have seen that ExxonMobil is already using it to help address its most complex business challenges, such as energy exploration and chemicals manufacturing.
The number of new clients using IBM Cloud Private accelerated in the fourth quarter, and adoption is growing for our IBM Cloud Private for Data platform, which was named a leader in the first quarter 2019 Forrester Wave report on enterprise insight platforms. All of this is a validation of our hybrid open approach to cloud, and we have a strong foundation from which to drive synergies across the business with the addition of Red Hat.
Let me pause here to remind you of the value we see from the combination of IBM and Red Hat, which is all about accelerating hybrid cloud adoption. The client response to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. They understand the power of this acquisition and the combination of IBM and Red Hat capabilities in helping them move beyond their initial cloud work to really shifting their business applications to the cloud. They are concerned about the secure portability of data and workloads across cloud environments, about consistency in management and security protocols across clouds and in avoiding vendor lock-in. They understand how the combination of IBM and Red Hat will help them address these issues.
We see the strong bookings Red Hat recently reported as further evidence of clients' confidence in the value. Remember, the quarter ended a month after the transaction was announced.
From a value perspective, in addition to the growing Red Hat business itself, we see an opportunity to lift all of IBM by selling more of our own IBM Cloud and by selling more of our analytics and AI capabilities on OpenShift across multiple platforms. As clients proceed on their journey to get more business value from the cloud, they need more services help from the digital design to app modernization to native app development to management of hybrid cloud environments.
You saw last week the results of Red Hat's shareholder vote with very high participation and over 99% voting in support. We are moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect to close in the second half of 2019. We've had a decade-long partnership with Red Hat and extended it nearly a year ago around hybrid and multi-cloud. And now after the announcement in late October, we've begun the internal enablement planning, so we can hit the ground running post-closing.
So now I'll go through the details of the fourth quarter, wrap up with the summary of the full year and our view of 2019.
As I said, our revenue in the quarter was $21.8 billion. This includes a currency hurt to revenue of over $500 million, which is $150 million more than mid-October spot rates suggested, as the dollar has continued to strengthen.
Looking at our margin dynamics. We expanded both our gross and pretax operating margins. Our gross margin was up 10 basis points with strong performance in the services businesses; together, up 190 basis points. This was mitigated by the expected mix headwind from the IBM Z cycle dynamics.
Our operating expense was better 5%. When currency impacts the top line, it generally helps expense due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. And so with the strengthening of the dollar, currency helped our expense by nearly 5 points. Remember, the majority of our hedges are reflected in expense, and these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L.
We've been focused on driving productivity in our business, implementing new ways of working like using agile methodologies and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This provides flexibility to drive innovation in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, security and blockchain while also delivering operating leverage.
Within our expense decline, we also had a lower level of IP income. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected IP income to be down year-to-year, and it has been tracking lower, down $165 million year-to-year in the fourth quarter and nearly $450 million for the full year. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pretax margin was up 50 basis points.
Looking at operating tax. At the beginning of 2018, we provided a range for our full year tax rate of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, and that was without discrete items. With our final geographic and product mix, the full year rate without discretes was about 15%, within the expected range. Including the discrete items in the first and third quarters, our full year operating tax rate was 8%, which is a headwind year-to-year. The resulting tax rate in the fourth quarter was 12%, which is up about 6 points year-to-year.
Regarding our GAAP tax rate, you saw in our press release that our fourth quarter rate also reflects a charge for a GILTI tax election associated with the implementation of 2017 U.S. tax reform. This charge impacts GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share.
And so turning back to our operating results. Operating earnings per share of $4.87 was driven by solid operating leverage, offset by expected headwind from tax.
Looking at our cash metrics. We generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter with $11.9 billion for the year, in line with our expectations. Our realization of GAAP net income is 111% for the year, normalizing for the nonoperating tax reform charge. This supports a high level of investment and shareholder returns.
So now let me move on to the segments. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2% with 3% growth in solutions software and 1% growth in transaction processing software. We expanded pretax margin by nearly 3 points, delivering operating leverage on this revenue growth from both operational efficiencies and mix while still investing at high levels. In the quarter, we continued to deliver innovation to our clients and scale our platforms and solutions, resulting in growth in our transactional revenue and SaaS signings.
In transaction processing software, we capitalized on the strong pipeline of larger transactions we discussed entering the fourth quarter, driven by our clients' buying cycles. Our fourth quarter performance reflects these clients' commitment to our platform for the longer term given the value we provide in managing their mission-critical workloads and predictability in their spending.
In solutions software, growth was led by analytics and AI offerings with several other high-value areas growing as well. In our underlying analytics platform, we had broad-based growth across our Db2 portfolio, including analytics appliances and data science offerings. Demand for our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering accelerated, and now over 100 clients have adopted the platform, and that's since launching just over 6 months ago. New clients include the Korea Internet & Security Agency, which is developing an app on ICP for Data that leverages a variety of data sources and machine learning models to find and thwart new cyber threats. In addition, we're scaling our newest Watson services running on IBM Cloud Private for Data, like AI OpenScale.
In security, we continue to have solid demand for our integrated security and services solutions, including strong growth in our security intelligence and orchestration offerings, QRadar and Resilient. Within our industry verticals, Watson Health had growth across payer, provider, imaging and government. And IoT once again had strong growth in our core offerings, Maximo and TRIRIGA, where we lead the market in asset management and facilities management.
In the emerging blockchain area, we announced several new clients this quarter, including our work with Smart Dubai on Middle East's first government-endorsed blockchain platform. We introduced an on-prem offering in November, the IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private, and signed several new deals this first month. We see a strong pipeline as clients are interested in the benefits of blockchain behind their firewall.
Now over the last few quarters, I called out offerings within our solutions software, which address horizontal domains, where we face secular shifts in the market, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent. We've been taking actions, and last month, we announced the divestiture of our collaboration in on-prem marketing and commerce products to HCL. After closing, which is currently expected to be midyear, this action will improve our Cognitive Solutions' revenue performance, normalizing for the divested content and reflects our commitment to disciplined portfolio management.
So now moving on to services. Before getting into the 2 segments, I want to provide a view of the total services business. As I said earlier, revenue was up 2% and gross margin expanded 190 basis points.
Looking at our signings. On our last earnings call, we talked about the strong pipeline of deals we had going into the fourth quarter, and we executed well, delivering signings of $15.8 billion, which is up 21% at constant currency. This results in a backlog, which is now $116 billion.
Since it's measured at year-end spot rates, currency is obviously impacting the backlog. But at constant currency, the backlog is down 60 basis points year-to-year, which is about a 2-point improvement versus last quarter's performance. Customers are increasingly looking to leverage digital for growth and innovation while at the same time increasing efficiencies and reducing costs within their businesses. IBM services can deliver this value by leveraging its breadth across GBS and GTS. A recent example is at the Bank of Philippines Islands, where we'll provide IT infrastructure services as well as digital experience solutions to support the bank's ongoing digital transformation, increasing their IT efficiency and scale and enabling them to seize opportunities in an increasingly digital financial sector.
So now turning to Global Business Services. We again delivered solid performance, building on the momentum throughout the year. The GBS team has done a really nice job repositioning this business, and you could see it in the results. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all business lines, and gross margin expanded 300 basis points. Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 10%. This is validation of our success in bringing together technology and industry expertise to help our clients on their digital journey. We had continued strong growth in Digital Strategy fueled by our digital commerce and CRM offerings. We are also accelerating growth in next-generation enterprise applications led by strong demand in our consulting and implementation services in areas like S/4HANA, Salesforce and Workday.
In application management, we grew 4%. This quarter, we returned to growth with strong performance in Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development, mitigated by continued declines in traditional application management engagements as our clients move to the cloud. The 4% growth also reflects the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts.
We've been also improving our revenue profile in global process services. Revenue grew 5% as we reinvent industry workflows by leveraging automation and infusing AI. And earlier this month, we announced the sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter and will result in improving revenue and margin profile, normalizing for the divested content. So this action, like the divestiture of select software assets, is about portfolio optimization. We're focusing on higher value offerings that are important to our integrated value proposition.
Turning to GBS gross profit. There are a number of drivers of our 300 basis point expansion, including the operating leverage we get on the revenue growth, our mix towards higher value offerings and capturing the price for value, a help from currency given our global delivery mix, and the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives, including the realignment of our skills pyramids to key growth areas.
In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.9 billion of revenue, which is flat versus last year, and gross margin expanded approximately 150 basis points. We continue to have strong growth in cloud revenue in the segment, this quarter up 22% year-to-year. We had a strong signings quarter with 16 transactions over $100 million each. Both new and existing clients are looking to IBM to manage their critical infrastructure and deliver innovation while simultaneously achieving predictable spending. We continue to see momentum in our open, hybrid multi-cloud approach.
I've mentioned BNP Paribas earlier. BNP Paribas has selected IBM to strengthen its cloud environment with a hybrid multi-cloud approach, bringing together the IBM Cloud, private clouds along with existing infrastructure. Leveraging IBM's technical and industry expertise, BNP Paribas will accelerate its digitization to offer its clients the best services while respecting the security and confidentiality of their data.
Looking at the revenue by line of business. Infrastructure services revenue was flat. As we prioritize our portfolio, we are exiting some lower-value content, which slightly impacts near-term revenue performance but results in higher margins.
In technical support services, revenue was down 3%. TSS continues to be impacted by the hardware product cycle dynamics, partially offset by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings.
And finally, integration software growth accelerated to 4%. This performance was driven by continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, where we added 200 new clients. That brings our total number of clients using this innovative platform to 600 in just over a year as they continue to modernize traditional workloads. We also now have over 100 IBM Software offerings integrated with IBM Cloud Private, including blockchain, Watson, IoT and analytics. We are continuing to deliver innovation in this space with new offerings to enable clients in an open, hybrid, multi-cloud world, like IBM Multicloud Manager, which I mentioned earlier.
Turning to profit for the segment. Gross margin improvement is driven by the lift of our productivity initiatives. This includes infusing AI in automation in our delivery processes such as by leveraging IBM services delivery platform with Watson and embedding agile thinking into our service delivery processes. We're also leveraging productivity and talent optimization efforts, where we continue to optimize business processes, re-skill our expert Workforce and leverage our global scale.
PTI margin was flat, reflecting continued investments to expand our go-to-market capabilities and develop new offerings to capture the hybrid market opportunity. So to wrap up services, at the beginning of 2018, we said we expected an improving trajectory in our services revenue and profit, and we delivered on that throughout the year with the strong fourth quarter.
In Systems, revenue was down 20% this quarter. I'll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the fourth quarter last year, where we grew 28%. Systems pretax margin was down 6.5 points, reflecting the mix headwind from the IBM Z product cycle. I'll walk through the different dynamics across the hardware portfolio.
In IBM Z, we are 6 quarters into the z14 cycle. Z revenue declined 44%, while margins expanded modestly, in line with where we are in the cycle. The program continues to track ahead of the prior program with broad client adoption across industries and countries.
We continued to add new clients and new workloads to the platform. Since launching the z14 program, our mix capacity has increased nearly 20% with new workload MIPS growing twice the rate of our standard MIPS. So we're taking advantage of the secular shifts in the market, and now over 55% of our installed MIPS inventory is in emerging workload areas. And while there's volatility in the hardware due to product cycles, as we continue to grow our installed base up roughly 3.5x over the last decade, this provides stability in our related software, services and financing business across IBM.
Power revenue was up 10%, driven by Linux and continued strong adoption across our new POWER9-based architecture. In the fourth quarter, we completed the release of our next-generation POWER9 processors in the high end, and we had strong adoption in both the low- and high-end systems. Our POWER9 systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. And we now have extended HANA certification to our POWER9 high end.
In the fourth quarter, we had strong initial traction with our new offerings that optimize both hardware and software for AI such as PowerAI Vision, which we introduced in the second half of 2018. And we've essentially completed the deployment of our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.
Storage hardware was down with declines in midrange mitigated by continued strong growth in all-flash arrays. The storage market remains very competitive with ongoing pricing pressures. We're continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality.
For example, in December, we extended our next-generation MVME technology into the midrange with strong initial client adoption. We will continue to roll out MVME across the storage portfolio in the first half of 2019.
So now turning to cash. We generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. With nearly $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This capped off a year with $15.6 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in our services and cloud-based businesses, and that's up $400 million from last year. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion for the year; and as I mentioned, our normalized free cash flow realization was 111%.
You'll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be about $12 billion for 2018. The year-to-year decline reflects the headwinds we anticipated from CapEx, working capital and cash taxes. We returned over $10 billion to shareholders in the year, including dividends of $5.7 billion. We've now increased our dividend per share for 23 consecutive years, and we remain committed to continued dividend increases. We also bought back just under 33 million shares, reducing our average share count by over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Now looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, which, without the impact to currency, is consistent with the year ago. Total debt was $45.8 billion, down $1 billion year-to-year with 68% in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is in line with the target of 9:1, and the credit quality in our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade, 1 point better than a year ago. And so our balance sheet remains strong, and we are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating.
As we typically do at the end of the year, I want to provide a quick update on our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen for over a decade; and over the last several years, we moved our asset base to a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of 2018, in aggregate, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are nearly fully funded with the U.S. at 104%, consistent with a year ago. So despite the volatility in the markets, our plans are in really good shape.
So let me start to wrap up with some thoughts on 2018, and then I'll move on to expectations for 2019. As we open the year, we talked about the work we had done to reposition our business, to help move our clients to the future, shifting our portfolio, changing our operating model and the way we work and reallocating our capital. And in our earnings call last January, we talked about how that drove our expectations for 2018 in revenue, in margin and in earnings per share. First, we said we expected to grow revenue at then current spot rates. We did, in fact, grow revenue for the year, and that's despite the U.S. dollar appreciation since early 2018, reducing our revenue growth by about 2 points or $1.7 billion. Second, we said we'd stabilize gross margins. While we fell a bit short for the full year, we stabilized gross margin in the third quarter and expanded both gross and pretax margin in the fourth quarter and second half. That's for the first time in over 3 years. We said tax would be a headwind for the year, and it was a headwind to us for the year and in the fourth quarter. We continue to return value to shareholders with share repurchases contributing to earnings per share growth. And finally, we said we expected operating earnings per share of at least $13.80 and free cash flow of about $12 billion, and we achieved both of these.
So looking back on 2018. We grew revenue, operating profit and operating earnings per share for the year with strong free cash flow realization. We had good momentum in GBS with particular strength in consulting led by our digital and cloud application offerings. We executed well in software in the fourth quarter, finishing the year strong led by analytics and AI and our hybrid cloud software. As we execute our strategy to help our clients implement hybrid cloud, our total cloud revenue grew to over $19 billion.
Across software and services, we continued to build our as-a-service revenue. We exited the year with a $12 billion annual run rate, which is up 21%. We continued our very successful IBM Z program and strong performance in Power with our POWER9 architecture rollout. We repositioned our operating model and drove productivity, which improved our margin profile. We also continue to prioritize our investments and took actions to optimize our portfolio. We announced the sale of select software and services businesses, actions that not only improve our go-forward revenue profile but allow us to increase our focus and investments in the high-value segments of IT in areas like hybrid cloud, AI and blockchain. All of this provides a solid business and financial foundation for the addition of Red Hat, and it gives us confidence in our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share of at least $13.90.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to be clear about what is and is not included in our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, Red Hat is expected to close in the second half; and given the financial implications to 2019 are heavily dependent on the timing of the closing, Red Hat is not included in our expectations. We'll update our view of the year at the time of closing.
In the last 1.5 months, we've also announced 2 divestitures: the sale of our collaboration in on-prem marketing commerce software and the sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business. For these businesses, when we consider the combination of the foregone profit, the gain on the sale of software assets, the actions to address structure and stranded costs and the resulting benefits from these actions, we expect there to be minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year. And unlike the Red Hat acquisition, the timing of the closing does not have a significant impact on the financial implications for the year, though it may affect the quarterly skew. As a result, our guidance assumes these divestitures. Said another way, because the divestitures are essentially neutral to our profit for 2019, they don't impact operating EPS guidance for the year, though they do have a benefit to our financial profile over the longer term.
Turning to free cash flow. We expect about $12 billion in 2019 with a realization rate of about 100%. This reflects our expected operational profit performance and continued working capital efficiency, partially offset with a cash tax headwind. We've also taken into account the estimated free cash flow impacts of the software and services divestitures. Note that while these are relatively neutral to earnings, they are a headwind to our free cash flow because the gain proceeds flow into the investing section of our cash flow statement.
Finally, while we haven't included Red Hat, we have taken into account an estimate of the pre-closing financing costs associated with the acquisition. So when you put it all together, we see free cash flow of about $12 billion, which is roughly flat year-to-year even after absorbing the headwind from the portfolio actions.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.",4765

Thank you very much for the question, and it's probably a good place to start given we just concluded the prepared remarks and we talked about some of the dynamics of what's in our guidance. But as always, you would expect, we run multiple scenarios here across our business. And we're looking at the trajectory of our business, the macroeconomic environment, what our enterprise clients are telling us. And we also take into account our own operational indices in front of us and our business plans and strategies. And when we put all that together, this is what gives us confidence in an expectation of an operating EPS of at least $13.90 for 2019. Now as I just stated, this guidance excludes Red Hat just given to the timing sensitivity and the financial implications on when it closes, but it includes the announced divestitures. And we'll talk about that through all these Q&As with regard to any forward-looking guidance. But we enter -- from my perspective, we entered 2019 with a much improved business profile in terms of, one, driving operating leverage, and you saw how that played out in the second half, and it's right to the core of your question; and two, our strategic imperatives right now, the high-value emerging segments of the IT industry are now consistently over 50% of IBM's business. So while we don't give guidance on revenue, let me give you a little color behind that. And then I'll go to operating leverage and gross and pretax margin and tax as we move forward. But first, I'll start with a tailwind. We have a solid annuity base in our business. And today, it's about 60% of IBM, and that builds resiliency into our model. And we got good momentum in our as a service as you heard. We exited the year with an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion, and that's up 21% year-over-year. You combine that with the strength within our services business. We accelerated throughout the year, and we exited the year with a very strong performance by a GBS team, who is just doing excellent with regards to continuing to win in front of the marketplace and deliver value to their clients. And we also captured significant signings in the fourth quarter that positions our GTS business and really instantiates our value around hybrid cloud and how we're winning. And then you couple that with solid execution on software. You know, we talked 90 days ago about where we were at in the third quarter around software, and we made some forward-looking projections, and we turned our software business around to growth growing 2% in the fourth quarter. And we had a strong portfolio lineup, so we would expect that to continue. And then hardware, yes, we're in the back end of our mainframe cycle. And I would tell you, it's the most successful mainframe we've had in quite a bit of time. But we continue to bring new innovation to market to deliver value for our clients in our POWER9 architecture, which is resonating well in the marketplace and we got great acceptance, grew 10% in the fourth quarter. We expect that will continue to play out in 2019. So we've got a good book of business here and some tailwinds at us. 
And from a headwind perspective, you talked about macro. Well, the first thing I would call out is currency. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen throughout 2018, especially even since our last earnings call 90 days ago, the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate. And right now you saw in the supplemental charts, we provide you with transparency, we expect about a 1- to 2-point headwind on currency. And then finally, we are taking very disciplined portfolio actions across our business where they don't align to our integrated value play and where we can reprioritize and focus our investment to drive the value around the IBM company. That divested content is going to be about a 1-point headwind. So when you put it all together, we've got some pluses and minuses at the top line, but really, this year in 2019, it's going to be predicated on operating leverage. We made good progress through '18, and it positions us very well, and to expand margins in 2019. So amongst all of our scenarios, our guidance model and our expectations indicate that we will expand gross and pretax operating margin in 2019 as we continue to deliver value. And that's going to come out of scale efficiencies. That's going to come out our services momentum and the mix shift in productivity, which will offset -- more than offset the product cycle mix we still have in the divested content. And one last thing that I would call out is tax. We're guiding to an all-in rate of about 11% to 12%, which, by the way, is a headwind year-to-year that we're going to have to overcome, finishing with a printed rate of about 8% in 2018. Now this rate assumes estimated potential discretes. This is a change. We're doing this to provide enhanced transparency into our guidance as we move forward. But I will tell you, discretes by nature vary in timing, they vary in amounts and will be recorded when they occur in 2019. But you put all that together. We've got headwinds and tailwinds on revenue, strong portfolio lineup in our high-value services and software. We got expanding operating leverage that we expect, the tax rate all-in of about 11% or 12%. This gives us confidence in our full year EPS of at least $13.90 and a free cash flow of about $12 billion.",950

I just wanted to know if you could clarify what the size of the expected gain is on the sale of assets to Red Hat -- excuse me, to HCL. And then whether you expect directionally Red Hat to be accretive or dilutive to free cash flow and EPS this year. And then on software, could you comment on the strength that you saw? Was it a pushout? Do you feel like you captured large enterprise license agreements? Or is this sort of a more normalized book? And should we expect Cognitive to grow in Q1 and Q2 at a similar pace to what we saw in Q4?",117

Thank you very much. Very good questions. Let me try to take each of these piece by piece. First of all, as you saw from our last earnings, we continue to take disciplined portfolio prioritization efforts around our portfolio both in terms of the announcement of the acquisition of Red Hat and also the announcement of sale of certain assets within our cognitive and GBS business. Red Hat, as we talked about, expected was -- we're working through regulatory right now, we expect to close that in the second half. But with regards to your specific question on divestitures, we included in our guidance the sale of our collaboration and on-prem marketing and commerce business and the sale of our Seterus mortgaging business. Both of these will drive headwinds, as you can imagine, in revenue for the year. We expect the mortgage business to close later in the first quarter. That will be a headwind this year to GBS revenue. But on a sustainable basis, this improves both our revenue profile in GBS and our margin profile as we continue to shift to higher value as we move forward. In terms of our cognitive assets that we sold with regards to collaboration and on-prem, those businesses generated roughly a little bit over $1 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. We said we expected to close that by midyear. The transaction price was $1.8 billion, but the expected gain, I will tell you, will be a lot less than that $1.8 billion as we're working through the acquisition accounting right now with regards to goodwill and how much goodwill will be applied to that. But we still expect a sizable gain, nowhere near $1.8 billion but a sizable gain. And as we said, we've got to overcome, one, the foregone profits of these businesses; the stranded cost of these businesses. And we will take that gain, and as you would expect, we're going to utilize a portion of that gain to address that stranded cost and structure, and we'll get return on that. All of that put together is minimal impact to our profit. So we included that in our guidance. It has minimal impact to our profit and EPS, but it does have an impact to free cash flow. Just given what I said a little while ago in the prepared remarks on the gain on the asset sale will end up in the investing section of free cash flow. So we've overcome that and still guided a free cash flow that's roughly flat at about $12 billion. 
Now your second question was on cognitive. We obviously executed well. You dial back 90 days ago, and we had some pretty frank discussions about our portfolio, how we had confidence in our portfolio, the competitiveness and the value we bring to clients. And we didn't execute in third quarter and we came back. We executed on strong pipelines. Software was up 2% overall. Our -- we had strong transactional performance. Well, probably what I'm most proud about is it was pervasive. We grew in hybrid cloud integration software 4%. We grew in solutions software 3% across many of our offerings led by data and AI and analytics also in many offerings in our industry verticals around Watson Health; and we grew in transaction processing software, which we said that business is mission critical, high value to our clients, and it followed client buying cycles. So if anything in our overall portfolio of software that's tied to SKU, it's really the transaction processing software business where we closed a strong pipeline, which we talked about 90 days ago. So we feel very good about the competitiveness and value of our portfolio. We're going to feel even better when we close the Red Hat acquisition, and what that does to provide us an acceleration and a leadership position on hybrid multi-cloud, and we're excited and looking forward to that.",660

Thank you, Katy, and thanks on behalf of the entire IBM team. We really just delivered a solid fourth quarter here. But if you take a look at it, it's very good question. Why don't I just address it by trying to get some visibility into first quarter. It's right in front of us right now. If you take a look at first quarter, again, we guided full year EPS of at least $13.90. If you look at first quarter, first of all, on an EPS perspective, we would expect the operating EPS skew to be around 16% of the full year at $13.90. So when you take a look at that, it gets us off to a good start. It does acknowledge that we are on the back end of a mainframe product cycle, but we got acceleration in our services and our software base of business. And we feel confident in at least that 16% starting out the year. Now if you look at that compared to the last 3 years, it will show that it's a little bit less attainment, but to your -- heart of your question, the last few years, we had substantial discrete tax items in the first quarter. If you go back to '16, we closed on the Japan audit. If you go back to last year, we closed on the U.S. audit settlement. We do not see anywhere near the level of discretes in the first quarter. And I would project somewhere around the 11%, 10%, there might be something within the first quarter, but we're not talking substantial amount. So that is really EPS. On revenue, which we probably had the best visibility just given our operational indices, the mix differential of our revenue base between annuity and transactional when we move from a fourth quarter to first quarter, that seasonality, the transactional businesses have a more muted effect on 1Q versus 4Q. And as the mix of more annuity content, which plays out in the first quarter, this should contribute about a 1- to 2-point sequential improvement in our growth at constant currency. And you know we just came off a fourth quarter with many different dynamics that produced a down 1 at constant currency. So we do see an improvement just given the mix shift in the strength of our annuity content as we move forward. The last thing that I'll bring up about first quarter is I talked a little bit about currency for the year. We have our toughest compare on currency in the first quarter. Just given last year, the dollar weakened throughout the first quarter and then dramatically accelerated or strengthened as we moved through 2Q through 4Q. So as you saw on the supplemental charts, our currency impact is going to be a 3- to 4-point headwind. And based on what I looked at where the dollar closed late today, it's going to be probably closer to that 4-point headwind overall.",498

Application management's up into a nice place. So curious on the sustainability there. And just as a clarification away from the services, with strategic imperatives up 9%, there wasn't as much talk about that in the prepared remark.

We obviously are very pleased with our services business and how we've continued to reposition our portfolio both in GBS but also in our GTS base of business as we moved throughout 2018. But when you look at the trajectory of our business, we ended the year with an overall or absolute backlog of $116 billion. That's down 60 basis points at constant currency, and it's a big improvement from where we started a year ago. If you remember our discussions here a year ago, we had a lot of discussion about your overall backlogs down 3% at constant currency, and we talked a lot about what we saw play out in 2018, and the team's just done an excellent job. We're in a much better position. And we do see across our total services business in '19 sustained revenue growth and margin profile. But let me take the pieces and just give you a little bit of perspective. GBS, couldn't be more proud of the team about what they've done to reposition their portfolio and their offerings in capturing and delivering growth to our clients in digital, in cognitive and cloud. You saw on the fourth quarter, we exited GBS. I'll get these numbers pretty close: strategic imperatives growing mid-teens; cloud growing 30-plus percent; and our as-a-service-based business exiting with over a $2 billion number, I think up 64% overall; and we've got pervasive growth across all 3 lines of business led by digital. We did state in application management, where we finally returned back to growth in the fourth quarter, we are executing and delivering value and driving cloud migration services and cloud application development. We have a differentiated offering, and we're delivering value to our clients. But we also closed on many client-specific milestones that caught up in the fourth quarter, but we still see good growth. It's just not going to be at the level that you saw here in the fourth quarter. With all that said, our margin and operating leverage, we feel comfortable. We grew GBS operating gross margins 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. That will dissipate throughout 2019, but we still see strong operating leverage led by our mix shift to higher value and the offerings, how we're capturing that price realization and how we're delivering real value and quality to our clients. Now in GTS, we are obviously winning with our hybrid cloud momentum. We had a strong signings quarter, really led by GTS overall and the hybrid cloud value prop; delivered $15.8 billion of signings, up 21%. That's what improved that backlog position here at the end of the year. And we're exiting with an $8 billion as-a-service annualized exit run rate, which provides a strong annuity base content and resiliency in our model. Now with that said, we are doing portfolio prioritization in GTS. We are constantly going to focus on where we can exploit and deliver value to our client and also make high-value returns for the IBM shareholder. We are walking away from low value-based content in GTS. You saw that in the fourth quarter where our GTS business overall was down, I think, 50, 70 basis points. And while you see that absolute backlog improve, we are going to continue prioritizing high value because we want to get prioritization of cash, profit and margin out of that business and leverage that business in the value of incumbency and moving our clients to the future and capitalizing on hybrid cloud. So we'll see continued margin expansion in GTS as we move forward, and that's going to come out of very similar scale efficiencies, productivity. And remember, in both, we're still going to get the second half of our productivity from our 2018 actions. So we feel pretty comfortable and confident in our services base of business as we walk into '19.",654

Thanks very much for the question. Let me take a big step back. Obviously, I've been thinking about this as has Ginni and everyone else. And from my perspective, we constantly say IBM is a high-value-based company. We're high value to our clients. We're high value to our shareholders. And the way we remain high value is through disciplined portfolio optimization. And whether you go over what we just did the last 90, 120 days or you go over the last 3 years to 5 years, we have constantly focused on, one, where is the market moving in terms of growth; high-value offerings; client value; and most importantly, profit pools. And you're seeing us continue to do that as we move forward. These latest actions really center around disciplined portfolio prioritization around market attractiveness, around differentiation and around how they really played to the integrated value of the IBM portfolio. Our differentiated hardware-software services, and that was really at the heart of the divestitures that we just announced around certain assets in our Cognitive Solutions segment and in our global processing mortgage servicing unit. They were basically more and more sold as standalone-only products and offerings that can be leveraged and delivered to our clients through a different partner, who will make the investment prioritization as we go -- move forward. I could tell you, we're always looking at portfolio optimization and how we prioritize our investment and capital allocation. And you see that with the announcement of Red Hat, and you see that play out in what we just did with cognitive and GBS. But as we go forward, we're going to continue prudently managing our portfolio and operate with that financial discipline in terms of acquisitions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's always been built around supporting high value, and it's built around leveraging the investment thesis and narrative of IBM, innovative technology, deep industry expertise and trust and security all delivered through an integrated model of hardware-software services. And then finally, I would tell you, we have a strong balance sheet. We have great cash flow, and we have enough financial flexibility to continue invest in our business and returning value to our shareholders over the long term. So we feel pretty good.",377

Let me try to put this in perspective around cloud. First of all, our cloud overall for the year was $19.2 billion. That was up 12%. And within that, as we always talk about, the high-value emerging areas of as-a-service finished with an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion, up 21%, which really clearly underlines our consistent execution and us capturing the high-value secular shifts around cloud in that as-a-service. No when you look at cloud in the quarter, the cloud number as printed really reflects the same fundamental headwind on the ramp of the product cycle of mainframe that we had to overcome. Now that isn't new. We expected that. We've been talking about that all year long. Second half of the year, we knew we were going to be on the back end of our mainframe product cycle. Remember, we came off of mainframe that grew 71% in the fourth quarter of 2017. And this is, as I said before, the most successful mainframe product cycle in quite some time, which, by the way, generates and captures new emerging workloads around pervasive encryption but also is capturing new workloads around cloud as we move forward. So that cloud business without mainframe was actually up 19%. That's an acceleration underlying our software acceleration from 3Q to 4Q, underlining our services acceleration from 3Q to 4Q. And we see that as we move forward because, remember, although we had a deal with the largest transactional quarter on mainframe, albeit in 2019, that starts to dissipate because we're through that biggest volume-based quarter. So we see cloud still resonating with our clients. And to your heart of your question about Red Hat, Red Hat and IBM together, we see this movement of how we can deliver value in leading the second phase, Ginni calls this chapter 2, the second phase around where clients are moving very business-critical, business-value-led workloads, and that's about 80% of the workloads ahead of us. So the value of bringing IBM and Red Hat together is going to be centered around hybrid, open, multi-cloud and us wrapping around our security, secure to the core, and how we're going to deliver that differentiated value proposition. And we're just excited about what Red Hat is going to mean to the IBM company and our clients.",396

And I guess, the question is, on a go-forward basis, you have a target of mid-single-digit growth long term in cognitive. Is it realistic to expect that you could achieve that as we head throughout 2019? And can you maybe talk about the impact of any of the transactional business you may have seen this quarter that might affect that? And just kind of talk broadly about the macro environment for that product set in general.",91

We are pleased with our software performance exiting the year. As I talked about, I think it's really an instantiation that demonstrates our ability to deliver innovative solutions embedded with AI that drives business value to our clients really through an industry lens that plays across the integrated value of IBM with our services base of business and stacked on top of our hardware-based platforms. But when you look at fourth quarter, we exited 2% growth. We had good pervasive growth across the portfolio, as I said before, good, strong transactional growth, good SaaS signings, high renewal rates. And remember, this Cognitive Solutions segment is high value, high operating margins, and we continued to expand operating margins here in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now when you take a step back, you asked long term, well, obviously, in 2019, we're going to deal with the headwind I talked about with the divested content. That will to Cognitive Solutions probably be, on a trailing 12 months, we did a little over $1 billion. So it would be about a 4-, 5-point headwind in '19, and that's pre-Red Hat acquisition because Red Hat's not in '19 yet. But we're going to have, right off the bat, a 4- to 5-point headwind. But the underlying fundamentals in our long-term sustainability around that, yes, our long-term model has not changed. We still see the strength of our offering portfolio, one, even getting better around our hybrid integration software; two, around our analytics portfolio, which just had a great quarter; data AI; our industry-based verticals. Our Watson Health had growth across many of its offerings as I talked about earlier. And even in IoT, we had growth around our core franchises of facilities management and asset management, Maximo and TRIRIGA. So we got a good lineup. It's going to be on us to execute here in 2019. We fully expect to do that.",330

Thank you very much for the call. First of all, we don't guide on revenue for the year, so I don't remember stating that we are going to grow the year at constant currency organically, et cetera. Red Hat's not in any of the guidance as we talked about upfront. We do have the divestitures in here. Divestitures are going to be about a 1-point headwind as we move forward. And as I stated, currency is going to be a 1- to 2-point headwind at actual rates. But we do feel confident in the book of business we have around our services and around our software as we move forward. But the underlying dynamics, as I talked about, we have many different scenarios we're running here. All point to giving us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 as we move forward. That is going to be a mixture of the mix of our portfolio, the revenue of our portfolio, the operating leverage of our portfolio, the tax structure, IP. There are many different variables that go into that $13.90 overall. We do see strong operating leverage continuing in 2019, both gross and pretax margin, leveraging our scale efficiencies, leveraging our mix shift to higher value, leveraging our productivity initiatives. And when you look at it, we've got great momentum exiting second half, in particular around our services base of business. Second half services grew operating gross margins by 200 basis points, and I think you would expect a similar first half trend around that. And then second half, we'll start wrapping on a little tougher compares, but for the first -- or excuse me, for the full year, we would expect good operating leverage, and that's what we're guiding to.",294

The question I have is, as we look forward to next year, I know you have a lot of variables, are there any bridge items that you want to particularly call us out for as most likely to happen to hit your $13.90? And how come cash flow wouldn't be growing if you have earnings growing?",76
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2019",2019-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4939.0,1639272.0,64551726.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,30,"Okay, Jim. First of all, thank you for the question. Thanks for the compliment. The team does work very hard to provide the right level of transparency so our investors can understand the operating dynamics of our business. And Chart 10 lays out that full year. You see how 2018 played out, strong operating leverage, tax headwind, revenue growth at actuals. When you look at it and you go back to beginning of January last year, we stated what we saw for the year. We grew revenue. We grew operating leverage. We grew operating pretax income. We grew earnings per share, and that played out well. If you look at 2019, as I stated, many different scenarios. But what have we talked about already on this call? One, we see continued operating leverage coming out of gross and pretax margin in 2019. Two, we do see tax being a headwind to us in 2019. And again, we tried to provide enhanced transparency, where we're giving you an all-in rate of at least 11% to 12%, but even with that, that's a 3- to 4-point headwind. We'll continue to buy back shares as we talked about. I think that's, one, a level of confidence that we have in the long-term value of IBM, but it's also a level of confidence that we have in the power of the IBM and Red Hat acquisition. So I think you could see that continuing to play out. And then, I guess, last, we talked about currency on revenue. Currency on revenue, the impact of 1 to 2 points and the divestitures. So we will continue showing the transparency of this EPS bridge, helps our investors understand the operating dynamics as we move forward.",289

We also will have some items that hit our free cash flow relative to some pre-closing costs for Red Hat. So that's the reason that the free cash flow is flat despite the fact that we have a couple of headwinds within that.",91

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2019",2019-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4939.0,1639272.0,64551729.0,Question,Keith Bachman,,Analysts,33,"Jim, just a clarification first then a question. On the clarification, you mentioned the impact of the divestitures. In the slides, it indicates the impact is $1.5 billion. I think you said $1 billion was coming out of Cognitive. And I just wanted to see if you'd just clarify where is the rest coming out of? 
And then the question is on Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. I wanted to get your perspective. As you look at 2019, this business continues to trail a little bit relative to GBS in terms of revenue performance. Would you expect or anticipate this business to grow in CY '19? And therefore, would you expect operating leverage to also be demonstrated in this business?",120
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2019",2019-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4939.0,1639272.0,64551730.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,34,"Yes. Thanks, Keith, for the question overall. First of all, on your clarification, the impact to divestitures. We actually did provide a supplemental chart that hopefully each of you and our investors will appreciate on the transparency and the implications both on '19 and then directionally on 2019. I think I said a little over $1 billion. If you look at Chart, what is it, 15, in the supplementals, the Cognitive software assets of divesting collaboration and our on-prem marketing and commerce was about -- was $1.3 billion. So that's what I meant about a little over $1 billion. When you take a look at the GBS mortgage servicing divestiture, that's about $200 million. So on a full year basis, annualized, it's about $1.5 billion between the 2 of them. So hopefully, that answers the clarification. 
And then on your second question, TS&CP. We finished the year with strong signings growth, which really instantiates our hybrid cloud value proposition and also the value of incumbency that we provide with our clients of understanding their workloads, understanding their business processes and enabling us to mute -- move them to the future and capturing that cloud backlog. In fact, cloud backlog is up over 5 points year-to-year as a percent of our total outsourcing backlog. But as I said earlier, GTS business, we are going to manage this business for profit, for cash and for leveraging our incumbency to move our clients to the future and provide better client value and delight them through loyalty as they move forward. And we are going to exit some low-value content business. So, for 2019, I would expect pretty similar performance in GTS overall on a top line, but in margin, we are going to expand margin that's in our expectations. And you see that play out in the second half of '18, and we expect that to continue.
So all right, with that said, apologize for going a little bit long here. We wanted to get a lot in here, one, about the quarter; but two, about wrapping up the year and what it means for '19. So a few comments to wrap-up.
We're entering 2019 in a great position to help our clients, whether they're looking for innovation or productivity or both. We've got a solid base of business. You see this in our software and services results with strategic imperatives now consistently at about half of our revenue and in operating leverage we're driving, and we expect that to continue. This gives us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 of earnings per share for the year. You know, our hand will only get stronger with the addition of Red Hat, which positions us as the leader in hybrid, multi-cloud world.
So thanks for joining us today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you very much.",483

In the first quarter, we delivered $18.2 billion of revenue with significant operating leverage. We delivered $2.2 billion of operating pretax income and $2.25 of operating earnings per share, and we've now generated over $12 billion of free cash flow over the last year with realization well over 100%. We had strong performance in offerings that help clients with their digital transformations and journeys to cloud. At the same time, we continue to take actions to optimize our portfolio while investing to lead in the emerging, high-value areas of the IT industry. 
You saw this play out in our results. Our cloud growth accelerated to 12% at constant currency. Our Cloud & Cognitive Software was up 2%, and our consulting revenue was up 9%, also both at constant currency. 
We had significant margin expansion with operating gross margin up 90 basis points driven by both services segments, and we had solid free cash flow. 
Improving margin has been a focus for us, and our performance this quarter is the result of actions we've been taking not only our focus on higher value and portfolio optimization, but also driving productivity and operational efficiency, especially in our services business. 
With this start to the year, we are maintaining our full year expectations for operating earnings per share and free cash flow. In the first quarter, our revenue was down less than a point year-to-year at constant currency, slightly better than our fourth quarter performance. Our reported revenue, as expected, includes a significant currency headwind. As always, I'll focus on constant currency performance. 
From a geographic perspective, our year-to-year revenue growth in the developed markets improved a couple of points sequentially, consistent with the expectations we discussed last quarter. That said, we had weaker performance in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, which impacted our overall revenue performance. 
Looking at our results by segment, we had continued revenue growth in Global Business Services and in our Cloud & Cognitive Software. In GBS, as I said, we had another quarter of strong growth in consulting as we help clients with their digital reinventions, and we again expanded our margins in GBS. 
In our Software segment, growth was driven by our hybrid cloud offerings, security and solution areas like supply chain and Watson Health. 
In Global Technology Services, we're continuing to help our clients implement and manage hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is evidenced in the increasing share of our backlog which is now cloud. At the same time, consistent with our high-value focus, we're continuing to take actions to optimize our GTS performance by exiting lower-value content. While this contributes to lower GTS revenue, we had higher profit, margin and cash contribution.
Our Systems revenue declined, reflecting the IBM Z product cycle dynamics and weaker performance in storage. Across our segments, clients continue to be focused on solutions that deliver innovation and growth. Though as we mentioned last quarter, we're seeing an increasing bias towards engagements that provide productivity and predictability of spend. And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver both innovation and productivity, helping our clients transition their business models to hybrid cloud. Our cloud revenue growth in the first quarter accelerated to 12% with our as-a-service offerings up 15%. With this, our cloud revenue has grown to $19.5 billion over the last year. 
Over the last several months, we've talked about the next chapter of cloud, which focuses on shifting mission-critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services and workflows across multiple clouds and on-prem. And they need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability and cloud management. This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud open approach.
And so we have been reshaping our business to address this opportunity, investing heavily to build capabilities across our business like IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Private and IBM Cloud Private for Data; the IBM Multicloud Manager; Cloud Garages; cloud migration services; and cloud optimized systems. These are the innovations that are driving our $19.5 billion of cloud revenue.
In the first quarter, we introduced additional capabilities that will accelerate hybrid cloud adoption, including Watson Anywhere, which makes IBM Watson available on-premises as well as on any private or public cloud; and IBM Cloud Integration platform, which provides a standard way to integrate services and applications across multiple cloud environments. More broadly, we have built a framework of offerings to facilitate our clients' journey to the cloud. It is designed to help our clients across the 4 key stages of their cloud transformation journey: advise, move, build and manage. These offerings span our Cloud & Cognitive Software, Global Business Services and Global Technology Services, leveraging the integrated value of IBM. 
And so we have a strong foundation for the addition of Red Hat. Together, we will be ideally positioned to help our clients shift their business applications to hybrid cloud while addressing the issues I just mentioned around portability, management consistency, security, remaining open, which avoids vendor lock-in. This will not only enhance the growth of Red Hat's business after closing, but lift all of IBM as we saw more of our data and AI software on Containers across multiple platforms and more of our services from app modernization to multi-cloud managed services. 
At IBM, we're investing and building capabilities to be ready to drive these synergies. We're moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect to close in the second half of 2019. 
Before getting into the financial metrics, I want to lay out the contributors to our year-to-year operating earnings per share performance, especially because there are a couple of larger items in last year's results that impact the dynamics. In fact, these larger items contributed a $0.32 benefit to last year's earnings per share, which of course creates a headwind to this year's growth. 
And so looking at the drivers, as I said, our revenue was down less than 1% at constant currency, but with the stronger dollar, revenue was down 4.7%. At constant margin, revenue was a headwind to profit and earnings per share growth. 
Last year, we took pretax charges associated with the actions to realign our skills to key opportunities and better position our Systems cost structure. These, together with the benefit of the actions and our ongoing operating efficiencies, resulted in strong pretax income growth and pretax margin expansion. 
Last year, we also had a large discrete tax benefit associated with an audit settlement. With a much smaller discrete benefit this year, tax was a significant headwind to our net income. And finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. 
Putting this altogether, we had solid operating leverage and margin expansion, offset by a $0.32 impact of last year's significant items, resulting in an operating EPS of $2.25. 
So now getting into profit and margin metrics. We continue to drive operating leverage, expanding both gross and pretax margins. Our operating gross margin was up 90 basis points. This was driven by strong performance in both services businesses, together, up 160 basis points. 
We also had a year-to-year benefit from the charge we took last year in Systems, which was offset by the impact of the IBM Z product cycle. Our operating expense was better 11%, which resulted in a 2-point benefit in our expense-to-revenue ratio. Overall, we've been driving productivity in our business, including implementing new ways of working and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This drives operating leverage and provides flexibility to increase investment in areas like hybrid cloud, AI and blockchain. But we have a few other drivers of our expense performance this quarter, including currency and lower workforce rebalancing charges, mitigated by our lower level of IP income. 
Regarding currency, while a stronger dollar hurts the top line, it generally helps expense due both to translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. In the first quarter, currency helped our year-to-year expense by nearly 6 points. Much of this was reflected in other income and expense. In fact, the $200 million year-to-year change in other income and expense was entirely due to hedging benefits. Remember, these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L. 
Expense also includes a year-to-year reduction of over $500 million for workforce rebalancing driven by last year's charge. 
And finally, within expense, we absorbed a lower level of IP income as it hurts our PTI growth by over $200 million. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pretax margin was up over 300 basis points. 
Our operating tax rate was 10%, including discretes. This is right in line with our all-in first quarter expectation of 10% to 11% we provided in January. And as I said earlier, this was a significant headwind to our net income growth year-to-year. 
Looking at our cash metrics, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up about $350 million over last year. There's a lot of seasonality in our cash generation. And so looking over the last 12 months, we generated over $12 billion of free cash flow. That's 114% of our GAAP net income normalized. I'll touch on the cash drivers and uses of cash a little later. 
And so now before getting into the segment performance, I want to spend a minute on an overview of our 2019 segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we shared historical information on this new structure a couple of weeks ago. As our clients become digital enterprises, they need tighter integration between hybrid cloud and their data and AI platforms to unlock value. And so we recently made changes to our management system to more effectively address our clients' evolving needs and in preparation for the acquisition of Red Hat. The changes also better align our portfolio to the market and to underlying business models. 
The business changes resulted in 3 adjustments to our segment structure for 2019. First, we brought our Cloud & Cognitive Software together in one segment. Second, we combined our security services with security software, consistent with the way we are running that integrated business. And then finally, we moved the results for the businesses we're divesting to the Other category to provide better transparency to the ongoing operational performance of our software and GBS segments. This includes the pending sale of our collaboration and on-prem marketing and commerce software to HCL, the pending sale of the balance of our marketing and commerce software to Centerbridge and the just-completed sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business. 
And so looking at our new segments, we created the Cloud & Cognitive Software segment, bringing software platforms and solutions into one segment. Within this segment, we'll report cloud and data platforms, which brings together software for hybrid cloud management with data and AI platforms. Cognitive applications includes vertical and domain-specific solutions that are built on cloud and data platforms. These offerings are increasingly being infused with AI. And then transaction processing platforms includes the middleware and database software that supports our clients' mission-critical workloads running on z/OS as well as storage software. 
Looking at our services segments. The scope of Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged other than moving the divested mortgage servicing business to Other. Global Technology Services is consistent with the services component of Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, excluding security services. 
And then finally, our Systems and Global Financing segments are also unchanged. 
So now let me get into the segment results, starting with our Cloud & Cognitive Software segment where revenue grew 2%. Our clients' journey to cloud and AI is now turning to more mission-critical workloads. As I just mentioned, linking the data, AI and applications together with hybrid cloud in a secure way is critical for any successful digital reinvention. We are uniquely positioned to do this with our comprehensive cloud and data offerings, coupled with a deep understanding of our clients' workflows and security needs. Within this segment, we had good growth in cloud and data platforms and cognitive applications while transaction processing platforms was flat. I'll break down some of the drivers behind these areas. 
Our cloud and data platforms grew 2%. We delivered growth this quarter by helping clients build across public and private clouds with IBM Cloud Private, which as you know, is built on Linux Containers and Kubernetes. We help them modernize and integrate applications and environments with our integration and digital business automation platforms and then collect and manage data with a hybrid data management platform, all of which grew this quarter. This need for tighter integration across hybrid cloud, data and AI are also driving traction for our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering as well as Watson Assistant and Watson OpenScale that run on IBM Cloud Private for Data. We see the value of bringing together the hybrid cloud and data value propositions at a European tax authority, which is using our digital business automation platform to redesign their tax processes around their data lake and improve the taxpayer experience. 
In cognitive applications, revenue was up 4%. Growth was led by security as well as solution areas like health, supply chain and weather. 
In security, we delivered strong double-digit growth with our integrated software and services value proposition. 
In particular, we continue to see good traction with our threat management software and services offerings, including QRadar and Resilient, and our security intelligence operations consulting services, which detect and respond to security threats for our clients. 
Panasonic, for example, is leveraging QRadar and related services to strengthen its threat management posture. Panasonic is also piloting our next-gen X-Force threat management offering. 
In Watson Health, we had broad-based growth across areas including payer, provider and government as clients look to harness data to create actionable insights. We also had good results from our weather offerings, which grew double digits this quarter and reached a new all-time high in the number of active users. 
Transaction processing platforms revenue was consistent with last year as clients continue to commit to our platform for the longer term. Performance reflects the value we provide clients managing these vital workloads and their preference for predictability in IT spend. 
Turning to profit for this segment. We expanded pretax margin by 2 points year-to-year. This reflects a lower level of workforce rebalancing this year, mitigated by a headwind in IP income and continued investment in key strategic areas. 
As we look forward, essentially all of our software portfolio now runs on Linux Containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. We've introduced new offerings like IBM Cloud Integration platform, the digital business automation platform and Watson Anywhere to further accelerate hybrid cloud adoption, and we have ongoing activities to educate all of IBM's employees on the journey to cloud, which includes Red Hat skills. All of this better prepares us for the Red Hat acquisition. 
Moving to Global Business Services. We continued the momentum from last year and delivered another solid quarter. Revenue grew 4%, and gross margin expanded 280 basis points. We again had strong growth in consulting, which was up 9%. As clients embark on their digital journey to a cognitive enterprise, they are turning to GBS to help them with their strategy and implementation, leveraging our deep industry expertise and innovative technology portfolio. 
The growth this quarter was led by Digital Strategy and iX as well as consulting for cloud application migrations and our next-generation enterprise application practice. Within cloud application migration, GBS Cloud Advisory Services works with enterprises to plan and implement a clear strategy and road map for their hybrid cloud journey. We are doing this with Tribune Publishing as they transform from a legacy print company to a digital company, helping them determine the right environment for each of their applications and optimizing their migration to the cloud. Our next-generation enterprise application offerings assist clients as they build and implement cloud-native applications in areas such as Workday, Salesforce and S/4HANA. IBM is now leading the market with over 200 S/4HANA impact assessments, over 200 implementations and more than 125 go-lives. 
In application management, we are shifting our business to cloud-based offerings and continue to have good momentum in our Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development. 
Overall, application management revenue was flat due to ongoing declines in the traditional application management engagements. And then Global Process Services had solid performance in first quarter. Revenue was up 5% with strong performance in risk and compliance, along with financial process services. 
Turning to GBS profit. Our gross margin was 26%, which is up 280 basis points, driven by our mix to higher-value offerings, the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives and a continuing help from currency given our global delivery mix. This enables us to make investments as we prepare for the Red Hat acquisition such as scaling our existing Red Hat practice to enhance our journey to cloud offerings for clients leveraging Red Hat capabilities. 
We are also creating new offerings around advise, build, move and manage services through industry points of view and platform plays.
In Global Technology Services, as I mentioned last quarter, we are taking actions to optimize our portfolio by exiting low-value services content to increase margin, profit and cash contribution and better position the business for the longer term. GTS plays an important role in IBM's integrated value proposition, building on its deep client relationships to shift our clients to hybrid cloud. 
As we move through last year, we improved GTS profit and margin, creating operating leverage. This gives us a solid base from which we can deemphasize lower-value contract and third-party content, enabling continued investment for chapter 2 of the cloud and delivering sustained margin improvement. This is where we're focused. We saw this play out in our first quarter results. As overall revenue declined, our gross margin expanded 110 basis points driven by the mix shift to higher value, a lift from cloud scale efficiencies and productivity improvements.
So now looking at the GTS revenue by line of business, infrastructure and cloud services was down 3% and technology support services was down 2%. Within infrastructure and cloud services, we continued to have solid growth in cloud revenue, which was up 13%. This is driven by the backlog where cloud is now over 30% of the total services outsourcing backlog. Keep in mind, most of the cloud opportunity is ahead of us. 80% of the enterprise workloads, which represent mission-critical work, have yet to move to the cloud. As clients migrate these workloads to a hybrid, multi-cloud environment, they face increased complexity in managing their infrastructure. Because we've been running these workloads, we're better positioned to help our clients to build and manage these new environments. 
During the first quarter, we announced that we're moving and managing BNP Paribas and Santander, a couple of the largest banks in Europe, to hybrid cloud. That's on top of companies like Lloyds, Allianz, Westpac, American Airlines and Anthem Insurance. The list goes on. That's all mission-critical work starting to move, and they're moving it with IBM. 
The portfolio actions I mentioned earlier create flexibility to invest in additional cloud capabilities to capture this high-value growing market. 
For example, our IBM services for multi-cloud management offering provides a single system to help enterprise simplify the management of their IT resources across multiple cloud providers, on-prem environments and private clouds. And as we prepare for the Red Hat acquisition, we are investing to build on our partnership as a services integrator for Red Hat to be a leader in hybrid, multi-cloud services. 
In Systems, revenue was down 9% this quarter with declines in IBM Z, reflecting where we are in the product cycle, and in storage driven by market and competitive dynamics. That said, we had good performance in Power. 
This quarter, IBM Z revenue declined 38%. I'll remind you, we are wrapping on strong performance from last year when we had 54% growth. We are 7 quarters into the z14 cycle, and the program continues to track ahead of the prior program. We had strong growth in volumes or shipped MIPS, and new workload MIPS continue to outpace our standard MIPS. This growth is led by Linux again this quarter. And our single-frame z14, designed specifically for cloud data centers, remains a growth driver. 
Power revenue grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 9%, driven by Linux and the full rollout of our POWER9-based architecture. As clients look to handle more data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX, they are turning to POWER9 systems. These systems are built to handle advanced analytics and cloud environments. Both the high-end and entry-level offerings posted strong growth this quarter as clients continue to adopt this new technology. 
Storage hardware was down 11% with declines in both the high end and midrange, offset by continued growth in all-flash arrays. Performance reflects declines in our high end, which is tied to our mainframe cycle and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures. We are continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality to differentiate in this environment as we look to manage the portfolio for the market shift to flash. 
Looking at Systems profit. Pretax margin was down a point driven by a mix headwind due to where we are in the z14 cycle. 
So now turning to cash flow. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. Our free cash flow of $1.7 billion is up about $350 million year-to-year. This performance results in free cash flow of $12.2 billion over the last 12 months and continued strength in our normalized free cash flow realization rate, which is 114%. Our CapEx decline reflects effective capital management and the strategy I mentioned earlier to deemphasize some lower-value content. This reduces our capital requirements. And so free cash flow came in where we expected, and there is no change in our full year outlook of about $12 billion. 
Looking at uses of cash. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1.4 billion of dividends and over $900 million of gross share repurchases. That's $10.3 billion over the last 12 months. We bought back nearly 7 million shares, and at the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. I'll remind you, we plan to suspend share repurchase in 2020 and 2021 as we pay down debt for our Red Hat acquisition to get back to our targeted leverage ratio. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of over $18 billion and total debt of $50 billion. Both of these are up from December as we prepare for the acquisition of Red Hat later in the year. About 60% of our total debt is in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade. That's 2 points better than a year ago. As a reminder, our financing debt will decrease throughout the year as a result of the winding down of our commercial OEM content. 
So to summarize, free cash flow is on track and our balance sheet reflects the strength required to support our continuing investments and return to shareholders.
So let me make a few summary comments in the quarter and our view of the year before we move on to Q&A. In the first quarter, we grew in key high-value segments led by Global Business Services and Cloud & Cognitive Software while our overall revenue reflects the IBM Z product cycle dynamics and a focus on deemphasizing lower-value work in services. Across IBM, our cloud growth accelerated as we help our clients transition their business models to hybrid environments. We had significant margin expansion with gross margin up over 90 basis points. This reflects our shift to higher value and our focus on productivity and operational efficiencies, what I'd characterize as improving fundamentals. We're continuing to prioritize our investments and announce additional actions to divest some businesses that aren't contributing to the integrated value proposition for our clients. And we're continuing our planning and preparation for the acquisition of Red Hat. 
With this performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.90 of operating earnings per share and about $12 billion of free cash flow. I want to remind you what is and is not included in these expectations, and this is consistent with what we discussed last quarter. We continue to expect Red Hat to close in the second half. Because the financial implications to the year are dependent on the timing of the closing, we have not included Red Hat in the expectations. 
In contrast, the timing of the closing of our 2 remaining announced divestitures does not have a significant impact on the year. That's because we continue to expect the combination of the foregone profit, the gain on sale, the actions to address the structure and stranded costs and the resulting benefit from these actions to have minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year. And so our guidance assumes these divestitures. 
Looking at the skew of earnings per share for the year. We assume we'll deliver about 22% in the second quarter, in line with the last couple of years. And then looking at the second half, we would expect the growth in EPS to be skewed to the fourth quarter. This assumes we'll close the software divestitures in the second quarter with the gain effectively offset by the foregone profit and the charges for actions to address the structure and stranded costs. In other words, we expect essentially no impact to the second quarter. 
Looking at free cash flow. We do expect an impact from the divestitures as well as some pre-closing financing costs for the Red Hat acquisition. But with the solid start to the year in free cash flow, we are comfortable that we can absorb these headwinds in the full year expectation of about $12 billion. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.",4381

I think at the time, in Q4, you delivered minus 1% growth to constant currency, and you stated that revenues would improve 1 to 2 points in terms of the growth rate, which didn't occur. And on the margin side, when I back out restructuring expenses, it actually looks like operating margins declined year-over-year in Q1. And even if I adjust for IP income, it still looks like they were kind of flat year-over-year. So perhaps you can address each of those, particularly relative to your expectations 90 days ago and whether there was anything that kind of fell short of where you thought you'd be.",126

There's a lot packed into that. So let me take a step back and just give you a perspective of how we saw the quarter play out, and I'll touch on each of your points here as I go through this. 
We feel like we -- through the first 90 days of the year, we started out with a solid performance. Why? Because we see the fundamentals of our business model playing out in terms of growth in key high-value areas whether that be cloud and our acceleration there, security, digital and data and AI. And while we see the growth in those key high-value emerging areas, we're also delivering strong operating leverage by expanding margins, growing pretax income, expanding operating pretax margins and delivering strong free cash flow. So when you look at the quarter, let me start with revenue because you talked about what we expect in 90 days and where we're at. Underneath our revenue, we see continued momentum in our GBS business led by consulting, strong growth again, 9%, as we're enabling clients to really move on their journey to cloud and drive their digital reinventions and competitive advantage. We also had solid execution in our Cloud & Cognitive Software where our value propositions around hybrid cloud are playing out very nicely, and we're winning in the market. And we saw accelerated growth in our cloud-based business, basically going from mid-single digits in the fourth quarter when you look at our cloud performance to now exiting first quarter where in the quarter we grew 12%, and now we have a trailing 12-month $19.5 billion cloud business that's growing 12%. 
Now from a geography perspective, and it gets right at the heart of your question. We talked about 90 days ago that we saw about a 1 to 2-point sequential improvement. And if you look at our developed markets, we had pretty good execution, and we delivered that accelerated 1 to 2 points, in fact, over 2 points when you look at developed markets led by Japan, U.K., Italy, Spain and many others that grew very well. It was in the emerging markets, in particular, as I said in the prepared remarks, around the AP region where we saw a deceleration in revenue, and that was really driven by our transactional-related businesses, both Systems and the Cloud & Cognitive Software where we had a good transactional pipeline entering the quarter and just based on client buying decision delays, we did not execute. Those are great value propositions. They're in front of us right now. The team's on the field, and we're focused on closing that sales execution. 
Now let me go to operating leverage because you talked a little bit about our operating leverage and with and without charges, but let me set the record straight. One, strong gross profit margins, up 90 basis points driven by our services base of business, which is up 160 basis points year-over-year, and this is the strong -- strongest operating margin, gross margin, that we've had in 4 years from a year-to-year expansion. And pretax margins, you're right, up 320 basis points as printed, but within that, we did get a benefit by a much lower workforce rebalancing last year, but we're also seeing the fundamentals of our enterprise productivity initiatives play out. And when you adjust for the $200 million impact year-to-year in IP, our operating pretax margins are up. They're not down. So we feel like we started out. We delivered a strong quarter. We should have come up with some more revenue, especially in our emerging markets. The team is focused there in second quarter, but with all that said for the first 90 days, we think we're up to a solid start, and that gives us confidence in maintaining our guidance.",644

And then how are you thinking about Cloud & Cognitive Software growth going forward relative to the 2% growth over the last couple of quarters and especially in the context of the delayed deals that you referenced in Toni's question?",53
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575135.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Okay. Thanks, Katy, and I appreciate the question. Around strategic imperatives. Again, let me put this in perspective. We put the signpost out back in the beginning of 2015, if you all remember at our Investor Day. Why? Because we had to lay the groundwork and how as a company we needed to fundamentally shift our capital investment allocation and transform our portfolio into capturing the shifts in growth in cloud, in data, in analytics, in security and mobility. 
Now you fast-forward to the end of 2018, and at the time we made this announcement with that signpost, we were about less than a quarter's worth of our business, I think, Patricia? We exited '18 where we were consistently above 50%. And when you take a look at that, that has become more and more -- or I should say less and less of a relevant metric as we move forward. And more importantly, as I've spent quite a bit of time over the last quarter, both at Think with many of you as analysts and also with our investors to talk about as we change our external segmentation to reposition and get this company focused on chapter 2 and the journey to cloud and hybrid cloud, the same feedback we got from many of you and many of our investors is the strategic imperative metric is past its course, and they are looking for now what are the relevant metrics on managing the company moving forward. And that, as we put out in our new segmentation, is going to be around cloud in particular, accelerating our leadership position in the $1 trillion market opportunity around hybrid, that is going to be around as a Service and our scale efficiencies and margin; and finally, it's going to be around operating leverage and value. And that is going to be instantiated in gross margin and operating pretax margin. 
Now to your second question real quick, Cloud & Cognitive Software. Again, as I stated, solid execution again building on a couple of quarters, strong value proposition, strong offerings. Team executed well both across cloud and data platform as we were up 2%, but also across cognitive applications where we were up 4%. And I talked about in the prepared remarks how we continue to differentiate around our hybrid cloud software value proposition where our integration software had a very strong quarter led by ICP and ICP for Data, which had strong adoption, and also our cognitive applications where we're growing both in our domains like security and even emerging areas like blockchain, but also in our industry verticals where we have continued momentum in Watson Health and in supply chain and weather. Weather, we hit an all-time high, great quarter and first quarter, all-time high on the number of active users. 
So when you take a look at this portfolio, we had a couple of quarters of solid execution. Yes, in emerging markets, we had some buying decision delays that will come back here in the second quarter, but we feel very confident in this portfolio. We feel very confident in the value proposition and differentiation, and we see pretty consistent performance moving forward here in the second quarter and throughout the year.",541

I mean if the transactional stuff comes through, can you really continue to see organic constant currency revenue growth?",74
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575138.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,12,"Yes. If you take a look at it, John, obviously, we don't give guidance on revenue, but let me give you some dynamics of how we're seeing the business both around the trajectory of coming out of first quarter, but also the operational indices we see right in front of us and our business plans and strategies that we're executing on moving forward.
First, around GBS. Our GBS business has a lot of momentum. We actually delivered signings growth again for our GBS business. Those -- we got great momentum around our consulting business, and it's driving the digital reinventions of our clients and our journey to cloud. And we see that business continuing that momentum in growth right in front of us here in the second quarter, but second half is going to be dependent, as you know, in a very short-term, fast-yielding type of backlog. We got to continue doing the signings in 2Q. That's going to fuel backlog. That's going to fuel revenue in the second half, but we feel good, and we feel consistent growth in GBS. 
In Cloud & Cognitive Software, as I just answered to Katy, we feel confident in that offering portfolio, and we also feel confident in continued growth here in the second quarter, pretty consistent performance. 
Around GTS, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I'll go back to what we talked about kind of at length 90 days ago, is we embarked on a very conscious strategy around exiting low-value, third-party OEM content. We said at that time it was going to depress revenue in the near term but have higher value and higher margins and better position our portfolio for the long term as we go through the acquisition closure of Red Hat and really trying to address the leadership position in a hybrid multi-cloud arena. So I would expect GTS at least in the near term to be pretty consistent with what you just saw in first quarter. 
And then you'd get to our Systems base of business. This business, as you all know quite well, always follows innovation cycles. We are on the back-end of our mainframe cycle. We got about 1 more quarter to go through on that. It's going to be GA plus 7, plus 8, if I'm counting right. It's been our most successful program in a long time, but we got another quarter's worth of headwind on that, but we've got strong growth and momentum in our Power following that innovation cycle. We rolled out our POWER9 architecture for the first quarter. We hit our high end. We had strong adoption. We continue to win in that space, leveraging our cloud design systems for AI and for the data-intensive workloads. 
And then storage. Storage was a weak performance in the first quarter, was entirely driven again by the high-end DS8000, which was attached to our mainframe, and we see that pretty consistent until we can bring new innovation to market. 
So if you look at first quarter where we were down about 90 basis points at constant currency, you take the divested content out of that, and we were roughly about flat. If you look at second quarter, I would see pretty consistent performance, again, recognizing we've got a big headwind on mainframe in the second quarter, we grew 112% last year as we move forward.",564

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575140.0,Question,James Schneider,,Analysts,14,"Maybe, Jim, I was wondering if you could comment on the overall performance in the services business. Signings were down year-over-year, but it seems like you're continuing to see very good growth in GBS and maybe a little bit more tempered performance in GTS. So can you maybe just kind of give us a sense about where clients' heads are at in terms of new services contracts overall? And maybe any kind of divergence you're seeing in bookings within GBS and GTS right now.",84

Thank you very much for the question. As you stated, yes, signings were down, down 14% if I remember correctly, about a $7.5 billion, $7.6 billion overall in signings. But let me take a step back and give you some of the dynamics underneath that because I think it's very, very important because why are signings an indicator that's of interest to all of our investors? Because it leads to backlog that then leads to backlog realization and revenue. And as I've said many quarters, all signings are not equal, and they vary. They vary with lumpiness mainly based on the size of signings. 
And when you look at our first quarter, our first quarter being down 14%, our greater-than-$100-million signings were down over 50%. Why? Because we just came off of a fourth quarter, if you remember, 90 days ago where we had one of our strongest quarters in greater-than-$100-million signings in years where we signed 19 deals greater than $100 million, and we actually had signings growth well north of 25%. 
Also, we had a very strong signings quarter particularly in greater-than-$100-million deals last first quarter where we signed 10 deals, and our greater-than-$100-million signings were up 130%. So we had a very tough compare as we both looked at last year and also just on what we executed with solid execution exiting the year. 
But now let's take a look at backlog. Backlog has many factors that influence it, signings only being one of it. The duration, the mix of those signings, erosion and client dissatisfaction issues and also new signings, new logo versus extensions. And when you take a look at our GBS business, to your point, we have strong momentum. We grew signings in the first quarter because while our greater-than-$100-million signings were down 50% plus, we actually grew less-than-$100-million signings, which is going to fuel that backlog and be better revenue realization in the near term as we move forward. 
So all in all, GBS is doing a very nice job. We restructured our offering portfolio. We're winning in the marketplace with this digital reinvention and our journey to cloud and you're seeing a much shorter duration backlog and a better backlog optimization because our quality of delivery, as we've transformed that, has led to a much lower level of erosion, which has led to higher realization of revenue. That's what's playing out in GBS. 
In GTS, that is a function as we're shifting our portfolio to really capture the hybrid multi-cloud opportunity, and that backlog in GTS is flat. It's flat while we transition now in our GTS outsourcing business, our cloud penetration is over 35%, and we're going to continue driving that differentiated value proposition in the near term. But as I said to the last question around revenue realization, we're continuing down the strategy of managing this business for margin, profit and cash, and we're going to use our balance sheet appropriately and effectively around third-party capital content.",499

So I heard everything you just said. You mentioned GTS in the near term should be pretty consistent with what we saw in Q1, but I'm curious if we want to reconcile your prioritization of margin versus growth, the portfolio cleanup, the deterioration in signings and maybe even some re-segmentation impact on revenue, when might we see an inflection point for GTS to remix back to growth? Because there's a lot going on there, just trying to make sure we can recast this properly.",113
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575144.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,18,"Okay, Tien-Tsin, thank you very much for the question. On GTS, I'll remind all of us, last quarter, we discussed the portfolio prioritization efforts that we were doing in GTS. Why? To continue to focus and shift this business to higher value for our clients in winning the marketplace. And over the last few quarters, we have been exiting low-value content in our GBS business that we said would have some near-term impact on revenue but will result in higher margins, and more importantly, a better business profile going forward over the long term. 
And if you look at first quarter, that's exactly what have played out. Our GTS revenue was down about 2 points from exiting that lower-value content, but, Tien-Tsin, to your question, our gross margins, where I truly believe in the services-based business where value is really instantiated, were up 110 basis points year-over-year as we continue to drive the value of that mix shift, our productivity initiatives and our cloud scale. 
But let me spend a moment as to why. Why are we doing this? This is part of a very conscious strategy to focus this business on margin, profit and cash. We've chosen our investment prioritization, and chapter 2 was all about leading in hybrid multi-cloud, high-value market with the acquisition of Red Hat and the combination of -- through the combination of cash and debt. You see we are very focused on maintaining a very strong balance sheet and around maintaining our strong investment-grade profile and paying down net debt and getting back to our targeted leverage ratios in a few years. We've committed that to our shareholders, and we are taking the actions, GTS being one action, about getting out of low-value, third-party content that ties up our balance sheet, that ties up our financial flexibility and brings little to no profit to it. 
The second is our IGF business where we made a decision to get out of our commercial OEM. That in addition to, as we stated, the intent to suspend share repurchase in 2020 and 2021. So we are serious about our investment prioritization to lead in chapter 2. We're serious about getting our balance sheet and continuing the strength of that to support our dividend growth policy and continue to invest in our business. And we're serious about driving the innovation and the investments to winning that space. 
And I'll just conclude, to your question, GTS has tremendous value to our integrated model of IBM. 90% of our most strategic accounts, we call them integrated accounts, take advantage of IBM's integrated value through outsourcing. More than 50% of the software used in outsourcing is IBM content, and that's growing. And 60% of our outsourcing engagements include the management of mainframe. So it's a very integral part. We are being selective in our investment prioritization because we've chosen where we want to win and how we're going to win going forward.",491

Yes, from -- let me put it in perspective. From a profit perspective around the announced divestitures, which most recently included the sale of our marketing and commerce remaining products to Centerbridge, that on an annualized basis is about $1.8 billion, right? 
From a profit perspective, we said very consistent in the last quarter that we are going to have a gain on the sale, we're going to have foregone profit and stranded costs, we were going to take actions to address that foregone profit -- or excuse me, the stranded costs and structure of our business overall. And when you take all of that together, there is going to be minimal impact on our full year. And let me bring this home to second quarter right now because as we stated, we expect to close majority, if not all of this, by the second quarter. And when we take each of the components, the gain on sale, we expect the gain on sale to somewhere be between $500 million and $700 million. And our guidance assumes, for right now, it's the low end of that range. 
We -- to your question, we are going to take actions to address the stranded costs and structure that's going to spend the majority, a vast majority of that gain. 
And then, Steve, as you know, the return on that restructuring and those actions will help us mitigate the foregone profit in the second half of the year because the second half of the year, we are going to have about a 2-point revenue headwind with that business gone, and we'll have a foregone profit that we're going to have to manage as we go forward. So both for the full year and in the second quarter, minimal to no impact to our profit overall.",312

I'm not going to comment on any further actions, but I'd just give you the high-level perspective. 
IBM is a high-value company, and how we remain high value is through portfolio optimization. We consistently look at our portfolio, and I think we've stated this many times before. We look at many different factors, from market attractiveness to our ability to win and differentiate to where client value and profit pools are shifting over time to the value of our integrated model and how all that plays together. And we will consistently do that to make sure that we're optimizing the right level of return for our investors and we can win in the marketplace and deliver the innovative value and technology to our clients to enable them to win and create competitive advantage, and that's what we're focused on overall, David.",154

I think the question is, could you, Jim, perhaps help us with the Cloud as a Service revenue? It seems as though the cloud revenue overall accelerated, but I'm not sure that translates to the as a Service side of things. I'm wondering if you could help shed some light on that. And then secondly, it seems as though you were indicating the backlog for GBS grew and GTS was flat, but it looks like the overall backlog is down, and I'm trying to square that circle.",93
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575153.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,27,"Sure, Jeff, no problem. Thanks for the question. So actually, both kind of clarification questions, so let me just try to address it real quick and directly. 
Our as a Service -- first of all, our cloud. Our cloud business accelerated in the quarter. First quarter, we grew 12% overall at constant currency. That comes off mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. 
If you look at our as a Service business within that, our as a Service business now has a annualized exit run rate of $11.7 billion, and that's up mid-teens. I think 15% if I remember correctly. And that is down quarter-to-quarter, but Jeff, I would tell you, that's due to normal seasonality. And also as we talked about in the fourth quarter, there were specific project milestones that we achieved in our AMS business that drove our AMS business to a 4% growth in the fourth quarter. We said that would normalize back down to about flat. So when you take a look at normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter and you take into account the catch-up of those project milestones as we continuously improve our service delivery quality, that was expected from our perspective. And we see that continued momentum building throughout the year as we move forward with the value of our offerings and proposition. 
And just a clarification question, on backlog. Backlog is down 2% at constant currency. I stated that GBS signings grew, and we have continued momentum. In the backlog overall, I did not make a comment about that, but I gave you some color around the dynamics of the backlog as our GBS business as we re-architected our offerings, and you see it play out in consulting. Our backlog is moving to a much shorter duration, higher, faster yielding content with greater quality, less erosion, and it's driving backlog realization and revenue momentum. Overall, I did not make a comment about GBS backlog overall.",325
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575154.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,28,Our last question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,11
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575155.0,Question,Keith Bachman,,Analysts,29,"Jim, I also wanted to ask about services and the growth rates and particularly, if I look at GBS, could you make some comments on the durability of that is the first part of my question. Application maintenance was flattish. Consulting was pretty good at 9%. Should investors be thinking about the 3% to 4% kind of growth for the year? And then the second part of my question relates to services. If you could revisit since you've had some time since the Red Hat deal was announced, what are your expectations about how the services business, both GBS and really GTS, how the Red Hat business may impact growth or improve growth once that's included into your portfolio? Because I think investors are frankly concerned that GTS may have a long runway of runoff here, but how are you thinking that Red Hat may impact both services business, but particularly the GTS side?",154
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2019",2019-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4362.0,1721612.0,67575156.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,30,"Sure. Thank you, Keith, for the question. GBS overall, as I stated, we have very good momentum in that business coming throughout the second half of 2018 and into first quarter where we grew 4%, led by consulting up 9%. And within that, great growth in Digital Strategy, iX -- excuse me, our cloud migration and implementation services, next-gen enterprise apps growing so very good momentum overall. And again, we're coming off another quarter of growing signings, especially in small deals. So when we look at right in front of us, we see pretty consistent performance. I think you said somewhere around the 3%-ish, plus or minus, we see that right in front of us. And if we continue as we stated, winning in the marketplace and driving those signings in the second half, that's going to fuel backlog, that's going to fuel revenue, yes, we feel pretty confident. As you know, Keith, we run multiple scenarios about our guidance, which by the way, is on earnings per share and free cash flow, but we feel pretty confident that we've got a strong hand here, a team that's executing on the field, and we're delivering real value to our clients, and that's why we're seeing the performance overall. 
The second question I think you asked, if I remember correctly, was around our services base of businesses and Red Hat. First and foremost, we're very excited about the potential combination of IBM and Red Hat as we've talked about I think in a handful of other areas around us accelerating the leadership in a $1 trillion hybrid cloud market. We believe this differentiates us as we move forward, and we couldn't be more excited when you look at Red Hat's performance exiting fiscal year '19 and what they reported and shared publicly, accelerating revenue up into the high teens, their backlog's up 22%, if I remember correctly; strong margin contribution; and they're delivering very strong cash flow. I think north of $1 billion in operating cash. But when you look at the services piece, we're expecting synergistic effects across our portfolio of IBM and us leading this next generation of hybrid cloud both in our software base of businesses but also services. 
And when you take a look at services overall, we had spent a lot of time, and I talked about this in the prepared remarks, about re-architecting our offerings to enable our clients on their journey to cloud, and that spans everything from advising to building to moving to managing the journey for all of our clients from an enterprise perspective of really taking the 80% of the next phase of the mission-critical workloads to provide competitive advantage for them. So we're going to have consulting base synergistic effects on strategy implementation. We're going to have cloud migration at development. There's a whole slew of offerings that our teams are now armed with, and we are ready to go once we close this acquisition overall. 
So thank you all for very good questions. Let me wrap it up and just make a couple of comments. 
We had a solid start to the year, as I said, and I firmly believe the fundamentals of our business model are playing out in terms of growth in key high-value areas like software and GBS while delivering strong operating leverage across our business. We will continue this in the second quarter with revenue dynamics from 1Q to 2Q similar to last couple of years, which is about a sequential dollar increase of $900 million to $1 billion. And as I said, we expect our second quarter to be about 22% of our full year EPS, and that is right in line with what our last 3 years have been. So from a seasonality, you should expect pretty similar to history. This keeps us right on track for our full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow, and we'll continue to take actions to plan for Red Hat acquisition and position this company for the longer term. 
So with that, I thank you for joining us today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year.",699

In the second quarter, we delivered $19.2 billion of revenue, $2.8 billion of operating net income and $3.17 of operating earnings per share, which was up 3%. We expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points, which is the largest increase in over 5 years, and operating net income margin by 60 basis points. And we had solid free cash flow performance with $12.7 billion of free cash flow over the last year. These results reflect improving fundamentals of our ongoing business. And now with this performance through the second quarter, we remain on track to deliver at least $13.90 of operating EPS and about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year. This excludes Red Hat and related activity, but we believe this remains a relevant perspective as it provides transparency into our underlying business performance and is on a base that's consistent with our previous guidance and first half performance. But to be clear, Red Hat is not included in any of the operating results we're discussing today, and we will update our full year expectations to include Red Hat during our investor webcast on August 2. 
Over the last few quarters, we've talked about strong performance in areas that help our clients with their digital transformations and journeys to cloud. This continued in the second quarter, as evidenced by strong revenue performance across the high-value segments of Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services. Our results also reflect significant actions we've taken to improve our position over time. 
For example, at the end of the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of select software assets that didn't leverage our integrated value proposition, and we took workforce actions to continue to revitalize our skill base and address stranded costs associated with the divested businesses. 
And as you have likely seen just 8 days ago, we completed the acquisition of Red Hat. This acquisition is an important milestone for IBM and one that will significantly impact the cloud landscape. It is clear that the next chapter of cloud will be about shifting mission-critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. This requires a hybrid multi-cloud open approach to provide portability, management consistency and security for these enterprise workloads. We've been building hybrid cloud capabilities across our business to address this opportunity and to prepare for this moment, bringing to market innovations like IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Private, the Cloud Migration Factory, cloud application innovation, IBM Garages, IBM Multicloud Manager and cloud optimized systems with tens of thousands of cloud architects. These innovations helped to drive IBM's $19.5 billion of cloud revenue over the last 12 months, which is up 8%, led by mid-teens growth in our as-a-service capabilities, all at constant currency. This is why leading enterprises across industries that range from banking to transportation to telecom are using IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities to improve the management and delivery of their data. 
You saw in yesterday's announcement, IBM will modernize and move AT&T's business solutions/applications to the IBM Cloud while collaborating on an edge computing platform for their enterprise clients. AT&T will also leverage Red Hat's open-source platform to manage workloads and applications in AT&T's network cloud.
And so now with the acquisition of Red Hat, we'll be combining the power and flexibility of Red Hat's open hybrid cloud technologies with the scale and depth of IBM's innovation and industry expertise. In short, IBM and Red Hat will be better together, accelerating our clients' journey to the cloud and lifting all of IBM as we grow Red Hat and sell more software and services. You'll see our cloud capabilities contributed to our broader segment results in the second quarter. As usual, I'll use constant currency growth rates throughout. 
Our Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue performance this quarter was strong, up 5% at constant currency. Our Cloud & Cognitive growth was broad-based across all 3 business lines, led by hybrid cloud offerings and security. 
Global Business Services grew about 3.5%, and here too we had good growth across all 3 lines of business as we help our clients on their digital journeys and to modernize and migrate applications to the cloud. 
In Global Technology Services, our profit dynamics continue to improve with gross margin up 120 basis points and modest pretax profit growth, excluding workforce action. The margin expansion reflects our focus on exiting lower-value content in driving productivity and cloud scale efficiencies. While GTS revenue declined due in part to this portfolio focus, we had good growth in the services that help our clients implement and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. 
As expected, our Systems revenue was down, reflecting the product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and the related high-end Storage while Power continue to grow. When we bring all this together, our revenue was $19.2 billion, which was down about 1.5%, and that includes a 40 basis point impact from the divested businesses, which had been declining. 
As you look at our key financial metrics, you can see the improved fundamentals of our business with revenue growth in the higher-value segments, gross and net margin expansion and solid free cash flow generation. Our operating gross margin was up 100 basis points driven by a combination of our strong software revenue growth, services productivity and cloud scale efficiencies. And our operating expense was flat year-to-year. We continue to drive efficiency and productivity in our spending so our base expense was up this quarter as we invested ahead of Red Hat and in development ahead of our next generation IBM Z later this year.
And so now looking at our pretax income, the year-to-year performance is driven by the operational declines in our now divested businesses. Excluding these impacts, we delivered solid pretax operating leverage, reflecting our gross margin expansion, partially offset by the investments I just mentioned. 
Our operating tax rate in the quarter was 11%, including discrete items. This is right in line with the full year all-in tax rate of 11% to 12% we talked about in January. Pulling it all together, our operating earnings per share was up 3%, and that includes a $0.15 year-to-year impact from the operational declines of our now divested businesses. 
Looking at our cash metrics. The $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter is up $500 million over last year. As I've said, we generated $12.7 billion over the last 12 months. So good, solid cash generation. 
Now let me come back to expense to talk about a couple of items. First, currency helped our year-to-year expense dynamics due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. In fact, $120 million of the year-over-year change in other income and expense was due to hedging benefits. As always, these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout our P&L. 
Second, within expense, as expected, we also had gains and charges that together were effectively neutral to the bottom line. I just mentioned the operational impact of our divested businesses in the quarter. Let me comment on the transactional impact. 
We closed the 2 software divestitures at the end of the second quarter, resulting in about $575 million of onetime gains in other income. This is within the range of $500 million to $700 million we provided back in April. 
Within SG&A, also as expected, we took actions to revitalize skills and address structure and stranded costs associated with these divestitures, resulting in a workforce-related charge of about $500 million. We also took a charge for an unfavorable legal ruling received in late June on a case that has been under dispute for nearly a decade. And so together, these gains and charges were essentially neutral to our total expense and to our profit growth in the period. So as I have said in the past, the divestitures will improve our revenue and profit profile on a go-forward basis. 
Turning to our segments. Cloud & Cognitive Software delivered strong revenue performance this quarter, up 5%. We had growth across all 3 areas with cloud and data platforms up 7%; Cognitive Applications up 5%; and transaction processing platforms up 4%. Our software offerings help our clients securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on premises and on private and public clouds. 
In cloud and data platforms, we had broad-based growth led by several newer offerings throughout the portfolio that help clients modernize their applications for hybrid cloud environments and their data for AI. We continue to see good hybrid cloud growth this quarter as clients leverage our reliable and scalable IBM Cloud Private solution, built on open-source frameworks like Containers and Kubernetes. SK Group in South Korea turned to IBM Cloud Private to quickly and easily package applications as containers and re-factor them with IBM micro services across their businesses. Their new SK Telecom portal used by customers to buy mobile services is now running on the IBM Cloud Private platform. And our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering, which collects, organizes and analyzes data for AI, also delivered strong growth this quarter. We launched this solution just a year ago, and we've had strong client adoption, in fact, growing our installed base nearly 40% since first quarter. 
Cognitive Applications' revenue growth was led by strong performance in our integrated security software and services portfolio and growth across many of our industry vertical solutions. 
Let me spend a minute on security. We continue to see strong performance in our threat management software and services offerings, including QRadar and Resilient, as well as in managed security intelligence solutions like X-Force threat management. And as clients look to safeguard critical data in data warehouses and big data environments, we had good traction in our Guardium data security solutions. 
With 95% of the top global companies leveraging IBM Security solutions, we are well positioned as an industry leader. 
Turning to transaction processing platforms. Growth was driven by strong performance in IBM Z middleware as clients continue to predictably manage IT spending for their growing IBM Z mission-critical workloads.
And then moving to profit for this segment, pretax margin was up 2 points year-to-year, and that's excluding the impact from the workforce actions this quarter. Margins reflect strong transactional performance in high-value areas, offset by ongoing investment in key strategic areas, including the preparation for the Red Hat closing. 
Moving to Global Business Services. Revenue was up 3%. We again had good growth as enterprise continue their digital reinvention journeys to become cloud and cognitive enterprises. GBS is at the epicenter of IBM, bringing both business and technology transformation solutions to clients. They bring together deep industry expertise, IBM's innovative technology portfolio and third-party information technology architectures to deliver differentiated value to enterprises.
We see evidence in this in all 3 areas of GBS as consulting revenue grew 5%, application management grew 2% and Global Process Services grew 3%.
In consulting, growth was led by sustained performance in our next-gen enterprise apps like S/4HANA and in Digital Strategy and iX offerings. 
At Wimbledon, our Digital Strategy and iX team delivered a differentiated and personalized digital experience to on-site media, players and fans around the world, leveraging AI and running on the IBM Cloud supported by GTS. 
Clients are also leveraging the IBM Garage to help them power their digital reinventions with hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence while going from idea generation to enterprise scale adoption. ADP used IBM Garage method to infuse AI across the enterprise. ADP and IBM jointly developed an AI-powered digital agent that handles over 20% of ADP's chat traffic, which helped drive Net Promoter Scores to all-time highs. 
Today, ADP continues to work with GBS to help create its digital onboarding process, streamlining and enhancing their new clients' first impressions. In the past 18 months, IBM has helped more than 500 leading global companies use the IBM Garage to drive digital transformations with data and AI on the cloud. GBS is becoming the provider of choice for clients across the various phases of their journey to cloud, whether it's advising, moving, building or managing their applications and processes. 
For example, GBS is working with another leading telco provider to advise on their digital transformation journey to the cloud. As part of this, IBM will develop and manage a center of excellence that will power an enterprise-wide Red Hat Ansible implementation for hybrid and multi-cloud platforms. This will enable them to transform their product and technology organization, support an agile DevOps culture for its developer teams while moving its application portfolio to the cloud to reduce complexity and accelerate delivery and time to value. And at Fortum, a Finnish energy company, we're leveraging our Cloud Migration Factory to advise the company on its cloud strategy as well as helping them migrate and manage its applications to the cloud. Cloud Migration Factory is one of the areas contributing to our growth in application management revenue this quarter. 
Turning to profit. GBS gross margin was essentially flat with contribution from continued mix shift to higher-value offerings and from currency given our global delivery mix. This was offset by a higher level of skill capacity investments to capture demand around Red Hat and digital reinvention. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 4% with infrastructure and cloud services down 4% and technology support services down 2% while gross margin for this segment expanded 120 basis points. As we said over the last few quarters, we are managing this business for increased margin, profit and cash contribution to better position it for the long term. 
As part of that, we have been taking actions to de-emphasize lower-value contracts and third-party content and focus our investments on the higher-value segments of the IT market such as hybrid cloud. This contributes to lower GTS revenue in the short term but will enable us to deliver sustained margin improvement. 
You saw this play out again in the second quarter with our gross margin expansion driven by scale efficiencies in our cloud, productivity improvement as we infuse AI and automation into our service delivery models and the shift of our business to higher-value areas. This quarter, GTS delivered just under $0.5 billion of pretax profit and modest PTI growth, both adjusted for the workforce-related charge. We are going to leverage this improved profit position to continue to invest in our go-to-market and delivery capabilities to capture this high-value and growing market. 
Enterprises continue to turn to IBM to navigate and manage the increased complexities of a hybrid multi-cloud world. IBM Services is in a unique position to help our clients in Chapter 2 as we have been running these workloads and we know their processes as well as their IT and regulatory environments. 
As I mentioned earlier, at the end of June, we signed an agreement with AT&T, which spans both of our services businesses. In this multiyear strategic agreement, IBM will modernize and migrate AT&T business solutions/applications to the IBM Cloud and will help manage the entire IT infrastructure, on and off premises and across different clouds, private and public. By leveraging a hybrid multi-cloud approach, enterprises can not only reduce costs and complexity, they can modernize, build, deploy and run core business applications in a faster and more secure way. This approach will enable AT&T business to build and deploy any app or workload anywhere and deliver new innovative services to its business customers. This is a great example of how we're helping clients accelerate their journey to hybrid cloud. 
And now turning to Systems. Revenue was down 18% this quarter. We again had growth in Power. This was more than offset by declines in IBM Z and Storage, reflecting the late stage of our z14 product cycle. In the second quarter, IBM Z revenue declined 41%. I'll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the second quarter last year where we grew 112%. We announced the z14 program 2 years ago now, and our revenue has tracked ahead of the prior program throughout that period. We continue to see clients take advantage of the value of z14 such as pervasive encryption and connecting to the cloud. And so from a Malaysian bank securing and improving performance on core banking workloads to a European tax office implementing a private cloud solution on Linux to manage new applications, clients appreciate the z14 innovation. 
In today's environment, there's a lot of demand for technology underpinned by data protection and resiliency with the ability to integrate across cloud environments, and we will continue to innovate in these areas, which are core to the IBM Z value proposition. 
Power revenue was up 3%, again led by POWER9. We had continued growth in high-end offerings and in Linux with HANA on Power, leveraging our performance of POWER9. This is the same architecture used with Summit and Sierra, which are among the world's largest scientific and AI computing systems. As a reminder, we started the delivery of these supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the second quarter of last year and essentially completed the deployment through the second half of 2018. 
This quarter, we also announced that IBM Power Systems virtual servers are now available in the IBM Cloud, providing clients with hybrid cloud scale of compute for AIX and IBM i workloads. Our enterprise clients are increasingly looking to adopt hybrid cloud strategies, backed by their performance, resiliency and security capabilities of IBM POWER9 to help optimize everything from supply chains to sales. 
In Storage, revenue was down 21%, reflecting declines in our high end, which is tied to our mainframe cycle and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures in the midrange. 
Looking at Systems profit. Gross profit margin expanded across the portfolio while pretax margin was down, reflecting where we are in the Z product cycle. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We've now generated $12.7 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months. Our normalized free cash flow realization over that period remains high at 118%. In the second quarter, we generated $2.8 billion of net cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and $2.4 billion of free cash flow. That brings our free cash flow for the first half to $4.1 billion, which is up about $900 million year-to-year. These results reflect our operational performance and effective capital management. Our strategy to de-emphasize lower-value content across our services and financing portfolios continue to play out in cash and contributed to our CapEx spending decline for the half. 
Capital expenditures also reflect the benefit from a real estate sale of about $270 million, although there was effectively no P&L benefit. I'll remind you that the proceeds from the divestitures are considered an investing activity so are not included in our free cash flow. 
Looking at uses of cash. So far this year, we returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. $2.8 billion of that was dividends. And in April, we again raised our dividend. That's now the 24th consecutive year we've taken our dividend up. Through the first half, we spent $1.2 billion on gross share repurchases, buying back more than 9 million shares. With the closing of the Red Hat transaction, we suspended our share repurchase program on July 9. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $46 billion in cash. Approximately $34 billion of that was used to close the Red Hat transaction earlier this month. Our total debt was $73 billion, including incremental debt raised to fund the Red Hat acquisition. About 1/3 of our total debt is in support of our financing business, which continues to be levered at a ratio of 9:1. Our global financing debt is down over $6 billion from December, reflecting the portfolio decisions we made regarding the financing of third-party content. These decisions also led to further improvement in the credit quality of our financing portfolio, which is now 57% investment grade, 3 points better than a year ago. 
So to sum this up, we continue to generate strong free cash flow and together with the portfolio actions we've taken and the suspension of share repurchases positions us to return to our targeted leverage ratios within a couple of years. In the meantime, our balance sheet is strong with the flexibility to support our business. 
So I'll make a few summary comments in the quarter before we move on to Q&A. 
In the second quarter, our performance reflects the value we provide in helping our clients with their digital transformations and journey to cloud. We see this across our business in our hybrid cloud offerings and services, our data and AI capabilities and in areas like security. We had significant gross margin expansion and solid free cash flow, a reflection of the improving fundamentals of our business. And we continued our focus on investment prioritization and portfolio optimization, closing the pending software divestitures, de-emphasizing lower-value content in GTS and continuing to wind down our OEM commercial financing portfolio. All of these improve our profit profile going forward. And of course, just 8 days ago, we completed the acquisition of Red Hat, a landmark acquisition that has important implications to the cloud landscape and to IBM. 
Now let me make a few things very clear before we go into Q&A. This quarter, we're in a unique position due to the timing of the Red Hat acquisition. And so today, I won't address any questions on forward-looking guidance. As mentioned, we will be updating our full year 2019 expectations on August 2, which will include the impact of Red Hat. As you would expect, with a highly profitable software business, the noncash purchase accounting adjustments result in the acquisition being dilutive to full year 2019 earnings per share. We have said this and also that we continue to expect Red Hat to be accretive to operating earnings per share by the end of the second year and accretive to free cash flow in the first full year. 
And so now, I'm happy to take your questions about our second quarter performance and the trends we are seeing in our underlying business, excluding Red Hat.",3704

And when I look at the trajectory of services, I think GBS was up 4% in the first half, GTS was down 3%. How do you see the services business transpire as we go forward through 2019? And importantly maybe help me understand what's changed in your perspective when it comes to services versus 90 days ago.",87

Thanks, Amit, and it's a very nice to hear from you again and welcome back. 
Let's talk about services, and allow me to break it into 2 because you're asking both the GTS side of the business and the GBS side of the business because they have 2 fundamentals that are happening against each other. 
On one, we've been talking about -- let's talk about GTS first. We've been talking about the portfolio prioritization work that we've been doing about exiting lower-value content which we've said all along would impact revenue in the near term but results in higher margins and a better business profile going forward. And I think you're seeing that play out in our first half performance. Revenue in the second quarter, pretty consistent with the first quarter overall, but our margins, our operating leverage, we are seeing substantial leverage in that business as we move forward because we said we were going to shift that business to higher-value margin, profit and cash. And we were up 120 basis points, really led by that mix shift to getting away from lower-value content, de-emphasizing that, but also with our productivity initiatives, which are executing well and delivering very good return on investment. 
Now with regards to GTS, what do we learn about the first half performance? And how does that impact the trajectory going into second half with regards to what did we learn? What I would tell you right now based on where our backlog dynamics are and in particular, our backlog runout, we see an inflection point as we enter the second half in GTS. We're coming off a first half down 3.5%. Most of that being driven by conscious strategy as I talked about. But now we're going to wrap on that strategy as we enter the later half of the second -- second half of '19, and we're also beginning to ramp on a very strong large deals signings at the end of 4Q '18 as we move forward. So we feel very good about our book of business in GTS. We got through this conscious strategy. It's given us tremendous margin leverage, tremendous free cash flow leverage, and we returned that business back to profitability in the first half, and we see both margin improvement and sustainability. And we see that inflection point with an improvement in sequential year-to-year performance. 
On GBS, the team has done a great job. We have repositioned the portfolio, redesigned our service lines. We are driving growth across all 3 platforms, digital, cloud, cognitive, as we enable our clients to really drive their digital reinvention journeys to the cloud and journeys to the cognitive enterprise. 
As we look at the end of the first half and we look at our backlog runout, our backlog runout says we're going to have consistent growth as we move into the third quarter. We're coming off of a pretty good signings quarter with GBS and a very strong continuation in small and mid-sized deals that are fueling our revenue in period. So we feel pretty good about sustainability of that growth coming off the first half in GBS. And we see that marked inflection on a sequential year-to-year improvement in GTS as we exit the second -- enter the second half.",550

Yes, we're obviously very pleased with our Cloud & Cognitive Software business here in the second quarter. And most importantly, as you all know quite well, we'll spend a lot more time on August 2 talking about IBM plus Red Hat and how we're better together and how it's going to change the cloud landscape in this $1 trillion hybrid cloud market. Red Hat will be part of this segment overall in Cloud & Cognitive Software. 
But if you look at the second quarter, I think there's a perfect instantiation of where client demand is going. And when you've got differentiated value propositions and strong portfolio and offerings and a lineup and you execute well, you start seeing the leverage in the acceleration. And that's what we got out of the quarter. We're helping our clients as they move their hybrid cloud applications to the cloud and also on data and AI. So cloud and data platform, strong growth, up 7%. Strong adoption in our ICP, IBM Cloud Private, up 50% quarter-over-quarter in adoption rates. But we're also seeing very good growth in our integration offerings and our hybrid cloud data platforms that are driving both our data, our analytics and our AI capability going forward. 
But also across the other platform, Cognitive Applications, we saw good growth of 5% driven by a very good quarter in our integrated security software and services business as we launched new offerings around identity management, around threat management. And we've got a very differentiated value proposition, and we're executing well, but we also had very good growth across some industry verticals, led by supply chain, in IoT, offerings around Maximo, which we've got very strong incumbency with our clients in delivering value, and also in Weather. Weather has consistently driven good growth for us. 
And I would tell you, this quarter, the Weather app in India became the #1 downloaded app for the first time ever in India, and that couples with already being #1 downloaded app in the United States here. So we're seeing good growth across many of our verticals and across our cloud and data platform, and this really establishes the foundation, and we couldn't be more excited with Red Hat coming onboard July 8.",381

That business includes tech support services, which historically have had extremely high margins. And if you back that out, it's pointing to infrastructure and cloud services margins that are probably pretty close to 0. Your peers like DXC who have double-digit margins in that business, peers like Accenture who have double-digit margins in that business. So one, can you address why the margin gap is so significant? And two, I heard your earlier comments about an inflection point, but I struggle a little bit given that signings are down 17% in the first half. Your backlog is down 4%, which I think is the worst in the last 20 years year-over-year. And so if I look at leading indicators, they actually don't look really good from a revenue perspective. 
Going forward, I realize your comps get a lot easier, but is -- are you really seeing an inflection? And what's the disconnect between the backlog and signings data that we're seeing and your optimism? And how do margins improve when the business is descaling?",192
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3398.0,1827829.0,71472774.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Okay, Toni, thank you for your questions. Multiple part, a lot packed in there, but let me just try to hit some of these head on. 
First of all, when you look at our GTS segment, it fits into the overarching integrated value of the IBM portfolio. There's components within our TSS segment that play to our Systems platforms in our business and drive tremendous integrated value. And our infrastructure services segment obviously plays a tremendous value to IBM's integrated model with their deep client relationships where we leverage the value of incumbency and we actually drive as channel high-value software and hardware into those businesses. So I'm not going to talk about the individual profitability of those 2 pieces because we manage this as an integrated play across IBM. 
But what I will talk about, and I did see your report, is that I view this as we have tremendous headroom to grow our margins, which is what we are maniacally focused on in this business about selling high value, which is part of our conscious strategy of exiting and de-emphasizing our low-value third-party OEM. And by the way, in the first half, you see how that has played out in our results. Our margins are up very strong 120 basis points, and our pretax margins ex the charges, so you can look at it on a sustainable basis going forward, are up in the second quarter, and they're up through the first half. And I didn't even talk about the level of cash contribution that this business now is spewing off. So we are very pleased with the business model, the trajectory and the value of what GTS brings to us. And I would agree with you completely that we got headroom, and that's what the team's focused on driving moving forward. 
Now with regards to your services signings and backlog. We've been talking about, at least for multiple quarters, about the changing dynamics of signings and backlog in this environment. Part of that is the changing client demand and buying behaviors. Part of that is a shift to as-a-service in cloud. But as you stated, our signings were down in the quarter. Our backlog -- absolute backlog is down. But I will remind everyone, it's $111 billion overall. That backlog is down mainly driven by large deals, to your point. 
Now when you look at large deals, our large deals in the quarter were down by 20%. But over the trailing 12 months, our large deals are actually flat, up in GTS as we sell that integrated outsourcing value and actually down in GBS as the application management service is moving much quicker to the cloud, which is why we've been re-architecting our offerings around application management, modernization, migration services. 
But as I said before, and I'm giving increased transparency and disclosure for our investors, signings are not all equal. Signings vary, and they vary based on how they influence backlog, duration, erosion, mix of signings, new logo. And for increased disclosure, when we look at our backlog runout, which is right in front of us right now, that gives us confidence to talk about the inflection point in GTS as we wrap on this de-emphasis on lower-value content and we start ramping up our large deals from fourth quarter, which will start in the second half, so we see that inflection on a sequential year-to-year. And around GBS, we see continued momentum as we move forward.",580

I know there's a number of factors helping you on that front. But if you isolate the cloud business, is it fair to say that you have escape velocity, meaning cloud margins are improving sequentially with scale every quarter? Or should we think about cloud still having some lumpiness and seasonality around margins?",64

Yes, very good question overall. Last year, we talked about, in the beginning of '18, how we were investing significantly in building out our cloud architecture. In fact, our capital spend last year was up 70% as we built out 6 new MZRs around the world, which today, our cloud architecture is very competitive, and it covers 95-plus percent of the demand from a cloud market overall. 
But as we talked about throughout 2018 and now definitely into the first half of 2019, we are seeing continued scale efficiencies around our cloud as we generate more and more scale, as we're starting to drive the utilization around our cloud pods around the world and as we're obviously leveraging the differentiated value proposition and growing our cloud business, which is now $19.5 billion over a trailing 12 months. So we feel pretty good. 
And you see that play out in our GTS segment, which has consistently been accelerating their year-over-year margins, up 110 basis points in the first quarter and up 120 basis points in the second quarter. And as you all know, that's well in excess of their model, but my answer to last question, we believe we've got a lot of headroom.",206

I appreciate the question because obviously given the seasonality of our business, as you all know, the transactional component is a very important part of our second quarter and also fourth quarter overall. 
But let me put it in perspective. 90 days ago, we sat here and we talked about coming off the first quarter that we were going to grow sequentially $900 million to $1 billion of revenue, and that was going to be driven off of the back of our transactional-related business. We actually delivered at the high end of that coming in at roughly the $19.2 billion overall. But the underpinnings are a little different. 
To the earlier question, we had very strong growth in our Cloud & Cognitive Software segment that was pervasive across each of our platforms, and that was mainly driven by leveraging our differentiated value proposition and the strength of our offering portfolio and accelerating that through the transactional component. So I would tell you from 90 days ago, we actually executed better in the software space. 
Now on the flip side, our hardware base of business, which carries tremendous value from a platform perspective. As you all know, we are in the back end of our mainframe cycle. We're 8 quarters in. So arguably one of the most successful mainframe programs that we've had to date, and that's driven by the differentiated value proposition and our ability to continue building out an enduring platform. 90 days ago compared to where we ended up today, we fell a little short on our Systems hardware and where we're at. 
Now as you heard in the prepared remarks, we have invested. You've seen in our development expense overall in the first half, which has been up, we had been investing and driving the teams very hard because as we all know, the Systems segment follows innovation cycles. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we are going to come out with new innovation on our high-end mainframe and our high-end storage later in 2019.",342

There are a lot of macro issues around trade, Brexit, China. Just wondering what you're seeing through a broader macro lens. And more specifically, some of the workforce rebalancing was targeted towards Cloud & Cognitive. Obviously, you've demonstrated some really strong growth over there in the quarter.

Thank you. Obviously, all of us, we operate in 170 countries around the world. We are constantly monitoring information around market dynamics and in particular around client buying behaviors, which I think is at the core of your question. 
Now we would tell you, the IT industry is still growing in excess of GDP, and in particular, as you see play out in our results around key high-value areas, data and AI, cloud, security digital, where there's tremendous value proposition to allow our clients to differentiate their competitive positioning as they move along their digital reinvention journeys to the cloud and journey to cognitive enterprise. And we see that continuing to play out. 
Now with that said, the IT industry has always been predicated, in my mind, on effective balance between leveraging technology for growth and leveraging technology for productivity. And at certain times, things change, that balance changes. And I would tell you, today, what we're seeing on client buying behaviors is a slight shift more and more to productivity, to quick payback, ROI. And more importantly, as a CFO, I could tell you directly, in uncertain times, you want predictability. And our value equations really played to that, especially in our software part of our portfolio and our services. 
But I would tell you, when you look across the world, we had pretty good growth around both major markets and around components of emerging markets. U.K., Canada, Japan, Spain grew very nicely and consistently. And from an industry perspective, we're seeing pretty good pervasive growth still in insurance, in financial markets, in health care, life sciences, education, on travel, transportation, so we see pretty good perspective overall.",287

I think in your prepared remarks you've mentioned a couple of items. One was the gain on sale of the software assets. The other was the real estate gain. Are there any other known headwinds or tailwinds that we should keep in mind that may impact the comparison next year, excluding obviously any impact from Red Hat?",72

Thank you, David. I appreciate the question because free cash flow is obviously front and center right now with all of us around continuing to shift this business model to higher value. We're very excited about the Red Hat acquisition. We do think it's a game changer where we're going with regards to helping our clients in Chapter 2, and we're also prudently driving the financial discipline and manage it -- management in this company around delevering the company and around getting back to our targeted leverage ratios within a couple of years. 
But if you take a look at free cash flow, first of all, we're very pleased in the first half. We delivered over $4 billion of free cash flow in the first half. That's up $900 million driven by continued working capital efficiency, offset by operating profit here in the first half, but we got very good, sound capital management. And we talked about a couple of those components in the prepared remarks as you called out. 
Now with the Red Hat acquisition, we're going to talk much more about this on August 2, and put it in perspective of why we're better between IBM and Red Hat together and share with our investors our business profile, our synergies, our capabilities, our financial model and the investment thesis going forward. So we look forward to talking to all of you in about 10 days from now, plus or minus, as we move forward. And we'll give some discussion about guidance on free cash flow as we move forward. 
So with that said, I just want to make a few comments to wrap up the call. Our performance this quarter, I think, is a great basis from which to move forward in the future. We set the foundation, and now one that includes Red Hat effective July 8. 
On August 2, as I just said in the last question, we're going to host our investor webcast. We'll talk about how IBM is addressing what we call Chapter 2 of our clients' digital reinventions. We'll have several of our senior leaders lay out our strategy and show how IBM plus Red Hat is ideally positioned to address the opportunity ahead of us. And then I'll wrap up with our financial view of IBM and also not only talk about 2019 but more importantly give a perspective about where this business is going in the medium term as we move forward. 
So as always, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue in early August.",433

In the third quarter, we delivered $18 billion of revenue, $2.4 billion of operating net income and $2.68 of operating earnings per share. We continued our strong cash generation with $12.3 billion of free cash flow over the last year, which is 126% normalized free cash flow realization; and we reduced our debt balance by nearly $7 billion since the end of June, maintaining a strong balance sheet.
 
This quarter, we continue to see good performance in the key high-value areas of data and AI, security, cloud and digital. We continue to bring new innovations to the market, launching our z15 mainframe and containerizing our software. And of course, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat where we've had a good first quarter, with Red Hat revenue growth accelerating to 20% on a normalized basis.
 
Let me give you a little more color by segment. Cloud & Cognitive Software was up 8% this quarter led by growth in cognitive applications and cloud and data platforms, including the contribution from Red Hat.
 
In Global Business Services, revenue was up over 2%, and we expanded gross margin. Once again, we had solid performance in consulting driven by next-generation application offerings and in application modernization for the cloud.
 
In Global Technology Services, revenue was down 4%. We continue to have good growth in the services that help our clients to move and manage cloud workloads, and our cloud revenue in the segment was up 10%. But our GTS performance fell short of our expectations due to lower in-period revenue from client business volumes in certain markets. While the volume impact has near-term revenue and profit implications, we had good long-term signings and a solid pipeline of deals that deliver productivity to clients in this environment.
 
Our Systems revenue was down 14% primarily reflecting the back end of our z14 mainframe product cycle. We continue to invest to bring new innovation to our platforms, and we announced our next-generation of IBM Z, which started to ship the last week of the quarter. Our new z15 has a strong value proposition, and we had a solid start to the cycle in line with our expectations. And so IBM's performance continues to be led by areas that help our clients with their digital transformations and journeys to cloud.
 
Across our segments, our cloud revenue growth accelerated to 14%, and IBM's cloud revenue over the last year is now over $20 billion. We're entering the next chapter of cloud, which will be driven by mission-critical workloads. Enterprise clients will need to securely deploy, run and manage these workloads across on-prem, private and public cloud environments. These hybrid multi-cloud environments will be based on a foundation of Linux with containers and Kubernetes.
 
Red Hat is at the center of this with the #1 Linux operating system, RHEL, and the leading hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift. When we bring these together with IBM's enterprise incumbency, scale and expertise, we're ideally positioned to lead in the significant hybrid cloud opportunity. We've invested to bring new innovations to market, leveraging the technology architecture of Linux, containers and Kubernetes. We have standardized on Red Hat OpenShift as our hybrid cloud platform, and we've modernized our software portfolio so that it can run on all private and public clouds. We've announced OpenShift on IBM Cloud and on IBM Z, and we've introduced consulting and technology services for Red Hat to capitalize on our expertise in digital reinventions and our leadership position in managing mission-critical workloads.
 
And now at the end of the third quarter, we're off to a great start. As I said, Red Hat revenue in the quarter was up 20%. That's normalized to provide a better comparability to Red Hat's historical performance. But remember, IBM's reported results also include the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment, which, by the way, was within $30 million of the third quarter estimates we provided in early August.
 
The 20% growth is an acceleration from Red Hat's performance before we announced the transaction. This quarter, Red Hat's infrastructure business, which is predominantly RHEL, had double-digit growth and continued to take share. This is a great proof point of the continued importance of Linux as the foundation for enterprise workloads in a hybrid cloud environment. And momentum continued in application development and emerging technologies driven by both OpenShift and Ansible. We're adding new OpenShift clients and expanding Red Hat adoption in existing clients.
 
For example, in the third quarter, IBM helped Red Hat expand its footprint at Visa in support of the client strategy of accelerating technology platform innovation using open source solutions. And Spanish retailer, El Corte Ingles, selected Red Hat OpenShift as the foundational technology together with IBM's migration and implementation services for its hybrid cloud strategy.
 
The expansion of the client base and the revenue trajectory are good indications of our clients' confidence in the value of Red Hat and IBM together. And in terms of confidence of the workforce, over the last several months, Red Hat hired about 1,000 new associates to address the growing demand for the Red Hat portfolio and hybrid cloud value proposition, while employee attrition has been stable year to year.
 
So let me turn to IBM's key financial metrics, which of course include Red Hat. As we discussed in the past, IBM's revenue, profit and operating earnings per share reflect the impact of the noncash deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment, along with other transaction-related activity. Our operating gross margin was flat, though up 30 basis points when you exclude the impact from the divested businesses. You'll recall, we took a workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter to address the foregone profit of these businesses and some stranded costs. We'll start to see more of the savings in the fourth quarter.
 
Our pretax income also reflects growth in expense. This operating expense increase was driven by the addition of Red Hat, both operational spending and transaction-related costs for equity, retention and higher interest expense. At the same time, our base spending reflects investments to bring our Software and Systems innovations to the market, and we had a lower level of IP income.
 
Our operating tax rate in the quarter was a few points less than we estimated in early August due to the timing of discrete tax items. We continue to expect a full year all-in operating tax rate of 9% to 10%, which includes Red Hat and an estimate of discrete tax items for the year. And so the year-to-year decline in operating net income and operating earnings per share was driven predominantly by the noncash purchase accounting adjustments.
 
But more importantly, our cash metrics are not affected by these adjustments. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and nearly $6 billion year-to-date. Because our cash generation is so heavily skewed to the fourth quarter, as always, the trailing 12 months is the best way to look at our free cash flow performance. On that basis, we generated $12.3 billion, which results in 126% normalized free cash flow realization. Our strong cash generation and focus on capital allocation resulted in a stronger balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of about $11 billion and significantly lower debt levels versus 90 days ago.
 
So let me comment on how we've improved our debt profile this quarter. As you know, we took out additional debt to fund the Red Hat transaction, and at the end of June, we had $73 billion in debt. This includes what I'll call core debt of $48 billion and $25 billion for our financing business, which is fully supported by our financing receivables.
 
Looking at our global financing debt, we're winding down our OEM commercial financing operations by the end of this year. This reduces our financing debt and improves the overall credit quality of our receivables. To accelerate reduction of our core debt, we suspended our share repurchase program. We did this in early July when we closed the Red Hat transaction. The result of these actions is a reduction in IBM's total debt from $73 billion to $66 billion during the quarter. That's nearly $7 billion. And so I'd say our deleveraging plan is on track. As we look forward, our debt repayment profile provides good opportunity to continue to deleverage. And as we said, we're committed to achieving a leverage ratio consistent with a mid- to high A rating within a couple years.
 
So now I'll get into the segment results starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software, which was up 8% this quarter. We had strong growth in both cloud and data platforms now inclusive of Red Hat and cognitive applications, while transaction processing platforms revenue was down. Cloud revenue in the segment was up over 60% this quarter, reflecting the investments and steps we've taken to capture the hybrid cloud opportunity.
 
In cloud and data platforms, we delivered double-digit growth as we execute on the combined IBM and Red Hat hybrid cloud strategy. I mentioned earlier the importance of Linux, containers and Kubernetes as the platform for hybrid cloud standardizing on Red Hat OpenShift. We've containerized our software and introduced Cloud Paks containerized software solutions that incorporate OpenShift and RHEL. We're rearchitecting and optimizing our offerings, including integrating technologies from IBM Cloud Private into our Cloud Paks and into OpenShift. And now just about 90 days following the closing of the acquisition, Red Hat demonstrated strong and broad-based revenue growth this quarter. And although early, we're seeing green shoots in our newly launched Cloud Paks. We're working with over 1,800 clients with access to our container solutions, including OpenShift and Cloud Paks.
 
For example, CVS Health has selected multiple Cloud Pak offerings, including the Cloud Pak for Integration in support of their hybrid cloud initiatives for agile data services and improved consumer experiences. These offerings will combine the power of IBM Software with OpenShift and RHEL. Cognitive applications revenue growth of 6% was led by security software in services and industry verticals like IoT.
 
In security, we were just recognized again by Gartner as the #1 enterprise security vendor. We continue to see strong performance in our threat management software and services offerings like QRadar and X-Force Threat Management. We recently announced a project working with the city of Los Angeles and the LA Cyber Lab to provide threat intelligence to local businesses to proactively fight cybercrime leveraging X-Force incident response and intelligent services. And as clients are increasingly looking to migrate secure operations to the cloud, we're seeing traction with the combination of QRadar on the cloud and X-Force Threat Management for managed threat monitoring services on the cloud.
 
In IoT, we had traction across the portfolio, including in our Maximo and TRIRIGA offerings. We continue to invest in new offerings, and our industry-specific solutions like Maximo for Transportation, Maximo for Oil and Gas, and Maximo for Aviation have been resonating with clients. And then in our transaction processing platforms, which include software that runs mission-critical workloads on our hardware platforms, revenue declined this quarter. While much of this revenue is annuity based, in any quarter, the performance reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client buying cycles. Looking at the profit for the segment, the decline in pretax margin was primarily driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition.
 
Moving to Global Business Services, revenue was up over 2%, and gross margin expanded by 110 basis points. Consulting revenue grew 5%, driven by offerings that address cognitive technology, application modernization and next-generation enterprise applications such S/4HANA and Salesforce.
 
Application management was flat. We had growth in our strategic areas of application modernization such as cloud application management and application development on emerging platforms offset by declines in traditional enterprise application management.
 
GBS brings together deep industry expertise and technology to provide clients with a holistic approach to derisk and orchestrate their digital transformation journeys. Our cloud application offerings help clients to implement cloud-centric architectures to modernize and automate their application portfolio. This is where we're seeing some early progress in synergies with Red Hat as we standardize on OpenShift as our preferred development platform. This quarter, we signed over 20 deals across industries ranging from telecommunications to banking and financial services to travel and transportation to retail, which utilize Red Hat capabilities to modernize their application portfolio. GBS also works with enterprises to leverage cognitive technologies to drive insights and process improvements as they evolve from isolated use cases to deploying AI at scale. We have good traction here with double-digit growth this quarter in our process reengineering and business decision support practices.
 
Turning to gross profit. GBS gross margin was 31%. The 110 basis point margin expansion was driven by continued mix shift to higher value offerings, yields on our delivery improvement, productivity and utilization initiatives, and currency benefit from leveraging our global delivery resource footprint.
 
In Global Technology Services, total revenue declined 4%. Last quarter, I mentioned that based on the backlog runout, we saw an inflection point in the year-to-year revenue in the second half. This was based on an improving trajectory in the runout projections over the subsequent quarters.
 
Revenue from backlog represents about 90% of next quarter's revenue and 85% 2 quarters out, so it is typically a good indicator of the total revenue performance. In the third quarter, the in-quarter revenue did not come in as expected. We had lower customer business volumes in certain markets and some multinational clients versus our expectations. And this impacted the growth rate by an additional point. Because this work leverages existing resources, it has a higher margin profile, and so these lower volumes impacted our gross margin, which was down about 1 point from the prior year. We have a supplemental chart that describes the revenue dynamics in more detail.
 
But now taking a broader perspective, we had good overall signings. Our GTS signings were up 20% this quarter, and signings are also up over the last 12 months. This results in a 1 point sequential improvement in the GTS year-to-year backlog performance. The signings growth is driven by cloud. Our cloud signings were up over 60%, and cloud now comprises over 40% of the GTS outsourcing backlog. This is up from just over 25% as we exited 2017.
 
Enterprises are in the early phases of their journeys to modernize their infrastructures to deliver savings, productivity and innovation. We are ideally positioned to move our clients to the cloud and derisk the journey for them. We've been shifting our portfolio to capture this opportunity, investing in our cloud capabilities while deemphasizing and exiting certain lower-value content. We have realigned our offerings across our clients' cloud life cycle journey of advice, move, build and manage. We've been infusing our offerings with IP and now leveraging Red Hat's capabilities. IBM services is taking an integrated approach to application modernization for the hybrid cloud.
 
At the same time, we have continued to expand our cloud availability zones and data centers. And in the coming weeks, you'll hear more from us on how companies from across some of the most highly regulated industries are turning to IBM's public cloud as their preferred destination for mission-critical workloads.
 
The IBM Cloud offers these clients the highest level of security, leading data protection and the best infrastructure to run Red Hat OpenShift and enterprise-grade workloads. And so we're going to continue to deliver solid growth in cloud, and this will drive performance over the longer term. But in the short term, given the dynamics around the lower client consumption, we're going to manage for margin, profit and cash. We're continuing to deemphasize low-margin offerings and contracts. We'll get more benefit from the workforce actions we took in the second quarter. We are scaling our agile services delivery model and accelerating our use of AI and automation in our delivery operations. And finally, in the near term, we're going to aggressively manage our variable spending while, of course, continuing to invest in cloud capabilities.
 
So now turning to Systems. Revenue was down this quarter, reflecting the back end of our product cycles. Let me walk through the dynamics across the portfolio.
 
In the third quarter, IBM Z revenue was down 20%. This is compared to good growth we had in the third quarter of last year. The mainframe is an enduring platform. And in September, we announced our newest and most advanced mainframe, z15. As I said, we had a solid start to the cycle based on shipments in the last week of the quarter. Building on the momentum from the advanced security of z14, the new z15 capabilities extend the platform's differentiation. Encryption everywhere is the industry's first commercial data privacy and security enforcement solution, including data privacy passports, which allow for remote access management. z15 also supports private and public clouds via Linux, Kubernetes and industry-standard tools. With the introduction of Red Hat OpenShift support, this new mainframe will support cloud-native development within enterprises. And instant recovery significantly reduces the impact of planned and unplanned downtime, enabling enterprises to get back to work more quickly. Putting all of this together, we're offering clients improved productivity, security and efficiency with z15.
 
Power revenue was down 27% this quarter. I'll remind you, in the third quarter of last year, we had the best Power performance in some time due to the introduction of mid-range and high-end POWER9 and the rollout of our supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the second half of 2018. Power continues to offer clients the performance, resiliency and security capabilities of POWER9 to optimize enterprise workflows.
 
In Storage, revenue was down 4%. This is an improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to recent quarters driven by our high end and growth in all-flash array. We're focused on continued innovation in Storage, and we announced the next-generation high-end system, DS8900, together with the mainframe in mid-September.
 
Looking at Systems profit. Pretax profit margin was down, reflecting mix headwinds and the investments we're making to bring new hardware innovation to market.
 
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. As I said, we've now generated $12.3 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months. In the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables and $1.8 billion of free cash flow. That brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $5.9 billion, which is up about $500 million year-to-year. These results reflect our operational performance, effective capital management and some of the expected headwinds we mentioned at the beginning of the year.
 
On capital expenditures, our strategy to deemphasize lower-value content across our services and financing portfolios contributed to our CapEx decline. Year-to-date CapEx also reflects the benefit from real estate sales in the second quarter.
 
You'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we said we expected a headwind on cash taxes. We saw some of that materialize in the third quarter and expect an additional headwind in the fourth as well. Also reflected in our performance is the impact from the software and services divestitures. I'll remind you that the proceeds from the divestitures are considered an investing activity so are not included in our free cash flow.
 
Finally, Red Hat had strong operational free cash flow performance, which was offset by incremental interest expense and some retention payments. As we have said, we expect Red Hat to be free cash flow accretive within 12 months of closing.
 
Looking at the uses of cash, over the last 3 quarters, we returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion of gross share repurchases. As we've previously disclosed, we suspended our share repurchase program when we closed the Red Hat transaction.
 
And then recapping the balance sheet highlights, we ended the quarter with $11 billion in cash, which is down from $46 billion in the second quarter with approximately $34 billion used to close the Red Hat transaction. As I mentioned earlier, total debt was down nearly $7 billion from the previous quarter.
 
So to sum up the cash and balance sheet dynamics, we continue to generate strong free cash flow. And together with the portfolio actions we've taken and the suspension of share repurchases, we're positioned to return to our targeted leverage ratios within a couple of years. In the meantime, our balance sheet is strong with the flexibility to support our business.
 
So I'll make a few summary comments on the quarter and the year before we move on to Q&A. During our investor webcast back in August, we shared our strategy and differentiation to address the hybrid cloud opportunity. We have been building a strong foundation, and now with Red Hat, we're even better positioned to win in chapter 2 of our clients' digital reinventions.
 
In the third quarter, you saw IBM and Red Hat are off to a great start, and across IBM, our cloud revenue growth accelerated. From a segment perspective, we had good growth in Cloud & Cognitive Software and in Global Business Services. In Systems, we had a solid start to our z15, which shipped at the end of the quarter, and we announced a new high-end storage. Global Technology Services also had strong cloud results but overall performance was weaker. I described the dynamics, and in the short term, we're going to manage this business for margin and cash.
 
Outside of the impact from the divested businesses, our gross margin expanded, reflecting operating leverage, which is an important element of our model. And our expense reflects a higher level of investment as we continue to bring new innovations to market. And so as we move into the fourth quarter, this is seasonally our biggest transaction quarter. It will be the first full quarter of availability for our z15, and we are expecting a normal IBM Z cycle. And we're assuming we have solid software transactional execution, and of course, we're still facing a strengthening dollar. With all of this and a steady economic environment, we continue to expect to deliver at least $12.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $12 billion for the year. This is consistent with the view we provided on August 2 when we updated our view of the full year for the acquisition of Red Hat.
 
And with that, we'll take your questions.",3745

What do you think is the root cause of the lower volumes in the quarter? Do you think that's a macro pause? And if you fast-forward to 2020, do the backlog runoff support flat to up GTS revenue? Or are we exiting too weak in 2019 to call for that right now? And if I could, on the GTS margin front, how much of this -- I think you alluded to the lower volumes being mainly the issue, but was pricing also an issue in the quarter on GTS margins?",106
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894690.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,6,"Okay. Thanks, Wamsi. Appreciate the question. So let me start with the last part of that multiple-part question because, as I stated in the prepared remarks, when you look at a GTS business profile, as you know, high-value, high-annuity content business. And when we're looking in-quarter, about 90-plus percent of our revenue in-quarter comes out of that backlog. Now you also have a labor-based structure that's relatively fixed in a short period of time in 90 days. And what you saw happened, and hopefully, you have taken a look at the supplemental chart, again for enhanced transparency for all of you so you can understand the dynamics of what's happened to our business, when that in-period revenue, that remaining 10% falls away, it has tremendous de-operating impacts from a leverage perspective overall. So that is high value, high profit, and when it hurts you at the latter part of the month, it definitely falls to the bottom line. So I'm sure we'll get into it. We're taking a lot of actions structurally. We got out ahead of that in the second quarter, and we're well positioned to return back to margins in GTS, as I stated, in the fourth quarter.
 
But let's go back to the first part of your question, which is that in-period 10% activity, that really comes from 2 aspects. One is based on our client business volumes that are embedded in our backlog and two, new selling bill signings that happen within a quarter, the latter being a minor part, the former being a major part. And when you take a look at what happened to us in the quarter, we did get impacted by lower client business based volumes that came out of predominantly 2 markets in Europe, that being United Kingdom and in Germany. But I would tell you, Europe overall, Europe was flat and pretty consistent with second quarter overall. So we still had good performance in our other base platforms or hardware, software. We fell short though in client base business volumes in GTS. So I wouldn't say it's per se macro, but we obviously saw less activity. But we got to improve our execution, period.",364

I think it's a notable uptick then with what Red Hat was doing standalone at least. What do you think is the longer-term trend line that we should think about Red Hat's revenue growth as we go forward under IBM both maybe on the subscription and services side? And just to kind of level set this, the 14% pretax margin drop or 14 points drop in the cognitive segment, how much of that is just transaction related versus other factors?",104
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894693.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,9,"Okay. Amit, thank you very much. And I appreciate you asking the question upfront here on Red Hat because obviously we're very pleased. And I think this is an instantiation and validation of the power of bringing IBM and Red Hat together and how it is better for our clients and for our shareholders overall. We definitely made some significant innovation announcements early August. We talked about our business profile at Investor Day. And I think 90 days into this, we're very pleased, 20% growth overall at a normalized basis to give you a normalized historical comparison. So we're very pleased.
 
But let me talk a little bit about the progress and what we're seeing within that 20% growth. And to your point, I would definitely reference for our investors pre the announcement in October of 2018, Red Hat was growing mid-teens. Just 3, 4 quarters later, at the time of closing in our first 90 days, you see the instantiation of that value given we accelerated it to 20%.
 
But let's talk about some of the other milestones in -- and key indicators. One, you talked about infrastructure. We had strong growth in the infrastructure led by RHEL and that return to double-digit growth of 12% if I'm not mistaken, and it's been a long time since RHEL actually was growing 12%. The application development emerging technology including OpenShift is growing mid-30s. Our OpenShift and now our newly announced containerized software, modernization of our software and Cloud Paks, we have now over an 1,800 installed base client embedded with that. Our backlog on a normalized basis, up 19%, and within the first 90 days, we talked a lot about at the Investor Day the deferred write-down that we had to take, the $2.2 billion. We talked about, over time, the value of Red Hat's platform and technology and the high renewal rates. Well, within the first 90 days, we actually replenished almost $0.5 billion of deferred revenue because we had very strong bookings, and those bookings were led by subscription. We actually had 11 deals over $10 million, which was up threefold. So we're very pleased with Red Hat overall. And I guess I would conclude, most importantly, the confidence in the workforce in IBM and Red Hat. Attrition's stable, and we hired over 1,000 people. And lastly, to your point about operating margin, the entire operating margin impact was due to transactional-related cost.",405

So should we expect, Jim, this dynamic to continue? I'm just looking for clues here on how legacy IBM Software might perform as you execute on Red Hat?",57

I mean if you take a look at our third quarter performance, our Cloud & Cognitive Software, we posted 8% growth. We're very pleased with that. Now obviously that normalized Red Hat growth of 20% does not get consolidated into IBM's books as you all quite well know given the deferred revenue adjustment. In fact, as you saw in the supplementals again for transparency as I'd committed to all of you since the beginning of the year, Red Hat delivered $371 million of revenue, a little bit better than around the $350 million that we talked about. And within that, just to call it out right off the bat, the $0.70 dilution that we expected in the third quarter as we stated in prepared remarks, we did about $30 million better on the deferred revenue write-down. By the way, that's a skew over 3Q versus fourth quarter. We still expect about $1 billion still in the second half of '19. So we're very pleased with that 8% overall. By the way, we grew organically, too.
 
Now to your point, we had very good growth in cloud and data platform led by our Cloud Paks off to a nice start. We grew in Db2 and our core offerings. We grew in our organic-based cognitive applications portfolio with very strong growth in security and in some of our industry verticals like Maximo and TRIRIGA, but we actually did fall short in our transaction processing platform. And as you know, as I've said many times, that's high value to us and that's high value to our clients because we run the mission-critical workloads and applications on our systems portfolio, and that's always tied to client buying cycles.
 
Now when you take a look, to your question, what do we see going forward in the fourth quarter? We see pretty consistent performance, high single digit in this segment. A couple of things I would call out. Number one, we have a much tougher compare. Number two, the difference between the amount of transactional activity you do on a fourth quarter versus third quarter is obviously a big hill to climb, but we've got a nice pipeline, and it's all about execution. I would not expect our TPP to come back here in the fourth quarter. We grew I think 6%, 7% fourth quarter last year. So we will not grow in TPP in the fourth quarter, but we will have a strong growth in cloud and data platform and in cognitive apps.",419

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894699.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Great. Thanks, Katy. Appreciate it. I think I got the heart of your question. You were breaking up there a little bit at least in the room here and on my speaker. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we did reaffirm guidance, at least $12.80 and about $12 billion of free cash flow. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to sequentially increase about 3.5 to 3.7, in that range, quarter-to-quarter. And as I just stated on the last question, it's typically our biggest transactional quarter ever -- or, excuse me, within a year.
 
Now a couple points to what you brought up. So it's a little bit higher than what you had asked. One, it's higher sequentially than 2018. And it's more representative of a normal mainframe cycle, which, if you go back to 2017, we were right within that. Now to your point, there's a few things I want to call out and give a little color what's underneath that. Number one, we continue to face a stronger and stronger dollar every quarter. It feels like each quarter I get up here and I talk about that, whereas 90 days ago, we were saying that basically no headwind. We're looking right now about 1 point to 1.5 points headwind in the fourth quarter based on where rates are at today.
 
Second, to your question, we still have a 2 point headwind, give or take, on the divesting of our software and mortgage processing based business, which was $2 billion annually here in the fourth quarter. So those 2 are kind of headwinds.
 
Now when you take a look at our portfolio, our mainframe, we are very pleased with the initial start. We announced it very late in the third quarter. We, in essence, have 1 week's worth of shipment. It met our expectations, and most importantly, the value proposition, the strong value proposition around data privacy, encryption everywhere, cloud native apps and putting Red Hat OpenShift on our mainframe and instant recovery are resonating well, and we got a very good pipeline. And we expect a normal cycle here in the fourth quarter, and I would attach that to the high-end DS8000 that we also announced. So Systems, we feel pretty good about the innovation and about us driving the fourth quarter.
 
Software, I just talked about. We see consistent performance. Services, GBS, GBS continues to have great momentum. We had a good signings quarter, high single-digit signings. We continue to have good backlog runout, but again, GBS grew 7% last year. We had a strong quarter. We closed on a lot of milestone billings, but we still see growth here in GBS, albeit probably very low single digits and continuing that momentum. By the way, GBS, their backlog runout is actually improving right now as we move through 2020. So we see consistency. And in GTS, based on what I said in the prepared remarks and you could see in the supplemental chart, it's prudent right now not to plan on anything better. We are taking actions to aggressively change and adapt our portfolio, our offerings. We're seeing very good green shoots in our cloud base of business in that segment. And we're going to continue to adapt and change that, but we're also going to manage this business for margin, profit and cash, and we're going after the right structural actions going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little color about the 3.5 to 3.7.",584

Given that, that's about 35% of your revenues and you're looking at maybe a more muted growth rate, are you still comfortable in talking about 4 to 5 points of growth and mid-single-digit growth for 2020? And then just related to that, maybe you can just talk about the dynamics of sort of what happened over the course of the quarter. You provided some guidance on the early April call. You fell a little short of that. And it sounds like it was mainly GTS. But at that point, did you not have a good read on what was happening with your workloads during the quarter? And I guess the question I'm asking, did it continue to decelerate from there? And what does that either say about the value proposition of GTS today for existing clients or more just about the health of your clients? So sorry I snuck 2 in there but one, just how we think of revenue growth next year in light of GTS being lower; and then two, what sort of changed from August 5 on.",198
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894702.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,18,"As always, Toni, thank you very much. At least it was only 2 and not 3 like last quarter, but who's counting? Anyways, let me try to take this in a couple of different components, so we can unpack this, so you can understand fundamentally what's happening to us in GTS, what happened throughout the quarter and then to your first part of your question, what do we see overall for IBM in 2020, which, by the way, we'll spend a lot more time on in January because given the amount of transactional business both on hardware and software but also on services signings that we got to get done here in the fourth quarter. We got a very robust pipeline over the next couple quarters, and that will dictate more importantly how 2020 will play out.
 
But if you take a look at -- within the quarter. So let me talk a little bit about -- I'm not going to repeat what's on the supplemental chart. The net message in the supplemental chart is, 90 days ago, we printed down 4%, as you all know, in our GTS technology services revenue. That was basically all out of backlog in our in-period sell and bill activity, and volumes from our clients was roughly muted. It was flat. That has been consistent for quite a while. We saw at that time a backlog that ran out in third quarter but roughly down 3%, and in fourth quarter, it was down 1% to 2%. That was the driver behind calling the inflection point.
 
Now how did the quarter play out? The quarter actually played out through August quarter-to-date, our GTS business was improving off of that down 4% that we exited second quarter. We were hovering about down 3%, give or take. This all happened late in the quarter. And by the way, to the earlier question, that's why you see it flow through our fixed structural costs that impacted our margins overall.
 
So when you look at it, one, it was tied to volume-based businesses in a couple of different markets around the world; and two, it was tied to some part of our execution. I'm not going to back off that. From a credibility perspective, we've got to execute better there. We've been focusing this business on margin, profit and cash. It is a high fixed cost, high capital-intensive business, and we've got to deliver that right return to our investors given that we've chosen our capital allocation strategy with the acquisition of Red Hat and what we've done to our balance sheet to lever up, which, by the way, we made a great down payment on with the $7 billion of debt we paid down. But it happened late in the quarter. We are taking action around that.
 
Now I'll conclude. Entering into 2020, we continue to see very strong performance as we continue to adapt our portfolio and our offerings in GTS to capture what we believe is that chapter 2 of hybrid cloud. One, our cloud base of business with regards to our backlog, our GTS backlog is $80 billion. Over 40% of that backlog is cloud. By the way, and I know you've done a ton of analysis on this, over the last 5 years, our GTS backlog ex currency is flat. And within that, we went from low single-digit cloud content to 40% cloud content overall. And now with the acquisition of Red Hat and building out differentiated offering and capabilities, we expect that to accelerate as we go forward. We delivered 60% signings growth in the fourth quarter. 40% of our backlog now is cloud, and we got a book of business on trailing 12 months in excess of $8 billion on cloud.
 
So when we look to 2020, we talked about on August 2, 4 to 5 points to your point, we talked about moving IBM to a sustainable revenue path. And what I've seen play out in third quarter, while we got a headwind right in front of us on GTS in fourth quarter, nothing would change my mind with regards to 2020 on driving sustainable revenue growth overall.",697

Thank you very much. I mean obviously, we operate in 170 countries around the world. So we are always monitoring and analyzing the market and most importantly to the heart of your question, client buying behaviors. When you look at the IT industry, the IT industry has always been predicated on effective balance of leveraging technology for growth and leveraging technology for productivity. And over time, that balance might shift, and we are seeing a shift, and we have seen a shift by the way. It's not just right in front of us here in the month of September that clients, from a buying perspective, are shifting more and more to productivity to quick payback to ROI and also predictability of spend, which, by the way, plays to the breadth and value of our portfolio overall. And you see how that's played out in our GBS base of business, continued momentum and in our Cloud & Cognitive Software business driving the value because clients are still spending. They're spending in those key high-value areas around cloud, around digital, around data/AI and around security. Why? Because they want to create a competitive advantage to win in the marketplace. So we still see spending in those areas.
 
And when we look around the world -- and I can only give you the lens of IBM. When you look around the world, we had strong growth in many markets around the world: Japan, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain, amongst many that grow -- that grew very nicely. We did fall short in a couple other areas around the world, and I called out in GTS specifically U.K. and Germany. But I'll tell you, overall, our Europe business was flat. So I would not say per se this is a macro-related thing. And by the way, we're selling hardware, software-based platforms all over the world. So we're acknowledging shifts in buying behavior. We're adapting our value propositions. Clients are still spending in those key high-value areas, and that's where we're placing, as CFO I could tell you, where we're placing all of our investment and capital allocation in our business.",358

The signings rebounded nicely in the quarter, up 15%. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the composition of those signings, particularly what that means about the sustainability of growth in GBS and to what extent those signings were kind of overweighted towards GTS that would help replenish the backlog?",58
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894708.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,24,"Sure. Thanks for the question, Jim. I appreciate it. So let me unpack this a little on signings backlog and backlog realization. We've been talking a lot about this, I think, over the last 6 quarters. We had great signings, signings over $9 billion up 15%. We had growth in GTS north of 20%; growth in GBS high single digits, if I'm not mistaken, about 9% growth. Within that, the composition as we all know, signings are not all the same. They're not equal on how they impact backlog, how they impact realization, but we had great signings growth above $100 million, large deals, up 45% overall, and we had small mid-sized deals up high single digits overall. So when you take a look at our signings, that then translated into an improvement in our overall backlog position. Our backlog improved 1 point quarter-to-quarter.
 
And let me break it out then between GTS and GBS, and again, for enhanced transparency, you saw the supplemental chart on GTS. GTS backlog, $80 billion. That backlog is down 2%. That improved about 1 point, 1.5 points quarter-to-quarter. We've seen relatively stable duration in GTS' backlog for a long period of time even as we continue to mix more and more to cloud. And now that cloud is over 40% of that backlog.
 
GBS grew signings 9%. GBS backlog is down 4, and that improved almost a couple of points quarter-to-quarter. It's this phenomenon of signings to backlog to revenue realization has really played out dramatically for the last 2-plus years in GBS. We talked about how Mark and the team have done a great job remixing the portfolio and offerings to capture where value and where spend are going. That is moving more and more to a consulting base and a cloud application modernization base area that's shorter duration. Our duration in our GBS backlog has reduced over 20% to 25% over the last couple years. And that's why you've been able to see an overall backlog that's been down mid- to high single digits, and we're delivering consistent revenue growth anywhere from 1% to 3% to 4% in that GBS base of business. So that is where you're seeing a big change.",370

You've mentioned in-period business volumes, but then it looks like it continues on to Q4. What I'm more interested in is do these in-period things continue on into Q1 in 2020 or maybe help a person who doesn't fully comprehend everything better understand it.",77

And hopefully, you appreciate the enhanced transparency in the chart overall. Obviously, Patricia and the team can spend a lot more time on this tonight. But as I stated earlier, the net message is in a GTS outsourcing based business, you have roughly -- you have -- as you enter a quarter, you have about 90-plus percent of that revenue that's under backlog, high annuity content-based business. It's under contract. You have a remaining 10% that is in-period sell and bill activity and also tied to the client business volumes that run off that backlog. And when you look at second quarter, it pretty much played out as we expected, down 4%. That's what the backlog said entering the quarter. Our in-period activity of sell and bill and transactional components were basically muted.
 
As we got into third quarter, you see the way the chart is laid out, that backlog runout said inflection point down 4%, goes to down 3%, goes down -- to down 1% to 2%. Assuming that we consistently execute both in an IBM manner and the market overall. And when you look at the third quarter, the third quarter, our in-period, that 10% was down mid-teens due to less client business volume and also execution on our small deals predominantly in Europe as I stated. That then has a flow-through because now we're starting October 1 looking at fourth quarter. Whereas we thought we were going to be down 1% to 2% in backlog, now we're down 2% to 3%. And to the extent we can go back and execute to that 10% that has a muted effect, we would end up the quarter at that level. If it plays out like third quarter, we're going to be down 3% to 4%. That's why I stated we're going to focus all of our energy on continuing to transform the offerings and portfolio and capture where spend and growth is coming from and getting after the structural cost to drive the margin expansion.",340

Does duration normalize in '20? In other words, do you think you can begin to glow -- grow, rather, services backlog? Or do you still feel like there's compression associated with the services signing on duration? And then I'll ask my second question, too. The consulting business in GBS also had a good quarter, 5% growth. Accenture's had some weak bookings frankly on consulting, and I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that business and the economic sensitivity associated with it as we seem to be facing some more headwinds here. Do you think that consulting business as you see it today can continue to grow low to mid-single digits over the next couple of quarters? And that's it for me.",133
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3955.0,1837205.0,71894714.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,30,"Okay. Keith, thanks. Good way to wrap up on the part of our portfolio that has delivered consistent operational execution. And as I stated earlier, the team really should be commended because we are capturing and we are becoming the clients' provider and service provider of choice as they embark on their digital reinvention journeys and journeys to cloud.
 
But let me take your second part of your question first if I remember correctly, and that is comparison to Accenture. But more importantly, I'm not going to talk about them. I'm going to talk about our business. Our consulting business continues to execute very well. We delivered 5% growth here. By the way, off of a tougher and tougher compare as we move throughout 2018, we improved that consulting performance in GBS. We delivered 5% growth, great growth in application modernization consulting and also on our next-generation enterprise applications like S/4HANA and in Salesforce. And by the way, I talked about GBS signings up high single digits. We were up significant double digits in consulting signings, so we had a great quarter overall on signings.
 
And that kind of leads me to your first question. When you look at our backlog, our duration has come down, like I said, 20% to 25% over the last handful of years. I don't see that changing right now. As this world moves more and more to cloud, we are moving more and more to shorter-duration, higher consumption-based activity that's going to play to the hand in the portfolio that we've put in place overall. So I think the reason I gave enhanced disclosure between GTS and GBS on duration and overall backlog, I think you see in the fundamental differences between the 2, and the GBS will continue to impact when you just look at the printed number of IBM. But I would focus more on GTS overall as far as looking at the total backlog going forward.
 
So with that, again, I want to thank you for joining our call here today. A few comments just to wrap up. As I've stated, we've been investing and taking bold actions to position our business to win in chapter 2 of hybrid cloud. The acceleration in Red Hat, our early support for our Cloud Paks and modernizing our software portfolio and growth in our digital and application modernization services are all validation the actions we've taken are resonating with our clients and driving that key high-value growth areas in the IT industry. At the same time, we're continuing our disciplined financial management, which should serve us well as we head into fourth quarter and 2020. So again, I'd like to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to the continued dialogue.",460
