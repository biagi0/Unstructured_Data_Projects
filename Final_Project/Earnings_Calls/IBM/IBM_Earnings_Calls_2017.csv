112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247679.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. As is typical in January, I'll start out with some top-level comments on the quarter and the year, discuss the details of the quarter and then conclude with our view of 2017. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $21.8 billion, operating net income of $4.8 billion and operating earnings per share of $5.01, which is up 3.5%. There are significant opportunities and shifts in our industry, and we believe that to be successful with enterprise clients, you need to bring together cognitive technologies on cloud platforms that create industry-based solutions to solve real-world problems.
So with that very brief context around our point of view, let me comment on what we achieved in the full year of 2016. We made progress in building new businesses and creating new markets and continued to deliver strong results in our strategic imperatives. We invested at a high level and remixed our skills to address these new opportunity areas. We also continue to innovate in the businesses that we have traditionally provided to our clients. We returned capital to our shareholders. And we achieved the earnings and free cash flow expectations we set last January, with $13.59 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $11.6 billion, which is 97% of GAAP net income. 
So we did what we said we'd do in a year not only with a lot of change in the industry, but also a year with a number of macro conditions and events, particularly in countries that are meaningful to our results. I'll cover our expectations shortly, but right up front, I'll say that we are exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it, and that is reflected in our 2017 guidance. 
Looking at some of the highlights of the fourth quarter. We had terrific growth in cloud, with revenue up 33%. We also had good growth in our analytics, security and mobile solutions. We're continuing to grow our substantial technology services business, reflecting the work our clients are demanding to help modernize and transform their infrastructures. And we had really good performance in our z Systems business, reflecting the value of differentiated, high-value solutions running important parts of our clients' infrastructure. 
There were some macro challenges in the quarter in certain countries like Brazil, the U.K. and Germany as well as the impact of a stronger dollar. As always, my comments throughout will be based on constant currency. 
Our results for the quarter and the year reflect the success we're having in our strategic areas and the investments we've been making to drive that shift. We delivered 14% revenue growth in our strategic imperatives for the year, led by cloud. We finished the year with $13.7 billion of cloud revenue, which was 17% of IBM's revenues. Our strategic imperatives together generated $33 billion of revenue in 2016 and now represent 41% of our revenue. To put this in perspective, when we first established the strategic imperatives, we said they'd grow to $40 billion and represent over 40% of our revenue by 2018. The growth we achieved in 2016 keeps us ahead of track to the $40 billion. In fact, a growth rate of 10% to 11% from here gets us to the $40 billion in 2018.
We're moving into a new phase. The debate about whether artificial intelligence is real is over, and we're getting to work to solve real business problems. As we move into this new era, it's important to understand what enterprise clients are looking for. They need a cognitive platform that turns vast amounts of data into insights and allows them to use it for competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for the capability, but for speed and agility. And they need a partner they trust and who understands their industry work and process flows. 
This is where we're clear and confident about our point of view. Yes, we have world-class cognitive technology, but that's table stakes. We're building datasets by industry that we either own or we partner for. Importantly, we've designed Watson on the IBM Cloud to allow our clients to retain control of their data and their insights rather than using client data to educate a central knowledge graph. And we're using our tremendous industry expertise to build vertical solutions and train Watson on specific-industry domains. We're amassing these capabilities because you need more than public data and automation algorithms to solve real problems like improving health care outcomes or navigating the banking regulatory environment. So in this new phase, data, and the business model around data matters, industry matters and time matters and that's why Watson is the AI platform for business. 
Let me give you a couple of examples of the progress we made in 2016 bringing together cognitive, the IBM Cloud and our industry expertise. Watson Health provides cognitive insights on our enterprise-grade Watson Health cloud and leverages broad datasets that we own, including 100 million electronic health records, 200 million claims records and 30 billion images. We now have 7,000 Watson Health employees, including doctors, nurses, health policy experts and 1,000 data scientists. We brought this together because you can't change the way health care works or work on curing cancer with public data alone. You need clinical data, payer data, images, all of which is private. You need the expertise of the leading oncologists and geneticists, and you need to do this work within a quality management system that is HIPAA-compliant. So Watson Health was our first vertical. 
Late in the year, we launched Watson Financial Services to provide targeted solutions, bringing together cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystem capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Promontory, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. We acquired Promontory because you can't help banks navigate regulatory environments by scraping the web or automating keystrokes. You need top industry specialists that understand the complexity and can train Watson to deal with risk management requirements that are specific to financial services because who trains your AI platform matters. 
So bringing together cognitive technology, private data, a cloud platform and industry expertise is what you need to do real work in the enterprise. 
What is also becoming very clear is that as IT moves to the cloud and as business processes are delivered as digital services, it is essential they are enterprise strength and that the transactions are trusted by all parties involved. That's where the blockchain comes in. It's a technology that brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts to allow the transfer of any asset, whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond, or a digital asset like music across any business network. 
Blockchain increases transparency, auditability and trust. It reduces risk, and it can drive tremendous efficiencies. Bottom line, blockchain will help to fundamentally reengineer business processes and improve outcomes. We're building a complete blockchain platform and we have already worked with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for business. Many are in financial services to handle foreign exchange settlement, smart contracts, identity management and trade finance. Just last week, we announced securities clearing and settlement with DTCC.
But the application for blockchain is well beyond financial services. For example, we're collaborating with Walmart to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China, and with Everledger, who is using a cloud-based blockchain to track the providence of diamonds and other high-value goods as they move through the supply chain. Here too, the data needed to improve food safety or track diamonds isn't on the web. It's private data owned by enterprises who want to work with a partner they trust. So in 2016, we built blockchain platforms and services, and in 2017, we expect to start scaling blockchain networks. I'll touch on a few more examples in the segment discussions, but first, I'll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $21.8 billion, which is down 70 basis points. Over the course of the year, we've had growth in our annuity businesses and some growth pressure in the transactional content. In the fourth quarter, even with the seasonally higher transactional content and a little less contribution from acquisitions, our constant-currency revenue performance was similar to third quarter. With the strengthening of the dollar, currency returned to a headwind. In fact, with the change in rates since mid-October and the seasonal skew of our business toward the back end of the quarter, revenue was impacted by nearly $300 million. 
On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, while EMEA decelerated. Performance by country would generally be what you'd expect based on macro and geopolitical trends. We've all read about various issues in countries such as the U.K., Germany, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, and so our performance in these countries reflects that reality. Some of these countries, U.K., Germany and Brazil, for instance, have a meaningful impact to our results. Collectively, these 3 countries had over a 1-point impact on our revenue performance in the quarter. Others, like Russia, Turkey and Egypt, were also a drag on our growth but less of an impact given their size. We had really good results in China. In fact, China grew strong double digits in the fourth, which resulted in revenue growth for the full year. This strength was in the banking sector, where our largest clients are upgrading to our latest technology to continue to run their infrastructure. I should mention that we also had good revenue performance in the U.S., where we returned to growth. 
Our gross margin reflects the impact of our investments, including the acquisitions we've made and the mix to as-a-service businesses that aren't yet at scale. Our expense overall is down 7% versus last year, and our expense-to-revenue ratio was down about 1.5 points. This includes a 5-point year-to-year impact from the acquisitions we've closed over the last year and a modest impact from currency.
Since early 2015, we've been talking about ramping the level of investment in the business in areas like cognitive and cloud. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect the fact that we've ramped on that higher level of investment. We're also seeing the yield from some of the workforce rebalancing actions earlier in the year. As we've discussed in the past, some of this is being reinvested in other areas, including cost. 
Our expense dynamics also reflect the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. This is a model we've developed for some of our high-value technologies that are more mature, but not necessarily in a priority investment area for us. So it made sense to work with partners who will invest and build businesses around some of these software assets. It's good for them and it's good for IBM.
We license the intellectual property to these partners, resulting in IP income for us. They take on the development mission, drive future innovation and ultimately expand the client base as they take the product to market. As we generate revenue from our own sales, we pay our partner a royalty for the development mission they've assumed. As the partner expands their client base, they pay us a royalty because we retain ownership of the IP. So with this model, we continue to own the product and our revenue stream but shift our spending profile to a more variable cost structure while extending the life of these assets. This is another way of monetizing our research and innovation while allocating our resources to where we see our best opportunities. This quarter, our IP income reflects licenses for several software products, and we have a pipeline that will continue into 2017. 
Our pretax margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate just under 16% for the year. This is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points. 
We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1.5%, and net income margin expanded by 60 basis points. With a share reduction of 2%, our EPS of $5.01 was better by 3.5%. We generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $11.6 billion for the year, which is 97% of our GAAP net income. We returned 3/4 of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So summing up the metrics for the quarter. We had strength in our strategic areas with a growing annuity base, an improving expense trajectory, PTI margin that was essentially flat and net margin that was up, modest growth in operating earnings per share and free cash flow realization and shareholder return for the year that was in line with our longer-term model.
Moving to our segments. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, and pretax income was up 1%. Our solutions software revenue was up, while transaction processing software declined. Within solutions software, growth was again led by analytics, including our Watson offerings such as health and security. We continue to innovate the Watson platform and extend cognitive across our solution offerings. We saw strong SaaS performance with double-digit growth again this quarter. Our Cognitive Solutions margin profile reflects our continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisition content and the ramp in our SaaS business. 
Let me talk about the progress we're making in parts of the portfolio. In analytics, we're helping clients move data to the cloud and deliver actionable insights from the data with our cognitive capabilities. This quarter, we introduced new offerings like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery service and trade surveillance for financial services, spanning our core analytics platform, Watson platform and industry platforms. 
Our Watson platform, which underpins our cognitive strategy, continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. Natural language processing has long been at the core of Watson. Last quarter, we added new cognitive capabilities for conversation and the demand has been strong. We've seen significant growth in our API calls this year, especially around conversational services, where API calls increased 50-fold year-to-year. 
Let me give you an example. In Latin America, Bradesco deployed a Portuguese solution based on Watson across more than 5,500 branches to assist employees in answering customers' questions. Watson had already learned over 300,000 words in the Portuguese language, more than twice the number linguists say is necessary to be fluent. But this isn't just about language translation. This is about understanding business. Watson was trained to answer questions on over 50 of Bradesco's retail products. And since going live in October, Watson is now helping to answer nearly 9 out of every 10 questions every day. 
As I mentioned, we're combining cloud and cognitive with industry expertise. In Watson Health, we're building scale and bringing real-world benefits to researchers and clinicians. With our offerings across 5 areas, including oncology and genomics, government, life sciences, value-based care and imaging, Watson is helping over 45 million people globally. Our oncology clients alone span more than 35 hospital systems. And with our acquisitions of Explorys, Phytel, Truven and Merge, we have over 10,000 clients and partners. 
Genomics is another area where we're building scale. We announced partnership with both Quest Diagnostics and Illumina, where both companies will leverage IBM Watson for Genomics, a new service that integrates Watson's cognitive services into genomics sequencing applications. Through partners, we'll make Watson's genomic analysis available to oncologists who treat 70% of cancer patients in the United States.
In the area of life sciences, Barrow Neurological Institute is an example of where we're seeing real-world benefits today. Barrow reported using Watson for Drug Discovery to help identify 5 never-before-linked genes associated with ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. This work gives researchers new insights that will pave the way for the development of new drug targets and therapies to combat ALS. Without Watson, researchers predicted the discovery would have taken years rather than only a few months. 
We had growth in our Watson IoT this quarter, where our clients are putting the power of Watson to work across the immense data pool created by the Internet of Things. We launched new industry solutions targeting manufacturing and insurance and new collaborations with clients like BMW. We more than doubled both the number of new clients and the number of developers on our IoT platform. 
We also had good results from our weather platform. Here, too, we've demonstrated our tremendous scale this quarter. During Hurricane Matthew, our platform served as a critical resource for over 100 million people. Our platform delivered 350 million video streams over that week. Roughly 1.6 petabytes of data were delivered through a total of 141 billion API calls. With weather information, you have to be able to deliver that kind of scale, particularly when recognized as the most accurate forecaster.
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We announced a major expansion of our incident response capabilities, including the industry's first cyber range for the commercial sector at our new security headquarters in Boston. Cyber range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber-attack experiences. Clients learn how to prepare for and handle cyber attacks. And Watson for Cyber Security is providing insights on live cyber attacks to 40 clients, including, as you would expect, several large financial institutions and universities who are participating in our beta program. 
So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter, while we continued to embed cognitive into our offerings, scale our platforms and build industry verticals.
Turning to Global Business Services. Our performance reflects continued declines in the businesses we are shifting away from, such as large ERP engagements. From a line of business perspective, our consulting results were fairly consistent with our performance throughout the year, while application management decelerated. 
We continue to aggressively shift our investments and resources to our digital practices, and growth in our strategic imperatives accelerated to 19% this quarter. Our cloud practice was up over 70%, mobile nearly 30% and analytics was up 10%. 
On a global basis, we continue to build out our digital design agency, the IBM Interactive Experience, which now has more than 30 global studios. In the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with General Motors to bring the power of OnStar and Watson together to create the auto industry's first cognitive mobility platform. Watson will learn the drivers' preferences, apply machine learning and sift through data to recognize patterns in their decisions and habits. This information will allow brand and marketing professionals working with OnStar to deliver personalized interactions that directly impact their target audiences. This solution brings together our cognitive technology with IBM differentiated data, such as the rich weather data and IBM iX's industry expertise and experience in mobile design.
As clients are looking to create new business models with our cognitive technologies, our industry experts and GBS are helping them scale. This quarter, we announced a new global Watson IoT consulting practice to help clients introduce IoT innovation into their businesses. This will include 1,500 consultants, data scientists and security experts with deep domain and industry expertise. We also announced that IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps can now be integrated with a broad set of Watson capabilities to increase the productivity and improve decision-making for enterprise employees. 
Turning to profit. GBS profit and margin were down. In the more traditional engagements, we continue to have some price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas to our digital businesses, adding nearly 8,000 resources to these practices in 2016. This impacts productivity in the near term. We're investing in enablement, hiring top talent and bringing in new skills through acquisitions. Profit this quarter also continues to reflect additional spending in some accounts to deliver on our client commitments. 
So for Global Business Services, we accelerated the growth in our digital practices, while managing a shift from the more traditional businesses. And we're continuing to invest to build out capabilities and deliver on client commitments.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and pretax income was up 4%. Within this segment, our GTS revenue and backlog continues to grow. And this quarter, we signed 16 deals greater than $100 million. 
We are modernizing our offerings and helping our clients move to the cloud. Our strategic imperatives for this segment were up over 35%, with cloud up 50%. We continue to invest to build out our cloud infrastructure and we now have more than 50 cloud centers globally. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired Sanovi Technologies, a cloud-native company that will enable us to deliver disaster recovery as a service to clients undergoing digital and hybrid cloud transformation. This adds to our leading resiliency capabilities.
Looking at the lines of business. Infrastructure services grew 3%. We built the IBM Cloud for the enterprise. Clients can mix bare-metal servers, virtual servers, storage and networking to find the right balance for their workloads. Our enterprise workloads on our public cloud continue to scale, contributing to growth in our as-a-service content. Clients continue to turn to us for enablement of their new digital businesses. These digital businesses require IT infrastructure that is always on, available everywhere and, of course, secure. 
Clients often struggle with the complexity of sourcing and integrating IT services such as multiple cloud platforms, on-premise data centers and mobile environments. As a services integrator, we help clients navigate the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and deliver the needed end-to-end infrastructure services solutions in an integrated and unified way. 
For example, at a large Australian bank, we partnered with the client to build an IT architecture for the future. We're helping the bank design, build and manage a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure. This solution automatically brokers, deploys, integrates and orchestrates across multiple environments and services. When the bank has a business need, such as a new digital banking service, their IT is ready to support it immediately with a secure, integrated and optimized solution. We are the premier partner when it comes to hybrid cloud services integration. Our depth of capabilities and experience is unmatched in the industry. 
Technical support services was flat year-to-year and continues to generate substantial revenue and profit for our model. We are seeing growth in multivendor services, leveraging our global scale and deep technical skills. We've expanded our multivendor services into industries like banking, retail and health care, and into technologies, including ATMs, mobile, point-of-sale and Internet of Things. Think of this as providing wall-to-wall support for our clients. 
Integration software grew again this quarter, as we continue to see momentum in our hybrid cloud integration capabilities and WebSphere Application Server, which grew double digits. We continue to scale our Bluemix platform, which has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open public cloud deployments globally. Based on open standards, it features a robust set of high-value services, including our cognitive, weather and blockchain APIs. American Airlines named IBM as its cloud provider for greater enterprise flexibility and scale. As part of the partnership, they will move enterprise applications to the IBM Cloud, leveraging a wide range of application development capabilities through Bluemix.
At Majesco, a global provider of core insurance software and services, we announced a 5-year partnership, where we'll contribute cognitive APIs that will allow insurance companies to better analyze, price and understand business risk using new data sources such as the weather and social media. We'll also add an engaging and personalized cognitive interface to their services. And of the largest banks in Thailand tapped Bluemix to build a new secure blockchain network to transform their credit approval process. 
Turning to profit. Gross margin is down 1.4 points. Infrastructure services margins were flat year-to-year, but technical support services and integration software margins declined. In TSS, we're shifting more of the business into multivendor services. And in integration software, we are shifting more capability to SaaS. This is impacting margins in the near term. The IP partnerships are a headwind to gross profit margins in integration software, though a tailwind to pretax margin this quarter. Pretax profit for the segment is up, with margins expanding 40 basis points. We continue to focus on investing in our strategic areas while innovating and driving productivity in our more traditional businesses.
So for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, we grew backlog, revenue and profit in the quarter, with continued strength in our hybrid cloud capabilities across services and software. These results reflect our success in modernizing the services that we provide to our clients. 
Our Systems revenue reflects growth in z Systems, offset by declines in power and storage as we continue to address shifting markets. Systems gross margin was up year-to-year due to both improvement in z margins and the relative strength in that higher-margin business. 
In z Systems, we delivered 4% revenue growth, double-digit growth in MIPS, and we expanded our margins. These results reflect our continued success in driving innovation in our core systems. The mainframe is optimized for mobile and security and is constantly being redesigned to drive new workloads, including instant payments and the emerging blockchain. 8 quarters into the cycle, we added 8 new clients in the quarter, 29 for the year and 80 since inception. 
New client adoption at this stage in our cycle further validates our clients' perceived value and their ongoing commitment to the IBM platform. Clients are investing heavily to meet the demands for future growth. 
I mentioned earlier the strength we had in China. We closed significant z Systems deals in the quarter, including 2 large Chinese banks migrating their mainframe installed base to our latest z13 technology. And in Europe, we're helping our clients manage new requirements in the rapidly evolving area of financial services modernization. We had 4 wins in the quarter on instant payments. Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, TARGET2-Securities, or T2S, has been deployed on IBM's z Systems to provide the necessary reliability, scalability and IT security. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients' complex environments. 
Our Power performance reflects our ongoing shift to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high-value but declining UNIX market. Linux workloads continued double-digit growth and faster than the market, while the traditional UNIX base declined. We've been shifting our platform to address Linux, and with fully expanded Linux offerings, our Power-on-Linux represents over 15% of our overall portfolio. Supporting this is our success in HANA on Power. The Power platform is critical to the workloads a cognitive world will demand. And in the fourth quarter, we saw this in the U.S. Department of Energy's deployment of hundreds of IBM's OpenPOWER servers. When complete, these 2 supercomputers will be among the world's largest scientific and AI computing systems.
Storage hardware was down 10% this quarter, which reflects the shift in value towards software-defined environments. Storage revenue declines were mainly driven by midrange and high-end disk. However, we are now benefiting from a full suite of all-flash array offerings and this portfolio grew double digits in the fourth quarter. We also continue to see double-digit revenue growth in software-defined storage, particularly in our Spectrum Suite and cloud object storage offerings, which is not reported in our Systems segment.
Storage gross margins are down, as hardware continues to be impacted by both volume and price pressure. So for Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by growth in z Systems, offset by Power and storage declines. These results reflect the reinvention of our core systems for work in a new era of computing. We have optimized our systems to drive new types of workloads like blockchain and instant payments. We're expanding our footprint, building new capabilities and solving new types of problems for our clients. And though we are facing some shifting market dynamics and product transitions in both power and storage, our portfolio overall remains optimized to address the demands of an era of cognitive and cloud computing. 
So now let me touch on our software performance across our segments. Our total software revenue was over $7 billion, up 1%. Software was up 1% for the year as well. From a business area perspective this quarter, we had growth in Cognitive Solutions and integration software, while operating systems continued to be a drag, in line with the long-term secular trend. Software annuity revenue was up mid-single digits, led by our SaaS offerings. Our software transaction revenue declined mid-single digits, which is a significant improvement from the performance in the first half. Given the seasonality in our software business, transactional revenue has a bigger impact on our total software performance in the fourth quarter.
So moving on to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated $5.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $900 million in CapEx and generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we generated $15.3 billion of cash from operations. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, with over $1 billion in support of our cloud and solutions businesses as well as a significant portion going to support our services backlog and our upcoming hardware cycles. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.6 billion and, as I mentioned earlier, our cash realization remains strong at just over 97% of GAAP net income, consistent with our longer-term model of realization in the 90s. So our cash performance is right in line with our profit levels as we talked about all year and includes significant cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year as well as lower cash taxes. We did see an uptick in our working capital as we closed the year, which we attribute to timing and mix of substantial transactions in December. 
Looking at uses of cash. We continue to strengthen our portfolio by investing $5.7 billion in acquisitions. We've acquired 15 companies in 2016, including 3 in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions added to our capabilities in cognitive and analytics, cloud and security, and significant transactions included The Weather Company, Truven Health, Promontory and 3 digital marketing agencies. 
Over the course of the year, we've returned almost $9 billion to shareholders, including dividends of over $5 billion and $3.5 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 23 million shares, reducing our average share count by just under 2.5%, which is in line with our longer-term model. At the end of the year, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Total debt was just over $42 billion, of which about 2/3 was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is 7:1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, a point better than September. I'll come back to a change we'll be making to the structure of our financing business starting in 2017. 
Our nonfinancing debt of $14.3 billion was $2 billion lower than September, resulting in a nonfinancing debt-to-cap of just under 50%, 5 points lower than September and, more importantly, 5 points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to a pension remeasurement, a $1.6 billion reduction to equity or about 3 points to the ratio.
Looking at our pension plans. As you know, the U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and the asset mix reflects that, with a relatively low-risk, low-return profile. The result of that is low odds of any required funding in the U.S., regardless of the interest rate environment. Our funding levels remain solid, with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 102% and 98%, respectively, a modest increase from last year. Information on the performance of our retirement-related assets and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts. Importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. 
So now let me spend just a minute on our financing business. As part of our own transformation, we saw an opportunity to drive some operational benefits by changing the structure of our financing business. First, let me say that the structure of the Global Financing segment that we report is unchanged. We have reorganized our client and commercial financing business as a wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM Credit LLC. This combined corporate structure will, over time, meet its funding requirements by issuing debt directly to the market. This will drive operational benefits by consolidating the operations of our financing business. We will issue debt directly out of the new entity and expect the entity to be able to access the capital markets later this year. And we'll increase our financing business leverage from 7:1 to 9:1, which represents an increase of about $600 million in Global Financing debt. But as I said, our Global Financing segment is unchanged and will continue to include our client and commercial financing business as well as our hardware remanufacturing and remarketing business.
So let me wrap this up. We have a very clear point of view on what it takes to be successful with enterprise clients in this new era. I'll shorthand it as cognitive, plus cloud, plus industry. And what differentiates IBM is the ability to bring all 3 together to change real business processes and outcomes. Enterprise clients rely on us to help them run their processes. We have the relationships, we know their process and workflows, and importantly, we have their trust. This incumbency positions us very well to take our clients to the new era. 
In 2016, we continued to make a lot of progress in the transformation of our own business. We had strong growth in our strategic imperatives, cloud, analytics, security and mobile. These offerings generated $33 billion in revenue and now represent over 40% of our revenue. And they're high-value offerings with a gross margin that raises overall IBM.
We also invested at a high level, through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016, we spent nearly $6 billion in R&D, nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures and nearly $6 billion to acquire 15 companies. We're amassing a unique set of assets to build our Cognitive Solutions and cloud platforms, like the digital assets of The Weather Company, health care datasets from Truven and risk and compliance experts of Promontory. In 2016, we continued to remix our skills to new opportunities while continuing to deliver innovation in our more traditional areas like positioning z Systems as the ideal platform for blockchain or Power for cognitive or utilizing our intellectual property partnerships to extend some of our software assets. 
So we'll take all of these capabilities into 2017. Even recognizing the shifts in our industry, some country-specific challenges and opportunities and some macro effects of currency and potential tax reform, as I said upfront, we feel that we're exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it. 
This confidence is reflected in our view of 2017. To simplify, we expect to stay on track in our strategic imperatives. We'll continue to invest at a high level, though, as you saw in the fourth quarter, after ramping investment from 2015 through late 2016, we've wrapped on that higher level. And we expect to grow our pretax income, and while there are a number of scenarios for tax, in all cases, we expect tax to be a year-to-year headwind to our book rate in 2017.
Put it all together and we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $13.80 in 2017. If you remember the first quarter of last year, we had a few larger items in our earnings, but they offset at the net income level. That first quarter was about 17% of our 2016 operating EPS. We expect to benefit from discrete tax again in the first quarter of this year though smaller in size. And like last year, other actions will offset some portion of the benefit. With this, we expect a similar skew for 2017 with about 17% of the full year expectation of $13.80 in the first quarter.
Looking at cash flow for the year. We expect free cash flow realization in excess of 90% of GAAP net income, and we'll return 70% to 80% of our cash flow to shareholders, both in line with our longer-term model.
Bottom line, we feel good about the progress we made in 2016 and our prospects for 2017. And now we'll take your questions.",6171

The clarification is just it would be helpful if you gave a little more insight as to what you're expecting in terms of the range of outcomes for the tax rate both normalized rate and how much discrete items could be in the year and then similar for IP income just because those were so significant in 2016. And then as it relates to my question, which is on Watson, from the outside, it seems this business gets pretty significant share of the press but not contributing to revenue. Do you have visibility yet as to when we should expect an inflection in revenue recognition from Watson? Or should we just not think about this as a contributing factor or moving the needle in our models over the next couple of years?",140

Thanks, Katy. A couple things. On tax, when we look at -- as we said in -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we do see tax as a headwind year-to-year. But remember, we had last year $1 billion -- we won a tax case in Japan, so over $1 billion, which was in last year. That drives, by the way, the bulk of the year-to-year headwind. On a rate basis, we finished -- this year, we said 18% plus or minus 2. We finished kind of at the bottom end of that range in the -- for the full year on an operating base obviously with the -- on an all-in base with that Japan benefit from the first quarter, in there it's much lower, but we finished at the bottom end of that range. When we look at 2017, as I said in the prepared remarks, all scenarios point to a headwind. We're right now thinking it's about 15% plus or minus 3, and the reason we widened the range is because we are getting ready for tax reform here in the U.S. We don't know yet what that looks like. We read the same things you do, but we are going to start now to prepare for tax reform. So we've widened the range this year to 15% plus or minus 3. That doesn't have discretes in it. On IP income, as we've said a number of times, we are trying to rebuild that base of business. It's always been part of our income stream. It is a business where we've now had a fair bit of success in rebuilding it. And while we don't -- we're not relying on a big growth year-to-year, we do have -- in that particular line, a lot of this is already done quite frankly because we have these agreements in place that pay us royalties. And then we have a pretty good pool of opportunities that could get this back to, again, the same level that we printed this year. Again, we're not relying on that to -- within our guidance. Within our guidance, I'd say we could be down year-to-year a little bit. But again, a lot of this is already done, and we have a good pool of opportunities to drive IP again for what will be, what, 18 or 19 years of doing this. So we got, I think, a pretty good track record. And then on Watson, Watson is in -- and you can see it in the solutions software business, which accelerated. Again, our Watson, our solutions software is what's being -- or Watson is what's driving that. Now Watson is a silver thread. It runs through the platform. It runs through Watson Health. It runs through Watson IoT. It's in security now, right. Watson is embedded in security. And as we announced at the end of last year, Watson Financial Services, we'll now embed the regulatory expertise of Promontory into Watson. So Watson will be part of that financial services industry solution content as well. So Watson is firmly, firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those Cognitive Solutions, and you can see all of that in the solutions software performance.",541

I guess, the way I look at free cash flow conversion, as you know, we guide on a conversion metric, but we see free cash flow basically flat year-to-year in '17, not down. Now again, we give a range, and that's consistent with the model we have of being north of 90%, 90% to 100%. But we see free cash flow for the year to be flat. Now within that, as you know, again, we got our money back from Japan last year when we won our tax case. So we've got that as a headwind, and within that -- and we'll overcome that with the rest of the operations. But the other side of this is we're also holding, if you will, an ability to grow our capital investments within that flat as well. So it was not -- I mean, you shouldn't interpret that 90% as a down. We see free cash flow flat with a tax headwind, which we'll overcome, and room to grow CapEx.",175

And I realize you guys have done a lot of investments that offset -- is a driver of organic, but just talk about when do you think gross margins start to stabilize. And at what point do you think, at least on the cognitive side, the access service business starts to become more in line to the cognitive segment margin profile?",95

Okay, sure. So on Cognitive Solutions, it's been a year that you really have to go back to understand where we finished in the fourth, and I'm going to talk specifically about the fourth in a moment. But you have to go back to what we've been talking about within Cognitive Solutions all year. So in the first quarter, we saw the steepest year-to-year decline in margins driven by -- heavily by our investments, heavily by our need to remix our skills and also by -- we had acquisitions. And while currency was a big headwind in dollars for us last year, it was also an impact to our margin. So as we progress through the year, when we get to fourth, on a gross profit margin basis, we were down about 3 points, which I would put in currency and acquisitions is all of that 3. And so on a PTI margin basis in the fourth, we were down about 1 -- less -- about half, a little bit less than half, about 1.4 points. And within that, again, currency and acquisitions drove 3 points. So everything else in Cognitive Solutions within the PTI margin, the mix of the annuity business, the ramp of our as-a-Service business, the benefit we get from our -- licensing our IP and the offsetting royalties that are coming in, everything else improved operating PTI margin in the fourth quarter. And so what you saw in 2016 in cognitive segment margins on PTI was an operating margin that went up pretty dramatically as we went quarter-to-quarter, like, 17 points, right, from first all the way to fourth. And next year, I don't know when currency is going to ramp, but we do know it's much less of a headwind next year than it was this year, at least at current rates. And we also know that we ramp on the acquisitions. So those things that have dragged us -- dragged our margins down are starting to go away. And while gross profit -- we don't see that. I don't see that deteriorating by 3 points like it did in the fourth anymore. And in fact, PTI margins, I think, are much, much more stable going forward, which is what we're assuming. Now they don't have to be flat. We're still going to drive our as-a-Service performance. We are going to continue to drive these IP deals, which throw a little bit of royalty into the GP stream. But I see a much improved cognitive segment PTI margin from what we experienced in the fourth. And again, you saw in the fourth, we ramped on our heavy investment levels here as well.",449

Thanks, Tien-tsin. So there are some really important benefits here as we align kind of the legal and the capital structure of our financing business. That, just by itself, will drive pretty substantial operational benefits. It gives us better capital structure flexibility in each of the countries in which IGF operates. IGF, by the way, doesn't operate in 172 like all of IBM does. It's more like 45, but it allows for better capital structure in that more limited set of countries in which they operate. It gives us better efficiency of cash allocation. So what we're really doing here is we're taking the interest-earning parts of IGF, the client financing and the commercial financing. We've put those into a subsidiary. We'll provide -- be providing more information externally so you can see -- everyone can see what the capacity for them to borrow. And that's really the borrowing capacity of IGF. The remarketing business does not support a borrowing capacity. It's very high margin, it's very high return, but the interest-bearing portion of IGF is really what supports the debt. And so we're going to issue debt directly out of that entity. It'll allow us to add $600 million or so of debt because that portfolio is high enough quality that it can run at higher leverage. That's more -- by the way, more consistent with what we see in other entities of this nature. So we'll run at slightly higher leverage. That'll improve the ROE. That'll free up basically some equity, if you will, that we have in IGF. It'll free up some equity in main line. But it's not a change to -- necessarily to the overall debt levels. It's really a change to IGF and its efficiency, the operational benefits we get and our ability then to pull a little bit of capital out of IGF but also manage it better in which the -- in the countries in which it operates. But again, importantly, the segment that you see won't change. So this really is a change in how we access the capital markets externally.",351

So on a fundamental basis, earnings went from about $14.02 in 2015 to about $12.50 in 2016. So as we look to 2017, you're guiding for an improvement in earnings from $13.50 to $13.80. And you've said tax is going to be a headwind. You've said IP income is not going to help, but if anything, it might hurt. So the last 3 years, you've actually had fundamental erosion if we take out tax and IP in your business, and you're calling for an inflection point in 2017. So I'm wondering if you can talk through what are the key things that drive that improvement. And perhaps you could also be explicit about what your expectation for acquisitions is and their contribution, for restructuring expense and whether that will be a net -- will have any net impact on results and what your assumption is for cash tax versus accrued tax in 2017 as well.",192

Thanks, Toni. So a couple of things. When we entered 2016, as I said earlier on a prior question, we said tax would be 18% plus or minus 2, and we came in, again, at the bottom of the range. And so now when we look at tax, yes, we had $1 billion improvement from Japan, which we are not -- obviously, we're not going to win another tax case in Japan, by the way, but we do have discretes this year. When we look at where we finished, we finished at the bottom of that range. And as I said, with us going into now 15% -- into '17 at a 15% rate plus or minus 3, we have to overcome, if you will, the headwind from the Japan. But we're going to -- as we plan for tax reform, we don't see a fundamentally different operating tax picture than we saw last year in our I&E. We saw an inflection point that's probably -- maybe that's the right way to think about it. We saw an inflection point in intellectual property income this year, and I can tell you that, yes, we see an inflection point in profitability. Our PTI, we expect to improve. That's embedded within our earnings. So we saw an inflection point in IP income, but then you get to the end of the year and you want to take it all out. So we hit an inflection point in IP last year. We did better than we had the prior year, and it's always been a part of our model. And we -- again, we see while it may not continue exactly, we're not relying on all of that for the year. We will have IP income -- a substantial amount of IP income, as we always have for the last, I don't know, 18, 19 years. You have the history as well. So we do see an inflection point in our margin profile. Remember that we have gotten a lot done this year in terms of getting margins stabilized. We see that, for instance, in our infrastructure services business, which grew margins for the year. We did get a ramp, if you will, on the higher levels of investment and spending, and you see that in our Cognitive Solutions and I talked about that earlier. So -- and you see it in our E to R performance on SG&A, for instance, in the fourth quarter alone. So as we get into now -- as we get into 2017 and all of the work we got done, plus we've got a better base on which our as-a-Service margins are still continuing to grow because we're not where we want to be yet, but we did improve throughout the year, we have a momentum, if you will, in our Cognitive Solutions business and again, those are high value. And we'll get all the -- whatever savings, if we have, from workforce rebalancing both -- as we continue to remix our workforce. So yes, we -- I am saying that PTI margin and PTI growth this year is what is implied in our guidance. Now with the tax headwind, it doesn't translate as much to EPS growth, but we do see the inflection points in parts of our business, including our margin profile.",559

So just if you could help us out what's going on under the covers there, why it seems that it should have improved and obviously it didn't and what you think about that going forward.",92

Thanks, Lou. So the dynamics in GBS were similar to what we've talked about in prior quarters. We've said a couple of things. One, we are continuing to remix our skills. And while we have good performance in our strategic imperatives in that -- those digitized offerings, we still do have a pretty large book of business that is in a part of the marketplace that has very heavy price pressure as all of us are competing to get kind of that foothold, if you will, or competing for certain kinds of opportunities on some of these accounts. So we've got price pressure on parts of the business and again, we're remixing our skills, which, as we said, will have an impact, a shorter-term impact on productivity. Now shorter term, we invest in businesses for long, long periods of time. So I don't define shorter term as every 90 days, although this business should start to improve when we -- as we've talked about last time, when we see a couple of things. So the backlog in GBS is down. And so our first focus has to be to take the skills we're building and get a good signings, a good, consistent signings performance in order to grow the backlog. Once you grow the backlog, then obviously you deliver in an efficient and effective way and you start to improve your margins. And we still view GBS as being able to get that done. In fact, we'd say we'll grow signings in the first quarter this year. So maybe we'll start that position now, but we still see this business and these skills as such a key differentiator in the marketplace that we're unwilling, if you will, to reduce our capacity or our capabilities in the marketplace. We really -- this is the third leg, if you will, between cognitive and a robust cloud. Industry skills are going to -- are what brings it all together. So GBS is in a similar dynamic. I do think we'll grow signings in the first, which will be the start to having that business improve. But it's going to take a little while longer to get through these same dynamics of remixing skills and moving our skills away from these heavily price pressured opportunities.",382

Maybe just look at gross margins, do you think gross margins will expand? And if you could just give us a view on the major business segments, where should we expect improvement in PTI margin in 2017?",49
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247701.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. So a couple of things. We have -- as we always do, we have a bunch of scenarios on how a year might fold out -- roll out, right. So I would say that as you pointed out, PTI margin expansion is in every scenario. That's evidenced by the fact that profit is growing. It's implied to grow with a tax headwind and EPS, obviously, with a little bit of growth. So PTI margin growth is in each of the scenarios. GP margin is not necessarily required for us to grow PTI margin. And that's for a couple of -- now I'm not saying that GP is necessarily going to go down, but we can maintain our GP margins. We can even erode a little bit if we want to accelerate or move into as-a-Service even faster. As you saw, we had very good growth in our as-a-Service business in the fourth. Overall, those margins are below our IBM margin. So there's a little bit of margin pressure as you make that shift. But we can deliver '17 -- push as-a-Service margins really hard, either maintain or you can even contract GP margins a little bit and still grow PTI margins given that we've ramped on, again, this heavy level of investment and we've gotten a lot done on structure, both the overall IBM structure, the infrastructure of what runs IBM as well as each of the business have taken another good look at structure. So from a segment perspective, we saw good performance in our Global Technology Services business. When you look at the infrastructure services piece, growth in margins for the full year, and I'd say that we can see opportunity to continue to grow margins there. The technical support services, the TSS business is where the margin pressure was in 2016, but I think we have a way to stabilize that margin performance. It very much is a mix shift from as we drive the multivendor services business in TSS. So margin improvements in the infrastructure services business, I see relatively flat profit margins in Systems. Now we're coming off of a high point in the mainframe. At the end of the cycle, margins tend to be higher. As you go into a new cycle, they tend to be a little bit lower, but we also have an opportunity to improve in the other businesses. So Systems margins, relatively flat. And we see, again, an opportunity to improve margins in GBS. As we get some of the work that I've described done and get kind of the bow or the shift through the way, we can see improvements in GBS. And I talked earlier about Cognitive Solutions, so I won't cover that again. So again, PTI, we do see growing; GP, not necessarily. We don't need GP to grow in order to produce PTI margin growth.",482

I was curious, how much of that did you see last year? How much of it is going to be seen in '17? And how much of that in '17 may you take to the bottom line, because that strikes me that's a big part of this PTI improvement? And I also just wanted to ask, and you might want to actually respond to this, that -- where are you in the innings in your transformation? It's been a number of years now. How far into it are you? And just qualitatively, what's surprised you positively and what's been very difficult to change in terms of changing IBM?",128
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247704.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Okay. Wow, there's a lot there, Steve. So first, on the workforce rebalancing savings, we said for last year, for '16, that we would see a bit more than $500 million and we absolutely got that. And we said we would free up then $2 billion of total spend, some of which will get reinvested, some of which will go to the bottom line. You saw from our view of 2017 now that we've ramped, we're not obviously reinvesting all of that now that we've ramped on our higher levels of spending. So obviously, some of that's going to wind up in the profit. And with mid-single-digit profit growth, it's a fair -- a fair bit drives that profit growth in 2017. In the innings, IBM is always transforming. So I don't know how to pick an inning, other than to say that we have established -- a few years ago, we established this idea that the strategic imperatives were the path for revenue growth to resume and those continue to grow quite well. Then last year we changed the segment structure and said, ""Look, we're going to now report not only more detail on the strategic imperatives, but we're going to talk to you about Cognitive Solutions, which has all the Watson content. We're going to talk to you about a cloud platform business, and we're going to talk to you obviously about the industry dimension."" And so that part of the transformation continues, and I don't think that the transformation of IBM ever ends, quite frankly. We are back now. As we put in our guidance, we are back to our model level of pretax income growth we have in our model right now. Now if you say that pretax income growth or the model -- achieving the model is the definition of when the transformation is done, then I'd say that we see that this year for pretax income. Now we've got a lot of other elements of our financial model as well. We've been returning cash to our shareholders consistently. We have generated our free cash flow as a percentage of our net income has been on model. So we've had a number of elements that are on model. Pretax income growth, I think, is a good one that says this structure, this strategy is working and it will drive the financial model we've set out to achieve, at least on the pretax income growth, which had been missing.",413

Can you give us some thoughts on your expectations for growth in the strategic imperatives and decline in the core business in 2017?,35
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247707.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Sure. Sure, Joe. So we said a few years ago that strategic imperatives would be $40 billion and 40% by 2018. And as you just saw, we finished 2016 when they're 41%. So obviously, we made the mix piece of this early. But from here, if we grow, say, 10% to 11%, we get to 40 by 2018. And so with such a substantial part now of our business at $30-plus billion, with such a substantial part of our business, to grow that at that continued double digit says that we have the right offerings and the right spaces with the right skills to deliver them and that they're robust, powerful solutions. And so we see that kind of growth in order to get to the 40. We still think -- we're quite confident we're ahead actually of track, but we're quite confident in getting to the 40 still. The core business for the rest of the business, if you will, is always -- has a few components in it. One, at our very core, remember that we are delivering productivity to our clients. And so they use that productivity that we deliver to reinvest. And as we've said before, that's the dynamic you see in our revenue stream. We deliver productivity through parts of our business and they reinvest, and that's how you get the revenue dynamic that we have. The core was down double digit 2 years ago and down 9 in the fourth. If you do the math, roughly down 9. And when we get into this year, I'd say that we'll see kind of a similar dynamic, but that's what we're -- that's what is sort of embedded within our guidance for 2017. So continued good performance in the strategic imperatives, continued focus on delivering productivity for our clients, and we'll have that revenue dynamic into 2017.",311

One is to append your last answer. So if you're growing 11% in the strategics and you're pretty close to 50-50, I think you're at 44% in the fourth quarter and the core is declining 9, I mean, wouldn't that imply that we're reasonably close to getting to a crossover on the top line?",65

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247712.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,35,"So when you say we're reasonably -- I mean, we were down -- on a constant-currency basis, we were down 70 basis points in the fourth. So I think we're reasonably close. We're reasonably close in the third. Yes, this is the structure we're in, and we're focused on driving value in those strategic imperatives, not just grabbing a little bit of revenue to have some math work out differently. And our margins in the strategic imperatives continue to be higher than overall IBM and higher obviously than the core. So our focus on delivering value hasn't changed. And whenever that crossover point happens to be, we're already close. So when you say wouldn't it imply -- yes, we're close. We were close in the fourth, but we're focused on delivering value and for 2017, we're focused on, obviously, PTI margin expansion.",143
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247713.0,Question,David Grossman,,Analysts,36,"Right. And the second piece is if historical trend repeats itself, you're due for a mainframe product cycle on the back half of the year. And I believe the way you break it out, at least some of that mainframe revenue is in strategic imperatives. So that said, how should we be thinking of the potential financial impact of the next mainframe cycle vis-à-vis prior cycles, particularly given some of the secular shifts that you've talked about in your prepared remarks and the response to some of the other questions?",90
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2017",2017-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4425.0,1114439.0,46247714.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,37,"Sure. So yes, I mean, we -- if you follow a mainframe cycle, then it would say some time late this year we'd have another mainframe and -- but again, we wouldn't see the impact of that until late in the year. What drives the mainframe, as it always has, is our ability to make it relevant to the workloads that our clients need. So when we were together -- when we announced the last mainframe and 2 years ago, we talked a lot about the shift to mobile. We talked a lot about security. And we talked within those 2 elements, and there's a lot more to it, but within those 2 elements, we talked about how the mainframe was built particularly with those 2 kinds of workloads in mind. And that drove the growth we saw in the mainframe through the cycle. That's still, by the way, part of the growth we see in a mainframe and it's still why big enterprises continue to put their most important work on mainframes. Now, the set of workloads that are going to drive the next incantation of the mainframe are going to be things like blockchain and so all of that is still ahead of us. We added, and we said in the prepared remarks, we added a number of new clients throughout the cycle, but we added more again in the fourth quarter as well. And while I haven't talked to every one of them, I think what they're thinking, what many of them are thinking is, yes, I need mobile and, yes, security is more important than ever, but I also need to be ready for the next workload drivers. And blockchain is a good example of a workload driver that is ideal -- ideally suited for the most robust enterprise platform there is. So I think that if I had to pick just one that drives the mainframe, blockchain is -- would be my first -- top of my list for what drives the next mainframe cycle.
So let me wrap up the call by saying, again, that we're really pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and how we're positioned for 2017. Of course, there's plenty for us to work on. We're not confused by that, but we are looking forward to continuing this dialogue at our investor briefing later in the quarter. 
So with that, thank you for joining the call.",407

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262937.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered over $18 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of $2.1 billion and operating earnings per share of $2.38, which is up year-to-year. This is in line with the view we provided back in January and keeps us on track to our full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow.
In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong performance in our strategic imperative, with revenue up 13% at constant currency. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. 
Our cloud offerings were up 35% this quarter, led by Cloud as a Service, which was up over 60%. Analytics, the largest of our strategic areas, was up 7%, mobile was up over 20%, and security, up 10%. We also continued to deliver core capabilities to our clients running mission-critical systems and processes. Many of these products provide the foundation of hybrid environments, enabling our clients to get more value from their on-premise data and application. Some of these key franchises are growing, like WebSphere, while others are declining as they are in declining markets, but all are high-value. 
We've been very clear that to be successful with enterprise clients and to solve real problems, you need to bring together cognitive solutions on cloud platforms and create industry-specific solutions. And so we've been focused on building a cognitive and cloud platform and amassing the best industry skills and capabilities, all while maintaining our focus on delivering higher-value solutions.
As part of the transformation, we've made significant investments and shifted resources. This level of investment and the longer return profile of the Cloud as a Service businesses are reflected in our margins. Our foundation is now solidly in place, and while the investments will continue, our focus shifts to improving the returns on these investments by building scale and realizing operating efficiencies, keeping us on track to our full year objectives. 
And so our first quarter results once again reflect the success we're having in our strategic imperatives. We grew 13% in the quarter, which was compared to our strongest growth quarter last year. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives together generated nearly $34 billion in revenue and now represent 42% of our total revenue. 
With over $14.5 billion in cloud revenue over the last 12 months, we're the global leader in enterprise cloud. We play an important role in running the critical processes of the largest enterprises. And so it's not surprising that each of the 10 largest global banks, 9 of the top 10 retailers and 8 of the top 10 airlines are now IBM Cloud as a Service customers. 
At our investor briefing last month, we spent the day showing how we've transformed IBM into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company and the importance and value of delivering industry-specific solutions. We talked about the differentiation of our cognitive and cloud platform through specific Watson technologies, through our data-first approach and our enterprise-strength cloud. We bring all of this together in one architecture, and we're providing highly differentiated solutions by industry and scaling these solutions. I'm not going to recap all of that here, but what I want to focus on today is some of the progress we made specifically in the first quarter, with our solutions, our clients and our partners. 
In the quarter, we extended the reach of Watson and the IBM Cloud through our partnership with Visa, where Watson IoT turns cars, appliances and other connected devices into potential points of sale; through our alliance with Samsung, where The Weather Company will be the default weather app on new Samsung devices, powering the weather experience for tens of millions of devices by the end of the year; and through our engagement with H&R Block, where we're now embedded in 10,000 branches, enabling 9 million filers to benefit from the Watson-enhanced expertise of H&R Block's tax professionals. 
In the first quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce to deliver joint solutions designed to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter, faster decisions across sales, service and marketing. We also partnered with Wanda, one of the largest commercial and enterprise groups in Asia, to bring public cloud services to China. We're building emerging technologies on the IBM Cloud like blockchain and quantum. In blockchain, we had over 40 new engagements in the quarter and are working on over 400 more. And as we've discussed in the past, the opportunities span multiple industries. This quarter, we announced that we're working with Maersk to use blockchain to transform the global shipping supply chain; partnered with Northern Trust to launch blockchain for the private equity market; and are collaborating with the FDA to explore how a blockchain can benefit public health.
In the first quarter, we also announced the first commercial quantum system. IBM Q systems are designed to tackle problems that are beyond the reach of today's computing systems. These are just a few of the examples of the reach and the scale we're building with cognitive and cloud. And I'll highlight a few more in the segment discussions, but first, I'll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $18.2 billion, which is down 2%. Currency was once again a headwind to growth, fairly consistent with the impact in the fourth quarter. At current spot rates, that headwind will be more substantial over the next couple of quarters. On a geographic basis, last quarter I talked about the impact of macro and geopolitical trends on some countries' performance. In Europe, much of this continued into the first quarter, with declines in the U.K. and Germany, in particular, putting pressure on our growth.
Our gross margin performance continues to reflect investments across our business and the mix to as-a-service businesses. I'll talk about additional drivers in the segment discussions.
Looking at our expense. Pretax profit, tax rate and cash flow metrics, the year-to-year dynamics reflect some unique items in last year's first quarter results. A year ago, we had charges that impacted our expense and pretax income by nearly $1.5 billion, including a workforce rebalancing charge of $1 billion. In the first quarter of this year, our workforce rebalancing charge was about $170 million. So the year-to-year impact of a lower level of workforce rebalancing accounts for 11 points of the 20% reduction in total expense.
Our expense also includes a higher level of IP income, reflecting the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. I'll come back to this a little later. 
And so our operating pretax profit of $2.1 billion was up over 50% this quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 15%, plus or minus 3 points. We also said we'd have a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of $400 million to $500 million, and in the quarter, the net benefit was just under $500 million. This is far less than the discrete benefit we had last year of $1.2 billion associated with a Japan tax refund. And so tax was the substantial headwind to our net income and EPS growth in the quarter. 
We generated $2.3 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 12.4%, which is up 30 basis points. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was up 1% to $2.38. 
We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down year-to-year by the amount of last year's Japan tax refund. As you know, there's a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. That's why it makes sense to look at cash realization on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow was 90% of our GAAP net income.
Looking at our segments. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3% year-to-year, and pretax income was up double digits. Our Solutions Software revenue was up 5%, while Transaction Processing Software was down 1%. Within Solutions Software, growth was again led by offerings in analytics, including our Watson-related offerings and security. We saw strong SaaS performance, with strong double-digit growth again this quarter. I'll share more on our progress, starting with analytics. 
We saw good growth in on-premise databases and data warehousing, which includes DB2, Informix and Netezza. Content and integration offerings were also up this quarter as data ingestion is an important initial step in a cognitive journey. As part of that journey, our Watson platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. The Watson platform, built on the IBM Cloud, underpins our AI strategy and is a fast and easy way to embed cognitive into our clients' workflows. 2 great examples are Salesforce and H&R Block. H&R Block went from an idea, to fundamentally changing the client engagement experience with Watson, redesigning business processes and deploying a cognitive solution across 10,000 branches in just a matter of months. 
Building on the platform, we've differentiated with industry expertise across verticals. In Watson Health, we had strong growth, particularly in oncology, government and life sciences, as we move to scaling Watson in health care. Out of the top 25 life sciences companies, nearly half are either using or implementing our cognitive offerings. In an environment of increased regulatory pressure, cognitive helps to expedite the time to bring drugs to market and to monitor them once in the market. 
This quarter, we also introduced new cognitive offerings such as Watson Imaging Clinical Review and infused cognitive into existing offerings. For example, in Watson Care Manager, we're bringing organic and acquired content together to build a cloud-based offering that addresses integrated care. We're then adding cognitive capabilities to extract trends and provide actionable insights. This is the kind of work we can do with our industry-specific development skills. 
We also had good growth in Watson IoT, where we added over 50 new clients to our IoT platform again this quarter. And we're incorporating new capabilities into the IoT platform, such as the Visa payment services mentioned earlier. Clients are co-locating for innovation at our Munich center, and the number of developers on our IoT platform had strong double-digit growth. Watson for financial services also contributed to growth this quarter.
Here, we're leveraging the skills we acquired through the acquisition of Promontory, the world's leading regulatory compliance consulting firm, to develop cognitive offerings in areas like regulatory change management. It is a space ideally suited for cognitive because it's expertise- and domain-driven. 
Banks aren't going to automate core regulatory processes with publicly available data alone. By combining industry experts with cognitive capabilities and leveraging industry-specific client data, we're building solutions that solve the problems in the industry. Remember, it matters who trained your AI platform, on what data and who owns the insights. By pulling all of this together, IBM will be well positioned as the leader in the reg tech marketplace. 
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven again by areas such as data security and Security Intelligence. We've had strong traction in Watson for cyber security since launching in February and deployed it in over 50 customers globally. And we embedded cognitive into another offering, MaaS360 Advisor, using machine learning to analyze and protect devices. We complement our software offerings with security services to offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Together with our security services, we outpaced the market. 
Turning to Transaction Processing Software. Performance improved sequentially, driven by our z Systems middleware and storage middleware. While the overall business is declining, we have some areas that are growing, like software-defined storage. Other parts are high-value and running mission-critical workloads for our clients, but the growth profile is stable to declining. 
Turning to profit. Cognitive Solutions gross margin is down, driven by continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Roughly 1/4 of the Cognitive Solutions business is now services and SaaS offerings, which currently have a different margin profile. Pretax income is up for the segment and improving year-to-year even when you adjust for the lower rebalancing charges. This segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded this quarter. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter, we're embedding cognitive into more offerings, scaling platforms and building high-value vertical solutions. 
Global Business Services was down 2%, which is a 2-point improvement in the trajectory from last quarter. Strategic imperatives grew double digits, led by our cloud and mobile practices. Overall, we had modest growth in signings this quarter, driven by our digital offerings. However, the GBS backlog is still declining. As we talked about last quarter, we need the growth from our new offerings to drive consistent signings growth to improve the trajectory of the GBS backlog.
Consulting revenue was down 2%, improving nearly 3 points from last quarter's performance. We have good growth in IBM iX, our digital design practice, that helps our clients build new customer and employee engagement models around digital. We've built a robust network of 35 design studios around the world, where clients co-create with GBS consultants in digital strategy, design and mobile experience. We're redesigning our clients' workflows through integrated solutions and a robust set of enterprise-grade mobility applications. This quarter, we announced agreements with BP Castrol, Bell Canada and Santander, to name a few. 
In Consulting, we continue to shift resources to our cognitive services, advanced analytics and digital platforms and away from the more traditional areas, including consulting for on-premise enterprise applications and some migration and process reengineering services. Our consulting revenue reflects this shift. 
Application management was flat year-to-year, and it's been relatively stable over the last year. We're innovating our clients' platforms, helping them migrate to new cloud architectures, increasing their speed and agility and ultimately improving their competitiveness.
Turning to profit. We continue to invest in our strategic imperatives and build out our practices around cognitive, cloud, mobile and digital design. Over the last year, we've added nearly 8,000 resources to these businesses. There also continue to be accounts where we are investing more to deliver on important client commitment. And in parallel, we're streamlining the practice infrastructure and driving efficiencies in our delivery model through new methods, solutions and project management approaches. As we talked about at our investor briefing, GBS has aligned and focused its capabilities around 3 growth platforms. The first is digital strategy and iX, where we help clients imagine what their businesses should like in the digital world and then execute a road map to build and migrate their capabilities to get them there.
The second is cognitive process transformation, where we help clients adapt their core processes and integrate cognitive technology to gain insights, drive efficiencies and create new business models. 
The third is cloud application innovation, where we modernize their systems by putting in place new cloud-centric application architectures tailored to their business and their industry. With deep industry capabilities, we're executing a strategy that is client value-led and powered by IBM assets and leading third-party platforms. We've refocused our practice model to ensure we're building deep skills in the right areas and increasing our sales and delivery capacity. We're starting to see the benefit of this focus and are expecting improved performance over the course of the year. 
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue was down 2%. We continue to have strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives, particularly in cloud, which was up over 40%, as we build out hybrid cloud environments for our client. As enterprises move to the cloud, they need help in managing the complexity of integrating multiple environments. We're able to move these enterprises to the cloud in a way that leverages their critical data and IT investment. Our Cloud as a Service revenue for this segment grew over 50%, and our annual as-a-service run rate was $5.7 billion. 
Infrastructure services was down 2%. As you know, this is a business model where we drive productivity for our client. We orchestrate disparate systems and optimize IT operations. We help clients manage their hybrid cloud environments, which can include multiple cloud platforms, on-premise data centers and mobile environment. When we deliver this productivity to our clients, that's less revenue for us, but then we look to create new revenue streams by moving them to new areas, acquiring new scope and bringing on new clients. So our business model has always been to deliver productivity for our clients and then grow by expanding our scope of work and adding new clients to the platform. 
While we had some substantial relationships lined up, we did not get them closed by quarter end, which impacted revenue in the period. The revenue trajectory also reflects that a couple of large clients brought their operations in-house due to regulatory and other unique circumstances. These clients remain on IBM platforms and will continue to be a trusted partner. 
Turning to technical support services. Revenue was down 2%. We continue to shift more to our multivendor support services, which again grew this quarter. We provide end-to-end support both inside and outside the data center, including, for example, IoT environment. 
Integration software was down 3%. We grew in our hybrid integration software that connects and integrates applications, data and processes across on-premise and cloud environments. In addition, WebSphere Application Server grew for the third consecutive quarter, demonstrating the importance of middleware in public, private and hybrid environments. We declined in our on-prem dev ops tools and IT services management software. While some clients prefer to keep this work in-house, these kinds of workloads continue to shift to cloud. We're seeing this as Bluemix, our cloud dev ops platform, continues to expand. 
Looking at profit. Gross profit margin was down, while PTI margin for the segment was up 5 points year-to-year. This quarter, we had a lower level of workforce rebalancing, and we recognized savings from productivity actions, including last year's transformation action. Much of this was reinvested in new and existing skills. We are investing as we move to a Watson-based cognitive delivery model. Through this delivery model, we're able to manage complex, hybrid cloud environments and provide more insights into infrastructure that is always on, available everywhere and of course, secure. 
In infrastructure services, we're constantly managing resources and investment across our portfolio, and the combination of the winding down of some contracts, signings delays and some investment ahead of those signings impacted our profit in the quarter. 
Finally, in TSS, we're shifting more to multivendor services. And in integration software, we're mixing more to SaaS, which impacts margins in the near term.
In summary, when you look at our performance in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, our clients need help moving to the cloud and managing the complexity of their hybrid cloud environments, and we continue to see strong growth in cloud and our as-a-service revenue. Our middleware also continues to be important in these environments. Our business model is one where we're constantly delivering productivity for our clients. This is what makes us the market leader. The profit cycle requires that we invest ahead to provide the scale and efficiency that our clients cannot achieve on their own. These dynamics impacted revenue and margin this quarter. 
As we signed the contracts that didn't close in March and yield some operational efficiencies, we're expecting better performance in this business in the second half. 
Our Systems revenue reflects declines in z Systems and Power, indicative of where we are in the product cycles, while storage grew after repositioning for flash across our portfolio. Systems gross margin was down year-to-year, with declines across z Systems, Power and storage as we address market shifts and product transitions. 
In z Systems, the mainframe continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform that is critical to our clients' needs, addressing both existing and new workloads. We added 7 new clients in the quarter and 87 since the beginning of this cycle. We also had 5 major financial services sector wins this quarter with existing clients as well as several blockchain engagements. Our revenue and margin performance for the quarter reflects the fact that we are 9 quarters into the product cycle, and we expect the new mainframe late in the year. 
Power declined, which reflects our changeover to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high-value but declining UNIX market. Linux workloads again had double-digit growth, outpacing the market. We're the underdog here, and we have a 3% share, so there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. 
Our expanded Linux offerings, Power on Linux (sic) [ Linux on Power ], are on a path to double revenue this year. And HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success. By contrast, in UNIX, declines are driven by our mid-range and low-end systems. Power, while critical for cloud and cognitive workloads, continues to be impacted by shifting our platform from UNIX to Linux, both in revenue and margins. 
Storage hardware was up 7% this quarter, led by double-digit growth in our all-flash array offering. Flash contributed to our storage revenue growth in both mid-range and high end. In storage, we continue to see the shift in value towards software-defined environments, where we continue to lead the market. We again had double-digit revenue growth in software-defined storage, which was not reported in our Systems segment. Storage software now represents more than 40% of our total storage revenue. 
Storage gross margins are down as hardware continues to be impacted by price pressure. 
To summarize Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by expected cycle declines in z Systems and Power, mitigated by storage revenue growth. We continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities, which address changing workloads. 
While we're facing some shifting market dynamics and ongoing product transitions, our portfolio remains uniquely optimized for cognitive and cloud computing. New systems' product introductions later in the year will drive improved second half performance as compared to the first.
I want to spend a minute on our IP income and put our recent performance into context. Our investment in research and development generates a significant amount of intellectual property, and we have a number of different ways we monetize it. Keep in mind that the vast majority of our IP is monetized through revenue streams, with only a small portion through IP income. 15 years ago or so, much of our IP was associated with our semiconductor manufacturing and design business. At the time, in addition to licensing some of the IP, we used joint development agreements to deal with the economics of our manufacturing scale. These partners essentially helped that scale issue. Since then, our strategy has changed, which resulted in a different mix of business. We continue to have joint development and technology licensing agreements, though fewer. Now clients see the value in our IP, but it requires continuous innovation to stay in high-value spaces. 
And so more recently, we're forming IP partnerships to enable ongoing innovation in our IP while allocating our development resources to where we see the best opportunities for us. In these partnerships, we license, not sell, our source code to a technology or services partner, who assumes the development mission and invests to innovate and build new functionality, enhancing the value of the asset, which reinforces and supports our revenue stream. We retain the ownership of the IP and the revenue streams and pay a royalty to the partner for the development mission. And as the partner sells to their clients, they pay a royalty back to IBM from the revenue they receive. The benefits of these IP partnerships to us include the prioritization of our development resources, the continued innovation for our clients based on our high-value assets and the creation of additional channels, which can expand the client base. 
So to sum it up, our ability to monetize IP is driven by the amount of IP that we create, which is substantial, not whether a transaction occurs in a particular period. Because our IP is high-value and relevant to our clients, it is attractive to a broad range of technology and services partners who can build solutions around the core asset. We had 3 new IP partnership agreements in the first quarter and now 19 over the last 2 years. To put that in perspective, we've licensed, on a nonexclusive basis, about 1% of our software code base in these agreements to date, and we're generating more IP every year than we're licensing. So we have a lot of opportunity in this area alone. But as I said earlier, why and how we choose to monetize our IP, for example, whether to address scale issues or resource optimization, reflects our business strategy, and so the opportunities and the models will evolve. 
So now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and we invested over $800 million in capital expenditures, particularly in our Watson and cloud platform areas as well as in support of our Services and Systems businesses. And so our free cash flow was $1.1 billion. Over the last year, our cash realization rate is 90%. Excluding the benefit of last year's tax refund, free cash flow is flat year-to-year. And within that, working capital contributed to our cash flow performance, driven by strong cash collections.
Our first quarter free cash flow generation is in line with historical trends, and we remain on track to deliver a level of free cash flow consistent with last year. 
Looking at uses of cash in the quarter. We returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders, about half through dividends and half through share repurchases. We bought back over 7 million shares, and at the end of the first quarter, we had $3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $10.7 billion in cash and total debt of $42.8 billion. 2/3 of our debt was in support of our financing business, which now includes the increase in leverage related to our client and commercial financing business, IBM Credit. The leverage in this business is now 9:1, which, as I described in January, translates to an increase of just over $600 million in Global Financing debt. 
The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment-grade, which is flat versus December and 1 point better than a year ago. More information on our financing business is provided in the supplemental charts in the backup. 
Our nonfinancing debt was $14.3 billion, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 48%, which is 1 point lower than December. Debt-to-cap is down 14 points year-to-year, as you'll recall, that we front end-loaded our debt issuance just last year. Our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. 
Let me wrap up by talking about how we see the balance of the year, starting with the progression in the first half and then drivers of our second half performance. As you know, we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. Last year, the sequential improvement was significant because of the charges in the first quarter. Adjusting for these outsized charges, we increased our operating pretax profit by an average of $800 million from first to second over the last couple of years. We see a similar level of sequential improvement this year, which means we would finish the first half at about 37% of our full year, at least, operating EPS expectation. 
Now every year is different, and when we look at that 37% attainment compared to history, you'll see it's a few points below the last few years. So I'll spend a minute on why this year, the first and second half dynamics will be different and why we remain comfortable with our full year expectation. To do that, I'll give a couple of examples of things that we know and things that we expect. 
We know that we'll have a new Systems product later in the year, and this will drive a significant improvement in gross profit from first half to second half. Related to that, in the second half, we'll have the investment ramp behind us, so we'll also benefit from lower Systems development spending in the second half relative to the first. 
We also know that we'll wrap on last year's larger acquisitions. They will be less dilutive to profit in the second half as we continue to ramp revenue and realize some operational synergies. 
Then there are a couple of things that we expect, particularly in our Services businesses. We expect that Global Technology Services will sign a few of the larger contracts that didn't close in the first quarter. And that, together with the cost savings and the yield on some of the investments we've been making, will improve the first to second half profit dynamics. 
In Global Business Services, our trajectory is starting to improve, and we expect this to continue throughout the year. We also expect currency to be a headwind, and we've put a view of that into the supplemental slides. 
The translation of our pretax profit to net income will depend on the mix of business, and the operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15%, plus or minus 3 points. As always, this is without discrete items. 
So put all of that together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow that's consistent with last year. 
And with that, we'll take your questions.",4986

Should we expect any more PTI improvement over the course of this year, given that the discrete tax benefit was $500 million? You can pretty much get to your guidance from those 2 elements. I'm not sure if there's more discrete items yet to come. But conceptually, is there more PTI benefit yet to come? Or have we seen the PTI benefit already flow through?",87

Thanks, Wamsi. The first thing I'll say is I apologize for my voice. So if I sound kind of croaky, I got a bit of a cold here. But hopefully, you can understand. So with regard to what we see from here out, as you noted, we got about $700 million in our guidance on a full year basis. We did about $700 million in the first. The thing I'd add is that we don't know what that mix is going to be. It's 15, plus or minus 2 points. So if you were to take that range, we either have another couple hundred to go if it comes in from a high-tax area, or we're already [ over-solved ] by a few hundred. So either way, you're in that about that right range. Now we have a lot of work underway to drive productivity in our Services business. We talked a bit about that in the prepared remarks. We still expect to get the growth out of the acquisitions that we spent some money on. So there is a lot more, obviously, within the dynamics of our business from here to the end of the year. But if you just wanted to look at those 2 line items, then yes, either we have a little bit left to go if it comes in at a higher-tax mix, or we've [ over-solved ] already. But yes, that's the -- what the guidance implies.",245

You also talked, essentially guided to GBS margin improvement for the full year. And when you step back and look at gross margins, which is more of a clean read on your profitability, not influenced by workforce rebalancing and IP income, those declines accelerated this quarter in all of those businesses. So the question is, do you still expect that we can start to see stability and even inflection in any of those businesses this year? Or is that further out?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262944.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"So thanks, Katy. So a couple of things. When we look at -- well, we pretty much look at every year, one quarter is the low point in GP margin. That's always true. And then we build sequentially from there. I think what I would expect this year in that build sequentially, I do expect, as we said in the prepared remarks, I do expect the Services units to start to drive sequential improvement in that business. Now some have longer to go, more progress to make, if you will. As we noted, GBS, with the declining revenue and the impact of margins, we are still -- we believe that's a business that can grow. The path to growth is what we described, which is consistent signings growth. We'll get to backlog growth, which will drive revenue growth. So all of that we still think we have ahead of us. We did get signings growth in the first quarter. It's 2%, but we got signings growth. And so we'll continue to build that business back. And then in GBS specifically, the margins in the new strategic imperative work, the margins in the area that, that business is moving to remain better than the margins in the places they are coming from. So yes, we have to realize the productivity at the overall model level, but we are seeing margin opportunities in those new areas in GBS. And we would expect to continue to make progress. But again, in total, the margin picture on a sequential basis, as we always do, we'll grow from first to second, third and fourth as well. And depending on the mix of business, that growth that we typically see from first to fourth could be 3, 4 points higher, and it's been as high as 10 points in some years. Now we'll be within that range some place by the time we get out of the fourth, but the first quarter is always the low point in the year.",334

Could you talk about, in dollars, are the investments that you're making into the strategic imperatives flattening out? Should we look for less growth year-over-year in those investments? Are they actually becoming flat? And is there a point in the next couple of years where you could even see them decline year-over-year to help your margins?",82

So a couple of things. One, when we said we would expect -- where the bow of the ship gets through the wave, that was a year-to-year statement. And so now with those acquisitions, for instance, in our run rate, the dollar is -- the dollar level is at an elevated amount. And so the year-on-year impact is diminished, if you will. Now those -- all of those businesses need continued investment. And for IBM, what it's always been about for us is shift as much as it is adding to that pie. So I think the adding to the pie now is behind us, if you will, and the shift will continue. So we'll continue to invest heavily in the strategic imperative, but it won't represent the same growth that what we've -- as what we've seen in the past now that they're in our model.",150

I just wanted to confirm and clarify how you're getting to your full year $13.80 target. So for Q2, I think given that you expect 37% of EPS in the first half, that would point to EPS of about $2.73. I think consensus is $3.17, so well below Street expectations, which means that you have to be well above Street expectations for the second half. I'm wondering if you can also clarify what you're assuming on IP licensing for the year. It was up dramatically in the first quarter. I think you said it would be about flat year-over-year, so that implies the rest of the year, IP licensing is going to be declining and therefore, a year-over-year headwind. Is that the right way we should think about it? And if your IP licensing or your discrete tax benefits are significantly higher than you think today, will you be adjusting your guidance accordingly?",154
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262950.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"So a couple of things, Toni. One, we're not adjusting our guidance. We've reaffirmed that we see an at least $13.80 number for the year. And we also see free cash flow flat, roughly flat, as we said, so same guidance as we talked about in January. And quite frankly, from my perspective, the quarter played out pretty much as we expected, other than we thought we had a couple of more deal -- a couple of more signings relationships in Services that we could have gotten done. But by and large, the quarter played out as we expected, and we've maintained our guidance. In the prepared remarks, Toni, we started to put together some of the things that we know and some of the things that we expect. And I think that framework is kind of how I think about it. Now as you know, we have a lot of scenarios around guidance and what might happen, but let's go through a couple of the things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. First, the Systems products -- product announcement have kind of a double impact. One, you have to ramp investment ahead of the revenue in order to get that system ready. That's the period we're in now and will be in through the first half. Once we get the Systems announced and out the door, then we start getting revenue and you get the -- so you get the double benefit. You get GP dollars, and you get a lower spending in order to -- because you don't have the ramp anymore. So that has a pretty profound impact on the first to second half. We also talked about getting the acquisitions further embedded. Now we do a lot of acquisitions. There's obviously opportunity to drive investment in those, but we also have a lot of opportunity to realize efficiencies in how we run. So we see an improvement from first to second half -- continued improvement, first to second half, as we ramp those new solutions around those acquisitions as well as get some synergies from the way we run the place. In our Services business, as we mentioned, we see an improvement as we go through the year, both in the revenue trajectory and in the margin profile, quite frankly. We've got a lot of work to drive productivity in our Services business, both in GTS and GBS, and it sits kind of across that delivery platform. We think there's a lot of opportunity to drive improvement as we get into the second half. And then IP income, similar to how we described it in January, we said we have a bunch of scenarios around IP income. We see enough opportunity to be flat year-to-year, but our guidance didn't rely on it year-to-year. So to your point, if we're flat versus, excuse me, versus -- here's where my voice starts to go, Toni, I apologize. If we're flat relative to -- for the full year and we were up a bit in the first quarter, does that imply down? Yes, that's kind of how we expected the year to play out. And in fact, we said that based on what you described, it could be a bigger headwind than what you described because not all of our scenarios have flat. Some of them -- we had a, like I said, quite a good year in the second half -- quite a good second half of last year in IP income. And so that could be down a bit, but again, we got a lot of scenarios. So the year comes together, I think, because we do have a dramatically different profile in the second versus the first. We included the framing, if you will, of where we finished the first half because not every year plays out the same way, and I think it's important to understand the dynamics. But no change to our guidance, and we still see the year playing out as we did in the first quarter.",675

So thanks, Tien-tsin. These are not macro, so I'll talk about GTS specifically. And you know quite well the nature of the work we do with our clients. We are running the hearts and lungs of our clients' businesses. And so obviously, when you run hearts and lungs, you're not running toward a 90-day schedule. There's nobody, by the way, that's in the room with you other than the client. Nobody has the breadth of capabilities that we have. So our clients move at a pace that reflects the importance of the work we do. And at the same time, add into that the steps required, for instance, regulatory approval, right? We've got a lot of banking customers or a lot of customers in regulated industries. And so the signings delays weren't -- were not at all macro-driven. This is -- these are deep, deep partnerships with our clients that require careful planning, careful execution, and they're not going to move on a 90-day cycle. In GBS, again, I don't think we need an improved macro environment for GBS. In fact, one could argue that GBS will do better when clients are more focused on -- or more focused on how to move to the future or more focused -- or put under more pressure, if you will. So the transformation that GBS is going through is driven by their ability to rescale in the new areas. And we've put quite a lot of people into GBS, focused on these new practices that we have. The results that we see as the teams move into those new practices are very positive. So no, this is not at all macro. On GTS, it is, again, because the relationships with these clients are so vital to how their organizations run and are never going to move on a 90-day calendar. And GBS, I think, is demonstrating now that as it moves into the future, it can do even better.",328

And can you maybe just kind of talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure in the market because you've previously called that out several times but didn't this time?",88
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262956.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Yes, sure. So the -- there is -- I wouldn't say there's anything macro. And the 2 instances that we mentioned about people bringing -- or companies bringing this in-house, very unique circumstances. And I think when I describe it, which I will, I think you'll agree that this is sort of unique. So for instance, we have a client in Germany. It was renewed. It was a -- that was a 5-year deal renewed for another 5 years. And there is a rule, there's a law in Germany that this particular type of client cannot renew the same contract twice. Just can't. And so they had to bring it back in-house due to regulatory reasons. We will still -- they took the people, by the way. They were all in a structure that allowed them to take the people back. They still run their IBM mainframe, so we're still partners with them on the infrastructure that they run. But that's again, highly unique, I am not making a macro statement. And in the other case, again, highly unique to the client situation. They had a plan in their industry to split 2 businesses. And so they were heading down the path of having 2 businesses with 2 infrastructures. We had them, by the way, both of them. And then the market, if you will, they made a judgment based on the market that they were just going to take one of those businesses and sort of wind it down. So they just had no need, if you will, to have a big infrastructure around that particular business. So very unique. Not at all, what I would call, macro. And then on pricing pressure, the nature of these relationships, again, as I mentioned earlier, these are substantial relationships that are running the very core of what these companies need. And the -- if I had to -- again, these are complex, but if I had to simplify it, they're asking us to move them into the future, to move into cloud, to give them the agility and the security and the mobility that they see their competitors have. So there is -- there are not -- there's nobody in the room with us when we go in for those calls. And if they want to pursue that path and if they think there's -- that suits their business model, then they're talking to us, and we'll make those deals happen. But it's not a macro statement. It's very much about our ability to deliver the future to them and whether or not that suits the way they're thinking about their business at that particular time.",445

I realize these margins will improve from Q1 to Q4. But at what point, I guess, do you see gross margins starting to stabilize or the year-over-year declines start to abate for the company? And any way to think about what the cost-saving benefits -- that cost-saving benefits that you have expected for 2017?",75
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262959.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Sure, Amit. A couple of things. One, we are seeing the savings, if you will, of what we were able to start to transform last year and the actions we took. Now remember, at that time we talked about 1Q '16, so a year ago, we talked about how there was some -- some measure of that was to reduce capacity. And a lot of that, by the way, that capacity reduction is -- was to get our teams back together into co-located offices, where they could operate in more agile environments. And it was to reduce the number of sites, if you will, at which we had people and couldn't collaborate properly. So there were some measure of what was reduced capacity. But the bulk of what we wanted to do was to revitalize skills as we always do. We're always revitalizing our skills. So we see the benefit of that in the new skill mix that we have. We see the benefit of that, for instance, in GBS, growing signings in the first quarter. Now there is productivity that we'd see in the SG&A line because while we're investing more for development, our SG&A spending is down. And that was, again, not only the reduced capacity, but it's us being more efficient at how we operate. From a gross profit margin perspective, we are a high-value -- we have a high-value model, as you know. And so one of the things we are always looking at is are the places we're going to still more valuable and higher margin than the places we're coming from. And the strategic imperatives, as we've talked about in the past, have a higher margin profile than the core, if you will. That shouldn't surprise anyone. I think that's why our investors expect us to invest into those new areas as opposed to just going to chase some lower-margin content, and we still see that now. It's been true since we've been talking about the strategic imperatives, and it remains true that the margins in those areas continue to be higher. So I think that I still view the opportunity for us in gross margin is going to look -- gets better because, again, the places we're moving to is better than where we're coming from.",383

What are the main variables that will dictate whether the imperatives grow to over 50% of revenue and begin to more than compensate for the declines in the legacy core?",57
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262962.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Sure, David. So a few things. First, and we talked about this a little bit in the prepared remarks, and I think it's important that the legacy core is a business that we're constantly reinventing. It's not something that we are underinvesting. It's not something that we don't like. We really like this business. It is very high-value. And some of that content sure sits in declining markets, so it has declining opportunity, but that's high-value. And then as we talked about in the prepared remarks, some of those businesses, like WebSphere Application Server, is growing. It's in a growing market, and we grow. So the core is -- and I know you didn't say it this way, but the core, I just want to make sure everyone's clear, is made up of a lot of different things. And included in that core, if you will, is we've got part of our Power business, we've got some of our mainframe business. We're just not in the right time of the cycle for that core part -- for those parts of the core to grow. We will get to that part of the cycle when it grows. So then from the high-level math you did, we said that strategic imperatives would be 40%. We're obviously there, but $40 billion at least by 2018, and we're still on track to get there. In fact, we're a little bit ahead of track. Now when that -- when those 2 lines cross, I don't know. I think that the investment community has been keen for us to stay on that solid, double-digit growth path in the strategic imperatives. There have been concerns every quarter about whether or not we're slowing down. But we just grew 13% on our toughest compare of the year last year because we did 17 in the first. So I think that the crossover point, I think, is a mathematical exercise. What I'm looking at is are the strategic imperatives and the growth we're getting out of those continuing to put us and keep us on the track to that $40 billion.",352

What I mean by that is if I think about the revenue growth, the core actually decelerated this quarter compared to, say, the last 3 quarters. And if I look at some of the areas like GBS, you have application maintenance, that's, combined with BPO, that's over 50% of the business and well under company profit levels. And I'm just trying to understand, specifically focused on GBS, is how you improved revenue growth. But should you improve revenue growth? Or is there more pruning that you can do as it relates to the total IBM portfolio but particularly within GBS?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2017",2017-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3646.0,1172765.0,48262965.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Sure, Keith. So I think I look at our portfolio, and as you know, as we've talked about this, and we've been pretty clear that we look at our portfolio through the eyes of value. And I think the portfolio, not solely through the eyes of growth. Value and -- or no value or a limited value without growth is obvious that we wouldn't -- we would have a -- we would be thinking about whether or not that fit. But the portfolio we have today I view as high-value. Now the AMS business, as you point out, that's a high-value business. Now the revenue -- it's pretty stable, but it serves a really important need with our client base. It is -- it allows us, based on how we do it with our industry focus, it allows us to drive value for our clients. So when we -- I think of pruning as something you do when you don't see an opportunity for differentiation, when you don't see a longer-term opportunity for value. And I look at the portfolio now, and boy, I think there is -- I think we have a very high-value portfolio and I think that GBS, large GBS, all of it plays a critical role in that. I don't see a pruning opportunity here.",219

The biggest question on many of these follow-up calls, and so maybe I'll give it one more shot, to be rounded out, is the investment you're putting forth in the degradation to gross margins, when are we going to see them stabilize? Or do you have line of sight to that? It just seems like when you give up some investment, at some point you want to harvest the fruit of your efforts. And it's been asked time and time again so I'll have to kind of one more time, do you see stabilization and if so, when?",119

So again, and this is actually -- it's an interesting question because -- it's not -- it's an interesting timing of this question because I want to make sure that everybody understands that as we head now into the rest of this year and our -- well, one of our focus items, as it always has been, but now the timing is right, is to get the returns for our investment. That's something, if you were to poll 100 IBM executives, it's something that they would all say is now it's time to get the return. So we have driven very heavy investment. That has impacted our margins. But the investment is not the only opportunity and the only lever we have to improve margins. We have a lot of opportunity in our Services business and our delivery model and how we drive margin. So yes, it is time for us to get the returns. We have invested quite heavily. The strategy is right. The -- we hear it from our client every day. The places that we are moving them to and the work we do in the core is highly, highly valuable to them. So I think now, the shorthand, that is yes, now it's time. And with that, I'll wrap up the call by saying, we have been making significant investments. And now we've added, by the way, a ton of capabilities to the IBM company. We've started new businesses. We made new markets. We've changed, as we always do, industries and professions, and we'll continue to do that. But now it's -- with the position -- with the business positioned very well for the long term in terms of capabilities, always opportunities to add a little bit here and there. But with the business positioned well for the long term, now it is time to focus on improving the returns on those investments. So thank you very much for joining the call today.",330

In the second quarter, we delivered $19.3 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of over $3 billion, operating earnings per share of $2.97 and free cash flow of over $2.5 billion. The quarter played out as we expected with continued solid growth in our strategic imperatives, which now really reflects organic growth. We wrapped on the acquisitive content, and we're at the stage where we can start to get some efficiency as a result of bringing them into IBM while we build on the new content. Our gross margin is up over 2.5 points sequentially and positions us for the continued improvement over the course of the year we talked about 90 days ago. And we had good free cash flow performance, all again as we expected.
In the second quarter, we signed a number of large contracts in Global Technology Services and again grew our Global Business Services signings, both of which will start to contribute in the second half. And since the quarter ended, we announced our new IBM z System, which will be available later this quarter. With all of this, we expect improved performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half, and we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS and free cash flow consistent with last year. I'll spend time on the first to second half dynamics a little later, and you'll see it very similar to what we talked about in April.
We've been focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their businesses to leverage their data for competitive advantage and to improve the efficiency and agility of their IT environments. Our strategic imperatives performance has been an indication of our progress in moving to these areas. As you know, our strategic imperatives aren't separate businesses but signposts that represent the revenue across our business lines that work together to address demand for analytics, cloud, security, mobile and social. Our clients are taking the productivity savings we're delivering to them in the more traditional areas of IT and reinvesting those savings to move into these new areas. These are the dynamics you've seen in our revenue.
In the quarter, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 7% in constant currency, which, as I said, is pretty much all organic growth. Over the last 12 months, revenue from our strategic imperatives was up 12% to over $34 billion and now represents 43% of IBM. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout.
A large part of our strategic imperatives are delivered as a service. Our as-a-service revenue was up over 30% in the second, and we exited the quarter with an $8.8 billion annual run rate. IBM's cloud revenue on a trailing 12-month basis is now over $15 billion. That's nearly 20% of IBM's revenue.
Let me spend a minute underscoring how we've been able to build cloud to a $15 billion business and why enterprises are increasingly moving to the IBM Cloud. In the second quarter, we added more leading companies to the IBM Cloud. For example, Lloyds Bank has chosen the IBM Cloud. Lloyds is one of the most advanced digital banks in the world, and they expect to become even more agile by leveraging IBM's unique combination of private and public cloud capabilities. American Airlines is also using the IBM Cloud as the foundation for its broad-based cloud transformation.
Clients are choosing the IBM Cloud for a number of reasons. First, our cloud is hybrid, built for the enterprise that's public and private and integrated with on-prem data and workloads. Second, they want to leverage our expertise in the industry and their existing business processes and systems, and we know how to migrate them from one area to the next. Third, they trust IBM and the IBM Cloud to protect and preserve not only their data but also their insights and AI training engines to ensure all of the value from their data accrues to them versus going to educate a central knowledge graph. And of course, we continue to add state-of-the-art tools and technologies to exploit enterprise data in the cloud. This includes Watson and Blockchain. You see this last point play out as companies deploy IBM Blockchain and Watson solutions in the cloud. Recently, we announced an agreement with a consortium of 7 of Europe's top banks to create a new blockchain service for trade finance for the small and medium business market. And in Australia, we're working with banks to launch new commercial property leasing services based on blockchain. And remember, we're already working with many others, including DTCC, CLS and Northern Trust. Beyond financial services, we're working with industry leaders like Walmart in food safety and Maersk in shipping. It's still early, but we see a lot of opportunity leveraging blockchain in the cloud and across multiple industries.
Similarly, in the second quarter, we saw Watson deployments continue to expand globally. The cognitive opportunity is a global one. It's not centered in New York or Boston or Silicon Valley. So you can't just look and listen in those places. In health care alone, you'd miss that this quarter, the first health care provider in Latin America is deploying Watson for oncology, and Baheal Pharmaceutical Group is bringing Watson for genomics to clinicians across China. In fact, 80% of the hospitals who've adopted Watson for oncology are outside of the U.S., and that's just health care. We have Watson deployed with other leaders like Bradesco, Honda and Vodafone as well.
So across industries and around the world, our clients realize that data, in fact, their own data, is the root of competitive advantage for all companies. Remember, 80% of the world's data is owned by enterprises. It's not searchable on the World Wide Web. It's customer data and patient data, clinical data, supply chain data, transaction data, and companies want to unlock and exploit that data. And so that's why enterprises will move to cognitive on the cloud with someone they trust, who has leading tools and industry expertise and a data model and business model consistent with their goals. That is the IBM Cloud plus Watson.
I want to also remind you of the importance of the underlying technology stack. We've continued to reinvent the mainframe and our Power platform to address the most contemporary enterprise workloads. Our new z14 mainframe is a great example. With a breakthrough in data encryption, IBM z is capable of encrypting all data associated with any application, service or database all of the time and with no application change and no performance impact. Think about what that means for addressing global data breaches, the increase in government regulations and blockchain opportunities. It's the biggest reinvention of our mainframe technology since the reinvention for Linux and open-source software 15 years ago. I'll touch on additional progress and examples of where we're winning in these areas and more details on our new mainframe capabilities as I go through the segment discussions, but first, I'll walk through our financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.3 billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. As expected, we had a larger currency headwind to revenue growth, was about twice the impact of the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we wrapped on the acquisitions we completed in early 2016. We had 2 points of benefit in the first quarter from acquisitions and only about 40 basis points in the second. So excluding the acquisitive content, our year-to-year revenue performance was a modest improvement over last quarter's rate.
When you look at our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue in the U.S. was down, while we had solid growth in Canada and Latin America. Our overall performance in Europe declined, centered in Germany and the U.K. You'll recall last quarter, I talked about the impact of the conclusion of services contracts in those countries, which will continue through the year, though we'll get some benefit from the new deals we signed in the second half. We had sequential improvement in Asia Pacific with growth in several markets, including Japan, which is our second largest country. I'll come back to the revenue trajectory later in the call.
When you look at our gross profit, our margin was down year-to-year but significantly better than the first quarter year-to-year performance. The year-to-year margin decline reflects both the mix and investments. From first to second quarter, we got substantial leverage from our high-value model. We added $1 billion gross profit dollars from first to second with $1.1 billion of additional revenue, while last year, we had similar gross profit improvement from first to second, but we needed more revenue to do it. So that, of course, resulted in improved trajectory in the year-to-year margin dynamics. In fact, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year gross margin performance in each of our 5 segments. We'll talk more about the drivers and trends in the segment discussions.
Our expense was down 6% versus last year with about half of that due to currency, and the balance reflects an increased focus on driving efficiency in our spend base. As I said, we've been shifting and adding resources as we invest to build solutions and platforms. In fact, in the first half of this year, we hired 20,000 people into the business, so our cost and expense profile reflects a balance between investing in key areas and driving efficiency across the spend base.
Our operating pretax profit was nearly $3.1 billion, which is up about $1 billion from the first quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, consistent with last quarter. We also had discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of about $170 million or $0.18 of operating EPS. We generated $2.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 14.5%, which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $2.97. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up year-to-year, and over the last 12 months, our free cash flow was 94% of our GAAP net income.
So now turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, continued growth in annuity content led by SaaS and an improved margin profile. Our annuity content, which represents 80% of Cognitive, was up 2% year-to-year, driven by roughly 4.5% growth in solutions software. We had strong SaaS performance with strong double-digit growth in signings and revenue again this quarter. Revenue was up nearly 30%. As our SaaS business grows, we continue to invest to build scale.
The software transactional revenue was down double digits due to declines in some of our licensed-based offerings, and as you know, this has a larger impact in the second quarter given the seasonality of our transactions. As we've said before, many of our license-based offerings are high value but in declining markets.
We also wrapped on most of our acquisitions and are focused on investing to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Let me talk about the progress we're making in parts of the solutions software portfolio.
In analytics, we saw good growth in Watson Health and Watson Financial Services and in BI and data discovery led by Cognos. We announced the partnership with Hortonworks to combine our data science experience and machine learning with Hortonworks data platform to allow developers to access data science and cognitive tools and create intelligent apps.
We also had strong growth in our Watson platform, which underpins our enterprise AI strategy as we build scale. Conversation API usage and the number of active users are up strong double digits quarter-to-quarter as we help clients embed cognitive into their workflows. For example, Crédit Mutuel is live with multiple use cases, including virtual systems for insurance and savings. These cognitive applications were rolled out to over 20,000 agents across France, enhancing their quality of service for 12 million customers.
In this quarter, we added new partners like LivePerson, which provides a conversational platform used for the customer care needs of over 18,000 businesses. Given the growing relevance of AI in digital channels, they announced a new offering called LiveEngage with Watson to transform the customer care space. LiveEngage can offer intelligent, personalized digital support to each customer. This is an appealing market. The value Watson provides depends on the complexity of the conversation. So the number of API calls can vary, but we have the potential to deliver value from every digital conversation. This will scale as more of today's 270 billion customer support phone calls shift to digital interactions.
Within our vertical strategy, Watson Health had strong growth, particularly in the areas of state and local government agencies and oncology as we continue scaling. While market uncertainty persists, government agencies still face the realities of having to deliver services more efficiently, and our analytics and social program management offerings can help clients make better informed decisions to reduce health care costs and improve outcomes. Both offerings drove strong growth this quarter. Oncology is also scaling and is now in over 50 hospitals on 5 continents. Through the first half, Watson's worked with nearly 40,000 patients and doctors, and this will grow to approximately 100,000 by year-end. And many of these have life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Watson for Oncology alone has the potential to reach millions around the world based just on the hospital systems we've engaged to date. So we're just at the beginning of scaling. We continue to add new cancer types, so our patient reach continues to grow.
We're not just scaling our business into new areas but also improving deployment. For example, we implemented Watson for Oncology at Baheal Pharmaceutical Group in less than a month. This quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expanded with Baheal into genomics. We also announced the new collaboration with Hackensack Meridian Health, a prominent U.S. provider, to combine Watson for oncology with their real-world data to help oncologists improve cancer treatment and reduce costs.
For another industry example, Watson for financial services, which includes the Promontory acquisition, also contributed to growth this quarter. We launched industry expert trained AI risk and compliance solutions, including Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer.
Beyond verticals, security, including security services, which is reported in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, grew again this quarter. Offerings like QRadar and Resilient had strong growth as customers look to strengthen their ability to both detect and respond to security threats. This quarter, we announced a partnership with Cisco to address this growing threat of cybercrime. We will collaborate on threat intelligence research by sharing data, integrating our offerings and coordinating on major cyber security incidents.
Turning to profit. Cognitive Solutions gross margin is down year-to-year though improving sequentially, driven by the continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Cognitive pretax income is up year-to-year, and this segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded again this quarter even with a high level of investment as we continue to embed cognitive into offerings, build and scale platforms and drive vertical solutions.
In Global Business Services, we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter and had modest improvement in the year-to-year revenue performance as compared to first. As we've talked about, we've realigned our practice model to improve productivity and focus our strategy around 3 growth platforms. The first platform is where we help our clients build and execute digital strategies. Next is where we help our clients reengineer their core processes. And the third platform is where we modernize our clients' applications and move them to the cloud. This differentiated strategy is beginning to take hold as we accelerated our signings growth in GBS this quarter. Our cloud, mobile and analytics practices delivered strong revenue growth.
Though consulting revenue was down 1%, our trajectory improved again this quarter with strong growth in our digital offerings. We continued to decline in traditional enterprise application work as we shift resources away from these areas to new areas such as SAP HANA, Workday and Salesforce.
We've talked about the path to improvement in GBS, which starts with consistent signings growth, which adds to the backlog and then, ultimately, revenue. Our consulting backlog this quarter was nearly flat year-to-year after several quarters of declines. We expect the consulting trajectory improvement to continue in the second half.
Our mobile practice continues to expand with a portfolio of cognitive-enabled enterprise iOS apps that can redesign our clients' workflows. This quarter, we announced new initiatives at several different clients, including Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines.
Application management was down 1%, has been relatively stable over the past several quarters. Clients continue to look to us to manage the life cycle of their critical applications. We help them move to new cloud architectures that improve the speed and agility of their operations while leveraging the value of their current systems and data.
Turning to profit. GBS gross profit margin was up over 1 point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added more gross profit dollars than we did a year ago, and we were able to do this on less incremental revenue. This is evidence of the turnaround that we expect in GBS as we move forward. We continue to shift to higher-value work while focusing on improving productivity. We yielded savings from workforce actions and continue to invest to remix our skills. While we're seeing pricing pressure in the areas that are not as differentiated, we continue to focus on capturing the value of our new offerings. We've streamlined our practice infrastructure and are driving efficiencies in our delivery model through new methods and project management approaches.
In summary, in GBS this quarter, we continued many of the improving trends that started in the first quarter. As we've said before, it starts with consistent signings growth, and we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to shift to our high-value strategic imperatives, and we're starting to see the benefits from a redesigned practice model and refocused growth strategy. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities. Put all this together, and we expect to see continued improvement in GBS in the second half.
In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.4 billion of revenue. While revenue performance decelerated, our margin profile improved compared to last quarter, and we signed a number of contracts that will contribute to improved performance in the second half. The deceleration was driven by infrastructure services as we ramped on some acquisitive content and shifted away from lower-value work. While this shift impacted our revenue, it contributed to the improved gross margin trajectory.
We also continue to be impacted by some large contracts that concluded, particularly in Europe, which we talked about last quarter. Our business model in infrastructure services is one where we're constantly delivering productivity to our clients. Our clients trust us with their most critical IT operations as we continue to lead this space. The way that we expand our footprint is by helping clients move to cloud and drive new workloads by acquiring new scope and new clients. This quarter, we were able to close some substantial new transactions, including a 6-year $700 million agreement with Bombardier. We'll move them to the IBM Cloud and help integrate their operations globally. This will drive productivity, improve their agility and ultimately provide competitive advantage.
I mentioned Lloyds, where we signed a 10-year cloud agreement valued at around $1.5 billion. We'll move the bank to the IBM Cloud and migrate their application suites to this infrastructure. And earlier this quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement with a large telco to acquire its cloud and managed hosting business. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017. We're working with them on a number of other strategic initiatives, including networking and cloud services. These transactions will help improve our revenue trajectory in the second half.
Technical support services revenue was down 1%, 1 point better than last quarter's rate. We continue to grow in our multi-vendor support services, where we provide wall-to-wall support for our clients' IT operations. Integration software revenue was down 1%, which is nearly 2 points better than the first quarter's rate. Our annuity base remains stable, with strong growth in SaaS across our offerings, including WebSphere Application Server and our hybrid transformation and connect-to-cloud offerings. Transactional revenue within integration software declined as more of this portfolio shifts to the IBM Cloud, which will benefit us over time. Across the segment, we delivered strong growth in cloud, analytics, mobile and security. The as-a-service run rate for the segment increased to $5.8 billion.
Clients are moving to the IBM Cloud because it's built for the enterprise and can optimize workloads across hybrid environments. The underlying architecture protects our clients' data and insights and is optimized for cognitive workloads to help our clients create new business models. The American Airlines example I referenced earlier is a great example where we're building on the partnership we signed last year. American Airlines announced this quarter they'll move to the IBM Cloud and use it as a foundation for their digital transformation. They will migrate critical applications, including AA.com, their customer-facing mobility app and their global network of kiosks.
Looking at profit. Gross profit margin for the segment was down year-to-year but up 1 point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added about the same gross profit dollars we did a year ago on less than half the incremental revenue, so you can see the leverage you can get in this business.
We drove efficiencies in services delivery and yielded savings from workforce actions. We've been investing in our automation capabilities and launched the IBM Services Platform with Watson last week. This platform offers next-generation enterprise IT services using cognitive technology and will drive operational efficiencies and improve delivery performance for our clients.
We also continue to invest in our IBM Cloud capabilities. We announced the opening of 4 new cloud centers in the U.S., extending our capacity with centers in key local markets across 19 different countries. This provides enterprises with the ability to run their data and applications locally and meet regulatory requirements. Clients can provision cloud infrastructure when and where they need it.
In summary for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, infrastructure services revenue decelerated given the ramp on some acquisitive content and the shift away from lower-value work. Given some of the significant transactions we closed this quarter and strong demand for our cloud services, we expect our revenue trajectory to improve in the second half. We also expect the improved trends in profit to continue.
In systems, this quarter, we had a significant improvement in our year-to-year revenue trajectory and an improved margin profile quarter-to-quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with growth in storage. Our Power declines moderated, and our mainframe business is consistent with what you would expect at the end of a cycle. Mainframe and storage margins grew year-to-year, and Power margins improved sequentially. Our overall systems margin was down year-to-year, reflecting mix largely due to product transitions.
In z Systems, as I mentioned, our results are reflective of being in the tenth and final quarter of the z13 product cycle. Revenue declined year-to-year. Gross margin expanded, and we added 4 new clients this quarter for a total of 91 since the launch of z13. We continue to deliver innovation on the platform in support our clients' evolving workload needs. For example, a large bank in Europe selected LinuxONE as the strategic platform for their BPM deployments, which will help the bank achieve significant savings over the next 5 years. Two large government clients expanded their mainframe capacity, helping them drive down the operating costs for these agencies.
In the areas of new workloads, we had wins in both blockchain and instant payments. The blockchain wins were geographically dispersed as we help our clients around the world tackle business challenges with the emerging blockchain technology. We closed 3 instant payment deals in Europe to help our banking clients comply with the EU payment modernization initiative.
I want to spend a minute on our new z14 mainframe that we announced yesterday. After 3 years of development and working with more than 150 clients, this is the world's most powerful transaction system, capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day and provides breakthrough pervasive encryption. This data encryption engine encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all of the time without the possibility of human intervention. And that's with no application change and no performance impact.
We took on this challenge to address both the global data breach epidemic and the need to operate within government regulations. In fact, of the 9 billion records breached in the past 5 years, only 4% were encrypted. Even with the rise of cloud data centers, little real progress had been made encrypting data at any scale because it's hard, expensive and it impacts performance. That is until now. Our new z14 system encrypts data 18x faster than x86 platforms, and the x86 platforms are 20x more expensive.
The reason why 92 of the world's top 100 banks rely on the mainframe is for its high-value, secure and scalable platform. The reason they stay on it is because of its appeal in new workloads and the advances we continue to make in the underlying technologies to address these, like the new z14 with its unprecedented encryption capabilities. And we do this with increased performance at lower cost, which is really valuable to our enterprise clients. So we can deliver all of this within an economic equation that works at the scale required by our clients.
The Power growth rate improved sequentially but was still down. The improvement reflects our transition to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high-value but declining UNIX market. Our Linux on Power revenue grew, and we gained share. We again had double-digit growth in Linux workloads. HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success.
By contrast, in UNIX, declines were driven by our low-end and mid-range systems. High-end systems grew. Our Power portfolio is focused on cognitive and cloud opportunities, and we continue to expand capabilities and partnerships. During the second quarter, we announced new integrated offerings with Hortonworks, designed to help everyone from data scientists to business leaders better analyze and manage their data and accelerate decision-making. And we announced integrated offerings with Nutanix to deliver hyper-converged solutions targeting critical workloads and large enterprises.
We also announced the new version PowerAI, which, paired with IBM Linux HPC servers, reduces training of deep learning from weeks to hours. I'll remind you that we'll bring the next-generation POWER9 to market in the fourth quarter starting with 2 U.S. Department of Energy-funded National Labs. There are 3 labs of this type, but no vendor can win more than 2. So we've won all we're allowed. These will be the world's most advanced data-centric supercomputing systems, and we'll roll out POWER9 across the Power portfolio throughout 2018.
Storage hardware was up again this quarter, increasing 8%, led by strong double-digit growth in our all-flash array offerings. Flash was the growth catalyst in our storage mid-range and high-end offerings. Storage hardware margins increased both year-to-year and sequentially.
So to summarize Systems, our year-to-year revenue and gross margin trajectory improved with consecutive quarters of revenue growth in storage offset by the expected cycle-driven declines in z Systems and Power. While we face some shifting market dynamics and product transitions, our portfolio remains optimized for cognitive and cloud, and we continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities. Our recent z14 launch and the upcoming Power refresh beginning later in the year will drive further improvement in second half performance.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested about $0.75 billion in capital expenditures focused in our Watson and Cloud platform areas as well as in support of our services and systems businesses. And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up almost $350 million year-to-year. This reflects continued strong collections performance for the second consecutive quarter.
For the first half, our free cash flow was $3.6 billion, and over the last 12 months, our cash realization rate is 94%, 4 points higher than last quarter's trailing 12-month rate. The first half free cash flow of $3.6 billion is down $900 million year-to-year. However, you'll recall in the first half of last year, we had a $1.2 billion Japan tax refund. As we look forward to the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be roughly flat with last year with the first half year-to-year headwind switching to a tailwind in the second half from taxes and workforce rebalancing payments. And of course, this reflects the level of profit consistent with our full year view of our earnings per share.
Looking at uses of cash in the half. Our acquisition spend was relatively light after a significant number of acquisitions in 2015 and early 2016. We're focused on investing and integrating these acquisitions as we expand our solutions and cloud capabilities. In the last 6 months, we've returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend, and with that, we've more than doubled our dividend since 2010. In the first half, we bought back over 16 million shares, and we ended June with 932 million shares outstanding and $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended June with $12.3 billion in cash and $45.7 billion in total debt. Both of these are up from year-end, primarily driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances and maturities.
$29 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1, and the portfolio remains strong at 53% investment grade. We've got more in our financing business in our supplemental charts at the back of the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and with our newly reorganized financing entity, we're even better positioned to support our business over the long term.
Let me start to wrap up by putting some additional perspective on our revenue trajectory, and we'll look at it by segment because our businesses are at different stages of transformation. In Global Business Services, we've said for some time that the progression is driven by improvement in signings leading to backlog and then, ultimately, revenue. I'd plant the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement and the revenue growth trajectory for GBS back in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've now had 2 consecutive quarters of signings growth, substantial improvements in the consulting backlog and a modest 20 basis point improvement in GBS revenue performance from first to second. This is what improving momentum in the services business looks like. So now with this momentum and a more focused set of offerings and improvements in execution, we see an improved trajectory in GBS in the second half.
In Global Technology Services, with decelerating performance over the last 2 quarters, we're planting the flag now, the end of the second quarter. With the ramp in some of our new contracts, we do expect improved performance in the second half, though we're not counting on a return to revenue growth this year, just an improved revenue trajectory.
And in systems, storage had been declining, but you'll remember, we planted the flag as we got all flash into the product line toward the end of last year. And we've now had 2 consecutive quarters of revenue growth.
Power, I'd similarly plant the flag back at the end of last year. And for System z mainframe, growth is tied more to the 9- to 10-quarter product cycle, which will refresh later this quarter.
Finally, in Cognitive Solutions, we've now ramped on our acquisitions. Our annuity content continues to grow. This was driven in large part by our SaaS offerings, and as we've talked about in the past, they ramp and build scale over a longer timeframe. Put it all together, and we expect improvement in the constant currency growth rate through the rest of the year.
Now when we look at gross margin, I mentioned 3 drivers of our year-to-year performance in the first half. We've seen some moderation in the headwinds from mix and investments already from first to second, and I'd expect that to continue. We're always driving productivity in the business, and much of that gets returned to our clients in the form of price, or it offsets cyclical impacts, or it goes to the bottom line.
In the first half, the net of these factors was an impact to our margin, but as we move to the second half with new product introduction and improved services dynamics, I'd expect this to be a benefit to our margin. Put that all together, and just as we expect improvement in our revenue trajectory, we also expect an improved gross margin profile in the second half as compared to the first.
So in total, those drivers of our first to second half performance improvements are consistent with what we talked about 90 days ago. We'll have a new IBM z product out by the end of the quarter, which will drive an improvement in gross profit from first to second half. Related to that, we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending.
The new services contracts in Global Technology Services will start to contribute, and with the cost savings we're driving, we'll have better performance in GTS. In Global Business Services, we expect the momentum to deliver a better second half.
We have essentially wrapped on last year's larger acquisitions, which are dilutive to profit, and we're now at the stage where we can start to yield more benefits from operational synergies. Our ongoing operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15%, plus or minus 3 points, driven by our anticipated mix. As always, this is without discrete items. But the rate is dependent on the mix of business because just like every dollar of revenue doesn't result in the same amount of gross profit, every dollar of gross profit doesn't drive the same amount of after-tax profit. But at the bottom line, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we'll take your questions.",5812

Thanks, and thanks for joining the call. I guess, a couple of things. I'll start actually where you finished on mainframe. Because we have, in the past, said that the economics for the mainframe for us, what we're looking for, is that the overall economic equation cycle to cycle kind of holds. And we saw it for the last 4 mainframes, including the one that we just finished. And now we expect the overall economic equation to be fairly stable. That doesn't map to a calendar period, obviously, because we announce them at different times. But we would expect the overall economics of the mainframe to hold cycle to cycle to cycle now to the fifth cycle. We could have gone back further, but let's just say that mainframe is roughly consistent with the past. In terms of third and fourth quarter, I guess a couple of things. I think you're interested in revenue and we'll talk about EPS as well, and then where does the mainframe fit. On the revenue side of that, typically, we see about -- for seasonal reasons, we see about $1 billion 2Q to 3Q reduction for seasonality. Now we're only going to have a month or less of the new mainframe. We're going to have a month of some of these new contracts, not the full quarter. Those will come in the fourth. And so that typical $1 billion impact will be helped a little bit, $200 million to $300 million, by mainframe or the services contracts. But that's about it for the third and then, obviously, the rest will be in the fourth. And then from an earnings perspective, given the power of the mainframe and the profit equation, how it helps mix, plus our typical -- typically, we have a lot of our transaction business in the fourth. When you look at our EPS guidance, we're up a little bit for the year. We're up even less than the full year now through the first half. And then third quarter, I wouldn't expect to drive much growth at all. I think most of the growth is going to be in the fourth, again given the cycle dynamics. And quite frankly, given the fact that the benefit really is only a month now and 3 months of the fourth. Thanks, Katy.",390

Thanks, Wamsi. Well, you've kind of answered your question, so well done. No, it is. It really is a reflection of a few things. One is that, sequentially, we got a benefit from scale. Now that's annual, that's year-to-year as well as sequential, but we're getting a benefit from scale as we build those as-a-service businesses. And then just like when we ramp on an acquisition and the revenue benefit, at the same time what that allows -- not allows us, but what we start to do is we start to build the consolidation, if you will, and the efficiency in getting those acquisitions onto our own platform. So we get kind of, what I'll call, expense savings, if you will, from doing things once as opposed to a number of times around the unit. So better scale, ramp on acquisitions, not only on the growth, but then we get an opportunity to get a bit more productivity out of them. And yes, those -- I would expect that the margins in Cognitive Solutions, while on a year-to-year basis we still see -- because of mix, we still see a year-to-year decline, sequentially, we'll continue to improve. And those things, the things I identified, the scale will last forever, and then the ramp on the acquisitions will start to deteriorate in another 3, 4 quarters.",226

And why do you think that's going to improve?",45

First, let's pull signings apart, we'll talk about backlog. Because the impact of signings on backlog, as you know, we've talked about it, is different when it's a renewal versus it's -- when it's new business. And signings, they don't play out, as we said in the past, on a 90-day period. Obviously, the longer you get, the more it looks like your backlog. But you got to get over a pretty long time frame in order to have the signings translate directly into backlog. So in the first half of this year, we had one of the biggest new contract signings we've had for any 6-month period. It was as big as it was last year. It was bigger than the year before. So what happens in our backlog is those new contracts come on once we go through the transition period -- as I mentioned earlier, that for us will start to be September, once you get through that transition period, all of that translates to revenue rather quickly. That's different from a backlog or a signing that goes into backlog as an extension of a contract that's 10 years old or -- and is about to expire because that's not going to drive any incremental growth. So yes, the -- on GPS, the backlog's down. The new signings go in, though, at a rate that will drive revenue in the near term. And so what the backlog being down is something that we obviously have to work on a few years out. Because those contracts are going to come due and we have to get them renewed, because it's not going to drive any growth, but we need the backlog. And on GBS, we had a second quarter in a row of good signings performance. In fact, an acceleration from the first. And within their backlog now, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the consulting business now has gotten itself back to kind of a flat backlog, which, in the near term, that tends to yield pretty quickly as we deliver. So they were battling double-digit declines in backlog for a while. They've worked their way out of that spiral. And so we'll see a near-term yield on the consulting side as well.",383

A couple of things I think worth noting. Yes, we certainly ramped on the acquisitions. And so this is a pretty good proxy for the organic piece. And it is mostly as-a-service, right? So it's not going to drive the same impact on our big base of business as it would if you ramped on an on-prem business because it didn't have the same impact to begin with. Now, by the way, we're not out of the acquisition business, right? We're still active acquirers. We just happen to ramp on and are getting our feet under us on everything we did in the past 18 months. But we are still an active acquirer, so that'll drive some of the growth. But when we think about strategic imperatives going forward, I would expect that we get a bit of an acceleration from the new mainframe. Power will drive a bit. And quite frankly, the services contracts, particularly the new ones we signed and we talked about, they are cloud contracts. They're to help our clients build and run clouds and move them on to the cloud. So just like we have encouraged everyone to look at the strategic imperatives on a trailing 12-month basis, which they were at 11% on a trailing 12-month basis, with the acceleration now through the back half of the year, when we get to the end of this year, I'd expect us still on that same trailing 12-month, so the whole calendar year. And I'd expect us to be in that 10% to 11% range on strategic imperatives as well.",268

I think you said you didn't expect EPS growth in Q3. Consensus is looking for a $0.09 year-over-year improvement in Q3. Are you suggesting that's not something that's appropriate? And then more specifically on my question, for strategic imperatives, it sounds like you feel organic growth is 7%. Are you still confident overall growth will be 10% plus, which is something you articulated at your Investment Day? And if you are, is the proper application to think about 3 points of strategic imperative growth coming from acquisitions, which is about $1 billion a year in acquisition revenue, is that sort of the framework by which we should think? And are you still confident in that double-digit sustained growth for strategic imperatives?",131
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2017",2017-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3742.0,1246292.0,50537631.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Sure. Thanks, Tony. So first, on the nonquestion clarifying piece. Look, we got a base -- $3-plus on a base, we're roughly flat. I think we're at a level now where it's just -- too fine a number in order to say am I talking about $0.09 on a $3 -- almost mid-3? Anyway, it's a big base. $0.09, too fine for me. On strategic imperatives, again, I do expect us to accelerate in the second half of the year for the reasons we talked about, right? We got new mainframe, a lot of the new contracts are coming on. And then the other elements within this, and you can actually see it in the segment charts, we've got good growth in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms on the strategic imperative base. That is organic. We have good growth in GBS. That is, by and large, organic. We have slower growth in the Cognitive Solutions, but that's a massive base. And then, obviously, what -- where we'll accelerate the most in the second half is the systems business, which was down dramatically in the quarter. But again, we're at the part of the cycle here where we would expect it to be down. So we gave the segment view already -- when we changed the segment reporting, we gave the segment view so you could try to put together now where we see that shift of business coming from. And as we go into the second half, I think the most profound shifts are going to be in the systems business. We'll see continued good growth in the Technology Services & Cloud Platforms unit. We'll see continued growth in GBS. And then Cognitive, we have made investments. We're getting growth out of that part of the business. It is as-a-service primarily, and therefore, its impact on the overall is more muted. But if we were to acquire something, it would go -- it would likely go back in there. But again, it's more muted because it's the as-a-service businesses.",339

But I was hoping you could help us better understand the growth dynamics in the cognitive and GBS segments. It looks like the strategic imperatives are well over 50% of the revenue mix in both those units, but they both are experiencing revenue declines. So if I've got that math right, can you help us better understand that dynamic and what the implies for the overall mix as strategic imperatives increase to the greater percent of IBM's overall revenue mix?",92
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2017",2017-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3742.0,1246292.0,50537634.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Yes, sure. Sure, David. So we'll do them kind of piece-by-piece, and I'll give you 2 words to kind of describe both of them. One is magnitude. And now to put that against cognitive, we got -- it's a big, big business. And obviously, the as-a-service that we're building has a smaller impact. And so we see growth, but it's going to take -- and we're getting growth in the as-a-service portfolio, but it's going to take time to build that. And part of that portfolio, TPS, our transaction processing business, as we have on the slide, is down 4%. So that's a very high-value business. But the big on-prem business, that is going to take a while to outbuild, if you will, from an as-a-service perspective. And then on GBS, the word I'd give you is the transition. So I described a bit on our Consulting business, where we got the backlog back and the -- back to flat, and the Consulting business has accelerated. The signings and consulting are good. The things -- the growth is quite strong. The things that we're engaging with our clients on, on digital offerings, those are resonating. So the Consulting business comes back pretty well. Then the Application Management business, it's a fairly stable business. And yes, we're helping our clients move those into cloud. We're helping them contemporize, if you will, the way those applications work. But that's not a big growth engine. It really is kind of a very stable base. And then in GPS, in our global processing systems business, that's not high content of strategic imperatives. But it is important work for our clients and it's quite valuable to us. So in GBS, as we make this transition, the overall will be lifted. And as we said, we planted the flag on revenue growth back in the fourth quarter. Now we've seen a moderately improving trajectory now. And we would expect, as I said on the prepared remarks, that third and fourth will be better again in terms of trajectory and revenue.",344

I realize 180 basis points decline in June is much better than the 300 basis points decline you had in the March quarter. But given -- firstly, at what point do you see gross margins from a year-over-year perspective starting to stabilize? And does stability in gross margin have to come in line with strategic revenue essentially decelerating a little bit?",72
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2017",2017-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3742.0,1246292.0,50537637.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Well, we do see, as we've said in the prepared remarks, that we do see continued improvement in the trajectory, right? So down 3 in the first, down 1.8 in the second. And then second half, driven by both mix and driven by the work we have underway in delivering productivity across our services platform, the work we have in improving our GBS margins, which is now starting to come -- to show up in the ledger. So we see both a mix of kind of structural benefit from productivity. We see a mix of execution benefits from realizing, if you will, the higher value of the solutions we're selling. And we see a mix from just the fact that we're in high-value systems business, which is going to mix more strongly. So yes, we do see continued gross margin improvement on a sequential basis and improvement on a year-to-year basis sequentially, and that would position us pretty well, I think, then for 2018. But we've got work to do here in the second half to put that on the table. But we do see it in the third and the fourth.",192

Do you think it will have a more favorable impact in 2018? And if you could give us just some guideposts around the attach rate of the z14 or any mainframe cycle to both sales and profits of IBM. Obviously, it's a small direct percent of IBM's total sales and profits. But if you look at the overall portfolio and the software and services that it drags through, that would be great.",95
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2017",2017-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3742.0,1246292.0,50537640.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"So first, I think what -- you started by saying was z14 not much impact in the second half, and I think what we're saying is that it's going to have quite an impact in the second half, right? It was announced yesterday. It'll become publicly available in September. And so we'll get a month in the quarter, but we'll get 3 months of it in the fourth quarter. So just to make sure we're clear, we do see a pretty good impact here in the second half from z. Now the timing, that impact will be most profound in the systems space because the hardware is what obviously goes out first. We also provide, as you know, we provide maintenance for that. But the warranty period on, so that's not going to be felt for until after the warranty period expires, that's in 12 months plus. There is software that goes with it, but that tends to be driven by usage, not by a placement of hardware. And so that also isn't going to be in the second half. We finance these, right? That happens over time, and so we get that money back over time. So the -- and then we sell storage. There's a little bit of tailwind in the hardware side, but again, a lot of it is software-defined storage. So the benefit in the second half is systems-driven. The rest of the platform, if you will, will continue to drive profit over time, and a lot of that will be dependent on the workloads that it can attract and the workloads it's running now and how people scale, which we feel quite good about. One of the things we haven't spent a lot of time on, on the mainframe because the interest has been around security. The interest has been around in-line machine learning. But one of the elements of the new mainframe is a new software model, which will allow our clients to partition off parts of the mainframe and to run new workloads and test new workloads in a much more economic way so they will attract new workloads onto the platform again. So over time, again, we're not relying on the mainframe as a platform to be any more valuable than it has in the past. But I'll tell you what, this mainframe solves a lot of clients -- a lot of problems that clients who don't use it today have, and it provides a lot of new onramps for other workloads.",420

Martin, you mentioned planting the flag post several times in different parts of the businesses, which is greatly appreciated. The question I have for you is, is there any correlation to cash flow and cash flow generation regarding those flag posts? Like, for example, if signings result in positive services growth, is there any impact to the future cash flow as they start? And how should we think about the cash flow with your signposts -- or flag posts comment?",86

I think I heard it, but you are -- it was -- you must be on mobile, it's a little bit hard to hear it. But I think the question was is there a correlation between planting the flag on some of the revenue trajectories and cash flow. So broadly speaking, the answer is obviously yes. But it's not a -- it's at kind of at the margin, if you will. So as we turn our GPS business and we start to bring on all these new clients that we have and put them on the IBM Cloud, of course, we expand the capacity of the cloud, but that's already in our plans, right? So at the relationship level, everything that has to do with driving revenue is going to have an impact with cash. But the way we have planned and talked about our cash flow all year of being flat year-to-year, we've recognized already that we're driving capacity into the cloud, that we have to build the capacity and the scale we need. And so it doesn't have an impact into the way we've guided it. But obviously, there is a correlation between what kind of growth we get and the cash demands, if you will, of the business, but not different from what we've talked about all year.",223

Is that -- based on your comments about the mainframe and the fourth quarter, is that still the right way to think about the third quarter, and then you get the bulk of the benefit from the mainframe really driving the fourth quarter earnings profit?",83

But as we said -- for the third. But as I said, in the fourth is where we see most of the growth begin because the mainframe in the fourth is where the bulk of it is going to sit. So I'll let you do the skew math in terms of percentage in the third. But yes, the answer is yes. We're going to see the bulk of the growth from the mainframe in the -- full quarter mainframe in the fourth, as well as the services signings that will have a full quarter impact. And then obviously, as we go through time, and we talked a bit about this on the prepared remarks -- and you've seen some of our announcements about, for instance, the cognitive delivery platform that we're building, those build as you go through time as well. And so all of that will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter.
So just to wrap up. Again, quickly, we finished the first half kind of spot on where we said we would. We positioned ourselves now to have the second half that we're confident we'll deliver. The path from here though, as we said, is pretty at a high level. It's an improved revenue trajectory, it's an improved the GP margin trajectory and it's an improved expense trajectory. And we have now, I think in the second quarter, shown that the GP margin trajectory is there. We've obviously got ability, and we showed good expense management and disciplined investments. And then on the revenue, we've kind of gone through it piece by piece to talk about where we planted the flag. And the most recent, again, second quarter, we'll plant in the flag on GTS, so we'll drive an improved revenue trajectory.
So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days.",336

In the third quarter, we delivered $19.2 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of $3.6 billion and operating earnings per share of $3.30. Our revenue trajectory improved, and revenue was roughly flat year-to-year. This includes a modest benefit from currency, and so we were down 1% at constant currency, which is 2 points better than last quarter's growth rate. Our growth in pretax margins again improved sequentially, and we again had good free cash flow performance. With this performance, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS for 2017 and free cash flow consistent with last year.
From a geographic perspective, our trajectory improvement was broad based, and from a segment perspective, we had significant improvement in Cognitive Solutions and in Systems. Cognitive Solutions grew year-to-year, led by security, IoT and our analytics and cognitive offerings as well as growth in our transaction processing software, so broad-based improvement across cognitive.
In Systems, we had strong growth, driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in storage and a solid launch of our new z14 mainframe, which was available for the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
And in services, the revenue performance in both Global Business Services and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was very similar to the second at constant currency. We had good signings performance this quarter, which were up year-to-year in both segments, including strong double-digit growth in GTS signings.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 11% or 10% at constant currency with strong double-digit growth in cloud and security. While there's not much difference between our constant currency and reported revenue rates this quarter, I'll continue to focus on constant currency growth rates throughout.
The revenue performance in the quarter was pretty much all organic. Revenue from our strategic imperatives over the last 12 months was also up 10% to $34.9 billion and now represents 45% of IBM. We're embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities across our business, and our strategic imperatives, as we said, are signposts of the progress we're making in helping our enterprise clients to extract value from data and become digital businesses. And so our strategic imperatives are in separate businesses with a view of the revenue across our segments that provide our clients with analytics, cloud, security, mobile and social capabilities.
This quarter, our cloud revenue was up 20% and over the last 12 months, has grown to a $15.8 billion revenue base, which represents 20% of IBM's revenue. Our as-a-service revenue was up 24% in the third, and we exited the quarter with a $9.4 billion annual run rate. We're able to drive these results because we're focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their IT. Keep in mind, the IBM Cloud is built for the enterprise. It is the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud and traditional data centers through a single architecture and is designed for cognitive workloads.
So as our clients look to use AI to extract value from data, Watson on the IBM Cloud is the AI platform for business, differentiated by vertical domain depth and in how it protects our clients' data and insights because for enterprises, data matters and industry matters. And that's why we've built industry-specific, cloud-based cognitive solutions in areas like oncology and life sciences in Watson Health and risk and compliance in Watson Financial Services. They address new opportunity areas outside of traditional IT.
Our analytics revenue includes these new vertical businesses as well as established horizontal offerings like DB2 that are being transformed, are high value and play a critical role in our clients' environments. In total, analytics revenue was up 5% this quarter to nearly $5 billion. So this business is large, and it's growing.
In security, we've recently embedded cognitive into many of our offerings. This quarter, across our segments, security grew about 50%, driven by our security software solutions and strong demand for their pervasive encryption capabilities in our new z14. The mainframe is a great example of a core platform that we've continually modernized, and now with new capabilities like Machine Learning on z and pervasive encryption, it's been reinvented again for the cognitive and cloud era as well as an ideal platform for blockchain.
As we build and scale new businesses, partnerships and ecosystems play a critical role, and so in the third quarter, we continued to launch new blockchain partnerships and networks, including an initiative with a group of leading food retailers and suppliers, including Walmart, Kroger, Dole, Nestlé and Unilever, to address food safety. And we're partnering with UBS and several global banks to build a blockchain-based platform to support trade finance.
In the area of big data, in partnership with Hortonworks, we announced new capabilities that allow data scientists to do big data analytics using IBM products on the Hortonworks Data Platform. And in the third quarter, we formed a new partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI Lab. We'll mobilize the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to advance AI hardware, software and algorithms and increase AI's impact on industries and enterprises.
So across our business, we're embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities into our offerings, which is fueling the shift to strategic imperatives. In many cases, we're building new businesses that address new markets, while in others, we're investing to reinvent existing businesses with these same technologies. This is what you see in our revenue and profit dynamics.
So now let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $19.2 billion, and when you look at our revenue performance by geography, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance in all 3 major geographic regions, so as I said earlier, broad-based improvement.
EMEA revenue performance improved 3 points from last quarter to down 1% in the third. We had year-to-year growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, mitigated by declines in the U.K. We recently signed large services engagements to provide cloud and digital services to clients in the U.K., Germany and Spain. I'll touch on a couple of them later.
Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth improved nearly 4 points and was up 2% year-to-year with good growth in Japan and China. The Americas year-to-year performance improved nearly a point, driven by the U.S.
Looking at our margin performance. Our gross margin was down 40 basis points year-to-year, which is another significant sequential improvement. Last quarter, we talked about the margin dynamics for the second half, and we said we'd get some improvement from mix and from productivity, which we did. And we said the impact from investments would moderate, so our margin came in as we said. Our operating expense was down 1% versus last year with little impact from currency and acquisitions this quarter.
Our expense dynamics reflect the continued efficiency we're driving in our underlying spending base while continuing to invest to build and reinvent our platforms and solutions. Included within the 1% reduction, we had about $220 million less IP income year-to-year and absorbed an impact of about $100 million year-to-year in SG&A associated with some commercial disputes. Our operating pretax profit was $3.6 billion, and pretax margin was 18.8%, which is down just 20 basis points year-to-year and up sequentially. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, consistent with last quarter, and we had no discrete tax items in the quarter.
On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $3.30, essentially flat year-to-year. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which is similar to last quarter and last year's third quarter, and we continue to expect our free cash flow for the full year to be relatively flat year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow of nearly $11 billion was 96% of our GAAP net income and supports both a high level of investment and shareholder returns.
Now turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3%, and pretax income was up 5% so better than balanced performance this quarter. Both solutions software and transaction processing software grew 3%, and we had growth in both our annuity content and our transactional businesses.
Within our annuity content, our SaaS offerings had double-digit growth in revenue and signings again this quarter, and we also had continued growth in our software services, which support our solutions offerings through industry and product expertise. We also had good software transactional performance as clients commit to the platform for the long term. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue growth is driven by organic performance as we've wrapped on most of our acquisitions. And we continue to invest to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings.
Within solutions software, growth was led by offerings in security and analytics. Our analytics growth was broad based, including business intelligence and data discovery, where we had triple-digit SaaS growth, led by Cognos Analytics. We also had strong growth in data warehousing, where we're continuing to reinvent these offerings. For example, in September, we launched our new unified data system, which leverages our DB2 technology and is built on IBM Power.
Also in analytics, we had strong growth again this quarter in Watson, our enterprise AI platform. Conversation API usage again had strong double-digit growth quarter-to-quarter. Clients have embedded cognitive into their workflows and are seeing compelling returns. For example, in January, the Royal Bank of Scotland launched Quora, leveraging both our conversation and discovery services. Quora now deflects nearly half of the calls from traditional channels while improving customer experience, significantly cutting down waiting times and freeing up time for call center staff to deal with more complex problems. 
And we're benefiting from cognitive ourselves. IBM's client support teams use Watson to help drastically reduce response time on more than 3.5 million service requests per year. Watson's trained on 7,000 IBM products and provides instant resolution based on what it has learned from previous similar requests. Watson has contributed to a 30% reduction in problem determination time across our technical support services business.
We're embedding cognitive into our security offerings as well. Security software grew double digits this quarter and is clearly a hot market for us. We had strong growth across our security portfolio in areas such as endpoint protection, incident response and security intelligence with offerings like Resilient and QRadar. Our clients using QRadar Advisor with Watson are seeing measurable results. For example, clients found threats 60x faster than manual investigations, and complex analysis went from an hour to less than a minute. As you would imagine, nothing matters more than time in these situations. Acceleration in the number of cyber security threats, the increasing requirements of regulatory compliance, including the upcoming GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation and our collaboration with Cisco and other partners on threat intelligence drove strong demand this quarter.
Looking at IoT. Our revenue was up double digits this quarter. We introduced new offerings like IoT for Connected Products as well as key enhancements around security and risk management. We signed nearly 40 new clients to the IoT platform, including a shipping logistics provider, a global electronics components distributor and a leading provider of wireless networking solutions. And the number of developers grew at a strong double-digit rate.
As we've said, an industry lens is key to our cognitive strategy, and this quarter, Watson Health continued to drive double-digit growth with strength in government, oncology and life sciences similar to last quarter. We continue to expand the number of patients touched by Watson across our global ecosystem as well as expand the number of countries. We also had strong growth in Watson Financial Services as clients look to evolve their financial systems to make better informed risk and compliance decisions as well as modernize their core systems like their payment gateways.
Turning to transaction processing software. We had a strong quarter with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients' ongoing long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. This portfolio predominantly runs on-premise mission-critical workloads in industries like banking, airlines and retail running on z Systems. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we're embedding cognitive, scaling platforms and building high-value vertical solutions. We grew revenue in the quarter, which drove total IBM software revenue growth, and we expanded the Cognitive Solutions pretax income margin.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue this quarter. The year-to-year performance is similar to last quarter as we continue to transform the business. We're investing to shift our practices to where we see the opportunity, which is around digital, cognitive, cloud and automation. Over the last 2.5 years, we've added tens of thousands of resources to these areas. We grew double digits in our strategic imperatives, and overall, GBS signings grew for the third consecutive quarter. With modest growth in signings, it takes time for our progress to be reflected in revenue and profit.
Consulting revenue grew 1%, led by our Digital Strategy and iX platform, which is up over 40%. The consulting backlog also returned to growth this quarter. IBM iX is helping clients digitally reinvent themselves. IBM iX was an early mover in the digital space, and we've built a global network where clients can cocreate with us. We now have 36 studios around the world, which gives us unmatched reach.
We recently announced the intention to acquire Vivant, a digital agency based in Australia. This adds to the acquisitions we did last year in Europe and North America to bring in new skills and rapidly expand our global iX capabilities. We're also leveraging strategic partnerships and investing in emerging technologies. In the third quarter, we signed a 5-year collaboration with Volkswagen to develop new mobility services that will utilize our cloud and cognitive capabilities to create highly personalized digital experiences for drivers. We also launched our blockchain services practice that will include more than 1,500 consultants who can help enterprises implement blockchain-enabled business models.
Application management revenue declined 3%. We grew in the practices that help clients implement new cloud-centric architectures in their critical applications. We're leveraging our incumbency to modernize their application suites by implementing cloud-based micro services and helping them build cloud native applications into their environments. 
Overall performance was impacted by areas that are not as differentiated, where we're seeing pricing pressure and driving productivity for our clients.
Turning to profit. Our Global Business Services gross profit margin declined with similar to last quarter. The GBS PTI margin of 10.8% is up 3 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance improved by over 1 point. The GBS margin has been impacted by the investments we're making to drive our transformation. We're acquiring to bring in important new skills and scale them across the organization. We're investing in the enablement of our practitioners, shifting resources to new areas while also hiring top talent. The margin dynamics also reflect pricing and profit pressure in the more traditional IT services such as back-office implementations of on-premise applications and parts of the global processing services business. As we go forward, we're focused on improving our productivity with a streamlined practice model and new project management approaches.
So in summary, for GBS, the revenue and profit trajectory was similar to last quarter. Consulting returned to growth, while application management decelerated. We continue to grow in our practices around cloud, analytics and mobility services, and we're investing in our skills to continue to drive our GBS transformation.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $8.5 billion of revenue with year-to-year performance similar to last quarter. We continue to grow revenue double digits in our strategic imperatives led by cloud. The annual as-a-service run rate for the segment is now $6.2 billion. With good momentum in our cloud offerings, we grew overall GTS signings by over 25%. Our total services backlog trajectory improved by 2 points compared to last quarter as we returned to backlog growth in infrastructure services. GTS continues to be the market share leader and is nearly 2x the size of our largest competitor.
Looking at the lines of business. Infrastructure services revenue was down 5%. This reflects the fact that we haven't yet wrapped on the year-to-year headwinds that we talked about earlier this year, and we're not yet yielding the full benefit from some of the new contracts we signed in the first half. In addition, we're shifting away from some lower-value work. We had strong signings performance in infrastructure services this quarter as clients look to implement hybrid cloud environments. They turn to the IBM Cloud because it's designed for data, AI and security, and it's the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud and legacy data centers through a single architecture. For example, at BBVA, the second largest bank in Spain, we signed an agreement to transform their current infrastructure. This will create the foundation for them to move ahead with their cloud strategy. We'll work with BBVA to optimize their infrastructure while enabling them to maintain control of their data and operations.
Technical support services revenue was down 2%. We're focused on driving our multi-vendor support offerings, which provide our clients with a single source of expertise and visibility across different vendor solutions. For example, we're working with HSBC to support data center maintenance of banking locations across 60 countries. In the U.S., we're providing an integrated solution to Walgreens that includes retail analytics and IBM Cloud infrastructure to improve the efficiency of field service support at over 8,100 drugstores nationwide. And in South Korea, we're deploying a multi-vendor support solution with Hana Financial Group to standardize the IT maintenance systems at 3 of Hana's subsidiary groups.
Looking at the software content within the segment. Integration software revenue was down 3%, and within that, we continue to have strong growth in SaaS across the portfolio as we help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments. This was offset by declines in areas like on-premise DevOps and IT service management. 
Turning to profit. Gross profit margin for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was down 1 point year-to-year, consistent with last quarter's performance. The PTI margin of 13.8% is up 2 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance is also about 2 points better than last quarter. We're yielding savings from actions we've taken, and we continue to focus on delivering productivity to our clients. We're investing to expand our cloud infrastructure, which is currently impacting our margin. With nearly 60 cloud centers across 19 countries, the IBM Cloud provides our clients with the flexibility to store data however and wherever they choose.
We're also focused on scaling the IBM services platform with Watson that we announced in July. This is a delivery platform that is designed to identify and predict potential problems and self-heal. The platform will redefine service delivery and quality, providing significant competitive advantages to our clients.
So to summarize Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, the revenue and profit declines this quarter were similar to last quarter. We continue to see momentum in cloud, grew signings double digits and improved our services backlog year-to-year performance. We're continuing to invest in our cloud infrastructure, and we're transforming our services delivery platform with Watson.
In Systems, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. Performance was driven by a combination of strong z14 acceptance and growth in storage. Power declined, consistent with where we are in that product cycle. Our systems margin was up year-to-year and sequentially as mainframe and storage margins grew while Power margin was flat.
IBM z revenue grew 62% year-to-year on 33% MIPS growth, and margins expanded after a successful launch of the z14 program in mid-September. This success is due to the strong demand for technology that helps address the growing threat of global data breaches and the need to operate within regulated environments. Our new z14 mainframe, with its unprecedented encryption capabilities, encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all the time without the possibility of human intervention. And that's with no application change and no performance impact. So the appeal is obvious, and we had good traction across a broad mix of industries and geographies. And across the z platform, we're addressing emerging workloads in areas like blockchain, machine learning and new payment systems.
For example, when banks are trying to figure out how to manage new requirements within the EU's payment modernization initiative, they come to us. Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, IBM z provides the necessary reliability, scalability and security, and that's why we had key wins in instant payments this quarter.
The Power revenue was down 8% year-to-year, driven by declines in UNIX, though UNIX high-end systems grew again. We continue to have good growth in Linux, and with double-digit growth in Linux workloads, Linux on Power now represents over 20% of our Power portfolio. Later this quarter, we will deliver our next-gen POWER9 to market, starting with 2 U.S. Department of Energy supercomputing centers. This is strong evidence of the importance of Power to the high-performance computing market, and we'll roll out commercial POWER9 solutions throughout 2018. So in an era of cognitive and AI, where data is fundamental to our enterprise clients, Power is demonstrably better for Linux machine learning and deep learning workloads, the workloads of the future, and that's why we're committed to the Power platform.
Storage hardware was up 4%, and as I said earlier, this is the third consecutive quarter of storage revenue growth. We had growth across our major hardware product areas, including in key mid-range and high-end product lines, which grew double digits. Our all-flash array offerings, once again, grew strong double digits, in line with the high-growth market. And our storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions, also had double-digit growth in software-defined storage, reflecting the shift in value to software.
So to summarize Systems, our year-to-year revenue grew double digits, and gross and pretax margins expanded with strong performance in z Systems. This reflects our focus on continually reinventing this portfolio to address new workloads.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had another good quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. After nearly $800 million in capital investments, we delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow, and that's up modestly, reflecting strong working capital performance and lower workforce rebalancing payments as well as higher cash taxes year-to-year.
We're continuing to convert our net income to free cash flow at a high rate with our free cash flow realization at 96% over the last 12 months. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we've generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down just under $800 million. You'll recall that in the first quarter our free cash flow was down $1.2 billion year-to-year, driven entirely by the foreign cash tax refund we received last year. Now with free cash flow growth in the second and third quarters, we've reduced the year-to-year decline. As we generate profit consistent with our EPS guidance and with a tailwind in both our workforce rebalancing payments and cash taxes in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be relatively flat year-to-year.
In terms of uses of cash, over the last 9 months, we've returned $7.8 billion to our shareholders, including $4.1 billion in dividends and $3.7 billion to buy back almost 23 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had 926 million shares outstanding and $1.5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet. We continue to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash, and total debt was $45.6 billion. Both are higher than year-end, driven by the timing of our term debt issuances. About 2/3 of our debt was in support of our financing business and includes our first public debt issuance of $3 billion in the third quarter out of our newly reorganized financing entity. This business continues to be leveraged at a debt-to-equity ratio of 9:1. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade. That's flat versus December and 1 point better than a year ago. And as always, we've included more information on our financing business in the supplemental charts in the backup.
Now let me wrap up with a quick summary of the third quarter and some comments on considerations for the fourth. 90 days ago, I talked about planting the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement of the trajectory of our business, which would result in a second half that was improved over the first. Now in the third quarter, we've improved our year-to-year revenue and margin trajectory. This was led by strong performance in our Cognitive Solutions and Systems segments. And our strategic imperatives revenue across our segments grew at 10%, reflecting our success in embedding cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer.
As we look to the fourth quarter, as always, we've got a range of scenarios, especially when you consider the typical large transactional base in our fourth quarter. Last year, we increased revenue by $2.5 billion from third to fourth quarter. This year, we'd expect stronger sequential performance due in part to the mainframe cycle, so perhaps, $300 million to $400 million more. And of course, that, quarter-to-quarter, will depend on currency, too.
Now looking at gross margin. We've had good progression over the last couple of quarters, driven by mix and some moderation in the headwinds from investments. In the fourth quarter, again, we have a number of scenarios, but all are consistent with the sequential improvement we've seen over the last few years, so an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 points in gross margin from third to fourth quarter.
For expense, we've been driving efficiency in our spend base, and we'll continue to do that. But keep in mind that with a weaker dollar, currency hedges will impact the expense line. And regarding IP income, we have a great list of opportunities, and we expect to close some of them. But as always, we're certainly not relying on all of them.
And then finally, let me comment on tax. As we've discussed in the past, our tax rate reflects our mix of business, both country and product mix. As we enter the fourth quarter with a seasonally large transaction base, we continue to see an ongoing operational tax rate of 15%, plus or minus 3 points as the right range. And as you know, that's not changed since we provided EPS guidance back in January. Remember, we widened the range in 2017 because of the tax reform discussions currently underway at a political level. In common with many companies, those tax reform discussions could still result in IBM taking planning actions this year.
We also may have discrete tax items in the fourth quarter. At this point, we don't know if or how much and then how much will be absorbed by other actions. However, as we sit here today, entering the fourth quarter, our views on tax remain unchanged. So you put all of this together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we'll take your questions.",4585

Do you see a path to year-on-year gross margin expansion at some point over the next year? And do you think that you can achieve that even as the mainframe contribution slows in a couple of quarters?",63

Thanks, Katy. So a couple of things. One, while the mainframe improved a bit of the mix, it's also software mix that helped in the quarter. So I wouldn't attribute it all to mainframe. And as you know and as we've been talking about, we've been focused on the productivity in our services business. So there are multiple contributors coming out of the third, which will also drive in the fourth some improvement. So what we said in the -- in our prepared remarks is we have a range. At the low end of the range, we'd say a very similar kind of a trajectory that we saw in the -- year-to-year trajectory we saw in the third. But at the high end of the range, we would show some more -- an improved trajectory, if you will, relative to the year-to-year. Now as we go into next year, we'll talk more about 2018, obviously, in January when we can see what kind of momentum we have in our software business. We can see what kind of signings momentum we have to drive our services platform. But our model, as you know, is to grow margins. We're not talking about 100 or 150 basis points. Our model is to grow 30, 40, 50 basis points of margins, and I would say that we are going to get there in the next year.",233

Could you just help us understand what is enabling the growth over there? And as you think about December quarter and potentially beyond that, how sustainable do you think this growth is as you go forward?",48
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2017",2017-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3382.0,1314810.0,52802699.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks, Amit. So a couple things on the historical side. We saw good growth, pretty broad-based growth in the solutions software categories, and that includes, obviously, our analytics business. It includes our security business, and we got good double-digit growth across many industries, including health and FSS and our Watson Health and FSS categories as well so pretty good, broad-based improvement in solutions software. As you know, also within that segment is our transaction processing software business, which was also up in the quarter so good execution in quarter. As we go into fourth now we're not relying on growth coming out of the TPS part of that business. Now that business, it's important for us to make sure we maintain high renewal rates in our S&S categories, for instance, which we have. That drives then this kind of strong transactional performance, but we're not relying on that to continue. We do expect, given that our solutions software business has attracted a lot of investment, I think that, that team has positioned itself pretty well to continue to see growth going into the fourth.",185

I think, historically, at your Analyst Day, you said that 45% of mainframe revenue is actually strategic imperatives, and you commented about how transaction processing software was -- a lot of it was mainframe related. So to that end, maybe you could tell us what strategic imperative growth would have been ex mainframe in the quarter and also, for Cognitive Solutions, how we would think about growth ex software that runs in the mainframe in the quarter with the intention of really trying to understand, given that mainframe cycles are pretty cyclical, how much of the growth that you're seeing in strategic imperatives and cognitive was aided by mainframe in the quarter?",153
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2017",2017-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3382.0,1314810.0,52802702.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Sure, Toni. I'll -- I think I got it all. I'll try to address them kind of piece by piece. So from a mainframe perspective, and we've talked about this in the past, the hardware part of the cycle is quite profound, and we spent a lot of time explaining what we expect to see on the hardware side. The software side is not as tied to a cycle. The software side has obviously tied to the platform, but the cycle for software does not coincide or isn't tied in any way to the hardware cycle. And then the other part of the business that I would say -- or 2 other parts of the business that I think are important, on the maintenance side, the maintenance business is impacted by the hardware cycle because of the warranty period that kicks in with new mainframes. Now the bulk of that hasn't obviously happened yet because we're only 2 weeks in here at the end of the quarter. So no real tie on software. Maintenance gets impacted. The other business that benefits from the mainframe cycle is our Global Financing business. And most -- I think all -- nearly all mainframes are financed through Global Financing, certainly, 90% or so attach rate in that business, so that will help the volumes. But given that the business itself probably had the volumes before it, it maintains its position as opposed to grows the asset base dramatically. So GF volumes will improve in the quarter. With regard to the strategic imperatives, and we've talked a lot about how 12 months or trailing 12-month period is the right way to look at it, given that we, in the cycle for the hardware side, have been -- our strategic imperatives growth has been held back, if you will, by the mainframe cycle, obviously, was helped a bit -- has helped a little bit in the third. But on a trailing 12-month basis now the mainframe really has become a neutral with regard to the strategic imperatives, really no impact to the growth rate on a trailing 12-month period. So ex mainframe trailing 12 months, strategic imperatives are the exact same number. Now they'll contribute a bit as they become -- when we get to the biggest quarter in the fourth, but on a trailing 12-month basis, no impact.",393

So well, first, I'd like to thank you for pointing out that we have had a pretty dramatic headwind. In fact, I think, from the time I have been in this job now this is my 15th call. I think, I've only had one other call where it was a small tailwind. And this was a small tailwind as well in the quarter, and hopefully, we've wrapped on some of the big, more profound FX. When we look at a dramatic impact like what happened in 2015 and the strengthening of the dollar from a cash perspective, that cost us, just on the translation, if you will, of translating all that cash back to U.S. dollars. It was like a $2 billion impact. Now we hedge our cash flows, and so that helps defer the impact if you will. But when you have a dramatic move like that, the impact is still more than $1 billion from a cash perspective. Now the margin impact is a little bit different, and depending on the broad-based nature of a dollar move, it will be anywhere from a small positive to a small negative. But the real impact again is the absolutes in terms of what it's doing to profit and what it's doing to cash.",216

We'll talk about each of those pieces. Maybe I'll start from the most recent, not just because I remember that one the best, by the way, because you just said it. But -- so first, from a strategic imperative margin perspective, our margins in strategic imperatives, this is across IBM, remain higher than the margins in -- outside, if you will, the strategic imperative revenue streams. And as we've always said, that's a good indication that the future is obviously better than the past. Now that has a couple of elements to it. In the case of the IBM -- broad IBM businesses, some of that's driven by mix because we have a better software content in those strategic imperatives than we do in the core. In the case of GBS, it is actually that the pricing is -- we're better able to differentiate and capture the pricing, if you will, in those strategic imperative areas. So you think about the design studios we built around the world and you think about how we bring skills to help our clients transform their digital interactions with their clients, that is -- it's important work. Clients value it highly, and when you have good skills and global capabilities, you can earn good returns. The GBS team, I think, has positioned themselves pretty well for getting the benefit, if you will, of that shift and moving more and more into their strategic imperatives. And our work says that the margins are, in fact, higher as they move into those new areas. There is still, though -- we still have some labor focused on some of these older areas that are less differentiated, and as we noted in our prepared remarks, those see margin pressure. And this is a competitive industry, so it's not only competitive where there's less differentiation. We're not confused by the competition in even in the newer areas. So we know we have to keep moving our teams and re-skilling and making sure that we are at the forefront of those new areas. But those older areas are also very competitive, and a lot of our competitors would look at those as kind of access points where they haven't developed yet the most robust skills. They look at those as access points to get into our clients. So we're still experiencing that phenomena.",397

I think you got $4 billion plus of tax credits and NOLs remaining. So it feels like you could see a number of discretes over time and perhaps see a tax rate consistently below 15% even if it's not always predictable. How do you think about that? And how much cash impact is there with these tax credits and NOLs going forward?",71
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2017",2017-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3382.0,1314810.0,52802711.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Sure, Steve. So a few things. On the rate itself, we're at, as we said, 15% -- from the way we've been thinking about it and talking about how it's embedded in our guidance, we're at 15%, plus or minus 3 ex discretes. And that's been consistent since we started the year. Now we just came out of the third quarter when -- and quite frankly, kind of a rare 90-day period when you do business in 162 countries. We had no discrete tax events, so somewhat rare, but it is what it is. We can neither predict nor necessarily predict the magnitude or the timing of discrete tax events by their very nature. Now we do take, as you know, which causes the $4 billion or so of deferred tax liabilities or assets, we do take a pretty conservative view on how we book -- how we run a book against our tax, and that's what's creates these discrete tax events, which, by and large for us, tend to be -- tend to come back into the income statement as opposed to finding that something's going to flow out because discretes, let's face it, discretes can go either way. They can be helps or hurts. For us, by and large, because we're pretty conservative, they tend to be helps. We don't know in terms of what could happen in the fourth quarter. Again, the 90-day period we just went through was somewhat rare, and we don't know if and we don't know when and we don't know how much they might be. But yes, we do -- our principle of how conservative we are has not changed, and therefore, I would expect that the discretes will be more credits than debits. But it was, again, a kind of a unique period. So we'll see where we go through the fourth. From a rate perspective, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 3 -- the plus or minus 3 points is the right way to think about it given the discussions going on around tax reform. And then, obviously, we don't know -- we have assumptions about the mix of the business, but the assumptions change, particularly when you're in the biggest part of the year. And then we'll see what happens as we go through the quarter on discretes.",391

Is there the view that within IBM and externally that the demand for this product could be -- take us out of the slow and steady decline that mainframes have been doing? Is it that good of a product? Or how should we kind of think about it as far as the mainframe cycle, which typically last kind of 3 to 4 years?",77
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2017",2017-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3382.0,1314810.0,52802714.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Yes. So a couple of things, Tim. So first, this new mainframe -- and the mainframe's always redesigned, rebuilt for the most contemporary workloads. This new mainframe addresses what is probably top of mind in every board discussion. It is top of mind for every CIO, and it's top of mind for the whole C suite, which is the problem of cyber security. So it addresses it in a way that nobody else can address it, and it's been, as we said, very well received by the marketplace. Now the mainframe was reinvented in the last instantiation to address mobile and cloud and analytics. And before that, it was reinvented to address the performance and the capacity needs to help our clients optimize their own data centers. So we've gone through -- as we always do, we go through a process by which we work with our clients to address how we can make sure that the mainframe retains their most important workloads, and included in that discussion is bringing new workloads onto it. And we've done some of that. We add new clients. So the long-term outlook for the mainframe and the model for the mainframe is to be a very stable business, very high value and one that's going to obviously be cyclical on the hardware side because of the cycle. But we actually see, given how we've reinvented it this time, that -- and the teams are working on this to try to figure out, yes, we're not just talking about new workloads, which we obviously have within our existing clients. There are not too many businesses out there. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find one that isn't -- that doesn't have workloads that can benefit from being rewritten and run on the mainframe given the capabilities it has. Now that is not a process that's going to sort itself out in 2 weeks. Things that run in an x86 environment and things that run on other platforms have to be reworked. They have to come into the mainframe platform. We've got a terrific group of developers and lab services that help the teams do that not only for existing clients but can do it for new clients as well. So given the problems this mainframe solves, I do think that there is an opportunity for us to further expand the market by further expanding the kind of workloads and the relevance that it plays in new environments.",413

Can you maybe give us some sense about, given the customer-specific issues, whether you see growth -- a return to growth in GTS for next year? And can you maybe comment on the kind of bookings trends you're seeing in the GBS in particular?",67
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2017",2017-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3382.0,1314810.0,52802717.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Sure, sure. Thanks, Jim. So a couple things. The team did, in GTS, they did a nice job in delivering pretty good signings growth. Now this is a big backlog of business, and they've managed in the infrastructure services side to get that backlog back to be flat for the -- now coming out of the quarter. And they -- when they look at their opportunity pool, they see a pretty good quarter in terms of signings. All of that's going to determine whether or not we see how quickly they come back to growth in 2018, and we'll talk more about that in January. Within that, I think it's important to note that the reason they're -- they've been successful not only in the most recent quarter but over the long term, the reason that backlog's holding up so well and we would expect it to get back to growth with a strong signings execution is because they are doing the most contemporary work for our clients. They are taking our clients and new clients into the kinds of cloud environments that they want. So they're being successful because they are moving to the future not because they're doing the same things that they've always been doing for clients. And I think the GTS team has done a nice job, again, in third quarter in executing some large deals, but their value proposition is as robust as it ever has been. On the GBS side, we did see growth again in the signings in the quarter. It was only 2%, which was a slowdown from where we've been. But 3 quarters of growth now and what that's been able to do for the GBS team is get that consulting backlog back to growth in the quarter. And the team has been very focused on delivering high value to our clients and rebuilding the skills in that consulting base in order to do that. So the consulting backlog being up is certainly a good starting point, but the backlog in total is still down. And so as we've said in the past, consistent signings growth will get to backlog growth, which will get to revenue growth. And I still think they're on that path, although we are going to have to accelerate from the low single-digit signings in order to make that go faster. So they've positioned themselves well in the fourth to have a lot of opportunities to try to close. We'll see how the fourth quarter goes for GBS as well, and that, too, like GTS, will determine how we enter 2018.",434

Did you feel good about that carrying into the fourth quarter given the demand environment as you see it today? I think you said that you're not counting on transactional revenue in the fourth quarter. Does that mean we could see upside potential if 3Q trends persist? Just wanted to clarify that.",70

So no, what you heard was a fair reflection of what we're counting on, which is we're not counting on continued strong growth in parts of that portfolio, things like transaction processing software. But make no mistake, the team is working on driving transactional performance in parts of that business, which, quite frankly, we have a pretty hot hand in. We have got a hot hand in security. We've got a hot hand in some of the IoT space. So we will continue to see good growth in parts of the business. And then for software in total, our as-a-services business continues to grow quite well, and we would expect to continue to see the as-a-service performance continue to grow. As-a-service in total was up to a $9.4 billion run rate when we exited, and that's pretty good sequential improvement from where we were in the second. And we'll -- we would expect that the fourth will also drive some growth. But again, the -- we're not relying on the TPS part of the business necessarily to grow, but our customer engagement business, our security business, these are businesses that have drawn a lot of investment. And they've got a hot hand, and they'll continue to perform.",209

And the results relative to the rest of the businesses are still demonstrating challenges, both on top line and on the margin profile. And the context of the question is, as you mentioned, application management is still experiencing challenge, and all participants in the industry seem to be echoing the same thing. So if application management continues to experience challenges, what are the conditions that allow GBS to improve? And in particular, as you look at FY '18, is it -- how should we be thinking about expectations if we just isolate on the margin profile? If application management continues to experience those challenges, is it reasonable to assume that margins could flatten out? But any comments there on broadly on the role of ADM within the context of GBS.",141

I mean, for us, this business is all about helping our clients move to the cloud. So where we're helping clients implement cloud-centric architectures, we're moving them to next-gen apps like Salesforce and Workday, and we've built terrific skills. We've even acquired skills to help accelerate this. There is plenty of room for us to both differentiate, to get growth and to have good margin performance. So in those areas, which are -- where we're more able to differentiate, I think there is a good future there, and that's what the team is focused on. And then in the other parts of the business, as I mentioned, the other parts of that business where it's more difficult to differentiate and where others who haven't built the kind of skill base that we have are trying to get inroads, yes, then there is some price pressure. But that's not the future. The future for us is helping our clients move to those cloud-centric architectures and the cloud -- the next-gen apps, which is what the team has positioned themselves well to continue to do not only in the fourth but going into 2018.
So let me wrap up the call and first by saying thanks for joining us today. As we said at the start of the year and then we reiterated again in July, we said we'd see improved trajectories in the second half of the year relative to the first half. Then, we talked about the drivers of that change. Our third quarter performance certainly reinforce that. And while we have more to get done in the fourth, it shows we're on the right course. And it also shows, quite frankly, that our confidence in our strategy is very well placed. So thanks again for joining us today, and we'll talk to you in January.",307
