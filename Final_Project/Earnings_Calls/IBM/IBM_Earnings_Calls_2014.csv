As we get into the first quarter results, you'll see that our performance reflects the actions we talked about in our last call. We're transitioning to key growth areas and transforming parts of the business. 
In the quarter, we announced a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand our SoftLayer cloud hubs. We launched BlueMix, our new Platform as a Service, to speed deployment of hybrid clouds. We acquired both Aspera and Cloudant to extend our capabilities in Big Data and cloud. We're expanding our ecosystem around OpenPOWER, and we created an integrated business unit around Watson and announced a $1 billion investment to bring cognitive capabilities to the enterprise. 
As we move to these growth areas, we're also taking portfolio actions to divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile. In January, we had the initial closing for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, and we announced the sale of our industry-standard server business to our partner, Lenovo. 
This quarter, as expected, we took a substantial charge to align our resources and skills to the demand profile we see. This charge impacts our results this quarter, but it will pay back within the year. 
So we got a lot done this quarter. Many of these actions impact our top and bottom line in the short term, but have long-term benefits. 
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $22.5 billion and operating EPS of $2.54. Our Software performance was driven by 5% constant currency growth in Key Branded Middleware. We're continuing to see strong client demand and great results in areas like mobile, cloud and security, where we've been targeting our investments. 
Our Services business was up 2% at constant currency, with growth in both Services segments adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. The growth reflects our expanded cloud offerings, the ramp in some of the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year and good performance in both Consulting and Systems Integration. 
Looking at Hardware. As expected, the combination of secular and cyclical challenges continued. Last quarter, I talked about business model challenges specific to POWER, Storage and System x. Let me tell you about some of the actions we've taken. As I mentioned, we're selling our industry-standard server business to Lenovo. We are repositioning POWER and building an ecosystem around OpenPOWER and we've taken actions across POWER and storage to rightsize the business to the market dynamics. Our System z performance in both revenue growth and margin reflects that we're 6 quarters into the product cycle, though on solid ground secularly. 
Looking at the financial metrics for our operating results this quarter. IBM's revenue was down 4%, or 1% at constant currency adjusting for the customer care divestiture. That's a 2-point sequential improvement from our fourth quarter rate. We had constant currency growth in Software, Services and Financing, which was more than offset by a decline in Systems and Technology. The currency impact to revenue growth was about 1.5. Currency was also a headwind to our profit performance, reflecting impacts from the yen and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. 
This quarter we improved gross margin by 90 basis points, driven by Services and our ongoing mix to Software. The profit dynamics below the gross profit line are impacted by the charge of nearly $900 million for workforce rebalancing as well as a gain of about $100 million for the sale of our customer care business and so are not representative of our future run rate. 
Our pretax income was down 19% and net income down 22%. Within net income, our tax rate was worse by 2.7 points year-to-year. The 20% rate in the quarter reflects our view of the annual operating tax rate for 2014. 
This quarter, we returned significant value to shareholders, including over $8 billion of gross share repurchases and $1 billion in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $600 million, which was down $1.1 billion year-to-year. In January, we highlighted a substantial cash tax headwind for 2014. This was skewed to first quarter, and cash tax payments were up $1.4 billion year-to-year. So without the cash tax increase, our free cash flow was up $300 million. 
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant-currency basis. Americas revenue was down 2% year-to-year, consistent with last quarter's performance. We had strong growth in Software, but Hardware performance, especially in the U.S., remains challenged. Once again, we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. 
EMEA was up 1%. The improvement was driven by a return to growth in both Germany and Italy. 
In Asia Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. Asia Pacific outside of Japan declined. 
In total, major markets were down 1%, with improvement from last quarter's performance driven by EMEA. 
The growth markets were down 5%, and within the growth markets, we had high single-digit growth in Latin America. But revenue from the Asia Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate with continued weakness in China. Our revenue in China was down 20%, so pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve. Because we view the bulk of the challenges in the growth markets as cyclical and we still see good opportunity over the long term, we're continuing to invest in these key markets to capture that opportunity. 
Turning to the segment perspective. I've already commented on the revenue drivers, and will address those further in the Services, Software and Hardware discussions. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved 90 basis points. We expanded margins in both Services segments, and the relative strength in our Software business drove an improving mix. The improvements are mitigated by a 5-point decline in Systems and Technology. The Systems decline is driven by a combination of margin degradation in POWER and Storage and a mix away from higher-margin z due to the product cycle. Consistent with these product cycle dynamics, our margin in System z is up year-over-year. 
Our total operating expense and other income was up 8% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth, while currency was fairly neutral to expense performance. So what we've labeled as base expense on the chart, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was up 7 points. 
There are a couple of larger items that are impacting this base expense. First, SG&A includes a workforce rebalancing charge of about $870 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. We expect this to pay back within the year. The workforce rebalancing activity impacted the SG&A base performance by 16 points. So without the charges in both years, our SG&A base expense would have been better 3 points year-to-year. 
And second, within Other income and Expense, you see the gain of nearly $100 million from the sale of our customer care business. We anticipate a gain of a similar amount in the second quarter as we complete the country closings. Adjusting for both of these items, our total base expense would have been better by 4 points rather than worse by 7 points. The 4-point improvement is more indicative of the productivity in the base expense we delivered in the quarter. 
I want to comment on another dynamic in our base expense. Within the base, we're continuing to shift our spending. So for example, the $1.5 billion of R&D spending this quarter reflects the shift of development priorities to where we see future growth. Our recent launch of BlueMix is a great example. We will be investing $1 billion to deliver unique Platform as a Service capabilities to connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud. We'll talk more about how we're shifting investments in our investor briefing in May. 
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported, and modest growth at constant currency. Adjusting for the customer care divestiture, total Services were up 2% at constant currency, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Services pretax profit was down 14%, and margin declined by 1.9 points. Without the workforce rebalancing charges in both years, profit was up 7% and margin expanded by 1.5 points. Total backlog was $138 billion, which includes a reduction of $3.8 billion for the customer care divestiture. Backlog was up 1% at constant currency when adjusted for the divestiture. 
Turning to the 2 segments. Global Technology Services revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% as reported and down 1% at constant currency, but up 2% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture. Within GTS, our SoftLayer platform provides a highly differentiated solution for clients looking to deploy across public, private or hybrid clouds unified on one platform. The range and scope of production workloads has been expanding. We have good growth in Enterprise Transformation projects, and the introduction of BlueMix has generated broad interest with application developers. This quarter, SoftLayer contributed about 1 point to GTS's revenue growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're spending $1.2 billion to expand our global cloud footprint. We'll double our SoftLayer centers. And with 40 cloud data centers in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. GTS outsourcing returned to growth at 1% constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. Growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on during 2013. 
GTS pretax profit declined 15% in the quarter. This includes a 20-point year-to-year impact from workforce rebalancing charges. GTS pretax profit also includes a gain of about $100 million for the divestiture. Keep in mind that GTS profit is impacted by the divestiture of those operations. In addition, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining traction but are not yet at scale. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, flat year-to-year as reported and up 2% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 5% at constant currency, driven by the practices that address the digital front office. We delivered growth across cloud and business analytics, and we had good success in projects for clients on systems of engagement and helping clients connect these new front-end capabilities to their back-end systems and processes. In fact, we are ranked #1 in overall business consulting and cloud professional services by IDC and #1 in mobility consulting services by Forrester, a good indication of our success in front office transformations.  
We're continuing to invest strategically, and in March, we committed $100 million to expand our consulting services capability with 10 new IBM Interactive labs and 1,000 employees to address client experience design and engagement.  
Application outsourcing was down 8% at constant currency. Our performance reflects increased pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects.  
Turning to profit. GBS declined 11% year-to-year. Without the workforce rebalancing charges, profit would have been up double digit, reflecting improved productivity in the base. 
Software revenue was up 2% to $5.7 billion. Key Branded Middleware grew 5% at constant currency. Our enterprise clients continued to rely on IBM's middleware solutions to transform their infrastructure and handle their business-critical transactions. We deliver this through a combination of on-premise and SaaS Solutions. Our SaaS offerings span our software brands, and this quarter, our SaaS revenue grew more than 25% year-to-year. 
Looking at our results by brand. WebSphere had another strong quarter, up 12% year-to-year, led by app server and mobile solutions. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services that enables our clients to manage, integrate and leverage mobile devices. We've been building capabilities to address this space, and we now have over 3,000 mobile experts. Across Software and Services, IBM's mobile business doubled from the prior year.  
Our application server business delivered strong growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is an example of our clients utilizing on-premise software to manage the infrastructure workloads driven by mobile, Big Data and analytics. This is the 13th year in a row that Gartner named IBM the market share leader in application infrastructure and middleware software. And with 30% market share, we are nearly double the size of our closest competitor. 
Information Management software was up 2% at constant currency. Growth was led by distributed database and master data management, which are key elements of our Big Data and analytics solutions. This quarter, we added Database as a Service capability with the acquisition of Cloudant. Cloudant extends IBM's mobile and cloud platforms by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next-generation mobile and web applications. 
Tivoli grew revenue 7%. This quarter, we had growth in all 3 of Tivoli's product segments: systems management, storage and security. Security grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our results are being driven in part by incremental requirements for security as clients expand into cloud and mobile computing. Our portfolio of security offerings across IBM grew more than 20% this quarter. 
Workforce solutions declined 4% at constant currency. Strong growth in our SaaS offerings were more than offset by a decline in our on-premise Notes business. We are transforming our business and building up the recurring streams from SaaS. 
I mentioned earlier that in the first quarter, we launched BlueMix, which will make all of our middleware accessible via the cloud. With BlueMix, developers can efficiently build cloud applications with reusable pieces of code tied to their enterprise systems. This enables businesses to leverage the flexibility that cloud applications provide. 
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 23%. This reflects both the product cycle of System z and the secular challenges in POWER, storage and System x. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lenovo to divest our System x business. And in the first quarter, we continued to reposition offerings in other parts of our Hardware business to make them more relevant, and we took actions to align our structure to the demand profile we see. 
Looking at our results this quarter. System z revenue was down 40% with MIPS down 19% year-to-year. We're in our sixth quarter of the product cycle, and gross profit margin was up year-to-year, consistent with this point in the cycle. System z is a core franchise which provides mission-critical infrastructure for our customers, and we continue to invest in the platform. It's worth noting that earlier this month, we celebrated the mainframe's 50th year. 
POWER revenue declined 21% at constant currency. We are aggressively repositioning this platform with a couple of key initiatives. First, the OpenPOWER Consortium makes POWER technology available to an open development alliance. This quarter, we expanded our OpenPOWER ecosystem. And second, we are expanding our Linux capabilities through our POWER8 launch this year. POWER8 is the first processor built for Big Data and delivers better cloud economics. 
Storage hardware revenue was down 23%. Our flash solutions contributed growth again this quarter. However, we saw substantial weakness in high-end storage. 
As we've discussed, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base. The repositioning of the POWER platform, the announcement of POWER8, new announcements in storage and the rightsizing in the business will all contribute as we move through the rest of the year. This, together with the divestiture of System x, will result in a smaller and more profitable Hardware business going forward. IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems, in storage and in cognitive computing, and we'll continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $600 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down $1.1 billion year-to-year. As you can see, our CapEx was up nearly $200 million year-to-year, which includes investment in additional SoftLayer capacity. But the real driver of the year-to-year decline was a $1.4 billion increase in tax payments, driven by audit settlement payments and other prior period discrete tax impacts that settled this quarter. Excluding the increased tax payments, free cash flow would have been up $300 million year-to-year.  
Looking at the uses of our cash, we spent almost $300 million in acquisitions, acquiring Aspera and Cloudant. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 45 million shares for $8.2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
I want to remind you that our free cash flow generation is always skewed to the back end of the year. In fact if you look over the last 10 years, the average free cash flow generated in the first quarter is less than 5% of our full year total. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion, which was down $1.4 billion from December. Total debt was $44 billion, which includes $28.3 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $15.7 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 55%. Given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50s for the next 2 quarters and roughly flat year-to-year at year end. 
So now let me wrap up the discussion on the quarter. There are major shifts in our industry driven by data, cloud and changes in the way individuals are engaging. This quarter, we had good performance in our offerings that address these shifts. Our business analytics revenue was up 6% at constant currency on a large base. Our cloud revenue was up over 50% with doubling of our Cloud as a Service business, and we had strong growth in mobile and security. 
Just as importantly, we continue to take significant actions to move to these growth areas. I talked about some of the targeted investments we're making, including SoftLayer capacity, BlueMix and Watson. 
We're focused on allocating our capital efficiently and effectively, which means investing in the right places as well as moving away from areas that don't support our shift to higher value. This is an important part of our model. In fact, over the last few years, including the recently announced sale of our industry-standard server business, we've divested over $6 billion of revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant business. 
As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our Hardware business and the customer care divestiture. The currency impact to revenue moderates at current spot rates, but we do expect currency to continue to impact profit. Our margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives and actions to improve our cost base as well as the relative strength of Software. And as always, we reinvest some of the productivity savings to drive our growth areas. 
I mentioned earlier that our annual effective tax rate for 2014 is 20%, and that's before any potential discrete tax items. And of course, we'll continue to return value to our shareholders. 
For the year, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. This does not include any gain from the sale of our System x business to Lenovo because of the uncertainty of the timing and the amount. But it will ultimately be included in our operating EPS results, and we'll update you later in the year. Like always, we manage our business and allocate capital for the long term. And along the way, we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.  
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.",3339

And secondly, in terms of goal setting, you now have a much lower tax rate for the full year than you anticipated 3 months ago. I think that's going to add about $0.70 to EPS that was not anticipated 3 months ago. You also mentioned there may be discrete items. So I'd like to understand on that, a, why the tax rate changed so significantly in 3 months? And secondly, do you have anticipated discrete items over the course of the year, and can you share those with us?",113
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578174.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,6,"Sure. Sure, Toni. I guess first on free cash flow is, as we noted in the prepared remarks, our free cash flow was $600 million in the quarter and down about $1.1 billion year-to-year. Now as we noted, that's a -- it represents -- the first quarter always represents a fairly small amount. Now to answer your question, I'm going to go through some math in a second. But to answer your question, we still do expect to grow free cash flow year-to-year even though we do have a tax headwind this year. So the short answer to your question is yes, we still expect to grow free cash flow. When we adjust -- when we look at our free cash flow on a year-to-year basis and we start to put in a more normal -- like a model tax rate, if you will, so we had, as you can see in our data, a big tax headwind. But in total, we paid -- we paid about $2.6 billion of cash taxes in the year. So that's an 80% rate in the quarter. Obviously, that's not a rate driven by our model. It's not driven by the way the business runs. But it just reflects really the tax audit that we finished in the fourth quarter and the related payments around that. So we had a very high rate in the quarter. Last year, we had a rate of about 30%. And so that $1.4 billion year-to-year, which we identified as driving -- would have driven $300 million year-to-year. The fact is on kind of a rate adjusted or model basis, we would have grown faster again. So I'm very comfortable with the free cash flow generation in the business. And I think we are on track to deliver the full year and the cash flow growth. Again, we do have a headwind this year, and the bulk of it was in the first quarter. On the tax rate, we were able to improve our expected full year operating rate to 20% with a more favorable mix of geographic income. And our income -- and our inter-company dividend plan resulted in higher usage of foreign tax credits for the year. So that's our operating tax rate. The rate, however, as you noted, and as we put in the prepared remarks, excludes any potential discrete tax impacts which may occur, and those are, as you know, generally for nonrecurring items. So 2 examples that could affect our rate from here. First, we did announce the sale of our xSeries business. Now that hasn't closed, but that could affect the rate. So the rate could be higher from the sale of the Lenovo business. At the same time, I'm sure you're aware that there are bills being discussed in Washington, tax extender bills, which could lower the rate further. So our operating rate of 20% is ultimately going to reflect not only our mix of geographic income and the intercompany dividend plan, which rolls into that operating tax rate, but it's also ultimately going to reflect the discretes.",516

I mean, given the lower tax rate, as Toni mentioned, you're still offering the same EPS guidance. So without the lower tax rate, it is a net guide down. So if so, could you comment on what exactly has changed above the tax line versus your prior expectations and the expectations you gave us in January?",72
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578177.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure, sure. So we got a lot done in a -- we got a lot done in the first quarter. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks, right? And roughly speaking, if I were to net it down, we continue to move our investments and our resources to where we see the needs of our enterprise clients. And we continue to -- we divested a pretty substantial business in xSeries, that didn't fit our high-value model. So we did get a lot done in the quarter. Now we also, as you would expect, look at the trajectory we see coming out of the quarter in order to get the right guidance for the year. And I guess I'd go through it -- I'll go through it by segment, but first, I think it's important to note that we did not see much improvement in the trajectory in the GMU in the quarter. We were down 5% in the first quarter. We were down 6% in the fourth quarter. So we are not seeing a trajectory improvement. GBS, as an example, just within the GMU, went from high single-digit growth to low single-digit growth. So we are not seeing the trajectory improve in the GMU as an example. Now looking at the segments at a higher level or at a complete segment view, in Services, when you adjust for the charge we took -- because again, we'll earn that charge back through the year -- when you adjust for that charge, we did expand margin in the first quarter and we would expect that to continue. So in Services, relative to last year when we grew profit in low single digits, we're really only counting on kind of mid-single-digit growth across those businesses. In Software, we continue to see an improving growth rate in Software and revenue, which obviously drives profitability. And then in Hardware, Hardware was down 23% constant currency, and we expect both the cyclical and the secular challenges that we see in that space to continue. So as we said in our last call, our focus in Hardware is to really stabilize that profit base on a year-to-year basis. So we do see the shifts we're making into the growth areas are absolutely the right things to do. We are being successful in growing that part of the business. And our 1Q trajectory really reflects, I think, no real improvement in the GMU.",407

Or do you think it's, you're just unfortunately at the bottom of mainframe and POWER cycles and when you include the POWER8 and you include the POWERLinux, think you can sort of grow your way out of it?

I'd say a few things, Rob. First, we -- the mainframe revenue growth absolutely reflects where we are in the cycle. There is not a secular challenge in mainframe at all. So the mainframe growth rates are absolutely cyclical and when we -- it's not a scale issue, when we get to announce a mainframe, that will absolutely turn. In POWER, as we said last time, we did have too much structure. There is a secular issue in POWER, particularly at the low end. Now we've said we were going to address that with a few different actions. First, we said OpenPOWER will be a tremendous benefit to opening up that technology and getting more -- and getting more users on that platform. And we think OpenPOWER over the long term will have a pretty solid impact in improving that platform. Secondly, we said that we have POWER8 coming. We had this in the prepared remarks, and POWER8 is highly relevant to Big Data workloads, relevant to the cloud. And so the secular move from low-end POWER on to industry-based servers, we will battle back with POWER8 and a much better offering in that space. And then thirdly, we did have too much structure in POWER8 -- I'm sorry, in POWER. And we did manage to get a fair bit of a structure out of the business to set a cost base -- and get a cost base into the POWER platform. In total on STG, let's go back to the total for a second. There is obviously a GP margin impact in the first quarter, down year-to-year. Some of that is obviously driven by the mainframe cycle and its lack of contribution, if you will, lack of mix to the high end. Some of it is driven by the cost base. None of the improvements that we've made are really felt in the first quarter. And then it is, relative to what's going to come next in second through fourth. It is the lowest transaction volume quarter. So there is just a high fixed cost base relative to what we have coming forward in the rest of the year. So I think the STG business is on a path that we will achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year, which was to stabilize that cost base and the profit base.",398

First, your share repurchase was very large this quarter. Could you talk about what you anticipate going forward? I'm assuming it was pretty front-end loaded, but kind of what do you seeing for the full year? And perhaps related to that, you've roughly doubled your non-finance debt over the last year. Did you say that you would take that ratio from 55% down to roughly 39% by the end of the year, which is where you ended last year?",85
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578183.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Sure, Steve. So on share repurchase, we did front-end load this year's share repurchases. So we would expect on a full year basis to finish probably a little bit less than where we were last year. So we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through the rest of the year, but it will be at a reduced rate relative to the first quarter. And then on a debt-to-capitalization ratio, which you noted was 55%, we'll probably run in the 50s in the next couple of quarters. But we will be back down to about where we started the year again by the end of the year.",106

What I'm really confused about is that the charge was about $100 million lower than I thought. Then we have the tax rate impact and the accelerated buyback, which is probably more than I think you guys probably modeled in January. So with all that, you could have almost $1 billion taken out of the net income the Street had and still guide to $18. And I wanted to know on cash flow, you've said in your 10-K that you would grow cash flow by $1 billion year-over-year. And we just took out almost $1 billion of the net income versus where we were in January. So I actually don't understand how we get to the free cash flow numbers previously guided in that, taking it in that light. If you could just explain it that way, that would be really great.",164
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578186.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Sure. So Ben, just to clarify again, we said at the beginning of the year we would grow free cash flow by $1 billion. And we still feel that we'll grow free cash flow by $1 billion given where we started the year. Again, the year, the first quarter of the year is typically quite light in terms of free cash flow. So when we look at now -- when we look at the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow, obviously, we have a pretty substantial transactional business that picks up from first to second quarter and also sticks with us then in third. And then the fourth is also a pretty substantial fourth quarter transactional flow, which drives a lot of free cash flow for the year. So in the first quarter, you're seeing a substantial impact to the in-quarter free cash flow numbers simply because of the size of the tax payments, the cash tax payments that we had to make in the first. Those do not replicate for the rest of the year. In terms of the $18, we said we would get to at least -- we said we'd get to at least $18. We said in the first quarter that we would do about 14% of that, and that's where we came in at 14%. Now we said about $1 billion of -- about $1 billion of restructuring plus or minus $100 million, and that's kind of where we came in. Now we had fewer shares, so on an EPS base, the EPS impact was I think right in the middle of where we would have put the original number. And we did get everything done that we wanted to get done in terms of setting the right cost base, so I think that's fairly consistent. And then when we look at how the rest of the -- at least $18 rolls out, we had a big charge in our results in the second quarter of last year. And obviously, we're not going to recreate that this year, so you're going to see big growth in the second quarter. Now given that quarterly phenomena, a charge in the first of this year but none in the second versus the prior, we would think that the first half then, given that quarterly phenomena, that first half is going to look a lot like last year. And we'll probably get about 38% of our full year EPS done by the end of the first half. And then when we look at the second half, we'll see kind of consistent growth with what we need on a full year basis at 10.5. And given the transactional nature and the momentum in some of our businesses, we would say it would probably be a little bit faster in the fourth than in the third.",479

It seems like GBS did slow down so much. Maybe Consulting and System Integration was okay with growth rates comparing last quarter and this quarter. But maybe you can go into a little more detail about the GBS outsourcing business.",53
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578189.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Sure. Sure, Lou. So a couple of things. GBS, 2% growth, it is slower quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing -- we saw a trajectory in the GMU that was -- that went from high single to low single-digit growth as an example. The bulk of the slowdown that we noted in the prepared remarks was in the application outsourcing business, which was down year-to-year. Now we have seen pretty substantial price pressure in that space. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, clients are absolutely focused on cost takeout projects and less focused and have decreasing volumes for what I would consider to be more elective kind of projects. So we are seeing a shift in focus. Now underneath that though -- that's the revenue side. Underneath that, we do have a robust delivery platform that allows us to manage even in that environment. And so from a GP perspective, gross profit perspective, we're comfortable that we can continue to deliver profit even in that environment. So you are right. As we saw on the data, our GBS did slow quarter-to-quarter. We're not expecting that the environment changes dramatically. We're not counting on it to change dramatically. And we do have a pretty robust, as I mentioned, a pretty robust delivery platform underneath that. And then in total, as you saw, even with slower revenue growth, our profits still grew 12% when you take the charge. I think it's important to take out the charge because we're going to earn it back during the year. So that's more indicative of the kind of growth we can still deliver, even on low kind of profit growth -- we can deliver even on a lower revenue trajectory.",288

I know that most of your projects there are larger projects and perhaps more profitable than some of your other businesses. How do you plan to make that up in your plans going forward? And any color you can give on the return to steady growth in either the Services business or the aggregate business would be great.",78
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578192.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Sure, Joe. So a couple of things. Growth markets, as you noted, were down 5%. We've experienced a pretty tough environment in the growth markets for a few quarters now. Down 5%, as I said earlier, is not the kind of trajectory improvement we are -- we're looking for in that business. Now when you look at it by region, however, it's not one -- it's not a homogenous answer here. So in Latin America, we had another good quarter of growth. The Latin America business for us is going really, really well. We were up 8% at constant currency. In the Mid-East and in Central Europe, we're about flat. Now that's down from growth we've seen before, but about flat is at least hanging in. And our challenge areas have been in China, which was down double-digit, and in Asia Pacific, which was down in the mid-single-digit. So I think there are a blend here of issues. There are cyclical issues, there are secular issues, and they are not consistent between the regions. We've talked in the past about China needing time to return to growth. We talked about across the growth markets that we still believe there is a very attractive region for us to invest in, so we're going to maintain our investments. But there is both a mix of secular and cyclical. Now we do have very heavy -- a heavier concentration in the growth markets in our STG business than in other parts of the world. And so while the growth markets are certainly impacted by the mainframe cycle, like we are in other parts of the world, that is not the bulk of the challenge in the GMU even though, again, STG is a bigger proponent. So the STG business does -- sorry, the GMU business does get impacted by this secular shift in our POWER business, as an example. There is a very difficult price environment in our industry-standard xSeries business. And I noted earlier that even our GBS business, from quarter-to-quarter, slowed down a bit. So mix of secular and cyclical issues, some related to our own hardware issues. Others related to what the countries themselves see in terms of economic environment, but not a single answer across the region.",378

I was wondering if you could talk about what were the forces that impacted that. And more broadly, as you look at exiting the year on a constant-currency basis and excluding dispositions, assuming the x86 business goes, do you think IBM can get to a position whereby revenue growth is flat on a constant-currency basis?",73
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578195.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Sure, Keith. A couple things. So in Software, we grew 2 points on a segment basis. Our Key Branded Middleware was up 5. We would expect both of those -- we would expect both of those to accelerate as we go through the year. We still see very good -- we still see very good software opportunity for our solutions, and we see very good software opportunity for the platforms that we're building. In fact, within the Key Branded Middleware, you probably noted on our software chart that WebSphere grew 12%. That's pretty healthy double-digit growth within our core Software business. So we do expect that to accelerate as we go through the year. Operating systems, particularly POWER, do impact that overall software business. POWER operating -- the AIX operating system is sold and it's a onetime charge. So as those hardware sales decline for the reasons we talked about, that does impact the overall Software segment growth. Now I don't think we're relying on -- I'm not relying on POWER to be coming back strongly. But one, as it becomes a smaller part of the overall revenue stream, it has less of an impact. And quite frankly, as I mentioned earlier, first quarter is our smallest transactional quarter. And so as we see improved transactional flow in the rest of the year, that impact to the overall software revenue growth will decline. In terms of overall revenue growth for the year, so I'd say a few things. One, we did have an impact from currency in the first quarter, which was about 2 points, and we do see that now being flat for the rest of the year. Now interestingly, at least I find it interesting, this was the first time since I think it's 11 quarters where we have not had a currency headwind at current rates. So as currency moves at least to neutral for us, we won't be battling that headwind. And again at current rates, we see that through the rest of the year. Obviously, we don't know where we might be in 90 days. Our customer care -- and I know you said without the dispositions -- customer care was about 1 point in the first quarter, but it will be between 1 and 1.5 points for the rest of the year. So we will be dealing with that. And then I cannot predict when the xSeries business, the xSeries divestiture may occur, and so I don't know what the overall impact will be to the top line. Now when we look, though, at the rest of the year on more of a segment basis, as I mentioned, Software, we would expect to improve the growth rate. The Hardware declines, though, will continue. Now we did set our cost base at a rate that we can achieve our goal of stabilizing the profit on a year-to-year basis. But we do not expect that -- and we're not counting on those hardware revenue declines to stop. And then GTS and GBS, now Services, we don't see dramatically different rates of growth than we saw in 1Q, which is fine for our model.",527

You talked about it getting a little long in the tooth, it's a bit of a drag. So how should we think about a refresh? And also, POWER systems, how should we think about that in terms of improving the performance? I mean, you talked about some things I think on the January call. But where are we in improving that performance? Will we see it this year?",93
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578198.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Okay, so a couple of things, Brian. I don't think I said the mainframe was long in the tooth. I cannot imagine those words coming out of my mouth. So I think the mainframe is where we would expect 6 quarters into the cycle. This is a very powerful platform for our clients. This drives a lot of value. And I would say we are right in line with where we'd expect it to be. And there are 2 -- I'd say there are 3 metrics to look at when we look at where are we in the mainframe cycle. One, we do see -- we do typically see this magnitude of a decline in revenue. So that is absolutely consistent. The other thing we see at this point in the cycle is an improving margin. And we saw that as well in the first quarter, that margin continues to improve and should through the rest of the cycle. And then the other thing we look at is program-to-program MIPS growth. And we see -- as we have in prior cycles at this point, we see MIPS growth up about 26% relative to the previous cycle, so very good usage, very good usage of that platform and customer environment. So the mainframe is, as I said, exactly where we'd expect to be in the cycle. On the POWER side, POWER is as we've said before, POWER is in a bit of a secular -- has a secular challenge here particularly at the low end. And we said that OpenPOWER will certainly help, and we have a few new members that we announced in OpenPOWER in the quarter. Now that is not going to have a profound impact on our POWER business in the year. So I don't think you should be looking at POWER, and I don't think we'll be saying that POWER is going to get better in the year because of OpenPOWER. We've also -- have moved and made that POWER platform much more relevant in the Linux space, which we've talked about in the past as being a key driver of growth down the line. But again, that takes time. You have to get the ISVs on to your platform, and we're doing that. We have over 800 ISVs now in that space, writing applications for Linux on POWER. And then the third thing that's important from an ecosystem standpoint is to have the most competitive processor in play in the space that you're targeting. And for us, we think POWER 8, which is going to target that low end certainly initially, is a very powerful processor that is really well suited to both Big Data applications and cloud environments. So those 3 things will all help. Now POWER is not going to turn around right away. In fact, I think 2014 is going to be a difficult year for POWER, if all you were to do is compare year-to-year revenue growth. But we are absolutely taking the right actions to make that POWER platform a sustainable and highly attractive economic model for us. We've taken cost out of that base, and we are getting the right both technology and ecosystem around it to make sure that it has a long-term future.",545

It seems that your EPS guide for the year, if my math is right, implies flattish, maybe even down net income this year. And last quarter, I believe you indicated that some combination of operational performance and working capital improvements would help drive that $1 billion increase year-over-year despite the $2 billion headwind from cash taxes. So I understand the working capital comment. I understand what happened in the first quarter. However, could you elaborate on the contribution from operational improvement, given what appears to be a flat-to-down net income in 2014?",117
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3334.0,611467.0,27578201.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,33,"Sure. Let's deal with the -- let's look at this, I guess, from a -- I'll try to do it from a pretax income flow and then we'll talk obviously -- obviously to that, then we would add the impact of taxes, which we know is a headwind later in the year, and then our capital allocation policy and the EPS driven from share repurchase. So we did, in the first quarter, we had $3.3 billion of pretax income. That had a charge in it, as we talked about, about $900 million. So I'm going to use kind of big round numbers. It'd be too hard to do this in millions, so I'll just use billions. So we have about $3.3 billion, we had about $900 million charge on that. So on a base level, that gets us to about $4.2 billion of pretax income. Now we have that for obviously as a starting point for 3 more quarters. And I add back the $1 billion in the charge we took, which we are going to earn back in savings, and the $16 billion then goes to $17 billion. So let's use $17 billion as a base in terms of starting from -- starting from the first quarter. Now I also noted that the first quarter is our lowest transactional skew, and that what we see as we go through the year is we add about $1 billion in profit growth from transactional businesses as well as overall volumes in the second through the fourth relative to what we did in the first. And that again was our starting point. So another $3 billion from that transactional growth as we go through the year. So $17 billion as a base, take the base of transactional growth that goes from first to second and carries through fourth, that gets you to 20. And then in the fourth quarter which is our big transactional quarter -- biggest transactional quarter, we see transactional growth, and we see this across the businesses. We see it in -- especially the heavily transactional business, obviously. We see it in Software, and we see it in Hardware as well. But across the businesses from third to fourth, we add another typically about $3 billion of pretax income into the business. Now we have different dynamics this year than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. For instance, our Hardware business was a much greater drag last year than we would expect it to be this year, given the momentum that we expect out of parts of that business,, i.e., momentum being described as less revenue declines, right, so -- and we see pretty good momentum, as I noted in our software business. So that profit base, that PTI profit base of about $23 billion with using 1Q as a starting point. Again, we have a tax rate headwind in the fourth quarter, but we also have a share repurchase benefit here. So that $23 billion of profit growth drives our free cash flow for the year. And as I said, we still feel like we're going to grow free cash flow by about $1 billion for the year even with the tax headwind. 
So let me wrap up the call. As I said in the beginning, we did get a lot done this quarter. We did transition more of our business into Big Data and analytics. We continue to move into the cloud. Our cloud platform is very powerful in the marketplace, good growth in mobile and security. And we have our Investor Day coming up on May 14, and we're looking forward to sharing with everyone more about the capabilities and the investments we're making to drive those businesses.

Our second quarter and first half results reflect the stability of our overall business model as we transform the company. Looking at the dynamics of our portfolio, we're continuing to drive double-digit growth in the parts of our business that address the emerging trends in enterprise IT. We have stability in our core franchises, where we continue to drive innovation. We're dealing with secular shifts in parts of our Hardware business, and as we shift to higher value, we have the impact of a divested business.
Overall, our year-to-year revenue performance improved from last quarter at actual rates and was fairly consistent at constant currency. We expanded margins, and we grew earnings per share. The profit dynamics also reflect the actions we've taken to transform our business. I'll get into that shortly.
In the first quarter, you'll remember that we announced a number of initiatives that support the shift to our strategic areas of data, cloud and systems of engagement. These included the launch of BlueMix, which is our cloud Platform as a Service for the enterprise. It included a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand SoftLayer cloud hubs, and it included a $1 billion investment to bring Watson's cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.
In the second quarter, we made progress to implement these initiatives, including, in June, BlueMix became generally available. We opened new SoftLayer data centers. We started to shift POWER8 and expanded the OpenPOWER Consortium, and we completed substantially all of the divestiture of our customer care business.
More recently, we announced additional actions to continue our shift to higher value. You saw last week that we're investing $3 billion over the next 5 years in research and in early-stage development to create the next generation of chip technologies. Those will fuel the systems required for cloud, Big Data and cognitive systems.
And just a couple of days ago, IBM and Apple announced a strategic global partnership to provide a new level of business value from mobility for enterprise clients. The underlying theme of all of this, from the expansion of our cloud platforms and capacity to the OpenPOWER Consortium, to the partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility, the next-generation chip technologies, is that we're leveraging our unique strengths and innovation and enterprise capabilities to maintain our differentiation in the emerging areas of enterprise IT. While some of these actions impact our results in the short term, they better position our business for the long term.
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $4.32. Our revenue was down 2% or down 1% at constant currency, adjusting for the customer care divestiture. We improved gross margin by 10 basis points, the 22nd consecutive quarter of operating gross margin expansion. Our pretax and net margins are up significantly. Last year's profit base was lower due to a workforce rebalancing charge of about $1 billion. We took a charge of a similar size in the first quarter of 2014, and so on a 6-month basis, the charges are fairly neutral to profit growth. On the bottom line, we reported operating earnings per share of $4.32 in the second quarter, which is up 34%, and we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year.
Let me spend a minute on the first half performance. The revenue performance for the half is very similar to the second quarter. Through 6 months, we had double-digit revenue growth and strategic initiatives, stable performance in our core franchises and the impact of some secular trends in parts of Hardware and from the divested business. 
Looking at profit. We expanded gross margin 50 basis points, pre-tax margin by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points, all while shifting investment to key areas. Operating earnings per share for the first half were up 9.5%. We generated free cash flow of $3.6 billion, which is down $800 million, though up $400 million without the higher level of cash taxes we paid in the first half.
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was up 1% year-to-year, a 3-point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. From a regional perspective, the U.S. rate also improved 3 points, and we had another great quarter in our Latin America region. The improvement in the Americas was driven by the strong System z mainframe performance.
EMEA declined this quarter. Within Western Europe, we had continued growth in Germany and Italy, though the U.K. and France were down. Eastern Europe also declined. Our performance in Asia Pacific was pretty consistent with last quarter. We had another good quarter in Japan, our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the country. Asia Pacific outside of Japan declined at a double-digit rate.
In total, major markets were down 1%, while growth markets were down 4%. Within the growth markets, the BRICs were up 1%, which is a 7-point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. The improvement was driven by Brazil, India and China, each up between 9 and 10 points sequentially.
Brazil grew over 20% year-to-year, driven by large deals in the financial sector, and India returned to growth. Our revenue in China was down 11%, effectively halving the rate of decline from the last couple of quarters. So this is a change in trajectory in China, but we haven't yet seen improvement in the other Asia-Pacific countries. Put it all together, and we had modest sequential improvement in our growth markets performance.
Turning to the segment perspective. Our Services revenue was up 1%, adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. Global Technology Services performance at constant currency was similar to last quarter, with growth in cloud and a ramp in the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year. Global Business Services once again had very strong growth in the practices that address the digital front office. However, performance in the globally integrated enterprise offerings lagged. In Software, middleware's up 3%, while operating systems were down, resulting in modest reported growth for total Software. 
We're continuing to drive strong results in strategic areas like mobile and security, as well as in some of our core franchises like our app servers and distributed databases.  While still down, our Hardware year-to-year revenue performance improved significantly from the first quarter rate, driven by our System z mainframe, System x and Storage.
Looking at the gross profit. In total, our operating gross margin improved modestly. The increase was driven by margin improvement in Global Technology Services and an improving mix. This was mitigated by margin declines in Global Business Services and in Systems and Technology. When you look at gross profit dollars, the year-to-year decline was driven entirely by our Systems and Technology business.  Aside from STG, our gross profit is flat, even after a $70 million impact from the divested customer care business and while we transitioned to some of the emerging areas, where the profit and margins will benefit from scale.
Our total operating expense and other income was better by 14% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. For the last 3 years, acquisitions have contributed between 1 and 3 points of expense growth each quarter. Currency drove 1 point of expense growth. So base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was down 17 points.
There is one large item that is impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we had $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter of last year. This impacted the base performance by 12 points. So without the impact of that item, our base expense would have been better 5 points year-to-year. This is a better indication of the productivity in the base. The other item I'll mention is the gain of over $100 million from the sale of our customer care business associated with the country closings we completed in the second quarter. This is in other income and expense. Keep in mind, the divested business removed about $70 million of gross profit.
Within our base expense, we're also continuing to shift our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. The substantial investments we're making in cloud, which includes BlueMix and Watson and in chip innovation, are examples of this.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the Services business generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. This is where we see the impact of the customer care divestiture in the year-to-year results. So adjusting for that divestiture, total service revenue was up 1% year-to-year. Services pre-tax profit was up 26%, and margin improved over 4 points. I'll discuss the profit drivers within the brand details.
Total backlog was $136 billion. We reduced backlog by nearly $4 billion when we divested the customer care business in January. Adjusted for the divested business, total backlog was down 1% at spot rates.
Global Technology Services revenue was $9.4 billion, down 1% as reported, but up 2% at constant currency adjusted for the divestiture. SoftLayer contributed about 1 point to GTS revenue growth in the quarter. We're expanding our footprint in the second quarter. We opened a cloud data center in Hong Kong and followed that with London earlier this week. We'll continue to roll out additional capacity in the third and fourth quarters.
GTS outsourcing, one of our core franchises, continued to improve with revenue growth of 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. Revenue growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013, and we expanded gross margin. GTS pre-tax profit was up significantly in the quarter. The profit performance was driven by several key factors. First, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security and cloud. These investments result in a differentiated set of capabilities that complement our client systems of record and are a good example of how we continue to evolve our core franchises. Second, profit reflects the gain from the completion of several country closings in the customer care divestiture, partially offset by the profit loss from the divested business. Finally, we have the benefit from the past rebalancing actions. The year-to-year growth also reflects the absence of workforce rebalancing charges compared to last year.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 2%. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 1% and flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that addressed the digital front office, particularly in cloud, analytics and mobile. This was offset by declines in our traditional packaged application implementations. As our digital front-office offerings become a larger part of the portfolio, they will contribute more meaningfully to top line performance.
Two days ago, we announced a strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise-ready, MobileFirst business applications for iOS. With this partnership, IBM's consultants and other client-facing specialists will help expand the mobile device productivity, enabling Big Data and analytics at the point of contact.
Application outsourcing was down 9%, in line with last quarter's results. Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects.
GBS pre-tax profit grew 34% year-to-year and reflects both the year-to-year benefit in workforce rebalancing charges and the impact of lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base.
Software revenue of $6.5 billion was up 1% and flat at constant currency. Middleware grew 3%, and within that, the branded middleware's flat at constant currency on a tough compare from last year. We had good growth in several of our strategic areas: cloud, Big Data and analytics, mobile and security. Across our Software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings are growing very quickly. This quarter, our SaaS offerings grew by  nearly 40%.
Looking at our results by brand. WebSphere had another good quarter, up 5% at constant currency, led by app server, commerce and mobile solutions. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of WebSphere growth coming from on-prem solutions.
Our Application Server business delivered strong growth with an increase in demand for on-premise software that was driven by mobile and analytics workloads. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, leveraging over 5,000 mobile experts and are expanding capabilities.  Supporting our partnership with Apple, our Software group will develop unique enterprise cloud services native for iOS to deliver the full enterprise-class mobile experience from analytics to cloud storage and data security.
Information Management software was down 2% at constant currency. Once again, relational database grew, though some product areas in the brand faced tough compares.
Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security software. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in security software, with most of those quarters up double digits. It's also every quarter since we acquired Q1 Labs and built our security division around that acquisition, supplemented by additional analytics capabilities.
Workforce Solutions declined 8% at constant currency as we transition from on-premise notes to our SaaS offerings. Across Software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas, and we continue to drive innovation in our core franchises. We're growing and building capabilities in emerging areas like Software-as-a-Service, mobile and security, and also in more traditional areas such as application server and relational database, as new growth areas drive the need for on-premise capabilities. This quarter, we face a difficult compare. We expect our revenue growth to accelerate in the second half.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.3 billion was down 11%. This is a significant improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to last quarter. The improvement was driven by System z, as well as sequential improvements in System x and Storage. This, together with actions to align our structure to the demand profile, resulted in progress in stabilizing our profit.
Looking at our results by brand. System z revenue was down 1% on flat MIPS, which is a significant performance in the seventh quarter following the product announcement. In the quarter, we had large deals in the financial sector in China, the United States and Brazil. When you compare this cycle to date versus the prior cycle, we have shipped 25% more MIPS, and the STG revenue and gross profit are each about 98% of the previous cycle, net of currency. The System z platform is one of our core franchises benefiting from IT trends. The value proposition for z becomes stronger as the scale of data and transactions grow, as well as the need for security of that data and those transactions. 
POWER revenue declined 28%. The year-to-year performance reflects fundamental changes in the business, and as we have talked about in past calls, we have taken actions to align our structure to the demand profile while investing to address where we see opportunity in the future. First, we launched entry-level or scale-out POWER8 in June, and had a good start compared to previous cycles. Keep in mind that entry level is a small portion of the POWER business. POWER8 will be introduced into the mid-range and high-end segments over the remainder of the year.
And second, we expanded our OpenPOWER Consortium, doubling the number of alliance members in the second quarter. At the end of June, we had 36 members across 10 countries, including 9 in China, so globally diverse. The membership is across the stack, from chip designers to hardware component OEMs to system vendors to middleware and software providers. With this alliance, members have access to high-end technology as the POWER architecture is available for open development and to integrate new designs into their hardware platforms. For example, alliance members can design and control their own encryption.
Our System x revenue was down 3%, which is an improvement from last quarter, when revenue was down 18%. As you know, we're in the process of divesting this business to Lenovo and are awaiting regulatory approvals.
Storage hardware revenue was down 12%, a sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We saw strong growth in our flash systems as we doubled our revenue over last year, and in our Storwize portfolio, which was up double digits. However, this was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind-down of our OEM business. We had a number of launches this quarter, including the V7000 update to our Storwize portfolio and flash-enabled DS8K. As we discussed over the last couple of earnings calls, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base. And after the first half, we are on track.
Within that envelope, we will continue to make investments in this business to remain the leader in high-performance, high-end systems. Our announcement last week to invest $3 billion over the next 5 years to tackle the challenges of the post-silicon era demonstrates our commitment to innovation and to leading in the new era of enterprise IT.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which was up $300 million year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion was down $800 million year-to-year. This performance was impacted by the significant increase in cash taxes in 2014, which I talked about earlier this year. Without the impact of cash tax payments, our free cash flow was up $400 million year-to-year.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half. We spent $600 million on acquisitions, including Silverpop and Cognea in the second quarter. We returned $13.9 billion to shareholders. Of that, $11.8 billion was in gross share repurchases, and at the end of June, we had $3.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In June, we reached a milestone. We finished the month with fewer than 1 billion shares outstanding. Let me put this in perspective. We started our share repurchase program in 1995, when we had more than 2 billion shares outstanding. So we've reduced our share count by more than 50%, and the average price we've paid from the start in 1995 through June 30 of this year is less than $100 per share. We took our dividend of 16% in April, and through June, we paid out $2.1 billion this year. This is the 19th consecutive quarter year that we raised our dividend and the 11th year in a row of double-digit increases. With our cash flow performance in the first half, we are on track to generate $16 billion of free cash flow for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion. Total debt was $46.5 billion, which includes over $29 billion to support our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at 7:1. Our nonfinancing debt was $17.1 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 56%. As I mentioned last quarter, given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt to cap to be in the 50s through the third quarter and roughly flat year-to-year at the end of the year. We continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term as we transition to the new areas of enterprise IT.
So now let me wrap up the discussion of the first half results and put it in the context of what we discussed at our Investor Day in May. We have a set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging. We said that the model was to deliver double-digit revenue growth for these areas with high software content. Our first half results were consistent with that part of the model.
Our business analytics revenue was up 7% on a large base, and cloud revenue was up over 50%, with our as-a-service business doubling once again. Our security revenue was up over 20%, and we more than doubled our revenue in mobile. Together, the revenue in our strategic imperatives was up double digits, and about half of the content was in Software. At the same time in May, we discussed our core franchises where we continue to innovate. These include our longer-term Services business, our recurring Software business and mainframe business with our large-capacity clients. The model is a stable revenue base, and we are on track here, too.
Finally, we have transactional businesses that are shifting to higher value. We're continuing to evolve the portfolio, investing in capabilities in some areas while divesting businesses that don't support our shift to high value. In the first half, we completed the sale of our customer care business and announced the sale of our industry standard server business to Lenovo. These impact our top line performance, but are clearly the right moves for us for the long term.
We continue to drive these shifts. Let me summarize what we've gotten done in the first half of this year. We took BlueMix Live. We're adding new SoftLayer cloud hubs, and we're ramping our investment to commercialize Watson. We've introduced POWER8 for Big Data and cloud at the entry level and are expanding our OpenPOWER Consortium. And we've committed $3 billion to drive chip innovation, while launching an important new partnership with Apple to extend IBM's position in the enterprise mobile space.
When you put all of this together, for the half, revenue was relatively flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture. Pre-tax margin expanded by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points, and operating earnings per share were up 9.5%.
As we look to the full year of 2014, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share, and we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. These are points along the way to delivering performance and shareholder value over the long term.

Obviously, you saw some improvement in China. But in terms of the overall region, how should we think about the revenue and profit trajectory from here? And then, I guess, related to that, on the profit side, can you walk us through some of the permanent changes you're making to your cost structure in that region specifically?",82

I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As you noted, we did see a pretty good sequential improvement in China and in India as well in the second quarter, but as we noted in the prepared remarks, we did not see that sequential improvement in AP. And notably, within that, I would say we saw a degradation in both Australia and Korea within that AP geography. Now when we look forward in China, we still see a continued improvement in the sequential performance out of China. Now it's important to note, I think -- it's important to note in China, even though we were still down year-to-year, sequentially, not only do we see a year-over-year improvement, but our business in China was about an $800 million business in the first quarter, and in the second quarter, it was over $1 billion. So we see a very typical sequential skew in China, which is growth in the second. So again, as we see that year-to-year sequential improvement in China that we expect, we are -- this is still a substantial business for us. Now we did not see and we do not see yet a material change in the trajectory in the rest of Asia Pacific. As I noted, Australia and Korea were slow in the second, and we don't see that. Outside that area, I'll comment also on some of the other growth markets. Latin America, as an example, as you heard in our prepared remarks, had another strong quarter, again, led by Brazil, which was up double digit. And although they're going to wrap on a strong second half from last year, we still see good performance coming out of Latin America. From an investment perspective, we have made substantial commitments to those growth markets, and we see good opportunity to deploy the IBM platform. And we would -- and we continue to invest in those growth markets to get that IBM platform deployed across the growth markets.",332

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335210.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,8,"I appreciate the -- all the investments in the pace of change that IBM is undertaking and accomplished so far in the first half. I guess the question that I hear a lot from investors is, is that change big enough to offset what appears to be a deterioration or secular pressures in the core franchise. So very specifically, coming out of last quarter, you did not have a good Software quarter. You were optimistic that Software would be notably better this quarter. It was worse. It was flat at constant currency. Similarly, when I look at Services, which is really the other big, core part of your franchise, Services signings are now down 33% for the first half. The signings this quarter were the lowest in more than 6 years in absolute term, and you've got 9 straight quarters with negative revenue growth in Services. So very specifically, can you address what was the shortfall in Software this quarter relative to much more positive expectations you had coming in? And secondly, when you look at Services, given the preponderance of data I just offered to you and given the leading indicator of signings being so weak, what secularly is going on there? And how does the business get better from here?",212
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335211.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks, Toni. There's a lot there. So let me try to talk a bit about Software first, and I'll talk a bit about Services next. So first on Software, my view 90 days ago was that Software would get -- would accelerate through the remainder of the year, and I still feel like in second half, we will see Software acceleration back to mid-single-digit growth. Now in the second quarter, we saw a couple of things. One, the headwind that we have in that total Software segment from the operating system content was 3 points, and that's kind of the high point, if you will, of the headwind in -- that we expect from that operating system content. So that headwind diminishes a bit. And then secondly, we feel -- we continue to see very good Software performance coming from our kind of typical enterprise license agreements as we go through the second half, again, to drive that single -- mid-single-digit revenue. On Services, Services, we said 90 days ago that we would see revenue performance kind of consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and we still feel that way. Services was -- when you adjust for the divestiture, Services was up 1 point, and we continue to see that. Now as you noted, we had a weak signings quarter in the second. Now that was on the back of first quarter last year of signings growth, first and second quarter of last year, north of 30%. So we had a difficult compare. We knew that in the first half, but we do see getting that signings content growing again in the third. And so when we look at the revenue streams for Services, again, we expect them to be consistent with what we have seen to date. I think we feel as though the yield we're getting out of the in-period revenue is a bit better than what you would normally do if you just ran it mathematically. We're getting a better yield. Two, we have -- outside of the backlog you see, we have content, the transactional content like our cloud business, which continues to grow. And then third, we will, as I mentioned, get additional third quarter signings growth that will deliver the rest of that pretty modest 1% growth on an adjusted basis, without the divestiture, going forward.",396

And if so, what do you think caused that? And have you been able to close the business in the third quarter?",46
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335214.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Yes. I mean, I -- there are deals, Katy -- there are deals that come in. I don't know. I wouldn't say -- I would not characterize it as a deal pushout. There are a few phenomena, though, that I think are worth noting. In our key branded middleware -- in our key branded middleware business, it's a mix of both transactional content, as well as subscription and support, which comes in over time. So it's a mix of transactional content and subscription support but very heavily transaction content. In our total middleware business, so in the other middleware that comprises that total middleware business, we have a mix as well, some transactional content and some subscription content, but the mix is kind of flipped in that case. So there's a lot more subscription content. What we see, in any given quarter, you can see this kind of a mix shift, we saw a much higher transactional content in that total middleware line. And then the key branded middleware period -- quarter-to-quarter, behaved very similarly as what we saw in the first quarter. So last year, in key branded middleware, first to second quarter, we grew that content just under $800 million quarter-to-quarter. And that delivered 10% growth, by the way. This year, we grew that same key branded middleware a bit over $800 million, so a bit more than last year, but because of the strong compare, that drove kind of a flat year-to-year performance. So we have a phenomena of different mixes between transactional and subscription support, and we have, quite frankly, a tough compare in key branded middleware.",271

And I think that math suggests that about $1.2 billion of that $2 billion cash tax headwind is reflected in that figure.  So assuming the $18 in earnings is a good number, how much visibility do you have on the change in working capital at this point in the year and your ability to hit that $16 billion free cash flow target for the year?",85
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335217.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Sure. Thanks, David. I'd say there are a couple of phenomena that are going to drive that free cash flow. So first, as you pointed out, when we make earnings -- I guess I'd say it this way. When we make earnings, we'll make the free cash flow number. And I think that, that phenomena that drives that, obviously, there is profitability skew in that second half here that drives -- on an absolute basis that drives that. And secondly, within the sales cycle working capital component, the other phenomena is our enterprise license agreement cycle we're in. That software content drives a substantial amount of free cash flow as well. So between, again, the profit and the mix in -- toward the second half, as well as the phenomena of our -- of the cash structure, if you will, of our ELA cycle, I think we have a very strong statement to say when we make profit, we'll make cash flow.",162

And just -- sorry, a two parter, but mainframe, down only 1%, was much -- big improvement, very big improvement from last quarter. So what happened there? And is that sustainable? And then there are some reports out there, and I know you're aware of them, about your -- what you might do with your chip-making capabilities. And you announced a very large investment commitment to your chip-making R&D during the quarter or during this month. So can you just reconcile that? I think you understand what we're hearing out there. And what is the commitment to the chip-making business as well?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335220.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Sure, sure, Ben. So a couple of things. First, on mainframe. We did have a very strong mainframe quarter, as you noted, just down 1%. And in the seventh quarter of the cycle, down 1% is quite good. Now in the first half, we were kind of down in the mid-teens, right? In the first quarter, we were down pretty healthy double digit, down 1% in this quarter gets us to a down mid-teens. And that's very typical. That performance, that mid-teens is very typical of where we would expect the next couple of quarters to be, again, given the cycle. Now I think the reason that the mainframe continues to do so well, and we had in the prepared remarks that in this cycle, the revenue and the GP is roughly 98% of where it was in the prior cycle. This continues to be not only a core franchise for us, but it is the critical infrastructure that drives still 70% of the world's enterprise data. And as our clients are moving toward new systems of engagement and mobility, and they want the most secure platform, the mainframe remains the premier platform on which to drive a world-class enterprise structure. So I don't expect that we're going to see a minus 1% going forward, but I think that first half performance is consistent with what we would expect. And then on the semiconductors, as you said, we did announce a $3 billion investment in semiconductor research and development. And as we've said a number of times, it was in our Chairman's letter to shareholders, we've been very, very vocal about our goal to remain the leader, the absolute leader in high-performance and high-end systems. We are the leader today, and we would expect, with this kind of investment, we can continue to maintain that leadership. Now this R&D investment is clearly focused on the distant future, where we have to figure out how to scale semiconductors to 7 nanometers. That's a big challenge. And then obviously, we're also thinking about, as we indicated, what the post-silicon world looks like. So we remain committed to being the leader of high-performance and high-end systems. And we have not changed our view on that at all. We've been very vocal about it, and we'll stay on that path.",386

I guess the question is that I continuously to hear that the Chinese government is pushing away from big U.S. tech companies.

I guess, again, we saw a sequential improvement, as I noted earlier, in China, quarter-to-quarter. And as I also noted, we would expect that sequential improvement to continue. Now interestingly, I would not characterize that sequential improvement as driven solely by x86 or any other of the single brands. In fact, it was across all of our segments. Global Technology Service, GBS Software group, STG, all showed sequential improvement in China. And in fact, when we look at our strategic imperatives content that sits in China, that was up a very solid double digit as well, which is consistent with the overall performance in our strategic imperatives. So really, no difference from what we're seeing in our success in China from what we're seeing anywhere else in the world.",134

First of all, on the share repurchase, you did, I think, $11.8 billion through the first half. Does that mean you have roughly $3 billion to do in the second half? And then second on emerging markets, I think in your annual report that you guys suggested you would see emerging market revenue growth in the second half. Is that correct? And does that still stand?",73

And as we've said in the past, we would expect to spend about what we did last year, maybe a little bit less. I don't think -- I haven't changed my view on that capital allocation. But we do have about $3 billion left in our authorization. On growth markets, as I mentioned earlier, I would say that we would see a continued sequential improvement in growth markets. And as I noted earlier, LA is going to wrap on a strong second half. That continues to do quite well. AP, we do not see that sequential improvement yet. And I guess, the other thing I'd point out that's worth noting, particularly in the growth markets, we are in the process, as you know, of divesting our industry standard server business, and that's going to have an impact on our revenue growth. And that's a profound impact in the emerging markets as well. So when we sell that content, that's going to be a pretty big headwind to growth from the emerging markets, notwithstanding the sequential improvements that we see in the business.",194

Thanks very much. So a couple of things on GBS. So there are secular shifts going on in this space. And we've been talking about our -- how we're shifting toward -- we refer to it as the digital front office or talk about it as our cloud and our analytics and our mobile. That was -- that -- when we see that, that flow in our clients, and we're obviously shifting both our resources, our skills, our training to that, and we see very solid double-digit growth. We saw that in the second quarter. And in fact, we look at our pipeline going forward, and over half of it is that kind of content. So there is absolutely a secular shift going on in that GBS space, and we are in the middle of it, and we are very competitive in that space. On the ERP implementations and some of the custom development work, I guess the -- what we are seeing is kind of a -- fewer of those large rollouts. And that, combined with the large rollouts that do occur, we're seeing them being broken up into small pieces, so they're not as large as they used to be. So they're -- so I don't know if I would consider that secular or cyclical. Within that, our clients -- where those back-office workloads are stable, our clients are still looking for additional productivity. And so obviously, we are in a bit of a battle to win there. But they're looking for productivity, and so we're still competitive. But other than the absolute secular shift toward cloud and analytics and mobile, which we're playing in, and which we have very solid double-digit growth in, we'll have to wait and see if the rest is secular or cyclical.",301

Are you hearing that businesses are starting to get a little more confident? I think you made some comments about the developed markets being a little bit better. And then thinking about that in terms of how it translates since the second half of the year, do you think you could start to see some flat or potentially some growth in revenue?",88
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3038.0,659277.0,29335232.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Sure. So if we look at our major -- we'll start with our major markets' performance, and so I've talked a bit about the growth markets already. In major markets, we were flat year-to-year when we exclude our customer care business, which was an improvement sequentially in North America. And we also did quite well in North America in our mainframe business, and we saw sequential improvements in some of our other platforms as well, including POWER and Storage and x. So there is a sequential improvement story, if you will, in our North America business that we certainly benefited from in the second. In Europe, we saw a decline at constant currency, but we did see within that growth in our Services business. And so I would say that Europe is -- I would expect Europe to see sequential improvement going forward, but it is a challenged environment from our experience. And then in Japan, we had a very solid performance, again, in Japan. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Japan. As we noted in the remarks, our Japan team does quite well. And I think it's more than just macro. I think our Japan team is doing quite well. And then as I mentioned in the growth markets, we do expect to see sequential improvement going forward. And then, again, all of this is in context from our own headwinds here in IBM. We do have -- we have closed on our customer care divestiture, which is a headwind for the rest of us for the year for a bit over a point. And then as I noted earlier in my growth markets commentary, if we're able to close our industry standard server, our x series divestiture, that'll also have a pretty substantial headwind for us as well.",303

And I believe we are absolutely, absolutely on track to do that, to stabilize that profit base. The impact against that profit base, when we look at last year and what we're trying to stabilize, there are, one, some cyclical issues. We have certainly seen this downturn in the emerging markets, which has an impact on Hardware. And we've talked about that on prior calls. The mix of our STG business in the growth markets is higher than other places, and therefore, they -- it had a -- that emerging market slowdown had a more pronounced effect on STG, and so there are some cyclical issues there. And then we've talked about the mainframe cycle already a number of times. But in addition to that, we've had this secular issue around POWER and trying to reposition that. And we've taken action pretty aggressively to make that platform the most viable for the future, including -- we just released POWER8 as an example, which is a POWER platform built for the world of Big Data and analytics and quite frankly, built for the world of cloud. And then we've also had a lot of success with our OpenPOWER initiative, which we've been able to expand again the alliance -- we've been able to expand the alliance of those who will use and build on top of that, so a mix of cyclical and secular within that STG performance. But as I've said -- as we said at the beginning of the year, and we are confident with the actions we've taken both to address the secular, and also we've taken a fair bit of cost out of that business to better suit the demand profile. We still see that business stabilizing in profit on a full year basis.
Okay, so I'm going to wrap up the call. And I guess, first though, I'll start with what we saw on the first half. We had very strong performance in the strategic imperatives, a lot of software content within that. And as we talked about at Investor Day, we had -- that's very important for our business model. The core franchises were relatively stable. That's also, as we said at Investor Day, important for our business model. And we're making -- we made some progress in addressing some of those secular issues in POWER. I talked a little bit about that in the answer to a question. In the second half, we see -- as I noted on an earlier question, we see our Software revenue growth accelerating to mid-single digit, and we see our Services profit growth of mid-single digit, driven by productivity in the base. And then on STG, as I just noted, we see that profit stabilization still.
So when I think about the second half and how that plays out, as we did 90 days ago, I said that I think EPS in the second half will be a little bit faster in the fourth than in the third, so kind of a double-digit fourth quarter EPS and a single-digit third quarter EPS. And bear in mind that, that single-digit EPS growth, even in the third, because of seasonality, kind of translates to no more absolute EPS than what we get in the second. So we still see that same mix skewed toward the fourth quarter, when we have the benefit of very strong Software performance, when the productivity hits and helps our margins and services, and we get that transactional benefit from STG.
So thanks very much, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and have a good evening.",639

We have a lot to cover today: our third quarter performance; actions that accelerate the transformation of our business, including important announcements that impact our results and the basis of our reporting; our 2014 guidance and what it means as we move into 2015. 
Let me start with the top-level results. We reported revenue of $22.4 billion, which is down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding our customer care divestiture. We delivered operating net income of $3.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.68, all excluding the discontinued semiconductor manufacturing business. These results fell short of our expectations, and I'd attribute the shortfall to 3 primary drivers: First, our software revenue was weaker than expected. We had some sales execution issues, and in addition, we've made it easier for our clients to manage their IBM software capacity across new and more traditional workloads as they invest in our platform for the longer term. I'll expand on this later. Second, we didn't get the productivity required in our Services business, impacting both our profit and margin. And third, the environment, including currency, isn't helping. With the sharp movement in currency rates in September, there were some effect in the quarter, and we expected to have a larger impact going forward. And for the business, overall, we did see a slowdown in September, which had a particular impact on us, given the skew of our transactional business.
I'll get into the details of the quarter shortly, but let me first describe the actions we are taking and put them into context. For some time now, we've been clear about our strategic direction and how we address the market shifts around data, cloud and engagement. All of this year, we've been launching initiatives and making significant investments to drive this shift. We've been very successful, with strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives, and you'll see in our third quarter results that the strategic imperatives again delivered double-digit revenue growth. But some of these fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than we planned, so we're putting in place a series of actions to accelerate our transformation. 
I want to address these right upfront. First, we're continuing to remix the higher value. We just took a bold step in our transformation, going fabless with the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business. We have world-class technologists and intellectual property, but this is a capital-intensive business, which has been challenging for us without scale. With future node progression and the potential transition to larger wafer sizes, the capital requirements will substantially increase. 
GLOBALFOUNDRIES will acquire our microelectronics business and will become the semiconductor technology provider for our future systems. This agreement leverages the strength of each company, IBM's semiconductor and material science research, development capabilities and leadership in high-end systems and GLOBALFOUNDRIES' leadership in advanced technology manufacturing at scale and commitment to delivering future semiconductor technologies, enabling them to address new business opportunities. With GLOBALFOUNDRIES operating at scale, we'll get supply at market-based pricing for the long term. And we'll exit a business that was not only capital-intensive, but also a drag in our profit. Clearly, this is the right move for our business for the long term. 
Also, in January, we announced the sale of our x86 business to Lenovo. And earlier this month, we completed the initial closing. This was a $4 billion business for us in 2013, with effectively no annual profit. With the transaction, IBM and Lenovo have formed a strategic alliance, which includes an agreement for Lenovo to resell selected IBM storage and software products. And to ensure a smooth transition for our clients, IBM will provide x86-related maintenance on Lenovo's behalf. We'll continue to remix our portfolio by investing in higher-value areas and making decisions on businesses that no longer support our high-value strategy. 
Second, we are implementing changes that make it easier to consume our capabilities and innovations and increase our agility. We are creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas. As we did with Watson earlier this year, we're creating a dedicated business unit for cloud and other integrated units to address growth areas like security and Smarter Commerce. This enables a more focused investment and improves our integration speed in bringing solutions to the market and with our clients. 
We're also providing more flexibility to clients in the way they buy our software. Specifically, we're accelerating investments to make our software more directly consumable through digital channels, so we'll have an end-to-end digital sales and marketing channel, which will improve our reach. 
Third, we're taking additional actions to simplify our structure and accelerate productivity. For example, to improve productivity and services, while, at the same time, providing greater value and innovation to our clients, we're implementing a number of actions. These include accelerating the use of automation in our data centers and being more aggressive in our use of global delivery skills and intellectual property across our service lines. 
Let me tell you what these actions do for our financial model. For the near term, our revenue will be down, not surprising since the 3 divestitures this year represent about $7 billion of revenue, with pretax losses of about $500 million. So clearly, we'll have an improved margin profile. These actions also free up our spend and capital to be reinvested to areas that will accelerate our transformation. And these allow us to continue to provide very strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. All of this is consistent with our strategic direction. And while there are impacts in the short term, we'll improve our position for the longer term.
I want to spend a minute on the high-level financial implications of the 2 most recent transactions. We've posted additional information in 2 articles on our investor portal. For the System x business, as I mentioned, this was over a $4 billion business for us last year. Though the business is breakeven on an annual basis, the transactional skew would have driven profit in the fourth quarter. Starting in the fourth quarter this year, we'll no longer have the System x hardware revenue and profit, and the related maintenance will be at a lower revenue and profit level, reflecting the new relationship. At an IBM level, this will result in about a 4-point impact to revenue growth over the next 4 quarters, but an improved margin profile. Our fourth quarter results will include the gain on sale associated with the countries closed, net of related transaction and performance-based costs. This net gain, as well as the operational profit we'll lose in the fourth quarter, will be included in our view of the full year, which I'll talk about later in the call. 
Free cash flow will be impacted by 2 items: accounts payable for the balances at closing, as well as the future procurement IBM will perform on Lenovo's behalf and for cash tax payments made in 2015. We estimate this will be a use of cash of approximately $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter and another $0.5 billion in 2015. 
Turning to the microelectronics business. The 2013 OEM revenue associated with the divested business was $1.4 billion, and our STG segment included pretax losses for this business of over $700 million. This is being reported as a discontinued operation. In the third quarter, disk ops will include both losses from the ongoing operations of about $90 million after-tax and a onetime after-tax charge of $3.3 billion associated with the transaction. The transaction had no impact to free cash flow in the third quarter. 
Now let me spend a minute on the reported structure. All of our results obviously start with GAAP, which is in the middle of the chart. To the left is a reference to our prior definition of operating results, which we introduced a few years ago to provide a better perspective on the operational performance of our business. This presentation excluded nonoperating retirement-related and acquisition-related items. Operating results is the basis of our 2015 road map objective, and we have provided a view of our results on this basis since 2011. This definition of operating results no longer exists. 
Now moving to the right side of the chart. With the reporting of our microelectronics business as a discontinued operation, all of the financial impacts of that business are lifted out of each line of our P&L and reported in one line: loss on discontinued operations, net of tax. 
Starting in the third quarter, our GAAP P&L will be on a continuing operations basis. We'll make the same nonoperating adjustments to determine our operating results, so our operating results definition will now be on a continuing operations basis. This is the basis for our third quarter and year-to-date results, all historical periods presented and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.
So now let me get into the third quarter results. And again, these are all operating results, which exclude the discontinued operations. We delivered $3.7 billion of operating net income on a revenue of $22.4 billion. Revenue was down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding the divested customer care business. On that constant currency basis, Services was flat, our Software segment declined 2% and Systems and Technology revenue was down double-digit. 90 days ago, we expected the currency would be a modest help to our revenue growth. But in September, we saw a sharp move in the currency markets. I'll talk more about currencies later. 
Our margins were down, with weak hardware performance and insufficient productivity in Services. We had a tax headwind of 3 points year-to-year, and we generated $3.7 billion of net income in the quarter. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.68, which is down 10%. 
Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $2.2 billion, which is relatively flat year-to-year. 
Turning to revenue by geography. When you look at the year-to-year performance at constant currency, major markets decelerated 2 points from last quarter and growth markets, 1 point. These results aren't normalized for the customer care divestiture. Both major and growth markets are impacted by a point of growth, consistent with last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a deceleration in September. This is true in nearly all regions and was most pronounced in our growth markets that have a higher transactional content. 
Within the growth markets, we again had double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, and good growth in the Middle East and Africa region. I think it's important to understand the impact of the System x divestiture on the geographic results going forward. Given the geography mix of that business, major markets growth will be impacted by about 3 points and growth markets by about 9 points. Reporting our divested semiconductor business as a discontinued operation will adjust the OEM revenue, but not impact the geographic results. 
Turning to the segment perspective. I'll cover the revenue drivers when we get into the segment discussions. 
Looking at the gross profit. In total, our operating gross margin was down 90 basis points, driven by margin declines in Systems and Technology, and in both of our Services segments. The 6-point decline in Systems and Technology was due to a combination of lower margin across the brand and a mix away from higher-margin z due to the product cycle. 
In Global Technology Services, we did get the savings from the workforce rebalancing actions we took earlier in the year, and we continue to make investments in capacity and skills. But we didn't get the base productivity we had planned through automation, and the transition on some new contracts took longer than expected. 
In Global Business Services, we had strong growth, with good margin performance in the strategic imperatives. But in the more traditional back-office implementations, we continue to see price pressure.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 2% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth, and currency drove 1 point. The base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was essentially flat. Within our base expense, we have been shifting our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. And with the actions we're taking, we'll accelerate that shift. 
There are a few items that are impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. First, we increased our accounts receivable reserves, which impacted expense by over $70 million year-to-year. This coverage is now at 2.2%, which is up from a year ago, but not as high as 2009 levels. Second, as you would expect, our accrual for 2014 variable compensation is down relative to where we were at the end of the first half. However, the reduction in the quarter was not as substantial as last year. And so across cost and expense, this element was up $230 million year-to-year.
Finally, I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dollar appreciated dramatically in the last several weeks of the quarter. And as you know, when the dollar appreciates broadly against other currency, it impacts our revenue and earnings. What is unusual about this is not just the sharp move, but the movements were nearly all in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. We hedged a portion of our cross-border cash flows, which, as you know, defers the impact of the currency movement, but doesn't eliminate it. While our hedges are designed to provide stability around the receipt of cash, there is no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period. 
Looking at the third quarter, we had a modest impact of profit from currency. However, at current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to fourth quarter and into 2015. 
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, combined services generated $13.7 billion in revenue, which was flat year-to-year at constant currency, adjusted for the customer care divestiture. Services pretax profit was down 13% year-to-year. Total backlog was $128 billion. Adjusting for the divested business and currency, total backlog was down 2% year-to-year. 
Global Technology Services revenue was $9.2 billion, down 3% as reported, but up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. In the third quarter, we wrapped on the SoftLayer acquisition, and it continues to attract new workloads to the platform. We're expanding our footprint. And in the third quarter, we opened cloud data centers in London and Toronto as well as 2 federal data centers outside of Dallas and Washington, D.C. We also added cloud capacity in Singapore. 
GTS outsourcing grew 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. That growth was driven by IT outsourcing performance from the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013. 
GTS pretax profit declined 11% in the quarter. While we continue to benefit from the rebalancing action earlier this year, this was more than offset by the investments across our portfolio in areas like new resiliency centers, additional security skills and the SoftLayer cloud hub expansion, the loss profit associated with the divested customer care business and we didn't get sufficient productivity in the base. Part of this is due to the large deals we signed last year, which have lower margins in the early stages, and we didn't execute those transitions as rapidly as expected.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.5 billion, down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 1% year-to-year and was flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that are highly differentiated in the marketplace, which address cloud, analytics, mobile and social, offset by declines in the areas that are becoming less differentiated, such as the more traditional back-office implementations. During our last call, we discussed our strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise-ready MobileFirst business applications for iOS, combining mobility and analytics. This quarter, we will launch the first dozen applications.
Application outsourcing was down 6% at constant currency, reflecting modest sequential improvement. Our performance continues to be impacted by pricing pressure and client renegotiations as well as a reduction in elective projects. 
PBS pretax profit was down year-to-year. Tier 2, we got the benefit from the previous workforce rebalancing actions, but it was more than offset by a couple of factors. Lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base and where we have strong differentiation, such as our solutions that address the strategic imperatives, we get good growth and margin performance. But in the parts of our portfolio that aren't as well differentiated, we're continuing to see price and profit pressure. These are the areas where we'll be more aggressive on the use of global delivery centers and applying intellectual property for faster time to value for our clients and improve business results for us. 
Software revenue of $5.7 billion was down 2%, and middleware was flat. We had solid growth in many of our solution areas like security and mobile and cloud. Across our software brands, software-as-a-service offerings are up nearly 50%, but overall software results didn't meet our expectations. First, we clearly had some sales execution issues. And second, given our clients' substantial investment in the IBM software platform, we have been providing more flexibility on how they deploy our software with economics that enable their mobile and social workloads on our platforms. This enables them to better manage their capacity and commit to our platforms for the long term. This will drive higher utilization of our middleware as these mobile and social platforms drive additional on-premise workload. 
Looking at our results by brand. WebSphere had another good quarter, up 7%, led by commerce, mobile solutions and business integration offerings. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of growth continuing to come from our on-premise solutions. 
In commerce, we saw broad-based growth, with strong momentum in commerce as a service, which includes our recent acquisitions, such as Silverpop and Aspera. Across software and services, IBM's mobile business more than doubled from the prior year. Information Management software was down 5%, where we were impacted by our sales execution challenges and some product transitions. 
Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage software. Security, once again, grew at a double-digit rate. Workforce Solutions grew 1%, with growth in our social and collaboration solutions mitigated by a decline in notes. Rational Software was down 12%, facing a tough compare. Across Software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas, we continue to drive innovation in our core franchises and we'll be accelerating investments to make our software more consumable through digital channels.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 15%. This reflects the product cycle of System z and declines in POWER, storage and System x, though both POWER and storage improved sequentially. We got a lot done recently, including the initial closing on the sale of our industry standard server business to Lenovo, an agreement to divest our semiconductor manufacturing business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and the introduction of our first OpenPOWER-based scale-out system. 
Looking at our results by brand. System z revenue was down 35%, now in the ninth quarter of the current product cycle. We continue to innovate on this platform. And as an example, we have recently made available new analytics offerings for the mainframe to provide real-time customer insights. With this, IBM adds new analytics capabilities to the mainframe platform, providing clients with the ability to integrate Hadoop Big Data. 
POWER revenue declined 12%, which is a significant sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned POWER. We introduced scale-out systems based on Power8 in June. And earlier this month, we announced the high-end Power8-based enterprise systems. These systems are highly scalable and can handle the most data-intensive mission-critical applications in the industry. 
In addition, we saw continued expansion of the OpenPOWER Consortium, now with over 60 members. Through the efforts of Consortium members, we have, for the first time, introduced a system built on IBM's Power8 processor that tightly integrates IBM and other OpenPOWER member technologies, including Nvidia's GPU accelerator technology.
Our System x revenue was down 10%. And this, of course, was the last quarter before the divestiture. Storage hardware revenue was down 6%, sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We again saw a strong contribution from our flash systems and our Storwize portfolio. This was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued winding down of our legacy OEM business. 
We see value in the storage business shifting to software. And this quarter, our storage software grew. We will continue to expand our software-defined storage portfolio. So across our Systems and Technology business, we have taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio and maintain our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage. We committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology as we strengthen our semiconductor research and development and systems innovation, with future chip supply coming from an at scale provider. We repositioned POWER through creation of our own Power8 systems, which are built for cloud and Big Data, and also made available to Power8 architecture through the OpenPOWER Consortium to build an open ecosystem and an IP play. We are repositioning storage to capture value through software-defined environments, and we divested our low-end System x business.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We invested $1 billion in CapEx, and we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, which was down $60 million year-to-year. This includes a $300 million year-to-year increase in cash tax payments. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our net cash from operations, excluding financing receivables of $8.6 billion, was down $700 million year-to-year. Within that, our cash tax payments were up $1.5 billion year-to-year. We invested $2.8 billion in capital expenditures, which was up about $100 million from last year. This includes about $350 million investment in SoftLayer, so this is a good example of where we're shifting spending in the base to new areas. 
The free cash flow was $5.8 billion, down $800 million, or up $700 million, excluding the impact from cash tax. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion. Our total assets reflect the reduction of more than $1.5 billion associated with the semiconductor transaction. This includes a noncash charge for fixed assets and an increase in deferred tax assets. 
Total debt was $45.7 billion, which includes just over $28.5 billion in support of our financing business. We target Global Financing leverage to be in the range of 7.0 to 7.2:1, and we do not have plans to change this model. However, the late quarter impact of foreign exchange on equity was the main driver of the leverage being slightly elevated, 7.4, versus our model. 
Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion, and our non-financing debt to cap was 62%. While the semiconductor manufacturing divestiture does not affect debt levels, it does impact equity by approximately $3.3 billion, resulting in a 7-point impact to the debt-to-cap ratio. At these levels, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
Before we wrap up, I want to spend a minute on the performance of our strategic imperatives that address the areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging. We have a broad analytics portfolio that helps our clients to extract value from their data. This is a large business for us, with revenues last year of nearly $16 billion. Through September, our business analytics revenue was up 8% this year, with the strongest growth coming from GBS. Our cloud portfolio supports the full scope of enterprise client cloud requirements, including solutions for private cloud, hybrid clouds and public clouds. Our revenue was up over 50% year-to-date. 
Our as-a-service component was up over 80%, and we exited the third quarter with an annual run rate of $3.1 billion. Addressing engagement on a year-to-date basis, our mobile revenue more than doubled; our social offerings returned to growth, with double-digit growth in the third quarter; and our security revenue was up over 20%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in security. Together, the revenue in our strategic imperatives was up double digits, and about half of the content was in software.
So let me bring all of this back together. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're driving the shift towards our strategic imperatives. Earlier this year, we created the Watson unit and committed $1 billion to bring Watson cognitive capabilities to the enterprise. We launched Bluemix. We are globally expanding our SoftLayer cloud data centers, and we formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility. 
Now as we exit the third quarter, we're making it easier to do business with us, including creating vertically-integrated units to address key growth areas and making our software more consumable through digital channels. We're taking additional actions to drive more productivity and increase the agility of our company. And while we invest to drive to the growth areas, we're also aggressively moving away from the businesses that don't fit our strategic profile. The sale of our x86 business and the divestiture of our microelectronics business are the 2 most recent examples. Earlier this year, we divested our customer care BPO business. And as I mentioned, the revenue from these 3 businesses was $7 billion in 2013. And in aggregate, they incurred a pretax loss of more than $500 million, all supporting the shift to higher value. 
Let me spend a minute on our view of the full year. As I said earlier, our operating results are moving to a continuing operations basis, so they exclude the financials associated with the semiconductor business in the current and prior periods. So when we reflect the discontinued operations in the base, our full year 2013 operating EPS was $16.64 versus $16.28 based on the prior definition. Within this new operating definition, we've considered a number of items in our guidance for 2014. 
First, we've completed the initial closing of the sale of our System x business. And as we said, we will no longer have the revenue and profit associated with that business. But in the fourth quarter, we will report a gain on the sale, net of related deal and performance-based costs. That net gain will contribute about $0.75 of earnings per share, but that does not reflect the lost profit in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we execute some of our plans to drive simplification and accelerate productivity in our business, we expect to take a workforce rebalancing charge in the fourth quarter. We're starting to work through our plans, but at this point, we'd expect to take a charge of up to $600 million. 
We've also had a dramatic move in currencies. We've taken into account an impact based on current spot rates. We'll see how that plays out. 
And of course, we've considered the rate and pace of business coming out of the third quarter, including the environment. As I noted, we saw a slowdown in September, and the fourth quarter is our largest transaction quarter.
Put all of this together, and we expect full year 2014 operating EPS to be down between 2% and 4%. And that's off of last year's comparable base of $16.64. Given that reduced outlook for earnings, we see a comparable impact to free cash flow for the year. As I mentioned, we can estimate the x86 divestiture impact at about $0.5 billion in the quarter. And so with that included, we see free cash flow for the year between $12 billion and $13 billion at this level of income. Of course, this doesn't include the gain from the divestiture. 
Looking forward to 2015, we've always considered a few factors as we look at the progress toward our 2015 objective: the trajectory of the business, including the macroenvironment; the investments we need to be successful over the longer term in enterprise IT; and our return of capital to shareholders. Two of these have now changed: the trajectory of the business and the timing of investments we need to make. Of course, it remains a priority to return significant value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Given our third quarter performance, the actions we're taking and with only 15 months until the end of 2015, we no longer expect to deliver $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. 
As is our practice, we'll provide our view of 2015 in January. In the meantime, we have a clear and compelling strategy, and we're accelerating our implementation. We will continue to manage our business for the long term, and we will absolutely continue to return significant value to our shareholders. 
Ginni and I look forward to your questions.",4841

Obviously, there's a lot of new info here, so I'm trying to understand or clarify how we should think about the unifying theme here for the shortfalls you're seeing. The challenges that really began in 2013 were primarily centered on the growth markets. Can you talk about how much of your current challenges are still centered on that issue? And how much of it is now well beyond just the geographic problem at this point? And I guess related to that, how are you thinking about the potential for stability in growth markets and what that would do for your turnaround potential in 2015?",112

Thanks, Bill. I guess from a unifying theme perspective, the thing that we've been talking about since 2013 is the -- both the secular and cyclical challenges we've had in our hardware business, and we talked about the profit loss year-to-year last year. Now relative to the growth markets, that hardware business has a -- had a sort of an outsized effect because it does represent more of the business there than what we see in the major markets. So that theme within their current results continues despite the actions we've taken within the hardware business to reposition that. We are not yet seeing the benefits -- all of the benefits of that repositioning. So as we've talked about, we repositioned POWER, we have divested of the xSeries business. We will wrap on the zSeries cycle, if you will. That's the cyclical element of this. So the ongoing theme of the hardware business continues, and it does have an outsized impact on the growth markets. Now relative to the growth markets, specifically, the other -- the one other point I'd make is that there is not a homogeneity around the performance of these growth markets. What we saw in the growth markets is a continuation of, what I'd call, disparate revenue performance. So Brazil continues to do well. China continues to decline as that hardware business affects them fairly substantially. India declined in the quarter. What we see in the third quarter was, where we have heavy transactional content, we tended to have a much bigger decline in that September month. So again, the unifying theme around hardware continues. And specifically, within the -- in the growth markets, we're seeing the disparity of performance continue, and the September impacted those transactional businesses much more dramatically.",297

Are there additional asset sales on the table? And also, how likely is it that we see more transformative acquisitions going forward?",38
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4345.0,705496.0,31150146.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things, Katy. First, we do invest at a high level every year already. We spend, as you know, about $4 billion in capital. We spend $5.5 billion in research and development, as examples. And we remain acquisitive. We've had a number of acquisitions this year to solidify, if you will, the core capabilities we've built around our strategic imperatives. So when we think about accelerating the shift, think about it from a SoftLayer perspective, for instance. We said, earlier in the year, we'd put about $1.2 billion into capital into SoftLayer to expand their footprint around the world. Now we're not going to add over $1 billion to our overall capital build. We'll probably wind up adding just a few hundred million year-to-year. But again, we're shifting that into the SoftLayer business, and that shift happens over time. And we think we have a pretty good set of facts around why and how that's working. So you saw, again, this quarter solid double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. So as that shift happens over time, we've been able to shift. Now we're going to accelerate that, and rebalancing our skills is an element or a means by which we can accelerate that shift. So yes, we will remain acquisitive. We still believe we have the core capabilities for our view of enterprise IT around data and cloud and engagement built, and so we'll continue to add capabilities around those, but our core capabilities are in place. We do invest at a very high level, and so we'll just accelerate the means by which we're shifting.",273

Ginni, IBM is missing its free cash flow goal this year by $3 billion to $4 billion, which, certainly, in investors' eyes, is a really significant margin. The announced actions feel not that different, quite frankly, from what IBM has been doing for the last 10 years, ongoing restructuring, organizational changes and select dispositions and the migration to higher-margin businesses. So I guess my question for you is, do you think this time is different in the sense that do you view the current results as effectively a crisis at IBM? And how do you gauge this magnitude of disappointment? And given that, do you believe that your responses should be outsized and different from what you've done historically? And do you believe they are? Because certainly, at the surface, they feel somewhat consistent with what you've done before.",145

Look, let's just back up 1 second. And first, let me give the context. As you said, does this time feel different? And so as you and we and I've talked with all our investors, this time in this industry is different, right, with these 3 shifts all going on at once. So it is unprecedented change, which then leads to your question. There is no doubt, look, in this quarter -- and part of the reason I'm on the call, obviously, we were disappointed in this quarter. But when we talk about what we're doing for the long term in these actions, these actions go on the heels of what has been a series of what I think are very bold actions from the entire year with a very clear strategy, one that's around moving to the enterprise IT to the era of cloud, one that's around data and analytics for transforming our clients' industries and professions and then social, mobile and I can't underscore enough, security. So when you step back and look at the full year, when we've said these will reorder our industry and therefore, we've got to reinvent ourselves like we've done in prior generations, but it will be around these things. And just go back to January. Watson, a $1 billion investment to start the group. As Martin just talked about, $1.2 billion to extend our data centers, 25 to 40 for cloud. Then $1 billion for Bluemix. It is a platform, a Platform-as-a-service that will provide a platform for innovation for many years to come. Not to mention the Power8 having been redone, developed bottom up for data and cloud. Then $3 billion of research and development for semiconductors that secure our long-term future. Not to mention what we did with Apple with SAP, which are really a fundamental change in partnering strategy that not only apply to Apple and SAP. They really point to us being the go-to enterprise that people come to on how to change and how to enter into the enterprise business, along with having divested, as you just heard, as you well know, $7 billion of revenue, which, by the way, was at a loss, $500 million loss, right? So empty calories, as some of my investors would say. And then the reprofiling of the STG business. So on the heels of those bold actions, these are 3 more that continue. And I consider them quite bold. The idea of cloud altogether, integrated vertical, and then not to underestimate this point about speed and what we are doing. I want to really sort of punctuate this point on speed. These divestitures do give us an opportunity to go ahead and simplify the business and remove layers. Make no mistake, that's important because the strategy is correct, and now it's our speed of execution that needs to continue to improve.",483

I wanted to talk about earnings power. I'm an old free cash flow guy. Call me antiquated, but the free cash flow has been averaging, let's call it, between $12 and $14 the last 2 years. Your guidance now is about $12.40 if I take the midpoint. And you're still reporting EPS and guiding for EPS that's $16 plus. And we've just had, obviously, a major setback here. And usually, when we're dealing with IBM, we have a road map and all those things to kind of guide us. But in my training, free cash flow -- EPS usually migrates towards free cash flow. So it seems like you have a lot of increased investments and whatnot that are going to keep free cash flow low for some time. So I guess I wanted your view of earnings power. And could we see flat to down EPS for several years now as these 2 numbers meet in the middle? Or is the EPS set to have growth from the $16 level despite free cash flow being significantly below?",187

Sure, Ben. Thanks for the question. A couple of points. First, from a free cash flow standpoint and your data that you just quoted, I won't rehash it. But with a cash tax headwind this year, which we've talked about in the past, that's obviously an impact. And the way the Lenovo transaction is structured has a free cash flow impact, not only in the fourth quarter of this year, but that will carry through a little bit to next year as well. In terms of capital investment requirements and what we need going forward, as I mentioned on Katy's question, we'll grow capital where we see opportunity, and the SoftLayer example is a good one. But in total, I would expect our capital requirements to be fairly flat to up a little bit. They won't change dramatically going forward. And so once we get through some of these impacts, if you will, some of these headwinds on the cash line, I think we'll have a relationship that is more like what you're used to from us. Now there are some other impacts that will affect, if you will, the ratios as opposed to the free cash flow alone. So as an example, you noted the earnings number on an earnings per share. Now that has obviously the gain from the Lenovo transaction in it, but that goes into the investing section of free cash flow. It doesn't go into the free cash flow area. So there are some other impacts or some other dynamics around the free cash flow in the near term that are going to impact those ratios. The balance sheet itself -- when we look at the balance sheet itself, it looks as though it's tracking. When you start -- once you make some of these -- once you recognize some of the adjustments that we made, the balance sheet itself is continuing to track to the profitability, and we would expect that to continue as well.",332

However, you obviously have 2 very big important businesses beyond that, both services and software. And I guess, specifically in software, you had a pretty easy comparison this year. And I'm wondering if you could just better help us understand exactly what the issues are in software and what you mean by making software more consumable through digital channels and how that's going to impact the business.",92

Sure, David. A couple of things on software. First, when we say more consumable on -- through digital channels, when we look at how the world is evolving in terms of how our clients will try, will then buy, a lot of that's moving into a model where they essentially have it through like what we have with our Bluemix, our store, if you will, our platform that allows them to try and get access to Bluemix. So if you haven't looked at our Bluemix content yet, I would encourage you to get a sense of what we mean by moving to a more digital engagement. On software, specifically on performance, we did see, as we -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see a slowdown in September, and that was true in software as well. And obviously, the software performance has a pretty profound impact on our profit, given the margin. Within software, when we looked at our performance, you saw that our WebSphere business continued to grow. It did reasonably well. Our SaaS business, our software as a service business across all of software, continued to do well, where we had a bit of a struggle within our IM business, in our Information Management business. Some of that's due to product transitions. And some of it, as we said on the call, is the way we're providing flexibility around our clients as they engage in these Enterprise License Agreements (sic) [Enterprise Licensing Agreements] as they engage to try to manage their capacity requirements. So again, the software performance impacted certainly in September, but not uniformly. We did have pretty good growth in, as I mentioned, in WebSphere and some challenges in the IM business. But disappointing, as we've said, a disappointing quarter for us in software.",302

I believe you recently took some of your executives out to the Valley. And I know, when I go out, I generally come back pretty depressed. They all argue. Of course, they're going to disrupt the large companies, that the large companies basically have to break up. There's an inevitability to the difficulties that companies like IBM face. I was curious what you took away from that, if you feel better or worse about IBM's ability to come back. And conversely, our surveys suggest a lot of your customers do want IBM to help them to move forward, but I think investors are concerned that you won't get a lot of these new companies who do start out with a different kind of infrastructure. I wonder if you could comment on that.",137

First, I've been out there many times actually, so not even just one. And when you take a look at our SoftLayer business -- and I think this is actually an important point as we have moved not only Watson but SoftLayer itself to be a platform for innovation for many companies. And so what we are finding is that many are very interested in SoftLayer. And SoftLayer runs some of the most interesting start-up companies that there are. So on one hand, it's about providing them with infrastructure. But then Bluemix and this Platform-as-a-service, and then the idea that Watson as a platform, which, as you know, is a very different approach we've taken, already, 3,000 of those partners are in line to get onto Watson, many of those from the West Coast. So that's one set of messages I pick up that pertain from what I could call the start-ups. But to your other question, I think -- as well and equally interesting to our current client base, I was with 30 CIOs of our biggest clients, just -- it was just the tail end of last week. And to me, it was very interesting to hear them talk about what they really need and are going to need even more of our help from. And it was a one -- was a role that one of them called being a navigator. That there are many of these start-ups out there. And that's interesting for innovation. And I agree. Every company will do some innovation, and many of these are cloud companies and the like. But at the end of the day, this gets integrated with how their businesses operate today. And you can see this now sort of peaking into a point to say, ""Hey, look. You're the ones that understand how an enterprise operates and how we should pull all these together."" This is a wonderful opportunity for us, and it really matches -- and I believe we have placed the right bet when we said, in cloud, the most -- one of the most important attributes would be hybrid. And that's this idea of all of us will build businesses, part on the cloud. In fact, you'll see most of that around things that need to move fast. And then you'll have your systems of record. You'll need to integrate them. That's the word hybrid. And we're seeing that play out. That's what people are looking for. And that's, as you know, where we doubled down in creating a lot of capabilities around hybrid in the cloud, about data. We said, at the end of the day, it's going to be all about data, and it's going to be about security. And I believe, sure enough, all 3 of those are coming to pass.",481

I heard words like workforce rebalancing. It sounds like you're shifting more to global delivery, more automation, right, and sales and processes. So what does this all mean for headcount? Can we see a big change in the headcount? And more importantly, what's the impact on culture?",65

It's a good question. So a few things. We have been reducing headcount just as a function of some of the divestitures that we've been in. So as an example, when we divested of our customer care business, our headcount's come down. And when we finished the xSeries divestiture, again, same kind of pattern. So our overall headcount is obviously down. From a culture perspective around the shift to global delivery centers, quite frankly, we're -- we have not been as aggressive here as others have been, so we think we have an opportunity to move more of that work to where we can put it into a more common platform. So yes, the overall headcount is coming down. And yes, we will be moving more aggressively into global delivery centers. But again, we have not been as aggressive as others. And then the other thing I'd point out is that, that reduction in overall headcount also allows us now to think about how we simplify our business. And some of what you heard on our -- in my prepared remarks were around trying to simplify the business. So yes, overall headcount is coming down. And I think what we would expect is not a dramatic shift, if you will, in the employee base, but just a reflection of what you have seen us publicly announce.",228

And let me -- Tien-tsin, let me go ahead at it. I really want to talk about this point on culture because this is something that we have been working on. And I think it's, again, important as part of any reinvention of any company, you have to go and match the culture with it. And I think of a couple of defining characteristics of the culture we are building here. One is speed. The second is the word engagement. And the third, Martin just mentioned, around simplification. And so make no bones about it on speed with the whole team. And as many of you know, I've been on this and with our teams. And it's not enough to tell teams about that you need to go faster. The point is, you point them to where we're going to go. We've been very clear about the strategy. And then it's also how you work. And many people call that agile or DevOps. It's just kind of speed that comes with, you try things, you fail, you correct them, you keep moving forward. And that, in fact, is what we are building around the company. In many of the places when -- where we have done that already, great result, and we're going to continue down that path. So I underscore speed. And then the second is this idea about engagement, which, really, our use of social and mobile within our own company. Think of that as the production engine that makes things go faster. And it's also, by the way, what we do with commercial clients. But we have done a great deal of work on this topic to allow the IBMers across 170 countries to both move to the future and move there with speed, this idea of engagement. And then as I said, Martin mentioned, simplify. And part of you simplifying is this idea of taking layers out, which is what we just -- I just talked about a minute ago. So culture is paramount. Take away the word speed and engagement.",346

Maybe if you can just help us understand a little bit. When we look at the results geographically, it looks like all geographies were down. So some may say it's more of an industry situation. But then when we look at IBM's results and compare them to the peers out there and the competitors who maybe are unique individual company, they're all seeing a lot better growth. So then when they say that actually, IBM focused or challenges. Can you help us better understand if you view this more of industry or IBM not being nimble enough?

So Jim, first, let me -- when I think about revenue in our company, I think, first and foremost, about moving us to higher value. And so when you think a higher value, as we've clearly staked out, this idea around data and analytics, around cloud and around social mobile and security. I want to take you back and just remember that, in this quarter -- and in fact, by the way, those collectively grew almost 20%. And it's improved every quarter, grown every quarter, a higher number.

These were individual businesses. They would be very highly applauded for their growth rates. And then on social, mobile and security, again, 8 quarters double digit. And so these are, in and of themselves, large businesses with very high growth rates. So I view those compared to their peers in those areas, they're doing quite well. Now when I take a look and you say, what do I see overall, now we do have core franchises. Core franchises that we've said, they do mission-critical work. In many cases, we need to keep innovating on them to improve their margin, but they may not be in growth markets. And as you know, we just as well added to the growth challenge and no apologies for divesting of revenue that is not high value, not core. We need to redeploy that capital to other things. This announcement this morning of GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a great example of that, right? That is a business that requires a fair amount of capital, but requires even more going forward, as you look at what's happened, as you go from 22 to 10 to 7 nanometers, let alone the larger wafer size. And so that is someone else's business. They're going to do that well. We're going to redeploy that capital into those growth areas. So I -- when you think of growth, I want you to keep -- we keep saying the word mix. We're mixing into to what we believe are the areas that are aligned with the shifts in the marketplace and then managing for high value. So I just -- one last question or one point I'd make kind of on macro that might be of interest. I mean, I take a look, and as Martin said, I can only speak to what happened in our September, as what we saw was both broad-based across the world. But clearly, in the areas where we were high, transaction revenue impacted more. But as well, I did see -- when you look by different industries, I see different industries doing different things. So as an example, Financial Services, very focused on things like omni-channel, cybersecurity, as you might expect. In fact, I had done a dinner with some of the largest CEOs of all the clients in France. And there were 2 topics we talked about: data analytics and security, the entire 4-hour dinner. And so this topic, and certainly, in cyber -- in cyber itself and then married with when you do omni-channel, the impact you have with channel reach, big in Financial Services, same in retail. So you see some industries pointed more in one way, others pointed more towards efficiency, so I do see differences around the world. But again, back to that September, just based on what we saw, and time will tell whether what we saw is pure execution. We're treating it that way. Or time will tell whether it was something broader.",509

Can you grow services? Outsourcing is about 45% of revenues -- services revenues, and outsourcing backlog is down about 8% in constant currency. Outsourcing signings in constant currency declined 17%. Coupled with that, maintenance, it's about 13% of services revenues, continues to decline. So when you think about that question I want to add on to, why is IBM underperforming Accenture so dramatically? Is this part of the organizational structure? So it really -- Ginni, you mentioned speed and engagement. It seems like IBM continues to underperform. Would IBM be better off with a different organizational structure, perhaps even breaking up the company further that allowed for greater speed in an organization? So the 2-part questions. Can you grow services? And then why is IBM underperforming a market leader like Accenture so dramatically?",143

So in terms of services, we did not have the signings performance that we were looking for. Now we have some pretty big deals. I wouldn't say that those deals are gone. Those deals are still out there and we're -- the teams continue to work them. There are -- as always, there are a series of complexity and regulatory environments and things. So we had a large pipeline. And when we entered in -- unfortunately, because we didn't get them done, we -- or fortunately, maybe we have a large pipeline as we exited the quarter as well. So we did not get the signings that we wanted. Now as we've talked about in the past, within any given quarter, but if I look at it over a longer term, about 70% of our revenue growth is driven by the backlog that we enter a year with. And our backlog now, adjusted for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, is down about 2%. But what we've been seeing is better yield out of that backlog than what we've seen in the past. And so a few dynamics. Backlog, down a little bit. But with better performance in terms of the -- what we're getting out of the backlog, we've done a bit better. And then on the in-quarter signings, what we have in the past talked about in terms of base growth, which the way to think about that is sales into existing customers where we already have contracts, there are generally 2, what I call, forms of that. One form is where we are adding more work, so deploying more servers on their behalf or something of that sort, and we did not see that as much as we expected in this quarter. And also, there are some of -- our contracts have more volume-related metrics tied to their performance, and we didn't see the volume levels that we had expected. Now that could be, again, macro-related. So from a services signings perspective and how it feeds in, I would say that we are not relying on, in our guidance, a dramatic turnaround. That business, however, does have some pretty strong underpinnings in it with regard to what we saw in the -- in kind of the base strategic outsourcing business, very good signings growth. Bear in mind that, with the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, that GBS business is going to be down obviously because we're not in that business anymore. So across services, not the quarter we wanted in signings, but some metrics and some dynamics underneath it that are kind of consistent with what we saw coming out of the third quarter. On our GBS business, very good performance when we move and where we've moved to the new areas, including front-office digitization of things, we've talked about. So very strong performance in the GBS elements of the business, where we see the future. And in fact, the pipeline now is more than half of that future business. And also, we'll start to see the benefit of -- some of the benefit of our partnership with Apple in the GBS business as well as they start to deploy those mobile apps that we're going to announce this quarter. So the GBS business is kind of a mix between very strong performance where we move to the future and continued price pressure and profit pressure in that more traditional packaged applications business. It is very price competitive. The incumbents are -- the incumbents in an account are protecting those accounts. And obviously, to break-in, we're having to be more aggressive, so it's a pretty aggressive environment.",620

I would just add a couple of points here. And that, one, the comment about versus Accenture, right? Now remember, managing for high value. So when you look at that from a margin point of view, you would say something different. And so a couple of things. As Martin just described where we grow, I think it's important to see in their business, the team has aligned across where the growth areas are and then aligned in other areas where they need to really just focus on efficiency and productivity. That will allow them to continue to go faster. So an example, the team is aligned around strategy and analytics together. We just talked about that result. They've aligned around what they call mobile and interactive. In fact, we put another $100 million into these mobile studios -- interactive design studios around the world. We are now the largest digital agency as measured by AdAge, not ourselves, largest digital agency out there. So their strategy and analytics, big practice around mobile and interactive, both of those have very good growth. And then I'll just complement it, where Martin said, the other 2 practices, ERP, and then the other is application development maintenance. And between those, you saw a pricing pressure on application packages, and you saw it as well, as you just described it, on the application maintenance area. But I believe the right way to grow, they've actually aligned themselves, 2 different formulas, and that is the right focus. Because remember, again, it's about managing for higher value.",260

So as we've talked about in the past and I mentioned on my prepared remarks as well, as currencies have kind of a one directional long-term trend here, our hedging programs to help us manage our cash position really have no benefit to the I&E [ph] anymore. So it was -- the sharp move in the third quarter was relatively small. I mean, it was an impact in the quarter, but relatively small to what we see coming in the fourth and next year. Now this is all based on the most recent exchange rates, and we don't know where this is going to wind up. But in the fourth quarter alone, as an example, FX could be up to $0.25 in EPS on a year-to-year basis just from the moves to date. So it has a pretty profound impact on our profitability in the near term. And again, the hedging programs don't have an I&E [ph] benefit, if you will, on a year-over-year basis as the currencies continue to move. Now next year, we'll talk more about next year when we get together in January, but that magnitude of impact is consistent with what we see in the fourth. Again, it's a pretty substantial impact to us. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, it wasn't just that it was a sharp move. It was that, interestingly, each of the currency seemed to work against us. Most of the time, we see some benefits from some of the crosses -- some of the cross FXs, but we just did not see that this quarter.",268

You're obviously talking about a bit of a downturn on the free cash flow number. But I'm curious, how do you think of the buyback program as you go forward? You told me it decelerated in the last few quarters. And then when you talk about excluding initiatives into the newer IT market, does that suggest maybe we start to look at more deals or maybe even bigger deals? So maybe just start in the buyback and the M&A side of the equation as we go forward.",109

So I'll -- maybe address the acquisition side of this first. We do continue to see ourselves being active. Now our acquisition model, which we think is a powerful one that works quite well for us, is really built around a couple of basic principles. One is that we are not looking to acquire to change, if you will, who IBM is, right? We have a very good position in enterprise IT. And our acquisition strategy is to supplement our view of where we see enterprise IT moving around data, cloud and engagement. Two, we need to -- in order to drive the economics out of these acquisitions, we need to find things that we can put into our distribution channel immediately and get the -- and start to get the returns immediately. And what that tends to mean for us then is that acquisitions tend to be smaller because they have not yet fully globalized. And we want to take advantage of that by bringing those products out to our clients. And then three, the basics here, and my boss sitting next to me is going to remind me as well, we don't do what I would call strategic -- and I'll do the air quote, ""strategic acquisitions."" They have to make sense economically, and we'll continue to make sure that our acquisition content is on a sound economic basis. In terms of share repurchase, we have been quite aggressive. And the share repurchase and the resulting reduction in shares is fairly -- it's fairly linear. It's something we've been doing for a long time. We've been returning capital to shareholders. The result or the impact, as I've mentioned, fairly linear. So if you were to reduce -- if we were to reduce our share repurchase going forward, it would have a commensurate reduction in how many shares we take out obviously. That's not going to surprise you. But remember, we've been -- since we've been aggressive, we can still have -- going forward, we can still have a very meaningful share reduction even if we were to reduce our levels going forward. And we feel very comfortable with the capacity and the flexibility we still have to continue to be -- to continue to return capital to shareholders, both through share repurchase as well as through dividend.",392

So look, let me -- I think it's probably a good time for me then to wrap up here, and I'd like to make a couple of comments. And the first, I'd like to just really summarize for everyone why I thought it was important to join the call today. As many of you referenced in your comments, we had 2 strategically important announcements that we made. One was this divestiture of the microelectronics business. It's an important strategic move and very important to us. Martin just commented about some of the financials around it, but it is more than that. It is about strategy. The second is -- and the second important reason I wanted to join is we no longer expect to deliver that 2015 EPS objective, which we have talked about. And as you know, it has been in place for some time. But these 2 things do come together, and they're underpinned by what I believe is a singularly important message to our investors in that we are reinventing and we are managing this company for the long term. So while -- make no mistake. Our results this quarter were disappointing, and we don't want to minimize that. We have, though, been very clear that this industry is shifting, and we have been executing a strategy that moves this company to the future. Now I am absolutely convinced that we are over the right targets. We see the evidence of it. You see it in the results in analytics, in cloud, in mobile, social and security. And we have taken, as I was going through, very big steps and bold moves to move this company to higher value. And that does include -- it does include divesting businesses that really don't fit our strategic profile, including today's divestiture of microelectronics. In fact, I'd ask you just to keep remembering that the divestitures this year alone represent $7 billion of annual revenue, but revenue that is absolutely with considerable losses, right? So our company, it is fundamentally better positioned than it was a few years ago. But as I have said, we have more to do and we need to do it faster. Now while many things are changing, as I always say to our team, they're changing because they must. There are some things, though, that will not change and they have not changed. And I want to just end our call on those couple of points. We are going to continue to shift this company and this business to higher value, we're going to continue to manage this business for the long term and we will continue to deliver significant value to shareholders. In the end, I believe these are the principles that are the hallmark of the IBM company. So on behalf of Martin and I, let me thank you for joining us today.",481

What I'll do over the next hour or so is take you through our fourth quarter results, a wrap-up of the year and our view of 2014 earnings per share, and then we'll take your questions. 
A month or so ago, before I assumed the CFO job, I met with a number of investors and analysts, and one of the things I took away is that it's important for me to be clear on IBM's 2015 road map objective and our ability to achieve the earnings per share. So I want to start out by saying that we continue to expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. We'll talk about 2014 a little later, and you'll see that our view of 2014 keeps us on track to that objective.
As we get into the fourth quarter results, you'll see that our software, services and financing businesses are all on solid ground. But in hardware, as you know, we've entered the back end of the mainframe product cycle, and we're dealing with some challenges in other areas. Together, these are impacting our overall results. 
IBM does have a resilient model based on continuous transformation, and we're investing substantially in key opportunity areas. You've seen evidence of that in announcements we've made in the last 2 weeks, and we're rightsizing and repositioning businesses where the market is shifting. This enables us to move to higher value and lead in enterprise IT. As always, we're positioning our business for the future, and as I noted, we continue to expect to achieve at least $20 in 2015 along the way.
So now let me get into the results. In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $27.7 billion and operating EPS of $6.13, which is up 14% year-to-year. We had a good quarter in software, the performance was broad-based, with constant currency growth in all brands. We had strength in several of the areas where we've been targeting our investments, like analytics, cloud and security. Our software revenue was up 4% at constant currency, and profit was up 6%. 
Services year-to-year revenue performance was consistent with our third quarter. GBS, again, had strong performance, driven by our offerings that address the digitization of the front office, and we had continued improvements in the year-to-year performance of Strategic Outsourcing and GTS. Services revenue was up 1% at constant currency and profit up 2%, and we entered the new year with a solid backlog.
Hardware continued to impact our overall performance. We're dealing with some challenges in our hardware business model specific to POWER, Storage and x86. As expected, in System z, we're impacted by the product cycle as we ramped on very strong performance from a year ago. Together, these dynamics significantly impacted our revenue growth and profit. In fact, our Hardware segment profit was down over $750 million in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year. 
From a geographic perspective, performance in growth markets was mixed, though disappointing overall. Looking at our 2 largest regions, Asia Pacific was down, primarily driven by China, while again, we had good performance in Latin America. 
All together, we posted EPS growth of 14%, which we achieved through the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas which drove a mix to higher value software in GBS, yield from productivity initiatives, a modest improvement in our ongoing tax rate, along with substantial benefits from tax audit settlements and the effective use of cash to repurchase shares. 
The full year had similar dynamics and similar drivers. So for 2013, we delivered $99.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net margins and increased our operating EPS 7% to $16.28. Software services and financing all expanded margins and grew profit while hardware declined. Across our businesses, we had strong performance in Big Data analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security.
Looking at our financial metrics for the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5% or 3% at constant currency. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing, which was more than offset by a decline in Systems and Technology. The currency impact to revenue was 2 points, and currency also impacted our profit performance. As we've discussed in the past, a weakening yen drops largely to the bottom line. 
This quarter, we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by 30 basis points, driven by services and an improving mix. Our pretax income of $7.4 billion was down 8% and pretax margin down 80 basis points, with the declines driven entirely by our hardware business. 
Net margin expanded, reflecting a lower tax rate. The fourth quarter rate was significantly lower than our normal operating tax rate and includes the settlement of our U.S. tax audit for the 3-year period from 2008 to 2010. We accrue taxes for uncertain tax matters in our normal operating rate. 
This particular tax audit commenced in late 2011 and concluded with the receipt of the revenue agent report in late November of 2013. The conclusion of the audit resulted in a reduction of tax expense, which was previously recorded in our operational tax rate. While the audit closure had the most significant impact, there were additional discrete items impacting the rate in the quarter. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $6.13, again, up 14% year-to-year.
Looking at the cash metrics, we generated free cash flow of $8.4 billion in the quarter and returned substantial value to shareholders. For the year, we generated $15 billion in free cash flow, which was down over $3 billion year-to-year. The decline was driven by our operational performance, higher cash tax payments and changes in working capital. I'll talk more about cash flow later in the call. We ended the year with a cash balance of over $11 billion, consistent with year-end 2012.
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography and on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 2% year-to-year. We had strong growth in software. The deceleration in year-to-year performance from last quarter was driven by the impact from the mainframe product cycle, predominantly in the U.S. We grew in Canada, and once again, we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, consistent with last quarter. Western Europe performed in line with the market, and here, too, we had good software performance. 
In Asia Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan, where revenue was up 4%. Japan is a great example of how we've shifted our investment and redirected our go-to-market focus to significantly improve our performance. This is now our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. Asia Pacific outside of Japan declined. In total, major markets were down 2%, while the growth markets were down 6%. 
Within the growth markets, we continue to gain share and deliver growth in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa region. Our performance in LA and EMEA has been consistently strong, and in particular, Latin America had a difficult compare, up 18% last year. 
In Eastern Europe, the declines moderated, while revenue from the Asia Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate, primarily driven by China. Our revenue in China was down 23%, so very similar to last quarter. The largest declines in China were in our hardware business. We continue to be impacted by the process surrounding the implementation of a broad-based economic reform plan. While there is more clarity on the overall plan, we continue to believe that it will take some time for our business in China to improve.
So to wrap up the discussion of the growth markets, we had good performance in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa, and while we're disappointed with our performance in certain regions of the growth markets, we continue to see good opportunity in all regions over the long term and we're continuing to invest in these key markets. 
Turning to the segment perspective, I've already commented on the revenue drivers. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved 0.3 point. We expanded margins in both Services segments, and the relative strength in our Software business drove an improving mix. The improvements are mitigated by a 5.5 point decline in Systems and Technology. System z margin is up, as you would expect at this point in the product cycle. The other hardware brands are down, reflecting business model challenges. I'll get into this in the STG section.
Our total operating expense and other income was better by 1% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. For the last 2.5 years, acquisitions contributed between 1 and 3 points of expense growth each quarter. Currency contributed 2 points of decline, driven almost entirely by translation, so our base expense was better by 1 point. 
Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift our spending. We're driving productivity across the business, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives. Much of the savings is reinvested into the business to drive our growth areas. So what you see here is the net effect of these actions.
Turning to the categories of expense that had year-to-year impacts, there is just 1 area to point out. Our accounts receivable provision was up nearly $60 million year-to-year. Our reserve coverage is up less than 20 basis points, though flat versus September. 
And finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the fourth quarter, the hedge activity across cost and expense was neutral in the period, and there was little year-to-year change in the impact from our hedges. For the last few quarters, we've been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen. Because our business in Japan is dominated by local services without cross-border cash flows to hedge, the impact falls largely to the bottom line. This was the case again in the fourth quarter, and the current spot rates would continue through next year. So unfortunately, we'll be dealing with another year of currency impacts to the bottom line. 
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $15 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. Pretax profit was up 2%, and pretax margin expanded by 0.9 point. Total backlog was $143 billion, up 2% at spot rates and up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both the transactional and the outsourcing businesses. 
Turning to the 2 segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency, in line with last quarter's year-to-year performance. Major markets returned to growth at constant currency for the first time since the first half of 2012 led by Europe while our growth markets performance lagged. With revenue down 1% at constant currency, our GTS outsourcing performance improved from the third quarter. 
We're starting to benefit from several of the large transformational contracts we signed earlier in 2013. At the same time, we continued to see a decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and can be economically sensitive. ITS revenue was flat year-to-year at constant currency. 
We continue to shift the business toward higher-value managed services such as business continuity, security and cloud. Within our cloud offerings, SoftLayer contributed 1 point of revenue growth to total GTS. SoftLayer provides unmatched performance, flexibility and breadth for public and hybrid cloud workloads, and we've just made a commitment to significantly expand our global cloud capacity.
Turning to GTS profit, pretax profit declined 2% in the quarter. Our growth markets performance contributed to the profit decline. In addition, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as cloud, mobility and security. While these initiatives are starting to contribute to the top line, we'll get better profit results as they get to scale. GTS pretax margin expanded by 0.4 point. The margin improvement was driven by tough-minded spend actions and benefits from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, up 1% as reported and up 4% at constant currency. This was a good quarter for GBS, and they again gained share this quarter. From a geographic perspective, we had growth in each region at constant currency, led by North America and the growth market countries. Japan continued its solid performance, and Europe grew for the second consecutive quarter. 
Looking at the GBS business by offering, growth was driven by the practices that addressed the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth in each of our strategic growth initiatives, business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. We've been investing to build capabilities and now have nearly 20,000 resources in GBS, focused on the growing digital front office opportunity. For example, in the area of Big Data, our capabilities span from BAO strategy through front office analytics to fraud and regulatory compliance and risk management. And within our back office solutions that address the Globally Integrated Enterprise, we again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications. 
Looking at GBS profit, pretax profit was up 12% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 2 points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were continued benefit from our enterprise productivity initiatives and the second quarter workforce rebalancing. The savings from these actions fuel the investment in our key initiatives. 
Now let me take the discussion back up to the Total Services level. We enter 2014 with a services backlog of $143 billion, and as we said in the past, approximately 70% of revenue in any year is driven by the opening backlog. Looking to 2014, the projected revenue from the backlog is up 1%. The divestiture of our customer care business is expected to close in the first quarter. That will reduce our backlog and impact revenue growth from the backlog by about 3 points. So overall, we expect revenue from backlog to be down 2%. 
Now the balance of the revenue, the other 30% or so, comes from yield from current year signings, as well as sales and volumes in our existing client base. It also includes SoftLayer and some of our cloud services, which generate in-period revenue that isn't reflected in the backlog. 
So to wrap up Services, in the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, pretax profit and expanded margins. We continue to see the strength in the areas of cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet, and we're investing to extend our capabilities.
Our Software revenue of $8.1 billion was up 3% or 4% at constant currency. Our Software revenue continues to mix toward our Key Branded Middleware. With 6% constant currency growth in Branded Middleware, we gained share. Looking at the results by brand, we had great performance in WebSphere. Revenue was up 15% at constant currency and we gained share. 
We had good growth in both our on-premise application server business and newer cloud-based offerings. We continued strong growth in mobile. MobileFirst is our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services, extending value to our clients to reach new markets and gain competitive advantage. And our core WebSphere offerings of business integration and commerce delivered strong growth. We're continuing to add capabilities in this space. Last week, we closed the acquisition of Aspera, which provides best-in-class transfer speeds for movement of Big Data.
Information Management software grew 5% at constant currency and gained share. We had our strongest growth of the year in our business analytics software offerings, led by Business Intelligence and Netezza appliances. And distributed database was up double digits again this quarter. 
In Tivoli, our security business, once again delivered another great quarter with double-digit growth. The transformation driven by mobile and cloud computing is raising the importance of security for enterprise customers everywhere. 
We've been building our capabilities, and across software and services, we now have 6,000 security experts worldwide. We have 3,000 patents in security, and we have 25 security labs worldwide. 
Our software value proposition remained strong for enterprise clients. Our customers continue to increase deployment of our Middleware products, and we're investing and gaining share in social, mobile, analytics, cloud and security. Some of this is delivered in a SaaS model, and we now have over 100 SaaS offerings in our software portfolio. 
In 2013, software revenue grew 3% at constant currency, with Key Branded Middleware up 6% year-to-year. Our software pretax income of over $11 billion was up 3%, and we expanded pretax margins.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 26% year-to-year. System z was down 37% against a very strong quarter a year ago when revenue was up 56%. This quarter, we entered the back end of the mainframe cycle, and as expected, we delivered a higher gross margin on a lower base of revenue. Mix declined 26%, following the largest MIPS shipment in mainframe history a year ago. Let me put the performance of the current mainframe cycle into perspective. 
In the current cycle, we have shipped 28% more MIPS, a measure of capacity, compared to the same period in the prior cycle. The revenue and gross profit in the current cycle are each about 99% of the previous cycle, net of currency. Mainframe provides the highest levels of availability, reliability, efficiency and security, which positions it as the ideal platform for high-volume, mission-critical workloads. This additional capacity that I mentioned is a reflection of the ongoing relevance of the mainframe to our clients and provides IBM with financial returns consistent with past cycles. 
In our POWER business, revenue declined 31%. We continue to ship significant capacity into the UNIX market. However, this has been more than offset by significant price performance, resulting in lower revenue. As we've said in the past, we've been very successful in the UNIX market, and we're taking 2 actions to improve our business model here. First, we're making the platform more relevant to clients, and to achieve this, in the fourth quarter, we introduced a new integrated facility for Linux offering, which enables our clients to run Linux workloads in their existing servers. This mirrors the successful strategy we executed on our System z platform. 
We'll expand our Linux relevance even further with POWER8 later this year, which will provide additional Big Data and cloud capabilities. Through our open POWER consortium, we're making POWER technology available to an open development alliance, building an ecosystem around our POWER technologies. Just yesterday, the Suzhou PowerCore Technology Company announced their intention to use IBM's POWER architecture to provide customized chip design solutions for the China server market. These effects will take some time. Secondly, even with these additional capabilities, we recognize that the size of the POWER platform will not return to prior revenue levels. We will take action in this business to reflect the new business model.
System x was down 15% at constant currency. Within that, PureSystems continues to gain momentum. Across our hardware products, Pure revenue was up more than 30% sequentially. Globally, we shipped over 2,500 systems in the fourth quarter and over 10,000 systems to date. 
Storage hardware revenue was down 12% at constant currency. Our flash solutions continued to gain momentum and contributed a few points of growth this quarter. Our Storwize product again delivered double-digit growth, which was offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings. We also had declines in the high end, driven by significant pricing pressure.
Profit in Systems and Technology segment was down over $750 million in the quarter and over $1.7 billion for the year. About half of the fourth quarter decline was driven by System z due to the product cycle, though platform is secularly strong with a solid business model. Our other hardware businesses are dealing with business model issues due to market shifts. We will make these products more relevant while rightsizing these businesses to meet the new value proposition.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $8.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $6.2 billion quarter-to-quarter but down $1.1 billion year-to-year. This is a similar quarter-to-quarter increase to what we saw in the third to fourth quarter of 2012, despite the fact that this year, we didn't have the benefit of a z cycle. Historically, over half of our annual cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter. 
In 2013, we generated 56% of the full year in the fourth quarter, and this is the highest percentage in several years. On a full year basis, we generated $15 billion of free cash flow, which was down $3.2 billion year-to-year. There were 3 key drivers of the year-to-year decline, our operational performance, higher cash taxes and changes in sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by lower capital expenditures and the fact that we prepaid certain retiree medical payments in 2012. 
As for the uses of cash for the year, we spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies, including 3 in the fourth quarter, Now Factory, Xtify and Fiberlink. We also returned almost $18 billion to shareholders in 2013, including over $4 billion in dividends, and we bought back 73 million shares for approximately $14 billion. On a net basis, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $12.8 billion, and at the end of the year, we had $14.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $39.7 billion, of which $27.5 billion was in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged at roughly 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $12.2 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 39%. We had good performance in our pension plans in 2013. The interest rate environment resulted in higher discount rates at year end, particularly in the U.S., and the pension liability remeasurement resulted in an increase to our equity. 
Our defined benefit qualified plans had solid asset returns and continue to be well-funded, and importantly, our cash requirements remain stable. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
Let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the full year from a few perspectives, starting with performance in some key growth areas. We've been continuing to shift our investments to address the key trends in IT, like social, mobile, Big Data analytics and cloud. A few years ago, we identified and established objectives for 3 growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud, that capture much of these trends. I've talked about how these growth areas have contributed to our performance within the segments, and I want to report on how they've done at an IBM level for the year. 
Smarter Planet grew about 20% year-to-year, with strength across all areas, including Smarter Commerce, industry solutions, Smarter Cities and social business. We believe that data as a natural resource will drive demand going forward and Big Data analytics will provide the basis for competitive differentiation. 
In 2013, we grew business analytics revenue 9%, led by GBS and by Software. This is now nearly a $16 billion business for us, which you'll recall was our original target for 2015. We've already taken our 2015 objective for business analytics revenue up to $20 billion.
Our cloud solutions addressed the full scope of customer requirements, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds, as well as platform and SaaS-based solutions. For the year, we delivered $4.4 billion of revenue for cloud-based solutions. That's up 69% year-to-year, and within that, $1.7 billion was delivered as a service. As we've said in the past, there's overlap between these initiatives. In total, software makes up about half of that combined content. This improves our business mix and contributes to our margin expansion. 
Now looking at 2013 from a segment perspective, our Software business continued to grow, fueled by these key areas. We returned to revenue growth in GBS, leveraging the investments we've made in the digital front office, and our GTS revenue trajectory improved and is stabilizing. In software, services and financing, we grew profit and expanded margin. 
Clearly, we do have some underperforming areas. First, we have a business model issue in parts of our hardware business, which we'll address through targeted investments in areas like flash and PowerLinux and by rightsizing for the demand characteristics we expect. And second, we've had recent declines in some of the growth markets where we'll continue to invest to capture the longer-term opportunity. And keep in mind, we're dealing with a currency headwind, and at current spot rates, this will continue into 2014. 
In 2013, we continued the transformation of the portfolio, shifting to higher value. We maintained high levels of investment, including $6 billion in R&D, $4 billion in capital, and $3 billion in acquisitions, adding significant capabilities to support key areas of growth. At the same time, we announced the divestiture of our customer care business, which we expect to close in early 2014. 
We're continuing to add to our capabilities and improve our position for the future. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week, we announced a significant investment to expand our global cloud footprint. We've committed $1.2 billion to double our SoftLayer centers, and with 40 cloud data centers in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. 
And earlier this month, we announced the $1 billion investment in Watson and established a new Watson Group. This new unit is dedicated to the development and commercialization of cloud-delivered, cognitive innovations. Completing the wrap-up of the year, we also improved our ongoing effective tax rate. We benefited from discrete tax items and we returned a significant amount to shareholders.
All together, we continue to position our business for the long term while dealing with some significant business model issues in hardware. As we look forward to 2014, we'll continue our transformation, shifting our investments to the growth areas and mixing to higher value. We'll acquire key capabilities, we'll divest businesses and we'll rebalance our workforce as we continue to return value to shareholders. Our current view of all of this is included in our expectation of at least $18 of operating EPS in 2014. That's up 10.5% from $16.28 in 2013. 
Some of the actions will be early in the year. For example, in the first quarter, we expect the initial closing of the sale of our customer care business and to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions, which we're currently working on. We'll see the benefits of the first quarter rebalancing action later in the year. As a result, we expect our first quarter EPS to be about 14% of the full year, reflecting the modest gain, workforce rebalancing charge and continued impact from currency. For these reasons, our first quarter SKU in 2014 should be lower than our historical SKU, which has been about 18% of the full year over the last few years. And importantly, we expect to grow our free cash flow in 2014 by about $1 billion. That's faster than net income even after absorbing another significant cash tax headwind and growing capital expenditures. All of this keeps us on track to our 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.

I was just hoping you could confirm that. I think I got the math right. But my question is with regard to a bridge from 2013 to 2014. 
If I look at 2013, you had about $1.50 or so benefit due to tax rate year-over-year, and my calculations are $1.10 and a hit in 2014. So considering that, it seems like you have to have a significant gain, maybe $1 to $2 of gains to get to $18. So again, my question is, can you just confirm the $2.50 or so number for the first quarter? And then do you mind bridging us from '13 to '14 and tell me what's missing? Because there's a big chunk missing and I think it's the gains from the sales.",149

Thanks, Ben, and thanks for the questions. So I guess a few things I'd say. I think your SKU math is consistent with how we would see it as well. So we'll put that aside for now. And on the full year, there are, I think, a number of issues that we should render explicit when we look at going from 2013 to 2014. 
So first, in our 2014 guidance, we do assume a gain from the sale of our customer care business, which was announced last year, and we expect that to close -- that'll close in stages, some in the first, some in the second quarters, and that'll be, in total, about $150 million of pretax gain. So that is in our guidance. There is not, however, another substantial gain or gain assumed in our guidance of at least $18 for 2014. 
So let me talk a little bit about how we see 2014 relative to what we faced in 2013. First, as you saw in our full year results and, obviously, really, clearly, in fourth quarter, we had a substantial year-to-year profit headwind in STG. The STG business on a year-to-year basis for 2013 was down $1.7 billion worth of profit. And of that, $750 million was in the fourth quarter. 
So the fourth quarter was -- obviously, some of it was mainframe, the cycle, and we're not at all worried about the cycle. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are very confident in the secular strength of the mainframe and the cycle. But we do have these business model issues in our p business, our x and our Storage business. 
So on a year-to-year basis, $1.7 billion of impact in STG. Now within our guidance, we are going to get that profit impact neutralized back to a 0 on a year-to-year basis. So we would hold the year-to-year profit that we saw in STG neutral in the year. I'm going to come back to that point at the end again because it's -- there's another important point to be made. We also had -- in 2013, we had about a -- we had a pretty substantial currency headwind, and we think this could have been as much as $600 million on a pretax basis. 
Now we've talked in the past. Some of these things get offset through sourcing decisions and, overall, by the flows that we experienced within the business. But it could have been as much as $600 million. Now we still see -- as we noted in the prepared content, we still see a headwind in profit from currency, but it is not at that same level at the current spot rates. We don't expect it to be at the same level. 
And then finally, on a year-to-year basis, I think we have one other unique item, which is, last year, as you know, we had a substantial workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter, and that is paying back now, right? We didn't get all of it out, all of the payback in 2013, so there'll be some additional benefit from 2014 in that as well. And as we noted in the call, because we're going to be taking our workforce rebalancing charge earlier than we did last year, it'll be in the first quarter. So on a full year basis, there won't be any year-to-year impact. 
We do expect that will be about $1 billion again, same as last year, plus or minus $100 million. We're still doing the work. But on a year-to-year basis, we would assume that -- we would suggest that, that's about the same and, therefore, no year-to-year impact. And then, obviously, we get the payback within the year. So not only do we get the tailwind from last year's, but we get everything this year paid back. 
And then in addition to that, which benefits the whole business, we still have our ongoing workforce productivity initiatives. We have -- which are driving productivity across the business, we have our software business going pretty well. We have our GBS business going pretty well. We see GTS on a profit base in that segment improving. I already talked a little bit about STG getting back to no profit impact on a year-to-year base. 
And then we have our share repurchase program, which will also deliver some EPS on a year-to-year base. So the first answer to your question is we think your math is where we would put it, and then on a year-to-year base, we feel like we have a pretty good game plan for 2014. 
Now -- sorry, Ben, one more thing before we get off STG. Our game plan for STG is flat profit year-to-year. That is not our ongoing model for STG. So we will improve and we do expect that we will improve that model position of STG over time. 2015, we'll see another z cycle, so there'll obviously be a bit of tailwind there. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that when we get this to 0 profit impact, that, that's where we're stopping. We are going to get that business back to grow profit. Thanks, Ben.",873

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537524.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,8,"I just wanted to follow up on that last question. I really appreciate the color. I think as was mentioned before, tax rate has been a huge, huge benefit for IBM in 2013. I think at sort of your normalized tax rate of 23%, earnings would have been up only about 2% year-over-year to about $15.60. Obviously, you reported much higher than that. So if I think about your earnings on a normalized tax rate in 2014, they need to go from normalized $15.60 to $18, which is a 15% increase. 
And so I understand that hardware is going to be flat. That made no money this year. But that implies that Software and Services are going to have to grow EPS at 15% year-over-year, which neither did this year. And so, again, if I look at it through that reality check lens, I guess the question is, particularly, with a very difficult quarter at the beginning of the year, how is it realistic that you get to 15% plus EPS base, EPS growth off a normalized tax rate? And can you be explicit about what you expect your actual accrued tax rate to be in 2014? You've said normalized is 23%, but it's been dramatically lower than that for 3 of the last 4 quarters. So what's your operating assumption for tax rate in 2014?",226
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537525.0,Answer,"Martin Schroeter;Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation",,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks, Toni, and good afternoon to you as well. So I guess I'd say a few things. So our view of the tax rate is 23%. That's our operating assumption. That's our practical assumption. I mean, that's what we think the tax rate is for 2014. Now that does not have discrete items, but we don't have a plan, if you will, for discrete items. We have an operating tax rate assumption of 23%. 
And as you point out, therefore, we do expect that we will have to refill, if you will, the income, the net income required to get there. And I went through a little bit of the bridge with you, as you pointed out, on STG, for instance. I'd say -- I guess I'd say a few other things. One, in terms of how we see the year rolling out, as you noted, first quarter will be -- with the charge, will obviously be down pretty dramatically with the charge in it, and that will pay for itself, as I mentioned, through the year. 
Second quarter, without the charge now, will be up dramatically. And so when we finish the first half, we would see -- with those 2 elements in, we would see about low double-digit growth in EPS when we exit the first half. Now we get to the second half, and the second half also has some interesting dynamics. 
Third quarter, one third quarter, we've got, quite frankly, an easier compare, and we don't have a lot of noise, if you will, from the tax rate in the third, not -- certainly not as much as we have in the fourth. So we would see third quarter growth and fourth quarter growth to be combined a high single digit to get us to be at least $18. But on top of that, we know that in the fourth, we do have this -- that we have to get through this discrete tax benefit, if you will, that we got in the fourth. 
So as we get through the fourth, again, we have the rest of last year's actions that we see continuing to help us. And obviously, the benefit of the actions we'll take in March. And then on a segment-by-segment basis, we do see our way to the guidance of at least $18, even with software performing at its historic level. So we are very -- we feel very good about the investments we've made in the software, and its profit growth trajectory as we enter 2014. 
And we see and feel very good about both the book of business we have and the backlog run out we have in GBS. And they've been delivering double-digit profit growth. And we think they are on track. Now GTS, we think we get some improved margin as we get through the year and our productivity takes -- has a bigger impact on their margin content. And then as you pointed out, STG, we hope to hold neutral or, I guess, we're planning hold neutral within this 2014 timeframe. 
And again, we do have the share repurchase. So with -- if you're -- with a very weak first, very, very strong second, we finish the first half about a little bit ahead of the run rate we need for the year. And then we have to, obviously, offset these discrete tax items in the second half. And we feel like we've got a good operational plan to do that.",584

You've obviously got some cash on the balance sheet. But you do have a 39% debt-to-cap ratio, excluding the financing business, which would, to me, seem like there's not a lot of room to go there. And you got, certainly, commitments to investors on dividends and share repurchase. Some are talking about the need for you to do more M&A given all the technology changes. But whenever I talk to IBM execs, it seems like you're still very much looking at doing a smaller deal that you can really leverage through your global sales force. Do you have to speed -- any change of M&A? And what's the financial flexibility that you refer to?",129
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537530.0,Answer,"Martin Schroeter;Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation",,Executives,14,"Sure, sure. I guess I'd say a few things. So first, as we've talked about for quite a while on our M&A, our strategy and our approach, we find that the financial returns and the economics of smaller deals, once we've put that, sort of that core competency, that core capability in place, we find that attaching smaller capabilities to those do drive exactly as you said. We do -- we are able to take advantage of those through our global distribution network, our global sales force. And we get very good returns on those. 
And we are very pleased with the way we run and the disciplined approach we have around acquisitions. And we are going to continue to do exactly that. It's worked out quite well for us. And we will continue to run a disciplined process. And we'll continue to run a process that looks to acquire content that fits around a set of capabilities that we have. And that we want to extend and drive that through our global sales and distribution network to earn returns. So that's been the model that's worked quite well for us, and we will continue on that. 
Now sometimes those deals are larger. Sometimes, they're smaller. A large deal -- we still think that a few billion-dollar deal is still a pretty big deal. You still have to get these integrated into the business. And that means teams and skills on the ground. We do have capacity to integrate any number of those deals at a single time. That's really the -- one of the beauties of the skills we've built is we can -- we're able to do this, 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 times simultaneously. So we're not constrained in our acquisitions by the number of teams we can put on the ground. 
We can do a series of small deals. They'll have a terrific set of financials. And we have the skills to integrate them and get those to work for us. So that is not at all an issue. And we, again, feel really good about our acquisition policy, process, approach, discipline, and the results we get out of it. 
Now from a financial flexibility standpoint, I think one way to look at it is our debt-to-cap. And we're in a range that we're not uncomfortable in at all. Now this even may -- and when we look forward, we can operate even at a higher debt-to-cap, quite frankly. But the other way that we think about our financial flexibility, particularly as we think about it with regard to acquisitions, is our EBITDA multiple and how close we can push our uses of cash, if you will, and our debt levels against our EBITDA multiple. 
Remember, when we are acquiring something, we have -- with our disciplined process and our ability to get that integrated, we are assuming -- and we've been right most of the time -- we are assuming we're going to get our cash back pretty quickly. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Sometimes it's very fast. But those are all contributing to the operational performance. So though that debt-to-cap, while it's a way to think about our financial flexibility, it is only one way. 
And quite frankly, I think given the cash-generating nature of our acquisition activity, I think that EBITDA multiple may be slightly more appropriate because it's a better reflection of how hard you can push your balance sheet and still integrate the content that you know is going to pay off. So I don't feel as though at this debt-to-cap or at this EBITDA ratio that we have relative to our debt levels that we feel constrained in any way from doing any -- just about any reasonable size deal. And we do have, like I said, we do have a disciplined process.",646

So I guess I'd make a few points. What we announced last week was the creation of a Watson Group. And the Watson Group will have investment of a bit more than $1 billion focused on the development and the research around bringing these cloud-delivered cognitive applications and services to the market. 
Now this is all delivered as a service, right. So it's not like you can -- you can't call us and say, ""I want to buy a Watson."" This is a service delivered through the cloud. We also announced that we would invest up to $100 million in venture investments to help support that ecosystem as the developers around the IBM Watson developers cloud build out their capabilities. So we announced those 2 things. It's a couple of thousand people. This is not a -- it's not a small effort. It's a pretty substantial effort. 
Now with regard to the 2015 roadmap, I think it's important to note that like a lot of things in IBM, these are long-term investments. We do manage the business for the long term. And while we've been clear that we believe we'll achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015 along the way, a lot of what we're doing is paying off down the road, past that. And I would put Watson into that category. So the Watson Group will be -- is part of, if you will, if you wanted to stick it into the roadmap, the Watson Group is within that overall business analytics content. 
Now business analytics for us is -- it hit nearly $16 billion. It hit $15.7 billion of revenue in 2013. Now the original time when we first started talking about our 2015 roadmap, we said that would be a $16 billion business. So we have since taken that up. We got there about 2 years early. We've since taken that up to $20 billion. And the Watson Group will certainly be part of that $20 billion of revenue in the 2015 roadmap, but it is not going to be the thing that drives business analytics in that short time period. This is a much longer-term investment, and it's consistent with the way we manage the business. 
We see trends over the longer term. We have to, obviously, invest in those trends. And this is a good example. So the Watson Group will deliver in the new field of cognitive computing. It does it through the cloud because it's going to be an as a service kind of offering. And we think building out this ecosystem with the right amount of investment is the right thing to do now, even though it's not going to be a big part of the 2015 roadmap.",460

Can you just help us understand a little bit about -- the last few quarters have been down year-over-year. So the first half of the year was very strong on your signings. Then they were soft in the second half of the year. 
As that 11% rolls forward next year, should we look to start to see some healthy growth? Or is there a little bit of margin headwind from it? Or how should we think about -- it's [ supposed ] to have a first half of the year with some positive year-over-year and second half is slowing. I assume a lot of it has to do with the BRIC or growth countries, but maybe you can shed some light?",149
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537538.0,Answer,"Martin Schroeter;Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation",,Executives,22,"Sure, Jim. Thanks for the question. So I think there are a couple of points to be made here. First, the signings, as you know -- and you could hear it within the data you were quoting -- signings can be volatile in any given quarter. And backlog is another element that we've been sharing because that signings content all goes into a backlog and then it drives, obviously, the future revenue opportunity. And I'm going to come back to that in a second because your question, I think, about the future is more going to be around the backlog we see as opposed to maybe the signings in any given quarter. 
Now backlog, we finished up 5% year-to-year and full year services signings were pretty strong growth on a constant currency basis. In fact, it's about the best growth we've seen in the past 5 years. Now in the fourth quarter, the signings were up 1% at constant currency versus the third. And maybe this is to your point of how volatile they are, the third was down 4%. So we went from down 4% to up 1%. 
The dynamic we saw in going from third to fourth was interesting in that in the third, our long-term signings were down double-digit, while in the fourth, they swapped to up double-digit, so very good performance in the longer term, more transformational kind of content in the fourth. And then in the shorter-term contracts, they were up single-digit in the third, and they moved to down double-digit in the fourth. And some of that is because the -- we are mixing our signings -- we're mixing our delivery to higher value managed services, like business continuity and security and cloud. So you're exactly right. 
Signings, obviously, volatile. There is a bit of a shift that we see in our bookings in third going to fourth, again, driven by very good acceptance and pretty strong growth in our longer-term more transformative kind of content, outsourcing. And those tend to be bigger deals. In fact, our larger deals, say, greater than $100 million, in the fourth were up -- sorry, for the full year were up 40% versus the prior year. So we're seeing very good growth in those bigger deals. Now when we talk about backlog, again, backlog we finished the year up 5% at constant currency. 
There are a couple of things to note about, I think, that are worth noting about backlog. First, we are going to close on the sale of our customer care business. And that's going to have an impact to the backlog. So while the revenue from the backlog that we see coming out of the total is -- would drive us to a positive growth rate, the loss of the backlog and the loss of the revenue out of that customer care business is going to drive it to a small negative. And we're, obviously, prepared for that. 
We know -- we have that covered in our guidance for the year. But we are going to see an impact from the sale of that business within that specific element that you mentioned, which is revenue coming out of the backlog. Now the whole year doesn't drive -- the whole year isn't driven out of the backlog. 70% of our revenue in any given year might be out of the backlog, but the other 30% is coming from our in-year or in-quarter shorter-term signings. 
And we've seen volatility there as well. Our base business outside of the backlog struggled a bit in the fourth. We saw a single-digit decline out of that. So we will see growth out of the backlog on an adjusted basis, if you will, without the customer care business. And then the rest of the growth will have to come from -- the rest of the growth will have to come from our base business. Now within that base business, we do have things like our cloud offering. And cloud grew very, very well. And while it doesn't show up in the backlog necessarily, it does provide growth within that other 30%.",690

And then my second question is around the cash flow. You did a great job of providing the bridge to kind of get to the $18 in 2014. Can you maybe go into a little more detail on some of the free cash flow pushes and pulls for 2014?",73
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537541.0,Answer,"Martin Schroeter;Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation",,Executives,25,"Sure, absolutely. So first, just for clarification, our $18, our at least $18 of guidance is all-in. So it has workforce rebalancing charges in it. It has the small gain that we expect. It's all-in. It's of at least $18 all-in basis. And like the roadmap, isn't it, it's an all-in roadmap of at least $20. So if we were to just hit the bottom end of our current guidance of at least $18, we'd have another $2 to go to achieve -- to finish out that roadmap. 
So yes, it's on an all-in basis. On cash flow, so we had a difficult cash flow year in 2013. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we were down year-to-year a bit over $3 billion. And if we were to kind of split up the attribution for that as we did on the call, operational performance, as I mentioned, we were -- we lost $1.7 billion of profit year-to-year just in the STG business, which had a profound impact on our cash. So operational challenges, we had a cash tax headwind in 2013. And then we had a slightly less efficient balance sheet, working capital, if you will, in 2013 as well, which drove the year-to-year decline in 2013. 
Now as we go to 2014, we said we'll grow free cash flow by about $1 billion. A little bit faster than net income, but by about $1 billion. And within that $1 billion, we still have the cash tax headwind of about $2 billion this year. So it's a larger cash tax headwind. But I want to talk about cash -- so that's -- and the bridge, by the way, comes from improved operational performance within the business, and we will improve our working capital position, if you will. That will drive the year-to-year improvement in 2013 to 2014. 
But I'd like to also spend a minute on free cash flow from a model perspective. And from a model perspective, we finished last year, if I were to look at free cash flow on a ratio basis, say, to net income on a free cash flow realization basis, we finished the year in the low-90s on a realization basis. And as I mentioned, this $1 billion would -- and a little bit faster than net income, so obviously, the math says, we'll improve that a little bit in 2014. But we'd still be, we think, in the low-90s even in 2014. 
And then in 2015, in 2015, we would see another improvement when cash tax isn't as big a headwind. And we'd see an improvement back to kind of the mid-90% level. Now that mid-90% level, relative to what we've seen in the past on a realization basis, is below where we've been when it was north of 100%, right? We ran the free cash flow realization north of 100% for many years. And a big chunk of this is the difference between the cash tax and the book tax. 
Now when we go forward on a model basis, we are very comfortable that in the mid-90s, our model holds over the long term. And by model, I mean our model of being able to continue to invest to either build or acquire capabilities that we need to continue to pay the dividend. If I oversimplify all of this in terms of uses of cash: invest to grow, pay the dividend and then return cash, excess cash, if you will, to shareholders. 
Now in the past, when we were north of 100% on a realization basis, that share repurchase element could drive 5, 6, 7 points of EPS growth year-to-year. That's not what our model would say we need. And on a model basis, if we were to be in that mid-90s, we would still deliver 3 to 4 points of EPS growth just on the -- from the share repurchase. So on free cash flow, again, I know you asked a 2014 question. 
But 2014, we will grow again. And we will improve that realization. But even when we look out longer term on a model basis, we are comfortable that in the mid-90s -- which we'll get back to by 2015 -- in the mid-90s, the model in a simplified view, the model from a uses perspective, the model will hold.",722

Thanks, Katy, and good afternoon. So I'll just go through a couple of data points here. As you saw, we did degrade to minus 3% on a constant currency basis in the fourth from minus 2% in the third on a global basis. That 1 point degradation, when you look at the majors, was really centered in z cycle and centered in the U.S. So I'll leave that off to the side because, again, we're comfortable with the z cycle and where we are. 
When we look in GMU, which was the nature of your question, we did see that same point, 1 point degradation. And it is not what we wanted to get done. Now we continue to struggle in hardware. We were still down double-digits in hardware. A little better sequentially from third to fourth, but still down double-digits. And services across the growth market areas, went from a small positive to a small negative in GTS. 
GBS, in fact, GBS went from low-single-digit growth to high-single-digit growth. So they actually did quite well. But it's a smaller part of the business, so it doesn't have as profound an impact on the overall. So when we looked at third quarter to fourth quarter, China's still an issue. Now let's recognize that China has -- is going through a very significant economic set of reforms. 
So in March of 2013, history that everyone knows, but in March of 2013, a new leadership team. In November, they announced some pretty significant structural changes. And we referred to those in the last call. And we were waiting to see what they were. And they looked, in our opinion, they look quite significant. Now many of those changes will affect the state-owned enterprises. And those state-owned enterprises are, quite frankly, some of our largest accounts. So to go from that view of the world down to what did we learn. 
Well, we actually always knew this, but we have to continue to make progress. We are centered pretty heavily in state-owned enterprises. And so it has a pretty profound impact on our business when they slow their purchasing. And so from an execution standpoint, we know we have to spread more into other elements of the buying patterns that we see in China. And we will get that done. But it is not surprising, I guess, to us given our concentration in state-owned enterprises that, that is having an impact on us. 
In many ways, yes, we're in state-owned enterprises, but it's exactly where we want to be. When you think about building an infrastructure for a country, if you will, the IBM platform is critical to do that. So of course, we want heavy reliance or to be in those accounts. And when they slowdown, then we also see an impact. So from an execution standpoint, we recognize that we have to widen, if you will, our client. 
So on the state-owned enterprises and others, while they have slowed, we don't think that this opportunity has gone away, if you will. There is still opportunity. In fact, our interpretation of some of the structural changes they have announced suggest that we'll have expanded opportunities, particularly in regional banking and some privately-owned enterprises. 
So as we expand our footprint in China, we do still see good long-term opportunity. In fact, we continue to invest in China to try to capture that opportunity. But it will take some time to come back. It's not going to rebound immediately. Now the other thing, just math, we do get easier compares in the first and the second and the third quarter, obviously. So that provides a bit of a tailwind.",617

If we kind of adjust 2013 and 2014 for the tax rate, it really implies your business has to improve substantially moving through 2014. With China still kind of in this holding pattern, your hardware is still struggling, the high-end software seems a bit more of a secular challenge or technology challenge. What should investors think about as kind of the top 3 pivot points that you're really looking to, to really have this confidence that you can reiterate both the $18 EPS target, as well as the $20 target for 2015, notwithstanding the tax rate.",106
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4443.0,2053922.0,80537549.0,Answer,"Martin Schroeter;Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation",,Executives,33,"Right, so I guess we did, obviously, get a substantial tax benefit in the fourth, but it really is -- it's not the tax rate, I think it's really the underlying business that is what we're, obviously, focused on improving. And again, as we -- as I said earlier, that hardware impact has been dramatic in all of 2013. 
The currency impact has been dramatic in 2013. And so when we look at the other elements of our business, including in software, we will grow software very consistently with what we grew in prior years. And that assumption is, obviously, within the $18. But within the at least $18, but it also is an assumption that we feel very comfortable with to get to the guidance for 2014. 
On services, we do see good momentum in GBS. We finished the second half of the year with double-digit profit growth in GBS. In GTS, we see based on the contracts we have and the time that those contracts have been in place and the productivity, therefore, that we believe we can drive out of services, we see services back at a model level of growth. 
And then with, again, share repurchase and the overall enterprise productivity initiatives, we expect that at least $18 is right in line with where -- what we should be able to deliver. The other element of this is, we don't have a year-to-year impact from restructuring in 2014. It was about -- it was $1 billion last year. It'll be about $1 billion again this year. So we get -- we eliminate that year-to-year. 
And without the year-to-year impact from hardware, that allows that software and that services profit growth to show up in the bottom line. So without the hardware profit growth impact, less of an impact from currency as we stated, services performing at model, if you will, and software at its historical growth rate, along with EPS, we will -- we'll refill that tax impact and get back to $23. But importantly, we're comfortable with the at least $18.",346

So first, just to make sure you're clear, the first quarter, we would expect a substantial charge, right, about the same as last year, plus or minus $100 million. And we have the gain, but not all $150 million is in the first -- some of it. 
The roadmap we have laid out, the roadmap is a way for us to allocate capital and a way for us to describe to investors how we shift the portfolio. That shift of the portfolio includes acquisitions, includes divestitures, it includes rebalancing the workforce, and all of that translates to an EPS at the end. That EPS is reflective of all those activities. It's got the workforce rebalancing. It's got the gains, if there are any. It's got the shift of investments. So the roadmap is on an all-in basis, if you will, and our guidance is also on an all-in basis. 
So I think the right way to look at our business is to keep it on the basis in which we have described our longer-term performance, now we're only 2 years away from the end of the roadmap now. But our longer-term performance is one where, as we shift the value, we acquire, we divest. And it's important, I think, to look at the totality of that earnings power.

Within that GBS content, we continue to move capability toward our digital front office offerings. And those have been very successful. And so from a -- what's driving the growth in GBS, it's both our success in the digital front office and the momentum coming from business we've put into the backlog in prior quarters. And we see that continuing on the GBS side into 2014. 
In GTS, the growth markets were an impact in GTS in the fourth. Now we think when we look at that business and its trajectory change from fourth -- to fourth from the third, we do see a continued investment required in some of our growth market clients, which is driving some of that content. And we see a -- because we signed some big contracts during the year, we see us in a stage of -- in early stage of some contracts where the productivity, quite frankly, as you would expect, is not as high. 
So as we get into 2014, and those contracts specifically mature and the investments we've made in some of those GMU clients pay off, we do see a bit of a tailwind. Now on the revenue side, in GTS as you pointed out, we do see growth in the backlog. But we are going to lose the impact of the customer care business, which we think, again, knocks the revenue side of that down to a small negative.",264
