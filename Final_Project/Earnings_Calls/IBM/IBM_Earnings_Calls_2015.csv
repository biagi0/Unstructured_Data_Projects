112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,747321.0,32753246.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. Today, I'll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance, review the details of the quarter and wrap up with a discussion of 2014 and expectations for 2015.
Our strategy is focused on leading in the areas where we see the most value in enterprise IT, and in 2014, we made tremendous progress in repositioning the portfolio and making investments to shift into these areas. Our results reflect all of that.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.1 billion, net income of $5.8 billion, free cash flow of $6.6 billion and operating earnings per share of $5.81. Our total revenue performance reflects the divestitures of System x and customer care, which together had $1.6 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we had about a $1.2 billion impact from currency movements. So combined, this represents about $2.8 billion of revenue or a 10-point impact to the reported revenue growth rate. That currency impact was even greater than spot rates suggested 90 days ago. Excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, our total revenue was in line with our expectations.
We once again had strong performance in our strategic imperatives that address the market shifts in data, cloud and engagement. Together, they posted double-digit growth as they did in every quarter of 2014. We had solid improvement in gross and pretax margins as we drive our overall business to higher value. That will certainly continue into this year as we benefit from the recent portfolio actions. And we're continuing to shift our investments in resources to our strategic imperatives and solutions that address our clients' most critical issues.
Looking at the full year from a financial perspective. We delivered $21 billion of pretax income and operating earnings per share of $16.53. We generated about $12.5 billion of free cash flow, paid out over $4 billion in dividends and reduced our average share count by over 8%, while reducing our core debt by $0.5 billion. 
Our strategic imperatives continue to drive strong growth, up 16% in 2014, and that includes an impact from currency. Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security generated $25 billion in revenue, which is 27% of IBM.
Analytics was up 7% on a large base, and with 60% revenue growth, our cloud business is substantial. It's now $7 billion in revenue, and we exited the year with an annual as-a-service run rate of $3.5 billion. That's up from $2.2 billion a year ago.
During the year, we once again spent 6% of our revenue in research and development and invested about $4 billion on capital, supporting actions in a number of areas that will yield financial benefits in future years. Let me mention a few. We introduced our cloud Platform-as-a-service, Bluemix, and are shifting capital to globally expand our SoftLayer cloud data centers. We are bringing Watson's capabilities to the enterprise and building a partner ecosystem, effectively creating a market for cognitive computing. We introduced cloud application innovations around Watson Analytics and Verse. We launched POWER8 and are building the OpenPOWER Consortium. We formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility, with Twitter for Big Data and with SAP and Tencent for cloud. Clearly, we are the go-to platform for the enterprise.
In 2014, we divested large businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, System x and customer care BPO, and announced the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business. These 3 businesses drove $7 billion of revenue in 2013 but lost about $0.5 billion of pretax profit. So while we certainly have a smaller business in terms of revenue, and of course, the divestitures reduced the number of employees, it is a higher-value, higher-margin business. Within that, we are continuing to remix our skills, and as an example, we had over 45,000 hires in 2014, adding to our capabilities in our strategic areas. So we got a lot done in 2014 that positions us for the longer term. I'll talk more about the full year and what it means for 2015 after going through the details of the quarter.
But now let me get into the fourth quarter results. These are all operating results, which are based on continuing operations. We delivered $5.8 billion of operating net income on revenue of $24.1 billion. Revenue was down 12%, but as I just said, that includes about 10 points of impact from currency and divestitures. But we were down 2% at constant currency, excluding the divested businesses.
On that basis, services revenue was flat, our Software segment declined 3%, and Systems and Technology revenue was down 12%. We've seen significant strengthening of the dollar since September. Currency impacted our revenue performance by about 4.5 points or $1.2 billion. This is 1.5 points of growth or $400 million more than anticipated based on spot rates 90 days ago.
Our gross margin was up 60 basis points, driven by improvements in GBS and a mix away from the low-margin System x business. Pretax margin was up 3 points this quarter. PTI includes the gain from the sale of System x, which, net of related transaction and performance-based costs, was $1.1 billion, as well as nearly $600 million of workforce rebalancing charges.
We had a substantial tax headwind in the fourth quarter. Last year, our rate included the benefit associated with the settlement of a U.S. tax audit, and as a result, our tax rate is up nearly 10 points over last year. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $5.81.
Looking at our free cash flow. We generated $6.6 billion in the quarter, which is more than half of the full year. We ended the year with $8.5 billion of cash on hand.
Now turning to the revenue by geography. Because of the geography mix of the System x business, the divestiture impacted major markets growth by 4 points and growth markets by 9 points. We'll focus on year-to-year performance at constant currency and adjusting for the divested businesses in all periods.
On this basis, both major markets and growth markets were down 2%. Within major markets, we had growth in Japan, while North America and Europe declined. Europe's performance improved from last quarter, with improvements in the U.K. and Italy and continued growth in Spain. Our North America revenue was down, driven by declines in Global Business Services, though signings grew for the second consecutive quarter.
Our growth markets year-to-year performance improved nearly 2 points from last quarter. This was driven by China, which was down 1% this quarter. The improvement in the year-to-year trajectory was driven by strong Software performance and several large mainframe transactions. In fact, 4 of our 5 largest banking clients in China added substantial new mainframe capacity. Overall BRIC performance was consistent with last quarter, but the improvement in China offset by weaker performance in Brazil.
Turning to the segment perspective. Our Total Services revenue was flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divested businesses. On that base, GTS was up 2% and we had growth across all business lines: Outsourcing, Integrated Technology Services and Maintenance. Global Business Services revenue was down, with significant growth in the strategic imperatives offset by weakness in some of the more traditional application areas.
In Software, we had good growth in key areas like security, cloud and mobile, but our Software customers continue to utilize the flexibility we've provided, impacting transaction revenue growth and weakness in operating systems. Systems performance reflects the end of the product cycle in our System z mainframe and declines in Power and Storage, though both had modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. 
Our gross profit margin was nearly 54%. That's up 60 basis points from last year. We had solid improvements in GBS, as we mixed toward the higher-margin strategic imperatives. The GTS margin is relatively flat, even with an impact from the divestiture of System x maintenance. Software continued to have a very strong margin at 90%, and we had significant margin improvement in Systems, driven by the divestiture of the lower-margin System x business. So our focus on moving to higher-value spaces is showing up in our gross margin.
The reported total operating expense and other income reflects not only the ongoing run rate of the business, but also the impact of the System x divestiture and the charge for workforce rebalancing.
In total, the reported level of expense is down 20%, though the entire decline is driven by the combination of the System x gain and the fact that we no longer have the expense for the System x business in our run rate. Normalizing for the System x divestiture, our expense and other income would have been up about 2% or about 6% adjusted for currency and acquisitions. 
You'll recall last October, I told you that we expected a ticket charge for workforce rebalancing in the fourth quarter. SG&A includes a workforce rebalancing charge of about $580 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift resources and spending to areas where we see the most opportunity, including Watson, SoftLayer, Bluemix and in support of our Apple partnership.
Finally, I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dramatic dollar strengthening started in September and has continued at a rapid pace. In addition, the currencies have nearly all moved in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. The result is an impact to our revenue and our earnings. We hedge a portion of our cross-border cash flows, which defers the impact of the currency movement, but it doesn't eliminate it. Our hedges are designed to provide stability around the receipt of cash, but there is no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period. And that's what we've been dealing with.
Looking at the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to our profit growth was nearly $300 million. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit in 2015. The chart in the back of our presentation sizes the revenue impact at current spot rates.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. Our Total Services backlog was $128 billion. When adjusted for currency and the customer care and System x divestitures, it was flat year-to-year. This is an improvement from the 2% decline we reported in the third quarter on that same basis. The sequential backlog improvement was driven by several significant new outsourcing contracts closed in the period. As a result, outsourcing backlog returned to growth and was up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the customer care divestiture. The combined Services revenue was $13.5 billion, which is flat year-to-year at constant currency adjusting for the divestitures. 
Revenue for Global Technology Services was $9.2 billion, up 2% at constant currency adjusted for the divestitures. GTS outsourcing was up 1% at constant currency for the quarter and for the year, adjusted for the customer care divestiture. Clients are continuing to sign large outsourcing engagements that leverage our cloud, business analytics and mobile solutions. Clients are using these outsourcing engagements as ways to optimize their IT infrastructure, while at the same time, enabling new services to their customers. Lufthansa and ABN AMRO, both of which were over $1 billion in contract value, are great recent examples of this.
ITS revenue was up 4% at constant currency, driven largely by our high-value security, mobility and resiliency offerings. SoftLayer continues to attract new workloads to the platform. And in October, we announced IBM was selected by SAP to be their global cloud provider for their enterprise cloud solution. IBM's ability to integrate public and private workloads within our hybrid cloud was a critical differentiator for SAP. We've continued to expand our data center footprint, and in the fourth quarter, we opened cloud centers in Melbourne, Paris, Mexico City, Tokyo and Frankfurt.
Maintenance was up 1% when adjusted for currency and the impact from the System x divestiture. GTS pretax profit was down significantly in the quarter. Year-to-year performance was driven by several key factors: First, we have the loss of year-to-year profit resulting from the customer care and System x divestitures; second, we took a workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, which impacts profit; finally, we're continuing to invest in both offerings and operational capabilities. That includes targeted investments in mobility, security and cloud, which complement our client systems of record as well as operational improvements such as the savings yield from the rebalancing action we took earlier this year and more broadly deployed automation in the delivery centers.
Overall, the profit performance in GTS reflects the actions we've taken to transform the business this year. We've invested in our strategic imperatives to accelerate growth. We've continued to optimize our delivery platform through the workforce rebalancing and broader use of automation and we've divested businesses, impacting our year-to-year results. While those actions all have near-term impacts to profit, they better position us going forward and enable us to deliver more value to clients.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion, down 3% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 3% at constant currency. Revenue was down in our traditional back-office implementations, particularly in North America. We again had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address cloud, analytics, mobile and social. Through our Apple partnership, we released the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS solutions in the fourth quarter, with more to come by the end of this quarter, focused in health care, energy and utilities. We've seen strong customer interest, and this partnership is another example of how we're helping enterprise clients transform their business models and sources of value.
Application outsourcing was down 2% at constant currency, reflecting sequential year-to-year improvement, but we still see a challenging pricing environment.
GBS gross margin expanded roughly 1.5 points year-to-year, which is a good indicator of the value our offerings deliver. Pretax profit declined, including a 15-point impact from the workforce rebalancing charge, which we'll pay back in 2015. We continued to see a slowdown in back-office implementations in the traditional parts of the portfolio. We're investing in strategic partnerships, and those will pay off in 2015 as well.
To wrap up GBS. We have integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business, with GBS, to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients. Starting in the first quarter, our reporting will reflect this shift of GPS from our Global Technology Services segment to GBS.
Software revenue of $7.6 billion was down 3% at constant currency. After the third quarter, we said we didn't expect a change in trajectory in the fourth, and our fourth quarter performance was fairly similar to the third. Total Software growth reflects a headwind from operating systems, driven by the divestiture of System x and our Power results. It also reflects business model changes, which impacted our transaction revenue growth as our customers continue to use the flexibility we have provided in the deployment of software purchased through enterprise licensing agreements. The flexibility enables clients to optimize their capacity on our platform for the long term.
We had solid growth in many of our solution areas, including security, mobile and cloud. Our security software once again grew at a double-digit rate. In fact, this was the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Cyber security threats are one of the key issues that all our customers are facing. We have brought our analytics, Big Data, research IP, mobile and cloud capabilities to create security offerings to address this market opportunity. Our Software mobile offerings more than doubled in the quarter, as we leveraged our integrated MobileFirst portfolio. And our Software-as-a-Service offerings are up nearly 50%. 
Across Software, we continue to drive innovation and capture growth areas. We're integrating analytics and security capabilities that are needed to operate seamlessly in a hybrid environment. For example, we're introducing several new offerings that further enable our analytics portfolio in a cloud environment. And we've recently announced IBM Verse, a cloud-based e-mail and collaboration offering that integrates Watson capabilities.
This type of continued innovation in our offerings, together with expanding services on our Bluemix Platform-as-a-service, will allow our customers to move to a hybrid environment.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 12% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of our System x business. Last January, our Systems and Technology business had just reported a $1.7 billion year-to-year profit decline for 2013. And we said we'd stabilize the profit on a go-forward basis. I'm pleased to say that after a lot of work to reposition the business, we have stabilized the profit.
Looking at our fourth quarter results. System z revenue was down 23% at constant currency, reflecting the fact that we are in the 10th and final quarter of this product cycle. Our last 10-quarter cycle was z10. Comparing the current cycle to that of z10, program-to-date System z revenue and gross profit is right on top of that cycle. 
We continue to innovate on the platform, and last week, we announced z13, the new generation of the IBM mainframe. The z13 system culminates a $1 billion investment, 5 years of development, exploits the innovation of more than 500 new patents and represents a collaboration with more than 60 clients. The result of this innovation is a mainframe that is the world's fastest processor that can execute 2.5 billion transactions a day. With this generation of mainframe, we have dramatically enhanced the capabilities around analytics, mobile, security and cloud to address the needs our clients see in their businesses. These capabilities span from real-time insights to real-time fraud detection in a system that can consistently run at 100% utilization with 100% uptime.
IBM continues to innovate on the platform to address client needs and extends its leadership in high-end systems, the core franchise that has nearly doubled in installed capacity over the last 5 years.
Power revenue declined 11% at constant currency, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned Power, which is now a Systems business, as well as an open chip processor and an IP opportunity through the OpenPOWER Foundation. We saw double-digit growth in the low-end, driven by entry-level POWER8 base systems. And in the fourth quarter, we introduced our high-end POWER8 enterprise systems. OpenPOWER Foundation membership continues to expand, which started in 2014 with 5 members and now stands at over 80, 14 of which are in Greater China. Since the establishment of the consortium a year ago, several products have been introduced. For example, on the scale-out systems, TYAN launched the first OpenPOWER customer reference system. And on the high end, the U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded IBM a $350 million contract to create future supercomputers based on OpenPOWER technology. In addition, we've initiated a strategic partnership with Suzhou PowerCore, which intends to use power architecture to develop and market processors for servers in China.
Our Storage hardware revenue was down 5% at constant currency, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We again saw strong growth in our FlashSystems and Storwize portfolio. This growth was offset by the wind down of our legacy OEM business and continued weakness in high-end disk. Recently, IDC reported that IBM was the leader in all-flash systems shipped capacity during the first half of 2014, outpacing the #2 and #3 competitors combined.
Over the course of the year, we took significant actions to reposition our Systems and Technology business for higher value and reinforced our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage. We repositioned Power through creation of our POWER8 systems, which are built for cloud and Big Data, and made available the POWER8 architecture through the OpenPOWER Consortium to build an open ecosystem and an IP play. We are divesting our microelectronics manufacturing with future chip supply coming from an at-scale provider. And we committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology as we strengthen our semiconductor R&D and systems innovation.
We also divested System x, our low-end server business. And as I mentioned, just last week, we announced z13, the new generation of the mainframe. Our Systems and Technology segment grew profit in the fourth quarter and was profitable for the year. With our portfolio repositioned and introduction of the new mainframe, we should now see profit leverage.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $7.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures, and we generated $6.6 billion in free cash flow, which was up $4.4 billion quarter-to-quarter but down $1.8 billion year-to-year.
As I said earlier, we generated more than half of our annual cash flow in the fourth quarter, in line with our average over the last 5 years. For the full year, our cash from operations, excluding GF receivables, was $16.2 billion. We invested almost $4 billion in capital expenditures with consistent spend throughout the year. And within that, we shifted significant spend to strategic areas, such as SoftLayer and Watson. 
So our free cash flow was $12.4 billion, down $2.6 billion year-to-year. The bulk of that was driven by an increase in cash tax payments and working capital impacts associated with the System x divestiture. While not in free cash flow, we received proceeds of $2.4 billion from divestitures, including the System x and customer care businesses.
As for the uses of free cash flow for the year. We acquired 6 companies, we paid $4.3 billion in dividends and bought back almost 72 million shares, reducing our average share count by 8%. 
Let me comment on our share repurchase activity over time. Since the beginning of our share repurchase program in 1995, we have taken our share count from roughly 2.35 billion shares to fewer than 1 billion shares. That's a reduction of 58% program-to-date at an average purchase price of less than $100 per share. At the end of the year, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Our total assets reflect the year-to-year reduction associated with the semiconductor transaction, as well as a reduction in our pension assets. We had strong returns on our pension assets, above the long-term expected return assumption. The asset decline was driven by year-end remeasurement of the liability. I'll address that in a minute.
Total debt was $40.8 billion, of which $29.1 billion was in support of our Financing business. The Global Financing leverage at year-end was 7.2:1, consistent with last December. Our total debt was down almost $5 billion since September and up $1.1 billion in the last year. Our nonfinancing debt drove the quarter-to-quarter decline. At $11.7 billion, it was down $5.4 billion since September and down $0.5 billion year-to-year.
Let me put our current nonfinancing or our core debt level in perspective. In May of 2007, we reintroduced debt to our core capital structure, and in June of that year, we had $11.8 billion of core debt. So while our debt level has varied over time, it's at the same level as when we introduced debt to our structure.
Looking at debt-to-cap. We improved our ratio since September, though not as much as expected. We reduced debt levels and profit performance increased equity, both as we expected. However, our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted by a $7 billion reduction in equity since September due to currency and pension. $1 billion of the equity hit was due to currency translation and over $6 billion for pension remeasurement, driven by a reduction in the discount rates and taking into account the recently released U.S. mortality tables.
Our pension funding levels remain solid, despite the impacts from rates and mortality. The U.S. and worldwide tax qualified plans were 102% and 97%, respectively.
Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the longer term.
So now let me wrap up 2014, and I want to put our revenue and profit performance in the context of the framework we provided at our Investor Day back in May. The strategic imperatives are focused on the market shifts of data, cloud and engagement. The model for these combined strategic imperatives is to deliver double-digit growth with high contribution from Software, which obviously drives a more profitable business mix. 
In 2014, revenue from our cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security solutions together was up 16%. And that includes the impact of currency as well as the divested System x business. In total, the strategic imperatives generated $25 billion in revenue, which is about 27% of IBM's total. And our Software content is well above the level for overall IBM.
Business analytics revenue for the year was $17 billion, up 7% over last year. Growth was led by our Consulting business, as we help our clients extract value from their data. Our cloud revenue in 2014 was up 60% to $7 billion, as we see growing client demands for higher-value cloud solutions across public, private and hybrid. Revenue from our as-a-service offerings increased about 75% to $3 billion for the year, and we exited 2014 with an annual run rate for our as-a-service business of $3.5 billion. The $7 billion also includes revenue from our foundational offerings, where we provide software, hardware and services to clients to build private cloud.
Turning to engagement. Our Mobile business more than tripled. We had strong growth in MobileFirst, driven by an integrated portfolio of offerings and a great start to our partnership with Apple. Social was up 3% and Security was up 19%, so very good growth in these businesses, in line with the double-digit objective. These are also the areas where we are launching initiatives and targeting investment. Earlier, I mentioned investments to build out Bluemix, SoftLayer, Watson and the partnerships with Apple, Twitter, SAP and Tencent. These investments and actions support growth into the future.
Now our recurring core franchises includes our annuity businesses and highly recurring portions of our transactional business, such as mainframe revenue from our largest clients. Most have annuity characteristics, and in many cases, these support mission-critical processes for our clients. The model or signpost is for these combined businesses to have stable revenue with improving margin. This year, revenue was down about 3%, with a modest decline in margin. The decline was driven by mainframe cycle and by currency.
We also have high-value transactional businesses, which include project-based work in Services, transactional Software and Power and Storage, in areas other than our strategic imperatives. The objective here is to optimize our business model and maintain margins. We've been clear that some parts of our Hardware business have had secular challenges. I talked earlier about all the actions we've taken to reposition our Hardware business for high value. While revenue is down as we work through these transitions, our gross margin remains attractive at over 40%. And of course, we've divested businesses that don't fit our strategic profile: customer care, System x and microelectronics manufacturing. Together, these businesses were about $7 billion of revenue in 2013 but lost $500 million of profit. So the divestitures reduced our revenue but improved our profit profile, clearly in line with our shift to higher value.
Our strategic direction is clear and compelling, and we've made a lot of progress. We've been successful in shifting to the higher-value areas of enterprise IT. The strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives confirms that, as does the overall profitability of our business. We expect the industry to continue to shift, and I want to spend a minute on what we see over the longer term, not in terms of an absolute end point or multiyear objective, but rather in terms of a long-term growth trajectory.
We have $25 billion of revenue in our strategic imperatives, and we continue to expect to grow this revenue at a double-digit rate. Keep in mind these areas are as high value as other parts of our business, which continue to manage our clients' most critical business processes. As we get our cloud business to scale and drive ongoing productivity improvements across our business, we see opportunity to continue to expand margin. And we'll continue to allocate capital to investments and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So over the longer term, when we look at the opportunities we will continue to develop, we see the ability to generate low-single digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value mix, high-single digit operating earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization in the 90s. Of course, we'll spend more time on the rate and pace of achieving that trajectory at our investor meeting next month.
Now in the near term, there are a few dynamics that are inconsistent with that trajectory. For 2015 specifically, we are dealing with some transitions in our business. For example, while we are fully participating in the shift to cloud, margins are impacted by the level of investment we're making and the fact that the business is not yet at scale. We will see some year-to-year benefit to margins in 2015 as the business ramps, but we won't yet be at scale. And I talked about the impact to our Software transaction revenue growth as customers utilize the flexibility we've provided as they commit to our platform for the longer term.
And then there are cyclical considerations. Given the geographic breadth of our business, we have seen challenges in some markets, most notably, many of the growth markets. We firmly believe these are important markets over time, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. But we're not counting on a robust demand environment in many geographies in 2015.
And then, of course, there is the impact from currency. The impact to our revenue growth is obvious as we translate results back to U.S. dollars. But as with all companies with a similar business profile, with the dollar strengthening, currency will have a significant translation impact on our profit growth.
Now we do have some cyclical benefits, like a tailwind from the new mainframe cycle, and we'll have a full year of POWER8. Now when you step back and look at the business and take into account everything I've just told you about 2015, we'll continue to grow in a lot of areas. We'll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives, we'll continue to expand margins, and we'll continue a high level of investment and hiring, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunities.
Now in this currency environment and with the divestitures we've completed, our total revenue as reported will not grow in 2015. I expect less spending in workforce rebalancing. And while we always have gains, we won't replicate the $1.6 billion of gains we had in 2014. So that will be a net impact to our profit. When we put it all together for 2015, we expect operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we expect free cash flow to be relatively flat. More importantly, we will exit 2015 with a higher-value, higher-margin business.

A few things. So first on tax, we'll address that first because that's probably the easiest. We're assuming a tax rate at 20% in the full year, so a slight decline from where we finished 2014. Now on the guidance in terms of what we saw coming out of the fourth, I think there are a few things that I would mention relative to the trajectories in some of our businesses. We do expect that the launch of the mainframe, along with the success in POWER8 that we're seeing, that will generate some momentum. And so we would expect to see growth in our Systems in kind of a mid-single digit range of growth coming out of '14 when we didn't have the cycle. In Services, we've not built a revenue trajectory or assumed a revenue trajectory that requires a lot of growth within our EPS. And then the most important, I think, from a guidance perspective is Software. So we have, as you know, a range in our EPS. And I think the way to characterize the bottom of the guidance and the top of the guidance is that at the bottom of the guidance, we are not assuming that we see an improvement in the trajectory of our Software business. And I would characterize the top of the guidance as sort of a stabilization of the Software business relative to 2014.",235

Looks like you're guiding for it to be flat, which is under 80% of net income if I sort of work backwards from the midpoint of your range. Can you help us understand what the forces at work are that create the significant discrepancy between free cash flow and net income? And can you also help us understand how we should be thinking about relative free cash flow spending on acquisitions versus dividend and stock repurchases relative to history?",95
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,747321.0,32753253.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure, Tony. A couple of things. So our free cash flow guidance is essentially flat year-to-year, given the range of profit we provided. And a couple of things within that, and I'll try to address these sort of in the reverse order that you asked about it. Relative to share repurchase, we've only assumed about a 2 to 3 impact -- a 2- to 3-point impact from share repurchase, which is obviously less than what we were able to do in the last year, so a reduced level of share repurchase. I guess the way to think about it is we entered 2015 with a bit over $6 billion of authorization remaining, and we've just assumed that we used the authorization. Now there -- obviously, timing will impact, that's impact on EPS. But think about our share repurchase in the year as consuming the bulk of that authorization. In terms of dividends, we have assumed that we would obviously continue to pay the dividend, and we'd like to. And we'll talk about the dividend with the board. We'd like to talk about how we might grow the dividend as well. We typically do that, as you know, in April. So those discussions will start soon. From a realization perspective, we printed a 79% realization in 2014, and we see that improving to the mid-80s. Now there are a few elements of our free cash flow relative to realization that I think are important to keep in mind. We'll start at, call it, a 100% just for simplicity. We get a 5-, 6-point impact just because we have a pension in terms of realization. Now sometimes, that is not as steep as that and sometimes, it can be more depending on what the market is due to the pension. But right now, in 2014, we saw about a 5-point impact in realization. We also saw in 2014 a substantial impact in realization from our cash taxes. That was about a 10-point impact last year, so pretty substantial impacts in realization. We do see that, as I mentioned, improving to the mid-80s in 2015 based on our guidance. Now there are some unique items within our guidance as well for 2015 that I think it's important to realize. One, we assumed or we are assuming a further increase in our capital acquisitions -- our capital expenditures of over $0.5 billion year-to-year as we continue to build out our cloud platform, as we continue to invest in SoftLayer. We grew SoftLayer investment pretty aggressively in 2014, and we'll continue to do that into 2015. We also have a year-to-year impact in cash flow in our guidance to recognize the timing of the payments for the restructuring actions we've taken. And then finally, as we had in 2014, we also have in 2015, there is a year-to-year impact from the xSeries business being out of our results, but because of the structure of that, there is a working capital impact. So overall guidance that we've provided has a profit decline embedded within it. And again, those -- that, combined with the year-to-year impacts we see in terms of CapEx restructuring and xSeries being out, delivers that essentially flat year-to-year free cash flow.",538

Even at the low end, you're only down about 5% in EPS from what you did in '14. And given how currencies moved against you and so forth, do you feel you're being conservative enough, particularly given that doesn't sound like the share count's going to come down too aggressively. And maybe you'd talk about what you're assuming for restructuring since restructuring is part of your reported EPS.",76

Sure, Steve. So first thing I'd say, the guidance is only about 1 hour and 15 minutes old, so I'm not going to recharacterize what we've already provided. Now having said that, and we talked -- and I talked a little bit about in response to Katy's question, the low and the high end of the range. I think, the primary difference is the Software trajectory that you assume. One assumes no change in trajectory at the low end; and one assumes in Software a stabilization if you will. And as you said, we're not going to get the same year-to-year improvement from our share repurchase program that we got last year. But at the same time, we've taken a lot of action to position our business coming out of 2014 that we feel very, very good about. So that $25 billion of strategic imperatives revenue growing at 16% a year is a very powerful part of the portfolio now and, in fact, those deliver gross profit margins that are better than the IBM total, on average, I should say, because they have a higher Software mix in them. So we are not going to get the same level of EPS out of share repurchase. I've shared, again, the dynamics on Software. And then the other part that you asked about was restructuring. We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year. It'll be a lower amount. Now we will continue to remix our skills. It's part of our business. As you said, we include it in the way we report, so it's part of our business, but we will not spend at the same rate. And we will get, obviously, some of the rollover benefits from what we've done this year. So parts of our business continue to do very well and the elements of the business that don't have that same level of growth remain very high margin, very profitable, very high value for us. Now I should remind you that currency has a big impact for us. We've included in the backup charts the impact to revenue. It's about 5 to 6 points based on spot. That's just the revenue impact. As we saw in the fourth quarter, it was nearly a $300 million impact to us in the fourth. And at $300 million on our base, that is really the difference between growing pretax income and not growing pretax income in the fourth quarter for us. So it will be a big impact and, despite that, we will grow margins next year or this year as well. So a few, I guess, I'd say puts and takes on this. But again, I'm not going to recharacterize the guidance, which is now 1 hour and 18 minutes old.",469

Of the elements you mentioned that sustain the gap between cash flow and earnings for this year, which specifically are likely to be less of a fact for beyond 2015? And I guess, what specifically should allow you to get to that 90% conversion goal over time?",67

A couple of things. So again, if I worked down from the 100, we do see an increased allocation of capital to the investments we're making. As I mentioned, we've included in our '15 guidance about -- more than $0.5 billion of increase. Now we don't see that rate and pace continuing forever. So yes, we see increased capital expenditure requirements over time as we continue to invest in things like our cloud but not at the same rate and pace. So that will slow a bit. At the same time, as we see markets perform or differently, we don't assume that the pension impact, it will not be a year-to-year impact, I should say, continuing into the future. So slower CapEx spending growth, reduced impact from the pension on a year-to-year base. And then we do see, as we go through this transition, as we talked about in our longer-term trajectory, we see profit growth in the high-single digits. And that profit growth has been the primary driver of our free cash flow growth over the years. We talked a bit about this in Investor Day. The primary driver over the past 10 years of our free cash flow has been profit growth. And as we get back to that profit growth, we see most of that converting back into free cash flow as well.",227

A couple of things, Ben. One, the way we approach acquisitions, which has worked very, very well for us, is a way to complement the organically developed innovations we can create and then to build around what we view as the future of enterprise IT. So over the last few years, with that as sort of an approach, we've been pretty aggressive in acquiring analytics companies. We've been pretty aggressive in acquiring -- we bought SoftLayer. We've been building out our cloud platform. We've been aggressive in acquiring new ways for clients to engage with their customers. So our acquisition model, again, has been built around our view of the future of enterprise IT and how we supplement the technologies and the innovations we're bringing to market. I think that model works really, really well. Now I do think that we see 2 differences as we move into the future on our acquisition policy or our acquisition approach. One is more of our acquisitions will probably be on an as-a-service basis as opposed to, say, an on-premise model. And that's kind of the nature of the market, and that's also where we have a lot of opportunity because we don't really play in some of those areas today. So we have over 100 as-a-service offerings. Our as-a-service business, in total, finished at $3.5 billion on an exit run rate, but we still see a lot of opportunity to expand, if you will, in that as-a-service space. So one is more as-a-service acquisition content. And then secondly, we've been more active and been very successful in partnering with leading companies in order to help transform industries and in order to help transform professions. And I think there is a great example in Apple and what we're working on with them and there's a great example in Twitter. And so those partnership models obviously require investment, and we invest in them heavily. But we don't have to own all the technology in order to bring it to our clients. And one of the things our clients tell us over and over again is that they look to us to help bring some of these things together so they can use it in the most effective enterprise-class way. So you'll see also more partnerships, if you will, as opposed to acquisitions. But from an acquisition standpoint, more as-a-service I would think as opposed to on-prem.",403

So cloud, for us, a $7 billion business. I think that kind of puts us at the forefront of cloud -- in the cloud industry, in the cloud space, if you will. So $7 billion, growing 60%. We are delighted with the investments we've made, and we see a very powerful opportunity in the cloud. That cloud business, for us, is made up not only of the as-a-service business which, as I mentioned, was a $3.5 billion run rate at the end of the year, it also has our foundational offerings in it where clients are building private clouds and deploying hybrid environments. And we've been talking about hybrid for many years now. We think that the hybrid environment is the way that we see most enterprises getting the benefit of the agility of the cloud linked in with their systems of record. So our foundational offerings are deploying private clouds and hybrid clouds, and we see that trend continuing as well. So $7 billion, we see continued strong double-digit growth in that for us. Cloud, for us, remains a terrific opportunity for all aspects of our business. When we sign, as an example, these large services deals that you've seen, for instance, coming out of Europe, a big element of those outsourcing transactions is also to embed and include a cloud environment for those clients as well. So cloud is sort of permeating a lot of the elements that we're bringing to market. And that's part of why we brought all of that together into a cloud organization just in January this year. It's something we mentioned we would do back in October. And we announced the cloud unit in January, which will bring all that together for our clients. So a very powerful opportunity, a very substantial business opportunity for us now at $7 billion last year, and we see continued strong growth.",316

Japan, again, had a very good quarter, a very consistent growth now. And boy, we are delighted with the progress the Japan team has made and the way they are bringing innovation to their clients. So I think it's a terrific story for us. When we look at the other growth markets, the other highlight I'd point out is China, as I said on the prepared remarks, down 1% in the quarter at constant currency. Now that's without the divestiture of the System x business. But we had seen some pretty dramatic declines in that business prior to that. So with our top banking customers deploying substantial new mainframe capacity in the quarter, we're pleased to see that, that business is starting to stabilize. Again, x currency, x divestitures, we're pleased to see that business is stabilizing. And quite frankly, China has been a substantial business for us. And it was again in the fourth, and it continues to be, we -- will continue to be a very important part of our business. In the other geographies, and Latin America I think is probably worth talking a little bit about because in Latin America, what we had in the fourth quarter was an impact from our transactional business as it wrapped on some -- a very strong prior year. So our more annuity-like businesses in Brazil and LA, in Brazil in particular, in LA, we're fairly stable with good growth. And our transactional businesses, which had been growing in the first 9 months of the year, hit a tough compare, and so were down. So LA finishes the year with growth, very good growth at about 8% but down in the fourth quarter. And then in Asia Pacific, we did not see a dramatic change in trajectory here going into the fourth. In the third, the fourth and even the full year, kind of 6% to 7% declines in Asia Pacific and fairly, fairly consistent even when we look across some of the constituents in that geography. Australia did not get any better. ASEAN did not get any better, so we are seeing some -- a challenging growth environment in Asia Pacific. The one driver, I would say, that's going to permeate across all these organizations though is the shift to the cloud, the shift to Big Data and analytics and the shift to new systems of engagement is a key source of growth within all these geographies. And we see that fairly consistently in our business. That phenomena is consistent across the geographies.",430

First, I'll talk about the margin profile. So what we see across all of our strategic imperatives, what we see on that $25 billion base is a gross profit margin that is greater than the IBM average. So we're actually seeing very good margin performance in gross margin on that strategic imperative content and, again, growing very rapidly. Now we are investing heavily, so net margins are not -- they don't have that same dynamic. They are not yet greater. But we will see, in our as-a-service business now, as we talked a bit about on the call, we will see an improvement in scale. We're not yet at scale, but we will see an improvement in scale as that business, from $3.5 billion on an exit run rate, continues to grow. So we see good margin opportunity in our strategic imperatives as we deliver high value. And then in terms of revenue targets for strategic imperatives over the long run, I wouldn't pick a number or a percentage per se. What I would say is that at $25 billion growing solid double-digit, just on a trajectory basis, the math would say you continue to make pretty good progress, i.e. it continues to represent a bigger and bigger percentage of your revenue. But bear in mind that the recurring core franchise business to us, which is fairly stable, and we expect it to continue to be fairly stable, remains very high margin as well. It's very high value. So those strategic imperatives will continue to grow, very good performance over the long run. They will represent a larger percentage of our business, obviously, just the sheer math would suggest that. But those other recurring core franchises are delivering very high value to our clients as well.",297

Full year growth in our Software business was clearly -- our Software segment was clearly impacted by the operating system content, so that was about 1.5 points of impact over the years. So total Software group, as you saw, at constant currency, was down about 1%. That includes -- just under 1%. That includes the impact of the operating system content. So the difference between the total segment is really the total middleware. Our total middleware business did grow, grew about 1%, excluding the currency. Now as we've said, there's a Software-as-a-Service business in there that's doing very well, growing 50%. We have elements of our middleware that are doing quite well. And in the prepared remarks, we talked about the flexibility we provided within that growth rate. So what we saw -- and we saw that in the fourth quarter as well. The elements of that, the flexibility that we provided to our larger customers, as they deploy, as I mentioned earlier, things like hybrid cloud environments and private cloud environments, their commitment to the platform over the long term comes with our giving them some flexibility on how they deploy. So it's an impact to the growth. As I mentioned, total middleware was up a bit in 2014 on a full year basis. And then within that content, if you look at the more transactional elements of our business, we still signed 350 or so ELAs in the fourth quarter. So the ELA structure still continues to be highly valued by clients. They really are just looking for the flexibility in how they deploy. The other way to look at it or another way that we think about it, those large clients use flexibility to deploy. Outside of those large clients, we actually saw growth in our middleware business, very good growth in our middleware business. So part of why we set the guidance the way we did was really reflective of the question that you asked. And I guess the way I'd answer it is for our guidance, we're not relying on an improvement in trajectory in -- at the low end of guidance. And we are -- we would need a stabilization, if you will, in order to see the high end of guidance. But the phenomena here is middleware is growing. Total middleware is growing at different deployment rates in our larger customers than the growth we're seeing in the rest of our customers.",462

It looks like 2015 will be another year of EPS decline as you shift revenues towards the strategic imperatives. I'm curious, when do you think the business model gets an optimal level where you see that target you outlined of low-single digit sales, high-single digit EPS growth? Is 2016 the year where you get there? Or do you see that happening at a later point?",77
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3896.0,747321.0,32753280.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,36,"Well, Amit, we're going to talk more about the longer term at Investor Day in February. So I'm going to limit my guidance today to talk about 2015 and what we just provided. And I think we've characterized it pretty well for what we're expecting or what is implied, if you will, in that guidance. But we look at 2014 and we look at how much we got done in positioning our business for the longer term, again, $25 billion business growing at 16%, including the impacts of currency. We look at the investments we made in our cloud business, including building out our SoftLayer platform across 15 countries now, including things that -- and by the way, we'll see the impact of that and the uptake of that capacity going forward. We look at the relationships we're building and now executing on with, again, partners like Apple and Twitter. And that's not yet in the 2014 obviously, because we just did them. That has a lot of good growth coming up. We look at the Analytics business, a substantial business, $17 billion last year with reasonable growth. And importantly, we're really pleased with the progress we're making in commercializing Watson. I would not characterize the $17 billion as reflective of a substantial revenue impact, if you will, from Watson. Certainly, a big investment for us, but it's absolutely the right investment. And we'd see all that growth still coming to us. And then we look at other elements of our portfolio like mobile tripling and security upsell at double digits. So from a growth and investment standpoint, boy, we feel terrific about what we got done in 2014. And then we also undertook a lot of difficult decisions to position our business over the long term for other elements. So we stabilized our STG business in terms of its profitability. We completed the divestiture of our lower-value xSeries business, as well as the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing, which is not going to be a payoff in 2015 or 2016. There's a payoff down the road for that, but it is the right thing to do for us to remain the leaders in high-performance computing. So I think 2014, we got a lot done. We feel very good about the progress we've made in building out those strategic imperatives to a $25 billion business. We feel very good about the overall high-value strategy. We did deliver $21 billion across the corporation of pretax income. And so we feel great about how we're exiting 2014. And then when we exit 2015, we'll have, again, a higher-margin business than we did in 2014. 
So let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as I just covered kind of with Amit, we did get a lot done in 2014 and we've got a lot of proof points, as I just went through. 
For 2015, as we indicated, we see EPS, operating EPS, in a range of $15.75 to $16.50. And within that, we'd see mid-single digit EPS growth in the first quarter. Now keep in mind, we had a large charge last year, so that growth in 1Q is off a low base because it had the charge in it. But again, as I finish with Amit, we will exit 2015 with a higher-value and a higher-margin business. So thank you for joining the call and we look forward to seeing you at Investor Day.",578

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3619.0,791518.0,34484883.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered $19.6 billion of revenue, $2.9 billion of operating net income and operating EPS of $2.91. That's up 9% from last year. It's quite a good start to the year and, obviously, better than the mid-single-digit growth we discussed 90 days ago. 
Our revenue was flat year-to-year, excluding the impact of currency and the divested businesses. There's been a lot of focus on the implication of a stronger dollar, especially to companies like IBM where, as you know, 2/3 of our revenue are outside the U.S. So let me address this right upfront. 
In the first quarter, we had an 8-point impact from currency translation. This impact is even greater than 90 days ago and also from the update we provided at the end of February. As always, we put a chart in the backup that shows the impact of currency translation to revenue for the first quarter and the full year. And as we shift our portfolio to higher value and divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, this also results in an impact to our reported revenue growth. In the first quarter, it was over 4 points. So together, the impact of currency and the divested businesses reduced the reported revenue growth by 12 points. 
And now for the balance of the presentation, I'll focus on our revenue performance at constant currency and excluding the impact of the divested businesses. This is the way we look at our business. And again, a net view of our business, our revenue was flat year-to-year. 
At our investor briefing at the end of February, we spent a lot of time on how we're transforming our business to where we see long-term value in enterprise IT. We have a core portfolio that's high value to our clients and high value to us. Quite frankly, it's essential. While the market for these capabilities isn't necessarily growing, we continue to reinvent and innovate to deliver that value. 
We've also been investing in our strategic imperatives, our solutions that address the opportunities in data, cloud, social, mobile and security. These are high-value solutions, and we're able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because our offerings are highly differentiated and because our core businesses provide the industry perspective and deep insight into how our clients operate. 
In February, we showed you the revenue across our strategic imperatives has been up 19% to 20% in each of the last 5 years. And now in the first quarter, revenue in our strategic imperatives grew more than 30%, so a good start toward another strong double-digit year. Analytics was up more than 20%, social more than 40% and mobile more than 4x. 
Our cloud revenue was up over 75% year-to-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cloud revenue was $7.7 billion. This is a demonstration of high growth in the higher-value cloud opportunities across public, private and hybrid. We had a terrific performance in our cloud foundational and as-a-service offerings, and we exited the quarter with an annual as-a-service run rate of $3.8 billion. That's up $1.5 billion in the last year. The bulk of that growth was organic, the result of our deep insights into how our clients run their business. We've applied that insight to develop a strong point of view on cloud, that the value on cloud is hybrid. 
In February, we announced a program to make hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise, extending our clients' control, visibility, security and governance in a hybrid cloud environment, similar to what they have in their private cloud and existing IT systems. And to deal with the data sprawl, we're providing increased data portability across environments. 
Now while we're investing and driving growth in our strategic imperatives, we're continuing to reinvent and bring innovation to our core portfolio. For example, in our Hardware business, we've continued to invest and innovate. That's how we've been able to introduce the z13 mainframe that is built for the mobile economy and roll out POWER8, optimized for data and cloud. We've also made some visible divestitures, and we're now starting to see the results of those actions. 
In March, we shipped the first z13 system, and our mainframe revenue more than doubled on MIPS shipments that were up 95%. POWER returned to growth, leveraging strong performance in our scale-out systems. All of this is driving our shift to higher value, resulting in a higher margin and supporting targeted investments. In fact, in 2015, we're shifting billions of dollars of spending to data, cloud and engagement to extend our differentiation in the market. And in the last few weeks, we've announced 2 initiatives, Internet of Things and Watson Health, That would further strengthen our position as a high-value innovation company, providing solutions at the intersection of business and IT. 
So to sum it up, our results this quarter at the IBM level and the segment level reflect the transformation in our business. We had continued momentum in our strategic imperatives and strong growth in Hardware, resulting from the innovation we continue to deliver. The declines in the core portfolio were consistent with the second half of last year, and our shift to higher value drove margin expansion, and we're continuing to shift investments and rebalance resources to address the best long-term opportunities in the market. 
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter. Our revenue was flat year-to-year, a 2-point improvement from our year-to-year performance in the third and the fourth quarters. At the risk of oversimplifying this quarter's revenue dynamics, our strategic imperatives were up over 30%, which is 10 points faster than last year. And bear in mind, we have a pretty substantial business in cloud and analytics alone, so it's on a big base. And our core businesses had a similar trajectory to what we delivered in the second half of last year. So our substantial strategic imperatives, growing 10 points faster, drove 2 points of sequential improvement. 
Looking at our margins. We had an 80-basis-point improvement in gross margin, driven by both portfolio actions and strong growth in System z. To put that 80 basis points into historical context, gross margin of 49.3% is up about 1,400 basis points in the last 15 years. And you'd get that same trend from a margin perspective, whether you go back 3, 5 or 10 years. In terms of gross profit dollars, we generated $9.5 billion in the quarter, and that's up $2.7 billion from 15 years ago. So this is clearly the result of our long-term, relentless shift to higher value. 
Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift as well, but they also reflect a smaller charge for workforce rebalancing this year. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $2.91, up 9%. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up from last year. And as you know, there's a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. We returned $1.2 billion through share repurchase and nearly the same amount in dividends, and we ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash on hand, up from year-end. 
Now turning to the revenue by geography. We had sequential improvement in our year-to-year performance in both the major markets and the growth markets, led by the U.S., Japan and Latin America. Revenue in the major markets was flat year-to-year. We grew in the U.S. with strong growth across our Hardware portfolio and some large Software deals, so we had a good transactional performance in the U.S. Japan growth accelerated on the strength of Services and Hardware. We continued to see mixed performance in Europe, with growth in the U.K. and declines in Germany and France. 
From a brand perspective, we had good growth in mainframe and POWER and continued momentum in outsourcing signings, as clients looked to integrate cloud and mobile capabilities into larger-scale IT environments. Overall, while our performance in Europe decelerated, it was in line with the market. 
In the growth markets, Latin America returned to double-digit growth, with broad-based growth in the region, and we had growth in the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific growth markets again declined, but we had sequential improvement in some key countries. In our year-to-year performance in the BRIC countries improved sequentially, though the total BRIC number is not reflective of the individual country's performance. We had growth in Brazil and India and declines in Russia and China. In China, we again had very strong growth in mainframe, but our Services revenue declined as we shift our focus away from some of the lower-margin offerings. Bear in mind, we do have a profitable business in China. 
Turning to the segment perspective. Our total revenue was flat, and gross margin improved 80 basis points. As always, I'll go into the revenue drivers in the segment discussions, but I want to spend a minute on margin dynamics. When you look at the drivers of margin improvement we've talked about in the past, a shift to higher value has been a big contributor. This quarter, we saw the shift coming from portfolio actions and strong System z performance. Over long periods of time, investment levels can improve margins. But given the market shifts and transformation we're driving, investments are currently reducing margins. Similarly, currency is typically neutral over an extended period, though our margin this quarter had a translational impact of the stronger dollar. With all of that, we drove margin improvement of 80 basis points. 
The reported operating expense and other income is down 17%. The reported decline is driven by currency, a lower level of workforce rebalancing and the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. I'll comment on each. 
8 points of decline was driven by currency between the translation of nondollar spending and hedging gains that are reported in expense. 2 points of the declined are due to the divestiture of System x, and we're continuing to rebalance our workforce. In this quarter, we took a charge of $280 million, but that's down $580 million year-to-year so, with the lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, drove another 7 points of decline. As we continue the transformation of our business, I'd expect a similar level of workforce rebalancing next quarter, which will impact our year-to-year profit performance. I should also mention that last year, we had nearly $100 million gain from the sale of our customer care business and other income, which, obviously, wasn't replicated this year. 
Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift resources and spending to areas where we see the most opportunity. In February, we talked about shifting $4 billion in spending in 2015. That's across expense, cost and capital. And in the first quarter, we've been executing to that plan. We have increased expense in areas like SoftLayer, Watson and Bluemix, just to name a few, and we'll see the benefits over the longer term. 
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services.
Combined Services revenue was $12.2 billion, which is down 2% year-to-year. This quarter, we closed 15 deals greater than $100 million, with about half of that for new clients or new scope with existing clients. This reflects the strength of our offerings and our clients' confidence in our ability to manage the most critical assets in their business. We ended the quarter with total Services backlog of $121 billion, which was flat at constant currency and adjusting for the divestiture. 
Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue. GTS outsourcing reflects the mix and timing of contracts from the backlog. As expected, many of the larger contracts signed last year did not contribute to revenue in the first quarter. We're continuing to see clients sign large infrastructure outsourcing deals, with embedded cloud and mobile initiatives creating large-scale hybrid IT environments. IBM is the trusted partner for these core business transformations because of our global capabilities and portfolio breadth and, in fact, the Forrester Research Wave evaluation cited IBM as, far and away, the leading supplier in the global infrastructure outsourcing segment. 
Within ITS, we had good growth in cloud, security and business resiliency, but overall performance was impacted by a shift away from lower-value services, such as data center buildouts and OEM hardware deployments. SoftLayer grew solid double digits this quarter, improving sequentially and building on the expanded data center capacity. We continued our steady progress with the opening of a few new footprints in Montréal, Sydney and Amsterdam. 
Clients, like Shop Direct, are choosing SoftLayer as a platform to integrate cloud initiatives with their core systems into unified hybrid IT model. This architecture provides them with on-demand burst capability as well as the ability to plan for and deliver consumer apparel and home goods based on real-time demand. This kind of value is only unlocked when the emerging technologies like cloud and analytics are integrated with the large sets of customer data enterprises already have. 
Maintenance was up 2%, with the growth driven by our multi-vendor support services, which is our third-party hardware maintenance offering. The continued growth of maintenance is another demonstration of the strength of our global reach and capabilities. As organizations expand, they want a partner who has scale and can provide global parts and support capabilities. 
GTS pretax margin was driven by a few elements. Currency was the biggest impact to profit year-to-year, and our maintenance profit was down due to the System x divestiture. Profit margin performance also reflects the continued investments in the business to expand our operational capabilities. The SoftLayer data center expansion I just mentioned is one example. This gives us a highly differentiated offering in hybrid cloud, especially as it relates to data residency requirements. 
We're also increasing our sales hiring in our mobile and security practices and making investments in our resiliency business, and we're accelerating our transition to a more significant global delivery model, which requires hiring and training costs ahead of the expected savings. Finally, we had a year-to-year benefit from a smaller workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, but we haven't yet realized the bulk of savings from our recent actions. 
Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion. We've had solid performance in many markets and solution areas. In Japan, we've been consistently growing revenue and expanding margins, with solid growth in consulting and application outsourcing. And in Europe this quarter, we've returned to revenue growth. Across all our geographies, we continue to drive strong growth in the offerings that address our strategic imperatives. Our cloud solutions more than tripled year-to-year. Analytics grew double digits, and we have very good growth in mobile and social. We are helping clients create new business models and opportunities for client engagement. The challenge for Global Business Services is North America. While we have solid growth in our strategic imperatives, we're dealing with the slowdown in some of the more traditional areas. Because the U.S. is our largest geography, its performance has a significant impact on the overall segment. But again, the U.S. has some very positive elements in GBS. Let me give you an example of the kind of work we're doing to help clients create opportunities for client engagement. 
In February, we announced a strategic partnership with AMB Sports & Entertainment to transform the fan experience at the new Atlanta Stadium. When complete, when you go to the stadium, you'll be able to see in real-time which parking lots are available and which are filled, where the shortest concession lines are during the game and have access to statistics and information from the bleachers, all because we can combine GTS outsourcing and technology capabilities with our GBS process and application expertise to provide a complete solution, creating new markets that didn't exist even a few years ago. 
Before wrapping up revenue, let me just remind you that we've integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business, into GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients and to better leverage our industry knowledge. 
Looking at GBS profit. The pretax margin had a mix of drivers. We got some year-to-year benefit from the lower workforce rebalancing charge and some savings yield from last year's action. We were impacted by the customer care divestiture, both by the loss of operational profit and by not having a gain in this year's results. The balance of the margin decline was driven by our cost structure and those geographies where we're not growing revenue. We're making investments and taking actions to make our cost structure more competitive, including rebalancing to more global delivery, use of alternate labor models and shifting resources toward higher-value strategic imperative offerings. 
Our Software revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. Key branded middleware grew 1%, driven by growth in our software-as-a-service offerings, which were up nearly 50%. Total Software growth reflects a 1-point headwind from operating systems. 
We had growth across many solution areas. Our analytics software was up, and our mobile software grew at a strong double-digit rate, led by our MobileFirst offerings. We had solid growth in our commerce solutions, where a large proportion of the business is software as a service, and our social solutions grew double digits, driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings. 
Across Software, we continue to drive innovation and capture growth areas, importantly building our Software into broader solution capabilities. Just this month, we made 2 major announcements: IoT and Watson Health. These are continuation of what we started last year with Watson, then earlier this year with analytics, commerce and security. There are some common threads throughout. They're all based on a unique point of view around cloud and the value of hybrid. They all use analytics to leverage data, and they all have an industry dimension. 
Let me comment briefly on the 2 announcements. At the end of March, we announced the creation of an Internet of Things unit, committing $3 billion of spend over the next 4 years. As part of this, we're establishing a cloud-based open platform to help clients and partners build and deliver vertical industry IoT solutions. We've also created an IoT zone within Bluemix, our platform as a service, and we're expanding an IoT ecosystem to leverage a growing developer and entrepreneur community. This is similar to what we've done successfully around Watson where we not only have large partners like SoftBank in Japan, but we have hundreds of ecosystem partners you may not have heard of yet, like WayBlazer, Fluid, Red Ant, MD Buyline, Elance, Sellpoints, SparkCognition and LifeLearn, all of whom are building commercial applications on Watson. 
And then last week, we announced Watson Health, which, we believe, will transform health care by bringing together the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson with a vast ecosystem of partners, practitioners and researchers. There are several aspects to the Watson Health announcement from the creation of a Watson Health cloud to partnerships with leading companies, to the acquisition of 2 companies that extend our health care analytics capabilities. These are the 2 most recent examples where we're partnering in new ways to drive innovation and build an ecosystem to transform industries. 
Turning to our Systems Hardware segment. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 30%, as we continue to deliver innovation across our high-end systems. This quarter, System z MIPS were up 95% year-to-year, resulting in revenue more than doubling. We started to ship our new z13 in the second week of March, and this was the fastest start in terms of the number of systems we've shipped in over a decade. We also booked the highest revenue growth in any quarter in more than a decade. The capabilities of the z13 mainframe around mobile, cloud and real-time insights and fraud detection are resonating well with our customers. 
Let me give you a real example of what we're talking about. If you are UPS, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, you have to manage nearly 5 billion deliveries a year, with highly seasonal changes in demand. Your customers expect their packages to arrive on time, and they expect to schedule, manage and track shipments anywhere, anytime and increasingly through their mobile devices. These mobile transactions can lead to dramatic increases in overall traffic, as customers complete transactions at will. This requires a system that could handle the growth and scale seamlessly when activity spikes, maintaining a secure system that's always available. That's why UPS chose to upgrade to the IBM z13 mainframe because it could meet the expanding demands of the mobile economy. 
Now moving on to POWER. Revenue returned to growth. We not only took share on the declining UNIX market, but we're also expanding beyond UNIX with Linux on POWER and our OpenPOWER IP opportunity. We're expanding our customer base in the entry-level Linux systems as well as with large cloud-based players. The likes of OVH, the largest Internet-hosting company in Europe; with Rackspace; and very recently, Zucchetti, a leading IT provider in Italy, have all selected POWER-based Linux systems to deliver their cloud offerings. 
In addition, just over a year ago, we launched the OpenPOWER Foundation to open up the POWER technology and build an ecosystem to share intellectual property. The ecosystem partners include large established players, such as Google, NVIDIA, Mellanox, Samsung, Tyan and Inspur. But the consortium includes other smaller and emerging players, such as SK Hynix from Korea, Teamsun from China and Nallatech from Scotland, adding tremendous breadth and reach. Last month, the foundation unveiled more than 10 new hardware innovations that continue to make POWER technology relevant beyond the UNIX market. 
And in the first quarter, we closed our first substantial intellectual property deal, the confirmation of our strategy on POWER as an open-chip processor. This is an important step for the first OpenPOWER-based system for China. As an example, Zoom Netcom, a data communication and equipment supplier, will launch a system in the market later this year, which is based on the first derivative of the POWER chip unveiled by Suzhou PowerCore. This clearly shows that our POWER strategy is working, and we see momentum in the business. 
Our Storage Hardware revenue was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement. We, again, saw strong growth in our FlashSystems. This growth was offset by the wind-down of our OEM business and continued price weakness in high-end disk. We see value in the storage market shifting to software. In the first quarter, we unveiled IBM Spectrum Storage, new storage software in support of hybrid cloud environments. The portfolio provides greater access to data, accelerate speed to insights and improves data economics. 
Our Systems Hardware segment growth is a clear result of the actions we've taken to position our Systems business for the future. With good adoption, z13 and POWER systems and launch of the remaining P8-based systems later this quarter, we continue to see good growth in this business. 
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We spent just under $1 billion in CapEx, which is flat year-to-year, but includes a shift in spend as we build out our SoftLayer cloud centers. And so we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year-to-year. The primary driver was lower tax payments. This was partially offset by the working capital impact associated with the sale of our System x business and higher payments for performance-based comp, which was accrued last year. I mentioned earlier that our free cash flow generation is skewed to the back end of the year, and we continue to expect to deliver on our full year objectives. 
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter. We returned over $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion to buy back almost 8 million shares. At the end of March, we had 985 million shares outstanding and $5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. With the flow-through from last year's share reduction, our first quarter spend and the remaining authorization, we can achieve the level of share reduction we've assumed in our model for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, which is up from December but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.8 billion, with over $26 billion in support of our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at 7:1. Our non-Financing debt was $12.6 billion, which is down $3 billion from a year ago. Our non-Financing debt-to-cap was essentially flat versus December and 4 points higher than last year. Remember, our equity was impacted in the latter half of last year by pension, currency and the semiconductor manufacturing divestiture. The changes in book equity and the resulting impact on our debt-to-cap ratio do not adequately reflect the financial flexibility we have to support our business over the long term. In fact, on the basis of a core debt-to-EBITDA metric, we are well positioned to support our long-term growth objectives. 
Finally, I want to mention that as a result of several court rulings in Spain, including one in March, we booked a $230 million pretax charge related to litigation involving IBM Spain retirement plans. The court ruling reverses a voluntary employee program to join a defined contribution plan that was offered more than 20 years ago. This nonoperating charge impacted GAAP earnings and pension liability in the first quarter. 
So now let me summarize the quarter and talk about our full year expectations. We've been very clear that we're transforming our business, and we continue to see signs that the transformation is working. In the first quarter, you see that the IBM level and in our segments, our revenue trajectory improved, driven by an acceleration in our strategic imperatives. We had strength in high-end systems as our new products address the most contemporary work loads of data, cloud and mobile. This strength, together with our overall shift to higher value, drove margin expansion for IBM. All together, our revenue was flat year-to-year, excluding currency and the impact of the divested businesses, and we had mid-single-digit operating net income growth and high single-digit EPS growth as reported. 
At the same time, we've made a number of bold moves that build on the momentum we started in 2014. These include our hybrid cloud announcement in February, the set of initiatives around Internet of Things in March and just 2 weeks ago, the launch of Watson Health. It was a very good start to the year. 
Looking forward, we'll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives while the transitions in some of our businesses continue. We'll continue to expand our margin as we shift to higher value, and we'll continue a high level of investment, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity. We're deploying capital through different models: organic R&D, capital expenditures and acquisitions. And we're building partnerships and ecosystems, not only with the big household names, but with hundreds of smaller firms. This leverages our mutual strengths and expands our reach, all at a high level of return and, of course, we'll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends. 
For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50, and at that level of profit, we continue to expect free cash flow to be flat for the year. With these dynamics and level of performance, we'll exit 2015 a higher-value business.

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3619.0,791518.0,34484886.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,5,"Martin, I was wondering if you could comment more broadly about progress in the transformation because if I kind of look at this very narrow-mindedly, Hardware grew enormously. And if I take out Hardware, the rest of the company grew at minus 2, which is what you've been doing the last couple of quarters. And you commented that your strategic imperatives had actually accelerated in growth. So if we take out Hardware and the strategic imperatives are actually growing faster than before, doesn't that suggest the core businesses outside of Hardware and the strategic initiatives are actually getting worse? And when we look at the gross margin profile of Services and Software, which are 90-plus percent of your business, they actually got notably worse year-over-year, even adjusting for the restructuring. So I'd like to just maybe push back a little bit on beyond what we saw in Hardware, which I think is probably cyclical. What is the progress in the transformation? And should we be thinking more like 30% growth rate in the strategic initiatives, and that's sustainable on what drives it? Or perhaps you can just help us think through that.",192

Sure, Toni. Thanks for the question. Boy, there's a lot in that question. So I will -- I'll try to address it at a high level. First, in terms of the strategic imperatives continuing 30%, we're not thinking that this is a 30% strategic imperative growth every quarter now for the rest of the year. As you know, and as we've talked about in Investor Day, they've been on a very steady 19%, 20% growth rate year-to-year. Now they're a pretty substantial part of our business now, and we view that 30% growth -- part of it's driven, obviously, by the mainframe and the POWER cycle. And we're thinking now, when we look at the rest of year, that we're kind of accounting on a continued 19% to 20% growth rate. So our guidance is not requiring 30% growth. In fact, we expect it to kind of return to what we've seen. Still very strong growth, still ahead of the marketplace and still contributing a fair bit of growth to IBM, but think of it as more of a 20% growth. Within the quarter, as we talked about the -- on the call -- on the prepared remarks, the -- outside the strategic imperatives, we've been talking about that business in kind of a high single-digit decline, similar to the market that it sits in. And we kind of saw that again in the first quarter. So the revenue dynamics in the first quarter were really reflective of that acceleration, not a change in the core underneath that. A couple of other points, I think, that you raised. One, progress in the transformation. I think the transformation that is underway in the marketplace and is underway in our investment levels, is under way in our focus continues at, not only a very rapid pace, but a pace necessary for us to continue to lead in enterprise IT. So by this time last year we had created the Watson unit, we had identified a pretty substantial SoftLayer expansion plan that we rolled out throughout the year. As a couple of examples, by this time this year, as you saw early in January, we reformulated some of our business units to more directly engage with clients the way they consume. So we have IBM Analytics. We have IBM Commerce. We have IBM Security as examples. And so we got that done. We -- you saw earlier, and I noted this in my prepared remarks, we created an Internet of Things group, which will build off of what we've done in Smarter Planet and Smarter Cities. We've gotten a -- just recently, we've created now the IBM Healthcare unit, which will build off a couple of acquisitions as well as partnerships with some leading names in that space. So the transformation continues at a very rapid pace. It continues at a pace, again, necessary for us to maintain our leadership in enterprise IT. But we're not building guidance around, again, that strategic imperative revenue continuing to grow at 30%. We are still thinking and kind of relying on that 20% growth rate that we've been able to deliver the last 5 years.",530

Seems like we're mostly done with the heavy workforce rebalancing. I heard a little about China mix shifting away from the lower-margin stuff and GTS being a little bit weak, but it seems like we could assume some maybe better performance starting in 2Q. Can you maybe expand on that, Martin?",70

Sure, Tien-tsin. Thanks. So a couple of things. One, we did see a deceleration in GTS in the first quarter, in Global Technology Services. But keep in mind that when we had these pretty substantial transactions and new relationships that we signed last year, those will only move into the run phase over the next few quarters, primarily in the second half. So we would expect those to contribute a bit more of something. In fact, they didn't contribute anything in the first quarter, but they'll start to contribute in the second half in Global Technology Services. Margins within Global Technology Services will continue to reflect both the currency environment we're in as well as the investments we're making in order to grow out our SoftLayer platform and to shift the business to these new higher areas. As you noted on our prepared remarks, we talked about shifting away from lower-margin offerings in some of our site and facilities business and redeploying that, and that will continue. So from a Global Technology Services perspective, with -- between the currency environment we're in and the shift we're making, the investments we're making, we're not relying on dramatic growth or margin improvement in GTS in our guidance. On GBS, we've got some very strong results -- continued strong results in Japan and in Europe, and we continue to shift that business as well into these new areas, where we're comfortable that the margin profile there will be consistent with our guidance also. So 2 different stories between GTS and GBS. Within our guidance, we're not relying on dramatic growth here, but we will see some improved performance coming out of the backlog because of the big deals we signed last year.",291

The compares get much easier in the back half of the year. And based on what you're seeing in the business today, let's assume no material shift in the economic backdrop, would your comps be enough to stabilize the Software segment on its own? Or is it possible that growth could remain negative, given all those different things you talked about in the back half of the year, even against the negative comps that you'll see versus last year through the back half of the year?",103

Thanks. So Software, as we talked about when we provided guidance initially back in January, we said we still feel this way. The difference in our low end of our guidance and our high end of our guidance really depends on the trajectory of Software. What we saw in the first quarter was a 1-point improvement in the trajectory, not back yet to growth, but a 1-point improvement in our trajectory. Now that's not all year. We haven't seen it yet all year but, again, the difference between high and low guidance is that trajectory improvement. Assuming we were at the same level, same trajectory we had last year, we said that's kind of the low end of our guidance. We do see an environment where that's kind of the trajectory performance that we can rely on, if you will. We continue to sign ELAs with clients. We signed 200 ELAs, again, in the first quarter. We continue to have an impact on -- in our growth from the operating system component of Software, but we also saw pretty good uptake in our as-a-service offerings, which are driving growth, up more than 50%. And at the same time, our clients, with their reduced visibility, continue to look for flexibility in our offerings for our -- for those who have deployed the most. So Software, again, represents, for us, the difference between the low end and the high end of our guidance. We saw that one quarter sequential improvement in the first, and we'll see how we go for the rest of the year.",265

You gave us revenue, but could you tell us cents per share? And I was curious on the free cash flow you gave us flat for the year. Could you talk a bit about the plus and minus factors that you got there, CapEx, cash taxes and so forth, and how those are going to play out?",70
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3619.0,791518.0,34484896.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Of course. And a -- and since currency and free cash flow are so related, we'll count that as a one-part question, Steve. So first on currency, we did talk -- as we mentioned in the call, currency was an impact of about 8 points on the revenue line, so a bit over $1.7 billion in terms of translating the first quarter revenue back to dollars. And we saw some significant movements, not only since January, but also even since we provided an update on the day of our Investor Day, so a pretty big impact on the revenue line. From a profit perspective, now this is somewhat of an imprecise calculation, right? We -- it is not knowable. It's an unknowable number. We can estimate it, but we think that profit growth was impacted year-to-year by somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 in the quarter. That's a pretty big impact. So obviously, that shows up in margin, and that first quarter impact then, given where the dollar is now, you could just -- if -- again, we're working to try to -- we will, obviously, have to manage our way through this. But if you just took that $0.15 to $0.20 impact at the high end, assuming the rates stay here, you could see an $0.80 year-to-year impact full year on earnings from this, again, without us having done anything. So obviously, it -- it's something we are thinking about and working on pretty hard. From -- in terms of free cash flow, we said relatively flat year-to-year and full year. The bridge items are not dissimilar or not going to surprise you. First, we do see cash taxes this year being better year-to-year than they were last year. So that's probably about $2 billion better year-to-year, so that will certainly help. Reducing that on a full year basis, though, will be increased CapEx investments, which we'll be making. We've talked about that already in January, and we mentioned, again, in Investor Day. We also have -- while we expect the lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, the timing of those, the cash impact of those is likely to lead to an increase this year relative to last year of about $0.5 billion. And then our performance-related cash payment this year for prior years -- prior-year accruals will probably up $700 million to $800 million as well. So outside of that, our cash performance will look a lot like our income performance, which is kind of what you would expect, I think.",422

And then I guess, just looking at the cycle overall, can you talk about whether there are any unique financial dynamics for this cycle that we should consider relative to the last 2 cycles? I guess, I'm particularly focused on the dynamics around pricing where it looks like you actually had an ASP tailwind relative to MIPS growth this quarter and also the pull-through for Software and Services on this new platform.",118

A few things on the mainframe. So first, we had a terrific first quarter in the mainframe, but I think it's important -- I think it's important to understand 2 elements of this. First, this is what we expected our mainframe performance to be. This was not a surprise to us, and so I don't think that you should take away from either our prepared remarks or even the questions that we think we did better than we would have. We think this was the mainframe performance we expected very clearly. I think that the elements of the mainframe, though, that are most widely misunderstood by many who follow us are twofold: one, and this has to do with the timing of what you're seeing in the quarter. One, I don't think that the mainframe is fully appreciated for the essential nature of the work it does, for the impact that our clients feel from an upgraded mainframe and for the kinds of enterprise-class, scalable workloads that it drives. So we used the example of UPS in the call, 5 billion packages they have to deliver on time. And again, they can't be down. So one, I think there's an under-appreciation for the mainframe and its value to our clients. Two, I think there is a huge difference, obviously, between how consumer technology works and how enterprise technology works. And so when you read that we were shipping the mainframe since March, remember, we've been having the discussions with about 60 of our clients for months and months and months because they help us build and design this for their needs in those enterprise spaces. But the January announcement is when we start building the value propositions for our clients, and so the work for the sales teams begin in January. The fact that it was only shipped in March, really, only means that our supply chain, our fulfillment teams did a phenomenal job in a relatively short period of time to get -- to fill the demand that we saw within the quarter. But from an enterprise buying cycle, I think you really do have to understand that these are built with our clients. These are -- we discussed the value prop with our clients before that March date. That's not as critical a date as you might think if -- again, if you're thinking about it from a consumer side. From a first quarter perspective, as I mentioned, we are very pleased with how we did, but it didn't surprise us. And as we've talked about in the past, the second quarter tends to be the largest quarter for mainframe, and we still see that in this quarter as well. So we have very good quarter in the first. We would expect that the mainframe will be the larger in the second than it was in the first. But keep in mind, now you'll get into compare issues, right? So from a dollar perspective, it'll be larger, but we also had a great mainframe quarter second quarter last year. So the growth year-to-year will look a lot different than the first quarter, but the absolute number in the second will be higher. We would expect that in the first half, we'll probably finish at solid 50% growth in the mainframe between the first 2 quarters, which is very typical, very traditional in terms of the mainframe. From a margin perspective, as you noted, with MIPS only going up 95%, I say only with a smirk, with MIPS going up 95% and revenue up 130% on a constant-currency basis, yes, there is obviously a lot of value that our clients see here and a lot of value for the IBM Corporation. So we are delighted with how well the mainframe did, but it wasn't a surprise to us. It's a powerful, powerful platform for the world's business.",650

One, we have not seen a dramatic shift in trajectory across a lot of our sectors. Financial services sector is, obviously, one where the mainframe plays a pretty vital role in how the world's banks run. And when you get a new mainframe, particularly one that's so relevant to them shifting their businesses into mobile, particularly one where counter-fraud is such an important part of what they have to think about every day and you -- again, you need scalability, you need reliability, you have to run all the time. That has a particular -- that new mainframe has a particularly -- a particular emphasis within financial services sector and, therefore, we did see an improvement in the trajectory in financial services. But across the rest, I would say not a dramatic shift in what we saw in the first quarter. Again, the common thread that we're seeing is not a sector by sector, other than what I pointed out in the financial services. The common thread here is the relevance of our offerings in these strategic imperatives, where the need for mobility, the need for social ways of engaging your -- either your employee base or your client base and the need for really powerful, scalable systems kind of drove the day here in the first quarter with 30% growth year-to-year relative to what had been a 20% kind of growing business.",242

In your past comments, you've talked about this year being flat but previously called out a number of onetime items, including pensions. And I was just wondering if you could comment directionally how we should be envisioning cash flow in 2016 relative to 2015. It seems like some of the items should be onetime in nature, but the tax payments, restructuring, et cetera, then both directionally and relative to the percent that you normally provide versus net income.",89

So a few things, Keith. One, as we said in a number of times, cash flow, we expect to be flat in 2015 relative to 2014. And relative to 2014, what we showed in Investor Day were -- the drivers of our realization in 2014 were really twofold. One, we had a very high cash tax rate last year relative to net income, and I just -- as I mentioned in a prior answer, we don't see that same level of headwind this year. So on a realization basis, taxes -- cash taxes will not be an impact to 2015. I'll come back to 2016 in a moment. And then also last year, we had a pretty substantial gain, which, obviously, showed up as cash in the IBM Corporation, but it showed up in the investing line, not in the free cash flow line. So that drove realization down about 20 points from the, say, if we set ourselves a high 90s. So this year, as I mentioned, we don't see cash taxes as a primary headwind, and we do expect to improve realization this year pretty dramatically. I did talk about a little bit on a full year basis about some of the differences in cash flows this year, including performance-related payments and workforce rebalancing payments and increased CapEx within 2015 but still an improvement in our realization rate in 2015. Now when we get to 2016, I think a few things happen. One, we, again, will have, I think, a cash tax headwind. Now this is at a planning level, and we are -- we're 9 months away from the start of the year, which means we're 21 months away from figuring out the settlement of audits and things. So we got a long way to go. But right now, we would envision a cash tax headwind, again, in 2016 that we can see. From a pension perspective, we're kind of -- we're well funded in our pensions, by the way. We've been -- we have a close pension, and we've been moving our assets side of our portfolio to more mimic the liability side, which is we've been moving to more debt instruments within that and allocating to more interest-rate securities. So we don't have as much risk in the portfolio, and our U.S. pension remains very well funded, and our global pensions are in a pretty good funding position. So we don't see a lot of -- at this point, we don't see a lot of impact from pensions.",424

Let's -- I'll talk about how we see the rest of the year playing out, first, in -- from a full year perspective, then I'll bring it back to the near term and what we see coming in the second quarter. So first, as I mentioned earlier, our low end of guidance assumes essentially that Software doesn't improve for the rest of the year. And as we already saw, that first quarter was just a bit ahead of that. So the high end of guidance assumes that we see a slight trajectory improvement in our Software business, right back to essentially flat. In the near term -- so that's the difference between high and low. The near term, from a profitability perspective, we have a fairly typical skew in our pretax profit from first to second quarter. It's fairly typical. Now as we transform our business, as we continue to make investments, as we continue to see growth in our strategic imperative business, we will get, as I mentioned, another good quarter out of the mainframe. But as we transform that business, I would expect to see a fairly typical skew from first to second quarter on a pretax profit basis. Now on a year-to-year basis, we have dynamics within our workforce rebalancing charges from prior years that drive the growth rates to look odd. So with essentially roughly the same level of workforce rebalancing from first quarter to second quarter this year, we take that out of the equation, therefore, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But the transformation of our business and the cycle we're in, in mainframe, I think, probably gets us to a typical -- a more typical, if you will, sequential improvement of about $1 billion of pretax profit quarter-to-quarter. And again, on a full year basis, we see the difference in the high end and the low end as being that Software trajectory.",318

I mean, I'd say a few things. So we did not see dramatic -- we didn't see any improvement in, for instance, in Asia Pacific. So we're continuing to see a low spending environment in AP, and I think our performance there mimics what we're seeing in the marketplace in general. Japan spending continues to go quite well, and we've continued to perform, but it's more than just the environment in Japan. The team has done a terrific job of maintaining growth now well into their third year, and so it's -- [indiscernible] of our offerings that are underpinned by a reasonable spending environment within Japan. In other places, as we noted on the call, North America, U.S., did quite well, and we see a spending environment there that is supportive of the investments we're making and the way we're shifting the business. So in total, without -- with some exceptions where we see weak spending environments in AP, we see a reasonable environment. Now from an expense perspective, our focus is, obviously, on continuing to drive that -- those investment levels. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, outside of the translation impact of currency and outside of the divested content, our spending was essentially flat year-to-year and so, on an EDAR [ph] basis, was about the same. And we will continue to shift within that our spending toward the strategic imperatives. And so when you look at 30% growth, and again, we don't expect it to stay at 30%. But when you look at 30% growth, that's supported by a pretty dramatic shift of spending within IBM. And at the same time, that funding, that spending is coming from the -- those core businesses. So some of what you're seeing in that core business decline is that engineered shift toward the strategic imperatives.",308

It looks like both GBS and GTS profitability was down year-over-year, and I know that signings had a lot of volatility around that. But kind of the rate of $10 billion seems to be at multi-year lows, how should we kind of think about what's going on in Services? Is mostly the shift to the strategic imperatives? And how should we kind of think about that because this is the shift you'd expect profitability actually be up year-over-year or maybe FX?",101
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3619.0,791518.0,34484914.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,33,"Sure. So a few things, and you're right, FX is obviously playing a role here in how some of those Services profits translate back to U.S. dollars. But on a broader context, signings growth in the first quarter, which -- is there plenty of opportunity out there? There certainly is. We see a lot of opportunity for continued growth in our outsourcing business, double-digit growth, in fact, across all of our outsourcing businesses and signings. And the backlog, in total, was essentially flat year-to-year. Obviously, there's a currency impact here and a divestiture impact. But backlog, in total, was essentially flat. What we see in Services is really a couple of things. One, within Global Technology Services, we continue to invest pretty heavily, as I noted earlier, in order to drive that SoftLayer platform, for instance. We continue to invest to build out that infrastructure-as-a-service capability, where we're seeing very good growth in our SoftLayer platform, a very good growth across cloud. In the GBS business, we're seeing very good performance in Japan. We got a return to growth in Europe, which was quite encouraging. And there are some areas of strength in other parts of those emerging markets. Latin America did quite well, doing well in the Middle East and Africa. What we're seeing is a slowdown that's driving the revenue line in the U.S. Now some of that's driven by consulting but, quite frankly now, we did grow our signings again in the U.S. So we have a -- we're building, if you will, a backlog that will turn into revenue in the future. But right now, we're dealing with a slowdown in our U.S. consulting business. The mix of our business in GBS is pretty consistent around the world. They have a very high mix of these strategic imperatives. And within that mix, the growth is very high. So we're comfortable that we're making the shift in GBS. We, obviously, have, as I noted, some work to do in our U.S. business. But we do see good -- some pretty good growth and pretty good performance in other parts of the world in GBS. 
So I wanted to wrap up the call just with a few points and, again, to thank you for joining this afternoon. Our first quarter performance, we view, as another proof point that the strategy is right. The actions we're taking to reinvent our businesses, the innovation we're delivering in our Hardware business, in our Software business and in our Services businesses is starting to pay off. And the investments and the focus on those solution areas are all contributing to the very strong growth we saw in these strategic imperatives. So as we move through the year, we'll continue the transformation. We'll continue to make these investments and to build those ecosystems that we talked about. It certainly takes some time. But certainly, this was a very good start to the year. So thanks for joining.",494

In the second quarter, we delivered $20.8 billion of revenue and operating EPS of $3.84. With that, our revenue for the first half was over $40 billion; operating net income was $6.7 billion and operating EPS was $6.75. Our revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter and essentially flat for the first half, excluding the impact of currency in the divested businesses. Our overall revenue performance includes the continued translation impact from a strong dollar and the impact of divested businesses. Together, these reduced our reported revenue growth by 12 to 13 points, both for the quarter and the half. I'll focus on our revenue performance, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, for the balance of the presentation.
Let me give you a quick overview of different parts of our business. Revenue in our strategic imperatives, those that address the market trends in data, cloud and engagement, is again up more than 30% in the second quarter and so, up over 30% for the first half. This is an acceleration from roughly 20% growth last year. As we said before, we're able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because of the industry perspective and deep insight we have from working with our clients on their core businesses to help move them to these strategic areas. 
We're clearly seeing this in analytics, where our revenue was up more than 20% in the first half, well above market rates. This is terrific growth on a large revenue base. Recall, we generated $17 billion of analytics revenue last year. The growth is led by GBS and by Systems Hardware, reflecting the new z13 and POWER8 systems where they specifically address analytics workloads. And we're developing new markets with the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson.
Our cloud revenue was up over 70% year-to-year in the first half, and over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $8.7 billion. We had strong growth in both our private foundations revenue and our as-a-service offerings, and we exited the second quarter with an annual as-a-service run rate of $4.5 billion. Our cloud business is substantial and growing rapidly.
The market continues to evolve beyond pure infrastructure toward higher-value process, data and analytics as-a-service engagements in the same way the Internet evolved from browsing to a full transactional business platform. Our clients are finding value on the combination of public, private and hybrid implementations we're able to provide. Our Security business was up 10% for the half, Social more than 40%, while our Mobile business quadrupled. 
From a segment perspective, we saw an increase in demand in our Services business with 22 deals over $100 million this quarter, the highest number in over 2 years. This contributed to a backlog that is up year-to-year for the first time since the end of 2013, which is certainly an encouraging data point. In our systems business, we've been delivering innovation and repositioning the portfolio, and this quarter, we again had solid revenue and profit performance. Our System z revenue was up about 50% year-to-date, and the z13 performance is in line with previous cycles. Power grew in the first and second quarters led by strong growth in scale-out systems, which are capturing both the UNIX and Linux opportunity and a return to growth in the high end this quarter.
Then there are parts of the business that are impacting our second quarter performance, but the transformation will pay off over the longer term. Parts of our Services business aren't delivering sufficient productivity in the base to fund the investments we're making and to offset the impact of currency. Now we'll get return on the investments over time, but it's impacting profit growth now. We are making the shift in our offerings as evidenced by our signings and backlog growth, but we need to drive more productivity to improve the profit profile. And some of the geographic regions, specifically the BRIC countries, are impacting our overall performance. I'll expand on that when we discuss the geo performance.
Our first half performance also reflects major portfolio actions we've taken to continue to shift to higher value. Late last year, we sold our x86 business. You can see the benefit in our 50-basis-point improvement in gross margin. And we recently completed the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business, while we continue to focus on advanced semiconductor research. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, we announced that an IBM Research-led alliance produced the industry's first 7-nanometer chip, another milestone in our contributions to semiconductor innovation. At the same time, we're making significant investments in our strategic imperatives. For example, we've created Watson Healthcare. We're continuing to build out cloud data centers, and we launched important new partnerships in analytics, mobile, social and cloud.
So to sum it up, our second quarter and first half results are a reflection of the transformation in our business as we move to where we see the longer-term value in enterprise IT. The actions and investments are delivering strong growth in our strategic imperatives and continued innovation across our portfolio. And we're able to drive overall margin improvement on a fairly stable revenue base.
I'll move on to the financial metrics, but first, let me remind you of some of the items we mentioned in our call back in April. We said we'd grow our pretax income by $1 billion quarter-to-quarter. We said that we'd have more workforce rebalancing than last year, and we said we'd have lower gains in our I&E since, last year, we had a gain associated with the sale of our customer care business. And we expected the stronger dollar to continue to have a significant impact to our revenue and profit. As always, we've included a view of the currency translation impact to our revenue in a chart in the backup, and you'll see the at current spot rates its impact continues to be substantial.
So now turning to the results for the quarter. We delivered $4.6 billion of operating PTI, which is up $1 billion from the first quarter. The year-to-year performance in PTI reflects the impact of currency, higher levels of investment and higher workforce rebalancing than last year, although the workforce rebalancing charge wasn't as large as we had initially expected. We also had lower divestiture gains year-to-year.
Looking at our margins. We had a 20-basis-point improvement in gross margin driven by our portfolio actions and the relative performance of System z. Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift to higher value as well, but they also reflect the dynamics I just mentioned in investments, workforce rebalancing and gains, which impacted expense. Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20%, but we did benefit from a few discrete items. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.84.
We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $400 million from last year. Over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.2 billion of free cash flow, so our realization of GAAP net income is in the high 80s. Over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by over 2% and increased our dividend, returning about 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders.
Now turning to the revenue by geography. In total, our performance in the major markets was consistent with last quarter, while the growth markets decelerated, driven by the BRIC countries. To put it in perspective, the BRICs impacted IBM's overall revenue growth rate by 2 points in the second quarter, or said another way, our revenue, excluding the BRICs, would have been up 1%. 
But let me start there. Within the BRICs, only India had modest growth, building on improved operational performance in Services. The other 3 countries were down at a double-digit rate. Brazil was down 16%, though our revenue Brazil last year was up over 20%. So it was a very tough compare. The volatility of our results in Russia continued, and our revenue in China was down 25% with fewer large transactions in the quarter. Outside of the BRICs, many countries improved their performance sequentially. In fact, outside of the BRICs, our growth markets revenue was up 5%, a 4-point improvement from last quarter.
Looking at the major markets. Revenue was flat year-to-year. The year-to-year performance in many of the major market countries also improved sequentially, including Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan. Two of our largest countries, Japan and Germany, posted the strongest growth. In the U.S., overall revenue was down low single digit, though we once again had good System z performance, and we signed substantial new Services business.
Turning to the segment perspective. Our total revenue was down less than 1%, and gross margin improved 20 basis points. I'll spend more time on the revenue and profit drivers in the segment discussions, but let me just make a couple of top-level comments.
Revenue in 3 of our 5 segments grew this quarter, including our largest segment, GTS. This quarter, Systems Hardware posted solid growth with double-digit growth in z and mid-single-digit growth in Power. And our Global Financing revenue was up, driven by equipment sales. In the other 2 segments, GBS and Software, our year-to-year performance was fairly consistent with the last few quarters. Our total margin improvement was driven by a shift to higher value. Remember the last quarter, the shift was driven by portfolio actions and the relative strength of System z.
The reported operating expense and other income is down 9%. At this level of spend, our expense-to-revenue ratio was up 1.5 year-to-year. As we've discussed in the past, within our large operational expense base, we've got a shift going on, driving productivity in some areas while significantly increasing our investment in the strategic imperatives. This investment is to build capabilities, much of which will be consumed as a service in areas like Watson, Watson Health and Bluemix, and so we'll see the benefits over the long term. The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture of System x. This quarter, we also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and lower divestiture gains. I'll comment on each.
11 points of the decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains that are reported number in other income and SG&A; 2 points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate, and this quarter, we took a charge of nearly $200 million for workforce rebalancing, nearly all of which is an increase year-to-year. This drove expense higher by 3 points. And then divestiture gains were down $100 million year-to-year, driven by last year's gain associated with the sale of the customer care business. This added about 1.5 points to expense growth.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. Combined service revenue was $12.4 billion with the year-to-year revenue trajectory a little better than in the first quarter. We closed 22 deals greater than $100 million, balanced between renewals and new scope or clients. This is the third consecutive quarter of signings growth, and with it, our total backlog was up more than 1% year-to-year.
Global Technology Services revenue of $8.1 billion was up 1% with growth in all 3 lines of business. This is a 2-point improvement from the first quarter year-to-year performance driven by a combination of revenue from backlog and in-period revenue. GTS outsourcing returned to growth, improving 3 points sequentially due to several large deals signed last year that are now completing transition. We're seeing good traction in the contracts that combine traditional IT outsourcing with the integration of mobility, hybrid cloud and analytics workloads.
Integrated Technology Services also returned to growth this quarter with strong performance in our cloud, security and business resiliency Services.
Growth in SoftLayer accelerated as we've significantly increased capacity in new data centers since the beginning of last year. And we now have 41 cloud data centers on 5 continents. Maintenance grew 2%, driven by growth in our multi-vendor support services. This is our hardware maintenance offering for third-party platforms, which leverages our global distribution and inventory capabilities.
Our pretax profit in GTS was down. Let me spend a minute on this. Currency drove the largest year-to-year impact given the strengthening dollar. We continue to generate significant profits and cash flow in local currencies, but the translation of those currencies back to U.S. dollars significantly affects our reported profit growth. The divestiture of the System x business impacted our maintenance profit and margin. And we took our workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, essentially all of which resulted in a year-to-year impact. We continue to invest for growth in our strategic imperatives offerings such as bringing additional SoftLayer capacity online and increasing our security and mobility go-to-market skills. 
We're also opening new resiliency data centers and expanding our global delivery capabilities. As you would expect, we look to productivity as a way to fund our investments. We didn't drive that productivity this quarter as we're always balancing the timing of our transformation with the dynamics of running our clients' most critical processes.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion, down 3%. Revenue declined in the practices focused on traditional back-office implementations. Customers are migrating away from large ERP projects toward smaller initiatives with cloud, mobility and analytics as their main focus, which are often contracted in an as-a-service model. We've been shifting skills and work from these declining practices to the new opportunity areas. We've had strong growth rates in our strategic imperatives, but we need to shift more aggressively to improve our overall GBS business results.
We're also seeing that long-term application management is becoming more important to enterprise clients as the IT environment grows more complex. Clients are integrating public and private cloud networks, deploying new mobile capabilities into their employee and customer base and deploying analytics around these solutions. These ongoing changes in clients' needs drive both shorter-term systems integration as well as long-term management requirements. And performance improved across our application management services in the second quarter.
Looking at GBS profit. There were a few drivers of the decline. The largest impact was from the customer care divestiture, which drove 9 points of the year-to-year decline in profit due to the sizable gain in last year's results. Also, we increased the level of investments to further enable our partnerships, and we hired or rescaled additional go-to-market and delivery practitioner resources for our fast-growing strategic imperative offerings. For example, we've hired over 2,000 incremental resources into our mobility practices and shifted almost 1,000 to analytics projects. The remaining profit decline was driven by the lower revenue on what is a relatively fixed cost base in the short term. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models, more aggressively shifting resources to higher-value offerings and enhancing our global delivery capabilities.
Our Software revenue of $5.8 billion was down 3%. With that, our first half revenue was down 2%, which is consistent with the performance in the second half of last year. Key branded middleware was flat but total Software performance reflects the headwind from operating systems and other middleware.
Profit performance in Software is a reflection of the overall revenue performance, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impact from currency translation. We had growth across the solution areas, including security, commerce and social, and within that, we saw strong growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings.
Our security software revenue returned to double-digit growth. Our security solutions bring together intelligence, integration and expertise that are essential in the world of advanced threat. As an example, 1 of the top 10 global energy firms was looking for an analytics-based approach to protect tens of thousands of systems and devices globally from advanced threats. IBM brought together its security solutions and services expertise to establish a security operation center to monitor billions of logs and events on a daily basis. This intelligent approach to threat management has allowed them to focus their resources on only the handful of high-priority threats that warrant further investigation.
In another of our solution areas, our commerce software grew. Our commerce solutions are allowing clients to get unique insights about their customers. 9 of the top 10 U.S. retailers and each of the top 10 global banks run on IBM's Commerce solutions. IBM Commerce now powers 30,000 organizations globally. Our social solutions again grew double digits, driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings.
We're continuing to bring innovations to our solution areas and deepen our industry focus. Watson is an example of where we're creating a market around cognitive computing and building an as-a-service business. Last quarter, I talked about expanding the Watson ecosystem. This quarter, I want to focus on another aspect of our progress. Watson's being deployed across nearly 30 countries and in 20 industries. We are currently working on hundreds of projects to expand industry domain knowledge as well as teaching the system new languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Arabic.
We continue to expand Watson's reach by forging additional partnerships, and just last week, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Mubadala to bring IBM Watson to the Middle East and North Africa with focus on health care, retail, education, banking and finance. Our focus on Software continues to be innovation, partnership and aligning to the needs of our customers and the industries in which they operate.
Turning to our Systems Hardware segment. Revenue of $2.1 billion was up 5%, and pretax income was up 26%. These results are a reflection of both our ability to continue to deliver innovation across our high-end systems and the significant actions we've taken. This quarter, z Systems revenue was up 15%, and through the first half, we grew about 50%. Power revenue grew 5% this quarter. We saw growth in both the low end and the high end where we've introduced new POWER8-based systems. The capabilities of both mainframe and Power Systems are resonating well with our customers, and we continue to add new customers to the platforms.
During our investor briefing earlier this year, I talked about the mission-critical nature and expansion of banking transactions their mainframe supports. Our z System offers the most secure, reliable and scalable platform with the best price performance. So when a leading managed service provider in Europe was looking to create a cloud platform for independent software vendors serving financial services clients, they opted for mainframe. This is another new IBM mainframe customer.
In that same Investor Day presentation, we talked about the explosion of data and transaction volumes in the telecommunications industry. So when a leading telco solutions provider in China was looking to offer a customer experience solution to its global clients, it selected Power on Linux over x86. The Power platform provides both higher capacity and better performance than x86, allowing them to incrementally scale out their solution.
Our OpenPOWER strategy continues to take hold globally. In June, the U.K. government joined the United States as the second major government to turn to OpenPOWER for its high-performance computing priorities. The U.K. government will utilize IBM's latest OpenPOWER high-performance computing and Watson-based cognitive technologies to obtain valuable insights from a variety of data sources to boost productivity and drive growth. This is a similar class of IBM OpenPOWER systems that the United States Department of Energy selected for the Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. I believe our Power results through the first half show that the Power strategy is working.
Our storage hardware revenue was down 4%. We again saw strong growth in our FlashSystems with our new generation offerings introduced in the first half. This growth was once again offset by the wind-down of our OEM business and continued weakness in high-end disk. Our Systems Hardware segment revenue growth and profitability improvement is a clear result of the actions we've taken to position our systems business for the future. 
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year-to-year. Of course, this is after nearly $1 billion spent in CapEx consistent with last quarter and with last year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.5 billion is up over $800 million year-to-year. The primary drivers were lower cash tax payments and an improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our System x divestiture; payments for performance-based compensation, which were accrued last year and operational performance. 
As you know, our annual free cash flow generation is skewed to the end of the year, and our first half results are in line with that skew. You'll remember we said that we'd improve our free cash flow realization from 2014 to 2015, and earlier this year, we expected realization in the mid- to high 80s. We now expect the full year to be about 90%. So even at the low end of the profit guidance, this reflects a modest year-to-year improvement in free cash flow for the year.
Looking at uses of cash. We spent $700 million on acquisitions. We've acquired 5 companies in the first half. These add to our capabilities in cloud and analytics and deepen our industry domain expertise to further differentiate our solutions. For example, the 2 acquisitions made by Watson Health strengthen IBM's leadership in health care analytics and support our effort to apply cognitive computing to drive healthier patient outcomes.
In the last 6 months, we've returned $4.7 billion to shareholders. This includes $2.4 billion in dividends and $2.3 billion in gross share repurchases to buy back over 14 million shares. At the end of June, we had 987 million shares outstanding and $3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, up $300 million from December but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.7 billion, of which just over $26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.
Our non-financing debt of $12.6 billion is down $4.5 billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt to cap was 55%, which is down 4 points from December and almost 1 point lower than a year ago. We continue to be well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy.
So now let me wrap it up and talk about our expectations for the full year. You've seen us move aggressively and decisively to reshape our business to best address the long-term value in IT. We've been shifting investments in resources, building partnerships and ecosystems and introducing key innovations. Since the beginning of the second quarter, we launched Watson Health, acquiring Phytel and Explorys, and partnering with other leading health care companies. We finalized the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, while we introduced a breakthrough in 7-nanometer technology. 
We had announced that we'd embed Spark into our analytics and commerce platforms and formed an innovative new cloud partnership with Box. Each one of these actions contributes to our transformation and approves our hand for the long term. But let's talk about what it means for 2015.
In the first half, our revenue in the strategic imperatives grew more than 30%. Those markets are also growing, but with our performance, we're clearly gaining share. The core portfolio continued to decline in a declining market, so together, the strategic imperatives and core delivered revenue in an IBM level that was roughly flat.
So for the full year, we continue to expect to deliver operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50. And even at the low end of the range, we now expect a modest year-to-year improvement of free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning of the year, the primary variable between the high and the low end of the guidance is our software revenue trajectory.
From a margin perspective, for the full year, we continue to expect to expand margin driven by portfolio actions. We also said we'll continue a high level of investment, and we'll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends.
For the third quarter, if you look back over the last few years, we typically see about $1 billion decrease in revenue from second to third quarter. There's no reason to think this year would be different than our typical seasonality. So with $1 billion less quarter-to-quarter, third quarter revenue would be about the same size as the first. Now what is different is the mix of business relative to what we've seen historically. But even with that, we'll continue to expand margin in the third quarter, driven by our portfolio actions.
When you look at some of the other dynamics in the third from a year-to-year perspective, currency impact, investments, workforce rebalancing, the third quarter profit trajectory looks a lot like the second. Now there are some differences, like we don't have a gain in last year's third quarter results, but on balance, the year-to-year profit would be pretty similar to 2Q. This is true for the EPS trajectory as well.
Through the first half, relative to the low end of our guidance, we are at the same point as last year and ahead of the year before. In the third quarter, given the profit trajectory I just described, we expect to finish the third quarter with 63% to 64% of our low-end EPS guidance achieved, consistent with prior years. And then where we finish within the range for the full year really depends primarily on whether we have a change in trajectory in our Software business. Importantly, as we progress in our transformation, we'll exit the year a higher-value business.

The business was down 3% at constant currency. I think other than the financial crisis in '09, that's the lowest Software growth rate in the last 15 years. You also had a significant pressure -- accompanying pressure on margins. And I'm wondering if you can kind of step back. At the beginning of the year, you were hoping for an improvement, and talking about the guidance, it looked like perhaps you're not as confident. You're saying we could end up at the low end of the range if we don't improve. Maybe we'll do better than that if we do improve. But I'm wondering if you can kind of step back now that you're halfway through the year. The results seem to suggest that there is something structural impacting your Software business. Now whether that's the decline that we've seen in UNIX over the last couple of years or whether it's the migration to as a service, there seems to be an inflection point over the last 4 quarters in your Software business for the worse. And I'm wondering if you can step back and tell us if you agree with that and what you think is driving this. And do you have confidence, like the same level of confidence as you did 6 months ago that the Software business will improve throughout the year?",237

Thanks, Toni. A few comments, I think, on Software. And some of these themes are going to be consistent with what we've talked about, and then some of them will -- or will be, I guess, observations as we go through the year. So relative to -- first, relative to guidance, as we said since the beginning, the difference -- the primary difference in our guidance range for the year is driven by the trajectory of Software. And so when we went through in the prepared remarks and pegged the third quarter to the low end, I wasn't suggesting that we don't see that difference still. In fact, we do still see Software driving the difference between the low and the high end, but we do have to -- when you have a range, you do have to pick one side to anchor your analysis. So we chose, in this case, to anchor to the low side. With regard to Software, there are some consistent themes here that we've been observing now for a while. We do still have, in our overall growth rate, a headwind from the operating system element of our business. So it was about 1 point. Additionally, what we saw in the BRIC countries' impact on IBM, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, even though the BRICs are relatively small, only about 7% of our revenue, they had a 2-point impact on the growth. That same phenomena translated into key branded middleware. So x the BRICs, our key branded middleware segment -- software segment would have had 2 points of growth as well. So when we look underneath that, I think the consistency here is that we have 2 phenomena within our top 250 clients. And we've talked about the substantial, both investment and commitment those clients have made to the Software platform. Within that client base, we continue to offer and they continue to utilize flexibility so that they can fully deploy our middleware across their operating -- across their environments. And that phenomena hasn't changed. Now outside of that top 250 clients, we do see growth. We've seen growth. We've been growing there, and we continue to grow. So it really is this flexibility that we're providing to our clients, which we still think, for the long term, is the right thing to do as they commit to the platform.",399

So it was quite a good acceleration, as we mentioned in the last call, from the fourth into the first. And as you noted, as we just talked about in our prepared remarks, we were able to maintain that trajectory into the second quarter. So we finished the first half in a very strong position in strategic imperatives. And given our growth rates and where we think that market growth rate is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're growing share across that space as well. When we look forward in those strategic imperatives and we look forward to the overall revenue trajectory of IBM, we don't have assumed -- we have not assumed a dramatic improvement, if you will, in the overall revenue trajectory at the low end of our guidance. At the high end, obviously, as we just talked about on the last question and in prepared remarks, the high end, we assume an improvement in the Software trajectory, some of which will be in the strategic imperatives, obviously. In fact, the weighting of our Software business and strategic imperatives is larger than the overall business, so I would expect that we would see an improvement in that. But again, our current guidance at the low end does not assume a dramatic improvement in the overall revenue trajectory. And so within that, the mix between the strategic imperatives, again, which have a lot of momentum versus the core, we're not suggesting that we have to grow or we have to change the trajectory at the low end.",264

Thanks, David. A few things. So -- and there are a number of metrics here. I want to make sure that we triangulate to the right answer and that we don't confuse or we don't mix some of the data points. So cash taxes, as you know, last year, were a substantial year-to-year headwind, and this year, they are not a year-to-year headwind. And the amount of cash tax tailwind that we're getting this year is the same as we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year, so no change to that. Now let's switch for a second to the realization metrics. So cash taxes were about a 10-point headwind to realization last year, very dramatic headwind to our realization. This year, they are still a headwind although much reduced. So the realization impact is only about 1 point or 2. So when you think about the relationship of what's going on, our cash tax rate will still be a little bit higher than our book rate although not as high as it was last year. So this year, cash taxes will be a little bit higher than the book rate. So there's still a realization impact, but there's a year-to-year tailwind in terms of payments. Now next year, we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of planning to do. And while we have a small headwind in realization this year, we do see a headwind in realization next year. And how that translates to a year-to-year, I think, we have to spend the next 6 months trying to figure that out, and then we'll have more guidance in January for you. But again, there are different elements here. So from a realization, cash taxes are still a headwind this year although smaller than last year. And next year, we expect them to be a headwind, but we'll have to translate as we get closer into what that means on a year-to-year base for 2016. But as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do see now a modest improvement in free cash flow for this year.",359

Can we circle back to the Services side in a sense that consulting in systems integration was weak again? And you had talked about having to shift some of your resources, then you can go in, in, say, the cloud or ERP deployments are going down or being replaced by SaaS deployments, and maybe you're not winning as many programs there given that others are growing actually consulting pretty well here in the beginning of 2015.",77

Our GBS -- and when we talk about consulting systems integration, I'll just focus the answer on our Global Business Services segment. GBS was, as you noted, down again in the quarter. Although quarter-to-quarter, we had about a 1-point improvement in the trajectory, still down but a bit better than the first. And the dynamics within that, I think, are similar to what we saw in the first, which is the shift that we're undertaking -- and what you noted in your question, the shift that we're undertaking is pretty dramatic, and we are seeing very strong double-digit revenue growth within the strategic imperatives within the GBS business alone. Now we also have a pretty substantial -- think about it as a traditional ERP implementation kind of consulting business. And the net of the shift to those strategic imperatives and obviously, the reduction in our resources applied to those larger implementations, that engineered shift is not yet at the point where the revenue growth coming from those imperatives is offsetting, if you will, our reduction in those -- the areas that address those traditional ERP. So the core is still the largest part of the portfolio, those traditional parts of ERP implementations. And while we engineer that shift, we are going to see declines in that part of the business. But as I mentioned, that shift is driving growth in the strategic imperatives. We just have to continue to be as fast as we can to get to those areas, so we can see growth overall for the GBS business.",264

Martin, last quarter, you suggested currency could hit EPS about $0.80 for the year. I was curious if that's still the number. And it looks like your expectations for the next few quarters on currency, it's similar to a little worse than in the April quarter, and I'm a little surprised given the move in the euro. And then also I was curious about the 17% tax rate. Should we carry that forward? Or does that go back to 20%?",85
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052906.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. A few things. So first on tax. We'll start at the back on tax. So we still see a 20% rate for IBM. That's the right operating rate, if you will, for us. We did have, as I noted in the call, a couple of discrete items in the quarter, but those were discretes in the quarter. Now we do have discretes, but -- we do have discretes throughout the year, but 20% is the right number for tax. On currency impact -- I'll come back to earnings in a moment, the first part of the question. Currency impact is now a little bit worse for the year relative to what we expected just 90 days ago. So you may remember we include -- as we always do, we include a supplemental chart on the impact of currency. And we had on that chart, in April, that the third quarter would be about an 8-point impact, and the fourth quarter would be about 5 year-to-year. And now we see 8 to 9 and 5 to 6 in terms of the currency impact. And that data again is in the supplemental chart. And so we are seeing an increased -- a slightly increased currency impact for the second half of the year. Now our view of currency and its impact on profit is and can be, as you would imagine, the translation impact can be quite substantial. So we did say that the impact to earnings would be about $0.80 for the year. And we still see -- while it's gotten a little bit worse, we still think that's probably a little bit worse as well, but we can hold that within the guidance we have given. So yes, the impact to EPS is probably a little bit worse than what we had assumed. We do have actions underway to try to navigate through whatever currency environment we're in, but the year-to-year impact is still fairly substantial in our guidance. Now of note is that the guidance, as you know, reflects a EPS of flat to down 5. And the currency impact is 5 points, roughly, in terms of earnings. So if we were in a benign currency environment, we'll discard the idea of it being an actual tailwind at some point. But if we were in a benign currency environment, our guidance would reflect flat to up 5. And that's the kind of impact, I think, that you would expect to see in a company that has more than 60% of its revenues and cash flows and profits, dramatic parts of its profits operating in currencies other than the dollar. So the short answers to your questions, tax at 20% is still the right thing in terms of operating. The currency impact is a little worse than what we assumed from 90 days ago, and it is a dramatic year-to-year impact on our profitability.",487

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052909.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. We did see -- as you saw, we have very strong signings quarter, which, as we noted in the prepared remarks, drove our backlog to 1% growth x currency. It's the first time we've had backlog growth in a couple of years. So obviously, very encouraging to get the Services backlog growing, so we can start to see a more consistent delivery of revenue growth. Obviously, within that, revenue growth in that business does drive profit leverage, but keep in mind that we continue to invest quite heavily as well in order to make sure we're building the right cloud platforms, the right skills around that Services business. So while the single largest impact year-to-year in our Services profitability, not on margins but Services profitability, is the translation of those profits back to dollars given the dollar strength, we do see an opportunity to continue to invest quite heavily in our Services business. We do see opportunities to continue to move not only the GTS business but the GBS business to higher value. And over time, that will drive margin improvements. But for now we're not relying on margin improvements in our guidance for this year. But again, the single largest impact on a year-to-year basis is currency. So as we continue to invest, while that revenue growth -- if we were to grow -- continue to grow revenue in GTS, for instance, that will drive some leverage in the profit model. We are going to continue to invest pretty heavily going forward.",256

So both the investment side and the mix side as you think about both sides of Services, please.",99

So a couple of things, Keith. First, we will continue to invest. So let's assume we'll get through, at some point, the year-to-year impact to currency, and we'll just take currency out of the equation for a second. When we look at our model, we see a few elements that will continue to drive profit growth within Services while, at the same time, continuing to invest. So first, we will continue to drive capacity utilization into our cloud business. So remember, we're investing pretty heavily in cloud, and I would say that those businesses are not yet at scale. So as we get those and utilize that capacity and get to scale, then we'll see margin improvements in the Services business. Secondly, we continue to shift that overall portfolio to the most contemporary, highest value offerings that our clients are demanding, and I think you can see that both in the signings we had, for instance, in our Services business and the backlog growth. You can see it in the strategic imperative performance within GBS. So we continue to shift those offerings to higher value. And then underpinning that, the delivery side of this, the delivery elements of this, including much broader deployment of intellectual property, leveraging our software and our research ability to put automation into our delivery content, so we do still see opportunities to keep a balance between -- we'll keep investing, but we'll also be able to drive a more efficient delivery platform as we go through -- as we get out of this currency environment. And then finally, I think it's important to note that while we do make use -- pretty heavy use in some countries like the U.S., where we have a pretty good global delivery platform within the U.S., that's not the same everywhere in the world. So in some regions in the world, our use of global delivery is still under 30%, so we still have opportunities in those regions to move more of our delivery into a global delivery format. So I still see between the shift to higher value, between getting cloud to scale and the move to automation and getting more of our regions into a global delivery environment, we still have room to improve margins in Services.",382

And I assume you're referring to the mix shift to more strategic imperatives. And if so, that's manifesting itself a nice growth. I think you said up 30% year-over-year, which is good. Can you help us understand the time frame or the milestones for judging and assessing the strategic imperatives and the investment in them of when we start to really start to see leverage to the model of leveraging that growth into a lot more profitability? Or in other words, how much longer do you have to keep really investing a lot more ahead of the fruit of all that?",131
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052915.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Sure, Jim. Thanks for the question. So a few things. In the prepared remarks, on expense, what we talked about was a slightly higher E to R in the year -- in the quarter, sorry. And we wanted to go through, make sure everyone understood that the 9% year-to-year improvement in expense was driven heavily by just the translation, the currency impact, which is actually 11 points to the year. So currency, obviously, has an impact on the expense side as well. We also talked a bit about the impact of having the expense from our System x divestiture now out of our run rate. So that was a couple of points. So we wanted to make sure that everyone understood, our investors understood that we continue to invest, and that's why the E to R is up in terms of the second quarter. Now when do we get through that? Boy, we see an industry where innovation, where industry skills and knowledge are the differentiators in many of our engagements. And so lot of our investments are focused on, yes, the strategic imperatives, as you said, which is a combination of shifting out of things that we were doing into new things. It's also part of growing that overall investment pool. But within those investments, yes, there's strategic imperatives, but it's also a lot of investments around building industry skills, industry talent because more and more, our clients are looking for that industry point of view. So I don't know that we get through, if you will, a -- the bow of the ship through the wave in terms of expense, in terms of investments, when do they slow down. Now I do think they're paying off. We had tremendous growth in cloud. Again, we had tremendous growth all across the strategic imperatives. So shifting this expense, as we've talked about in the beginning of the year, is absolutely the right thing for us to do for the long term. We can see that pay off in terms of the market share we're growing in those strategic imperatives. Now those will continue to pay dividends for a long, long time. Within that, as you know, we're building a number of as-a-services business -- as-a-services businesses including Watson. So I think that those investment levels are important. I think we'll continue to maintain those investments because we're building some very appealing businesses underneath those strategic imperatives.",406

And how do they impact your visibility on the business? And then just one last one. Have we hit a positive inflection point on the Services backlog?,45
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052918.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Sure. So a couple of things. Have we hit a positive inflection on the Services backlog, we'll start with that. So the backlog is $120-plus billion, so it's hard to make it move if you will. We had a very good signings quarter, as we talked about, 22 deals, greater than $100 million. We still see a lot of opportunity in terms of additional services opportunity. But getting that substantial backlog to move is, it takes a lot of services, signings over a consistent period of time. So while we see very good demand, it's tough to predict on a 90-day basis where the backlog is going to be, again, given it's $122 billion that we're trying to move. Now as a percentage of revenue, we talked about last year in Investor Day, we talked about it on a full year basis at about 27%, and we said in Investor Day that we're going to grow that to about 40%, right, be more than $40 billion, about 40% of our revenue by 2018. Now I think even though -- even there's seasonality in this number, I would say we are certainly ahead of the 27% given the growth, and we're making tremendous progress toward that 2018 goal of 40% of our business. But given the seasonality, I'm not sure that whether we're at -- whether we're -- where we are within that range is all that insightful. We will take our temperature again on this at the end of the year so that you can get a data point without much seasonality or without any seasonality. But again, from 27% last year, we're on our way to 40%. And I'd say the 2 data points that we have of 30 plus, 30 plus first and second quarter are in very good shape. Remember that we showed in Investor Day, we showed a chart that said these had been growing at about 19% fairly consistently over the last few years. So you should assume and I think we're comfortable that we're making very good progress on that longer-term goal.",348

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052920.0,Question,Amit Daryanani,,Analysts,32,"Just want to get back to the Software segment. Can you just talk about -- do you think the business performed in June quarter in line to your plan? Or was it ahead or below? And then when you look at the PTI margin decline you saw in Software, is that a reflection of the flexibility you're providing to your customers as a move to strategic imperatives and it should get back to a more normalized level once you get beyond that, I guess, initial transition? Or does that really reflect more of the reality that some of these strategic imperative revenues may be at a lower margin than your legacy revenues are?",113
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3460.0,834751.0,36052921.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,33,"Sure, Amit. A couple of things. So in terms of in line with the plan, we've said since the beginning of the year that the -- at the low end of guidance, we don't assume a change in trajectory, and at the high end, we do. And that's, by the way, to oversimplify a nearly $100 billion corporation. But we'll oversimplify it for the purpose of this question. And right now given that the trajectory in Software has not changed, I'd say that we are right in line with our plan, but we're right in line with that low end of guidance. I don't think that it would surprise anybody. With regard to the margin, a couple of things. One, Software is a very high-margin element and continues to be a very high-margin component of our overall mix. Now when we look at margins, I think there are 2 things I would disaggregate. On a gross profit level margin, the only real shift we see is a slight shift to our SaaS properties. And so while they are -- they come in at slightly lower margins than our traditional on-prem business, they are still highly accretive to the overall IBM model because, bear in mind, these are new spaces for us. We're not taking and converting an on-prem business to an as-a-service business. We are building new revenue streams in spaces where we're not today. So slightly lower gross margins on the SaaS business but all accretive to the IBM model. And then the net margins in our Software business reflect a lot of the investments that we've talked about both in strategic imperatives. And remember, we continue to invest in our core businesses because, as we talked about at Investor Day and in other venues, the contemporary nature of those, while they are products that have been in our clients' sights for many, many years and they're committed to those products, those products evolved into the latest, most contemporary needs as well. So those products now have to live in and support our clients in a mobile world, in a social world, and they have to have analytics capabilities as well. So the old products are also part of that investment. So from an investment standpoint, I would say that you're seeing the investments in our Software business on the net margin line.
So let me take a few minutes to wrap up the call. We're halfway through now a transformation year, and you can see in our results with the investments and of course, the shifts in our business, we're seeing good progress as we move more of our business into these strategic imperatives. We've been very active in reinventing our Hardware business, and I think that's paying off. And the investments and the added focus we've put on the solution areas are contributing to some pretty strong growth in those strategic imperatives. So with 6 months behind us, we've maintained our full year EPS, even though, as I mentioned in the remarks and in the Q&A, that currency is probably a little worse than it was at the beginning of the year, but we're maintaining our EPS guidance. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've taken up our view of free cash flow modestly, so modest growth free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning that this will take some time. We continue to manage the business for the long term, and we're confident that we're on track to that longer-term trajectory. So thanks very much, everyone, for joining us today.",600

For some time, we've been talking about the tremendous changes in our industry as our clients move to new areas, get greater value from their data and IT environments and implement new business models. So as we transform our business, we invest where we see higher value over the longer term. We drive growth in the areas where we're investing while other areas decline as we shift the business. And we expect to expand margins in our move to higher value. This is how we transform from one era to the next.
Our third quarter results reflect the progress we're making in that transformation. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expanded gross and net margins. We generated substantial free cash flow and we continued a high level of investment while returning value to shareholders. We always said this would play out over time though, this quarter, we fell a little short of the revenue expectations we set for ourselves. The GBS transformation is taking longer as the market shifts away from some of the more traditional application areas, and our storage disk business was weaker as more of the demand moves to our flash. And while our software performance for the quarter was consistent with what we've seen all year, we did have some weakness in transactions at the end of the quarter. 
In addition, our revenue trajectory continues to reflect significant impacts from currency movements in our divested businesses, in fact, over 12 points of growth in total. 
Put it all together, and the progress we're making demonstrates that we're on the right strategy as we help our clients move their businesses to the future. We see a lot of opportunity. And with this momentum and strategic imperatives, we're going to continue to invest at a very high level to accelerate the shift in our business. At the same time, we considered the pace of the GBS progress and applied the trajectory in transactions we saw at the end of the quarter to the larger fourth quarter transaction base, which reduces our view of the year. Taking all of this into consideration, we believe it is prudent to update our expectations for full year operating earnings per share to $14.75 to $15.75, while our view of free cash flow remains relatively flat year-to-year. I'll come back to this after going through the results of the quarter. 
Let me start by providing a little more color on the strategic imperatives performance. Our revenue in cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security was up 27% in the third quarter, which puts us up over 30% year-to-date. This is without the impact of currency and divestitures. And throughout this presentation, I'll focus on that view. Our cloud revenue was up over 65% through 3 quarters, with strong year-to-year performance across both our private foundations revenue and our as-a-service offerings. Over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $9.4 billion, and we exited the third quarter with an annual as-a-service run rate of $4.5 billion. Analytics revenue is up nearly 20% year-to-date. And in the area of engagement, the revenue from these businesses nearly doubled over last year. Our security business was up 12%, social up about 40%, and our mobile business quadrupled. 
Looking at the transformation or shift to strategic imperatives from a segment perspective. In Global Technology Services, we're bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services, both to new clients and to help existing clients move to the future. Our GTS results reflect growth in revenue and in the backlog. And when you look at high-end servers, we've repositioned the portfolio and delivered innovation as these systems run the most contemporary workloads. Throughout this year, we've had strong growth in our z Systems and continued success in Power. These are just 2 examples of what that shift looks like. 
We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to accelerate this shift, and in the last 90 days, we've committed more capital, including the acquisitions of Merge Healthcare to give Watson the ability to ""see"" millions of medical images along with Cleversafe, Compose, StrongLoop and Meteorix, each bolstering our cloud capabilities. We also just launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to cognitive business. These actions all advance our transformation of the IBM Company. 
Our approach is to integrate acquired content with our own organic capabilities and leverage partnerships in a broader ecosystem to build new high-value platforms like Watson, SoftLayer, Bluemix and OpenPOWER. Last quarter, I talked about the creation of Watson Health, which incorporated our Watson capabilities, the acquisitions of Phytel and Explorys, partnerships with leading health care companies and the creation of a HIPAA-compliant cloud. We've continued to announce new partnerships and new cloud services. The acquisition of Merge Healthcare brings together Watson's advanced analytics and cognitive capabilities with data and images from Merge's medical imaging platform to help doctors make sense of one patient's medical images in the context of the mass of related images. 
We are creating similar platforms for other industries and areas, such as Internet of Things. For example, we're working with a major global airline and had to apply cognitive thinking to understand all the variables impacting fuel demands of any given flight. They're looking at structured and unstructured data, included predicted taxi time, weather conditions, air traffic control delays and in-flight mechanical issues, so as to optimize fuel load. And we're working with a European hospitality company on how to apply cognitive thinking to understand how to maximize revenue from new high-end, kiosk-based coffee shops. They are looking at structured data such as frequency and timing of credit card purchases, combined with unstructured data, including social chatter on Twitter and real-time weather. They use Watson-cognitive APIs to make sense of the data. This requires a platform approach that integrates industry expertise, analytics software, cognitive APIs, cloud, Bluemix and multiple data streams, very powerful.
As I said earlier, this is a longer-term play. We're creating new platforms and building ecosystems and much of this is an as-a-service model. We're continuing to invest at a high level as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives. 
Let me now turn to the financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue of $19.3 billion was down 1%, reflecting the transition we've been describing. We expanded gross margin driven by our portfolio actions and the relative strength of z Systems revenue, in other words, driven by our shift to higher value. As we said last quarter, our PTI trajectory in the third quarter would be similar to the second, reflecting continued high level of investments across the business and currency impacts. And our PTI margin was flat year-to-year. Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20%, while the third quarter rate reflects discrete period items. And so bottom line, we delivered $3.34 of operating earnings per share. 
We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.6 billion of free cash flow with a realization of GAAP net income over 90%. Over that same period, we reduced our share count by 2% and increased our dividend, returning about 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Now turning to the revenue by geography. Our performance varied across the major markets. Our U.S. revenue was down 4%. A decline in traditional enterprise app implementations is impacting our consulting business and, in the month of September, we had a slowdown in our Software transactions. That said, we did have another quarter of strong z Systems performance in the U.S. By contrast, 2 of our other largest countries, Japan and Germany, posted the strongest growth. In fact, this is the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. And this quarter, we had growth across services, Software and hardware. We also had improved performance in the U.K., France and Canada. 
The growth markets in total were down 3%, a 2-point sequential improvement from last quarter. From a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia-Pacific. You'll recall last quarter, I talked about the weakness in the BRICs, which were down 18%. This quarter, the BRICs were down 7%, with sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance of all 4 countries. Brazil was down 4%, off a strong double-digit growth last year. Russia was also down at a single-digit rate. China was down 17% with fewer large transactions in the quarter. And the bright spot again was India, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. In fact, this quarter, India was up double digits, leveraging growth in the services backlog and an improvement in the hardware business. 
Turning to the segment perspective. Our total revenue was down 1% and gross margin improved 80 basis points.
Our Global Technology Services revenue grew and is now up in 6 of these last 7 quarters as we deliver value to new clients and help existing clients move to the future. In Global Business Services, we've been shifting resources and investing to drive growth in the strategic imperatives. The weakness in consulting, specifically around enterprise apps, is impacting our overall performance. In our Systems business, as I mentioned, we had strong performance in our z Systems and Power once again grew as we capture both the UNIX and Linux opportunity. The hardware decline was driven by storage, which continues to be a tough market. Software revenue performance was consistent with what we've seen over the past year, with growth across our solution areas of security, analytics and social offset by a headwind from operating systems and a decline in transactional revenue.
Our total margin improvement continues to be driven by a shift to higher value, primarily through portfolio actions and the relative strength of z Systems mitigated by investments and contract mix in our Services business. 
The reported operating expense and other income is down 12%. At this level of spend, our expense-to-revenue ratio was up 80 basis points. 
The expense dynamics have been very consistent all year. We're driving significant shifts within our large operational expense base, driving productivity and efficiency in some areas while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives. You'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we said we'd shift an incremental $4 billion of spend. That's across cost, expense and capital expenditures to our strategic imperatives, and we're on track to do that. 
The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture of System x. We also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and a lower amount of performance-based compensation. Nine points of the decline was driven by currency, between the translation of nondollar spending and the hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. Two points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. We'll wrap on this in the fourth quarter, but recall, we did have a gain associated with that transaction in the fourth quarter of last year. And in the third quarter, we took a charge for workforce rebalancing. With essentially no activity last year, this was up nearly $100 million year-to-year, contributing 2 points to expense growth. 
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue, which is up 1%. Our outsourcing business is based on long-term partnerships, where our clients entrust us with the most important elements of their business and look to us to deliver innovation to help them transform their enterprises. We've been reinventing our portfolio, providing the most modern IT services that connect our clients to the cloud-based mobile world and it's showing up in the business we're signing. For example, we recently signed a 10-year, $700 million agreement with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways to deliver a range of efficient technology, allowing the airline and its equity partners to transition their IT infrastructure into a globally integrated, hybrid cloud-based platform. Etihad Airways will use IBM's mobile solutions developed under the Apple-IBM alliance to provide enhanced mobile capabilities to its employees and guests. The agreement also includes plans for a new cloud data center in Abu Dhabi as well as a joint technology and innovation council to develop more personalized travel solutions. And earlier this month, we signed a $1 billion long-term partnership with EVRY, one of the leading IT services company in the Nordics. Using our innovative cloud technology and global scale, we'll provide a foundation for EVRY to build solutions that create business value and business outcomes for their customers. This allows EVRY to accelerate the ongoing transformation of their infrastructure business through access to hybrid cloud solutions based on our SoftLayer platform. These are examples of clients that chose to partner with IBM because they can move their operations into the future. We take over their IT systems and move them to cloud, while ensuring integration with their existing infrastructure. We make them more efficient and ultimately drive competitive advantages. Our capabilities and industry expertise give us the ability to address changes in their industry demand and help them compete in markets where data is the new natural resource. 
Looking at Integrated Technology Services. Revenue was up 4%, driven by our cloud solutions. SoftLayer grew strong double digits this quarter as we continue to increase our capacity. In September, we opened our second cloud data center in Brazil, which offers a full range of SoftLayer infrastructure services, including bare metal and virtual servers, storage, security services and networking. This past week, we just opened a cloud data center in India, as we continue to enable local companies to build in-country cloud solutions, and we're partnering with NASSCOM to create a platform for thousands of startups. 
Maintenance revenue grew 1%, with continued strength in our third-party hardware maintenance offerings, which allows clients to leverage our global reach and inventory capabilities. 
Our GTS margin improved quarter-to-quarter, but is down year-to-year, largely reflecting the investments we've been making. We continue to invest to bring the most contemporary offerings that are built with cloud, analytics, mobile, security and cognitive technologies, enabling us to transform our clients' enterprises. And we're investing to expand our global delivery and increase delivery efficiency through automation. This also requires that we continue to rebalance our workforce. And we took a charge in the quarter, essentially all of which is a year-to-year impact on profit. Finally, currency remains the largest year-to-year impact on profit growth given the strong dollar currency environment. 
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue of $4.2 billion is down 5%. Outsourcing was up, with growth in both process outsourcing and application outsourcing offset by a decline in consulting and systems integration. As we've talked about in the past, in the enterprise application space, we are seeing a shift away from traditional large ERP implementation projects to smaller initiatives that are built around cloud, mobility, security and analytics. We're continuing to grow in these high-value services, but we're still being impacted by larger contracts that are reaching their maturity. Our decline in Consulting and Systems Integration reflects this shift in market demand. 
In GBS, we had strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. Cloud and analytics services were both up double digits this quarter, and our mobile practice grew nearly 5x. Earlier this month, we launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to helping clients realize the transformative value of cognitive business. The new practice draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals who will help our clients leverage cognitive computing to unlock new possibilities for their business. 
Let me give you an example of where we already have work underway with 1 retailer. When you look back at history, they've been using data for a long time, but even the best retailers would forecast demand based on what happened in the prior year. They would look at what was sold, what season and at what price. Over time, these forecast models became more sophisticated and would include other variables, such as location and climate, various market differences. Accuracy improved as more historical data was built up, but insight was limited to what was able to be tracked and programmed into their IT systems. This worked in the past, but let's fast-forward to today, where much of the new data is unstructured and not able to be understood by traditional systems or traditional programming approaches. Companies that can somehow gain insights from this data will have a competitive advantage. Today, we're working with this client to build a cognitive solution that harnesses all this unstructured data. The solution will combine the client's internal data with all kinds of external, real-time data sources such as current weather patterns, local events and social commentary. We are laying the groundwork for a supply chain that can evaluate the immediate situation, sense anomalies and learn as it goes. This is the potential we're unlocking with our cognitive capabilities, integrating Watson, along with the data scientists and industry experts of the GBS cognitive practice. 
To further add to our GBS capabilities, at the end of September, we announced plans to acquire Meteorix, a premier Workday services partner. This will expand our reach as Meteorix has cultivated deep expertise and best practices for maximizing returns from these cloud-based HR applications. 
Our profit in GBS was down and reflects the market shift that I talked about earlier. In parts of our portfolio, where the market is declining, we're seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas into our high-value services around cloud and engagement, but we need to move faster. Workforce rebalancing charges are up modestly year-to-year as we continue to remix our skills to these strategic imperatives. We also remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models and enhancing our global capabilities. 
To wrap up on services, we've built capabilities to deliver the most contemporary offerings to our clients that transform their operations and help them become data-driven enterprises. You could see that in our consistent revenue growth in GTS and you can see that in our total services backlog, which again grew this quarter. 
Our Software revenue of $5.1 billion was down 3%, which is in line with the trajectory we have seen all year. When you look under the total, we continue to have a headwind from operating systems, which were down 7% in the quarter and our other middleware, which is also down. Revenue in our key branded middleware, which represents about 2/3 of the total, was down 1%. We've said in the past that many of our large clients are utilizing the flexibility we've provided in deployment of their software as they build out their environments. This is reflected in our results, with growth in our annuity revenue offset by a decline in transactional revenue. As I just mentioned, our Software revenue trajectory didn't change from the second to the third quarter, but we did have a slowdown in the transactional revenue at end of the quarter, predominantly in the U.S. 
This quarter, we again had growth across the Solution areas, including security, analytics and social. And within that, we saw strong growth in our software-as-a-service offerings. Security software grew at a double-digit rate. Our security solutions are built on the platform of intelligence, integration and expertise which, in the world of connected devices and an era of hybrid cloud, is a key differentiation that we bring to the marketplace. 
Our solutions are based on platforms, leveraging hybrid environments with an industry dimension. I'll give you an update on 2 of our platforms: Watson and Bluemix. Last quarter, I talked about how we're building an ecosystem around Watson. Today, I want to focus on how far along we've come on another dimension. When Watson played Jeopardy in 2011, Watson just did one service: question-and-answer, underpinned by 5 technologies, like machine learning and natural language processing. Today we have more than 25 different services or APIs underpinned by more than 50 different technologies like dialog framing, knowledge validation, voice synthesis, language modeling and visual analysis. As I discussed earlier, we're also bringing an industry dimension to the Watson platform, starting with Watson Health.
I'll comment also on progress in our Bluemix platform-as-a-service. The addition of StrongLoop helps developers connect enterprise apps to mobile, IoT and web applications in the cloud, and Compose expands cloud data services. Our Bluemix platform now offers over 130 IBM and third-party services. Security, reliability and scalability are important in this hybrid environment. And to address this, starting this month, Bluemix is now also available on premise behind our customer's firewall. Clients are taking advantage of our hybrid capabilities, connecting new cloud and mobile apps to their existing IT infrastructures. This year, we've added more than 1,000 new customers on our systems middleware like WebSphere, which is a reflection of the continued need for clients to support hybrid IT environments. 
When you look at our profit performance in Software, it's driven by the overall revenue trajectory and a higher level of investment in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impact from currency translation. 
Turning to our Systems Hardware segment. Revenue of $1.5 billion was down 2% driven by declines in Storage. 
This quarter, z Systems revenue was up 20%. Since the launch of z13 in the first quarter, we've delivered growth of over 40%. Building on the success of Linux on z Systems, in the third quarter, we introduced the LinusONE family of products, which embraces open source-based technologies that are the industry's most powerful and secure enterprise servers designed for the hybrid cloud environment. These innovations continue to resonate with our customers, and we continue to add new customers to the platform across several different industries and countries, including Japan, Australia, Singapore, Germany and the U.S. As we've contemporized the platform, many of our customers select Linux-based z Systems not only to consolidate existing systems to Linux on z to drive operational efficiency, but also to leverage scalability and security that these systems offer. 
Power revenue grew 2%, which is the third consecutive quarter of growth for the platform. This reflects the kind of revenue performance we would expect from Power in a product cycle year. We saw growth in both entry-level and the high-end systems, including strong growth and continued customer adoption in Linux-based systems. Our OpenPOWER initiative continues to progress as we both integrate innovation from the broader ecosystem into our own products and license IP to support third-party Power-based offerings. The announcement of our LC line of Power-based Linux servers and our recent collaboration agreement with GENCI, the high-performance computing agency in France, and our third such large high-performance computing national partnership, are 2 examples of how we're bringing innovation from OpenPOWER partnerships to IBM zone offerings. These Power results continue to reflect the progress we're making to transform the platform to align around data and cloud while embracing an open ecosystem. 
The growth in our high-end servers was more than offset by a double-digit decline in storage hardware driven by weakness in the high-end disk and tape. This market is shifting rapidly to flash where we again had very strong growth. 
When we set out this year, we saw leverage in the business through the z Systems and Power platforms. Our results confirm the progress we've made in the first 3 quarters, and our profit is up $600 million compared to the first 3 quarters of last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $3.5 billion of cash from operations, excluding our global financing receivables. We invested another $900 million in CapEx, with a good portion of our spend to build out cloud capacity. And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year-to-year. 
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow of $7 billion is up over $1 billion year-to-year. The primary drivers are lower tax payments and continued improvements in our sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our System x divestiture; payments for performance-based comp, which were accrued last year; and our year-to-year profit performance. 
Looking at uses of cash. We spent over $800 million on acquisitions. We've acquired 7 companies this year, including 2 in the third quarter, which further extend our cloud capabilities and industry expertise. In addition, Merge closed last week and we expect Cleversafe to close by the end of the year, so the spend will be included in our fourth quarter results. 
In the last 9 months, we've returned $7.5 billion to shareholders, with dividends of $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion in gross share repurchases to buy back over 24 million shares. Our share count at the end of September was 970 million shares and we had $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion, up over $1 billion from December and flat year-to-year. Total debt was $39.7 billion, of which $26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1. Our non-financing debt of $13.7 billion is $3.4 billion lower than a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 58%, a point lower than December and 3.5 points lower than last year. At these levels, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term. 
So now let me wrap up. When you look at our results through the first 3 quarters of this year, we've expanded margins on a fairly stable revenue base while we're reinventing our business. We've maintained high levels of investment as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives. We're creating new platforms and are building ecosystems, including Watson, Watson Health, SoftLayer and Bluemix. And we've been getting returns on our investments, with growth in the strategic imperatives over 30%. At the same time, the core is declining, in a declining market, as we deliver productivity to our clients so they can reinvest in the new areas. 
We've always said this takes time, especially because much of the new content is delivered as-a-service and our progression wouldn't be a straight line. But our execution over this sustained period is a proof point that we're on the right path. 
So let me come back to our view of the full year. When we look at the transformation we're driving, we've made a lot of progress, but the GBS transformation is taking longer, which is putting some pressure on revenue and profit. And we had weaker transaction performance at the end of the quarter which, when applied to the larger transaction base in the fourth quarter, has a more significant impact. At the same time, we're going to continue to put a lot of investment into the strategic imperatives where we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate the transformation. Taking all of this into consideration, we've updated our view of the year to $14.75 to $15.75. Let me put the low end in perspective. $14.75 not only reflects our transaction trajectory at the end of the quarter, but is also in line with the typical third quarter to fourth quarter skew, so we're comfortable at that $14.75 level. The change in our view of profit has less impact on free cash flow for the year as most of the transactions would occur late in the quarter anyway. And so we still expect free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year. 
Let me close at what remains constant. We certainly expect to continue strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We will continue to invest at a high level to drive our transformation while returning value to shareholders. And importantly, we're continuing to manage the business for the long term.

And I appreciate it's too early to give guidance, but what are some of the high-level gives and takes on free cash flow as you go into next year?",70

Thanks, Katy, a few things. As we noted in the call, because of the late nature, we don't expect it to have a profound impact in 2015. Now we'll see -- obviously, we have a range in our guidance, as you know, so we'll see where we finish. And if we were to start at a lower point in terms of transactional content coming out of 2015, then there would be an early year impact, I would call it. But at this point, as you said, it's a bit early to call guidance. And then we've got 12 months next year to figure out what the macro environment, what the sales cycle looks like. So it would be -- it is too early to decide if that has a meaningful impact on next year. And as we go to next year, then we also have a tax impact potentially next year. We're working through cash taxes now, so there may be a small cash tax impact. It is not the same magnitude as it was in 2014, but there may be a small cash tax impact. And then we have some things that are going our way. We've been quite efficient at improving our sales cycle working capital this year again, and we think there's some momentum there. We also will wrap on the divestiture of our System x business in the first half of next year, which was a headwind in this year's cash flow. So there are a few headwinds and tailwinds, which we'll be able to better describe as we get into next year. But it's too early to declare that this particular element is going to be an impact next year.",286

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642543.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,8,"It sounds like the message that you're providing to investors is the strategy of moving to higher value is correct, and that it will take time going forward. That said, it feels like you have been surprised, or the results would suggest that you've been surprised at the pace at which this stabilization and migration the business is taking. You've guided down 4 out of the last 5 quarters, and against an easier comp the last 2 quarters, your revenue has gotten fractionally weaker. So I wanted to get your perspective on why -- what has really been different from your forecast? And as we look forward, if I just think about 2016, you have currency hedges rolling off, you have very tough mainframe in Power comps because the product cycles this year. Your backlog is down $10 billion in nominal terms, which is what you have to deal with for next year. And you've stated that you're going to continue to aggressively invest. And so to the timing point, I guess, should we be thinking that things actually continue to get worse in the near term before they get better? And I guess, the question would be, why not? And what, if any, changes are you making?",209
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642544.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Okay. Well, I think I've gotten all the questions in. So let me try to address them, Toni, because there's a lot in there. Let me try to address them kind of piece by piece. So we put our guidance in place for 2015 back in January and we said that the trajectory, the difference between the high and the low is primarily the Software trajectory. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, when we came out of third, we -- given the trajectory, we would've said we're pointed right at that $15.75 level, but we did observe some longer sales cycle times, particularly in Software, which we think it's prudent to reflect that experience in our updated guidance, along with what we put in our prepared remarks around transitioning our GBS business into these new areas. By the way, that transformation, which I would characterize as well underway, is going well. It's just not going at the speed we'd like it to go, so we know we have to drive that a bit harder. When we get to next year, a few comments, I think, that's important. And you brought up currency, and I think currency is an important discussion. So we have, in the third quarter results, we have a pretty substantial headwind from -- in the revenue line and quite a substantial EPS impact in currency in the third quarter. And in fact, when we look at the fourth, there is still a significant impact in the fourth quarter in currency. So if we look at the high end and the low end of our guidance and just in the context of currency, at the low end of guidance, EPS at this level would be down 11%. And at the high end, it's down about 3%. The currency impact within that, in the low end, is about half of the year. And I'm going to put that now in context of next year because I think it's important. At the low end of guidance, we would actually be growing EPS, and that is as we transform the business and we've ramped up our investment. So yes, currency is clearly an impact. We don't know when the currency environment will be different. But as we head into next year, what's really important from a currency impact, yes, there will -- at least at this point, based on where the spots are today, there will be an additional impact because we will wrap on hedges. But importantly, we are not losing competitiveness in the marketplace because of currency. We have a global delivery platform that allows us to make sure we can be competitive in our services business, and we have a high-margin strategy which allows us to make sure we can be competitive in local marketplaces for our hardware and software. Now that translation impact or the effect of having that high value and being able to maintain your competitiveness is this issue around how it translates back to profit. And as I mentioned earlier, the impact this year is pretty profound, and I would expect that we'll have a currency impact next year that we'll start to talk about when we see where the spots are in January when we provide guidance. So in the context of, again, x currency -- or x currency, x divestitures, revenue is down about 1 for the year, so far, we'll see where we finish fourth quarter. Margins have been expanding. And again, we'll see where we are for the -- in the fourth. But I would expect margins will expand for the full year. And with the currency kind of defining anywhere from half to more than the year-to-year EPS decline, then I think this transformation is making very solid progress. And as you said, yes, the investments we're making are driving that strategic imperative growth, and we're pleased with those results and it's the right thing for us to do to keep these investment levels high.",669

I know you've been doing a lot of hiring and workforce rebalancing, and I know it's a people business. I'm just trying to get a sense of where we are at that, in that transition.",89

So it is -- as you said, it is a labor-based business. And it's important that everyone, I think, recognize that in a labor-based business, particularly when you have the kind of deep client relationships and you're doing the important kind of work that our clients rely on us, it's a business that takes time to shift. So when we look at that GBS business today, there is absolutely a high-value strategy for this business. And when we look at the strategic imperatives and we look at the margins we're getting on that part of the business in GBS, they are actually higher than the average GBS business. And as you know, we announced the creation of the first cognitive consulting group for the enterprise, and that's another example of us moving where we see tremendous amount of value. So we will transition this business. I don't know that I'd characterize where in the process we are. I can that within our guidance, at the low end, we've not assumed a dramatic improvement. And at the high end, we would assume that we make a bit more progress. But we're not counting or relying on a dramatic improvement in the GBS business at this level of guidance. But again, it is a business that where we've been, we get to the other side and we do see high value, it is a -- has a lot of appeal and, quite frankly, it's part of what differentiates us in the marketplace. We bring a lot of industry skill into our clients' environments and that's done through GBS. So we're going to keep driving that transformation. We're going to keep remixing those skills. We're going to keep that team focused on moving where the high value is, and again, cognitive, like I said, is a good example of that.",309

And also, I'm just curious, the weakness in the transactional business at the end of September, do you think that's more macro or -- that the industry will see or more IBM-specific?",60
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642550.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Sure, Brian, thanks. So a couple of things. And we've talked for the last year or so about the large client impact, if you will, within our transactional Software business. And remember, the transactional part of our Software business is only about 30% of the total, but it does have a profound impact on the trajectory of that business. And in the third quarter, as you saw, we printed down 3 for the segment. We were down 3 in the second, so no real change to the trajectory, and that's the way I'd characterize also that large client activity. No dramatic change in trajectory between second and third quarter. And the phenomena continues. We continue to provide our clients with flexibility for them to deploy the broadest possible part of the IBM portfolio, and I think that's the right thing to do. We think that's the right thing to do, and we think it's a way to keep our clients moving toward the future of hybrid. Within the month, if you will, I think we'll have to see how the quarter plays out. But there are, I think 2 important elements to keep in mind. One, enterprise technology, as you know, is a very complex area so our clients are dealing in very compact environments, and they're asking us to help them get to hybrid, which means we have to embed our as-a-service content into the structures they already have. And that includes not only the technical aspects of that, but there are business aspects to doing that as well, and how they can align their consumption patterns to the way we are able to contract with them. So there's complexity in the environment, that's a technology statement as well as a business statement. And unfortunately, or I guess, the reality is that not every one of those discussions aligns really, really well with a 90-day reporting period. And at the same time, the other thing to keep in mind is that every CIO, every enterprise is dealing with its own environment, and it would be too soon to tell how that plays out for the quarter. But I do think there is always a reality that our CIOs and others are dealing with around how they are navigating their own circumstances. So we'll see how the quarter plays out.",390

How much comes from maybe hardware, software, services? What the growth rates of those pieces might be?",33
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642553.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Steve, sure. A couple of things. So we had very good cloud performance again in our business. And now this is up 50% in the third quarter on trajectory, to be up more than 60% on a year-to-date basis. And when we look at the content that we're signing in the new deals, for instance, we just announced Etihad Airways, we just -- we saw that the elements of those, the things that Etihad is looking for us to do is bring them into the cloud. So a big component of that is that services element moving into the cloud. They're also asking, by the way, to help us build a mobile platform that will scale with them and have the global presence they need. And that's not dissimilar to what we're seeing in the Lufthansa contracts and the EVRY contract that we just signed. So within services, we're seeing very good performance. But as you know, not only do we have an as-a-service business that performed pretty well, we also do a lot of on-prem work, where our clients want the agility, if you will, of the cloud. But their economics suggest that they're better off if they build it themselves. And so we have a pretty big private cloud business and they build those on our hardware and our software content. So clearly, there is some element of the premier z platform and the Power platform that's sitting within that cloud business. But the hardware performance within the overall trajectory is not having a profound impact on the growth rates. It really is the Software business and the Services business that's driving the bulk of that growth.",279

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642555.0,Question,Keith Bachman,,Analysts,20,"I also wanted to drill down on the Software business. It seems like mix has gone against you in 2 ways. First, you have about 34% of your revenue wrapped up in operating systems and other, which is in secular decline. And also key branded middleware, which you said is a little over 2/3, even declined this quarter, 1% in constant currency. So I could -- I was hoping you could answer 2 questions. First is, as investors think about a decline of 3% in constant currency, is that the right frame of reference that investors should be thinking about as they look at calendar year '16? And as part of that, the second question would be, could you give us an update on where you are in terms of business model? In other words, IBM has traditionally been licensed in maintenance, and you talk about moving more to consumption or subscription-based model, but I would imagine that's is a very small part of your business and probably a headwind as we look out at future revenue growth and [indiscernible] a source of deceleration. Could you give us any percentages on where you are in terms of that business mix as it relates to your customers?",206
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2015",2015-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3651.0,877838.0,37642556.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Sure. So Keith, a few things. So first, we will, I think, address -- we should address operating systems. Operating systems are about a point headwind to us now. And quite frankly, I don't think that point headwind is going to go away in the near term. In fact, we have -- some of our models suggest it's sort of ever-present, if you will. So on a segment basis, I think we'll be dealing with a 1-point headwind from our operating system business. Now it will round up to a point, right now it rounds down to a point. So it's a bigger impact now than it will be. But I think it's safe to model that business as sort of an ongoing headwind. That's a pretty small part of the business, by the way. So if we take that part of the system -- of the Software out and we just talk about the recurring nature of the Software business, and as I mentioned earlier on a question, about 70% -- now that includes the operating systems -- but 70% of our operating business is that annuity kind structure. So think of it as our SaaS portfolio, which is showing terrific growth rates, but we got to drive more content into that SaaS platform. Now that's also, by the way, a newer kind of content for us, and so it's a new space. And so even though the GP in that area is a little bit lower than what we see in our on-prem business because it's net new content, it's accretive to our margins overall at the IBM level. So we've got a SaaS business that sits within that 70%. We have our monthly license charge business, which is the bulk of both our mainframe software as well as our distributed platform software. Remember, our Software runs across all platforms. And so we've got a pretty powerful monthly license charge business across our hardware platforms and others' hardware platforms that's really driving the bulk of the Software revenue. There is a subscription support part of this in the Software business as well. But you put those -- all those together, again, x operating systems because that is kind of a long-term headwind we see, the rest of those are all growing. That part of the business grows. And then on the transactional side, as we talked about -- with Brian a few moments ago, the large client transactional business is being impacted by the consumption, if you will, and the flexibility we're providing our clients. Outside the large clients, on a year-to-date basis, the transactional business is also growing. It's just that it's kind of overshadowed at this point by the larger transactional business. So as we move into '16, similar to the prior discussions on '16, we're a bit early to talk about where we're going to be here, but our Software business, I guess, I'd -- what we do know about the Software business is, one, small headwind from the operating systems. We know that our SaaS portfolio will both continue to grow and continue to expand, so that'll be a positive. And we know that we've got some momentum in other parts of the business across our MLC space and across on a year-to-date base. Again, getting Software into smaller clients, clients who haven't absorbed it all, I should say. So I think, they're -- again, we'll see where we go into 2016, but this is not a business that has the characteristics of some long secular decline in it. It's actually made up of a few pieces, only one of which, I think, has a long-term secular decline, and that's a small part. It's that operating system piece.",624

And it is one that we think about not from the perspective of size or scale because, as you know, we're not trying to be the largest of something. What we are, though, is trying to be the highest value. So as we move to value, that has -- that plays a large influence in how we think about deploying capital and where we think about putting our dollars to work. And so at this point, when we look at our businesses and the way they work together, I would argue that the world is moving more toward bringing solutions together in front of a client. The world is working -- moving more toward having industry expertise that can apply across a pretty broad platform. We see each of the elements that we have today bringing -- or adding to that context. And so even in businesses where we know we're in transition like our storage business, we said -- as we said in the prepared remarks, our storage business, our demand is moving to our flash products, which is terrific. It's the right thing to do for our clients. And our business is moving to the Software side of storage that's high value. And at the same time, while our acquisition of Cleversafe is really about the cloud, it will also help dramatically our storage business as we put object storage technologies into our storage business, so that makes that part of the business relevant to the way the world is going in cloud. The future storage is flash, it's Software and it's cloud-capable, if you will, which means object store. So what I didn't say in there was we want to be the biggest in storage, for instance, because we're again on a high-value model. And you can look now across our business and across our segments, and we do have that perspective of where do we think the value is going to be, not so much what's going to be the biggest element of that.",344

How much of that worsening in the rate of growth is down to pricing versus just macro weakness? And what are the prospects of that improving at any point in the future? Can you see a point at which that could possibly get out of this negative mid-single-digits rate that we're at now? And what would be the factors that would drive that? Or is it simply just a function of the kind of secular decline of that ERP price [ph] of business?",112

I think this is -- I think you just picked up coverage on us, so welcome to the call. On our GBS business, as I noted earlier, we do see where we're making the shift to those most contemporary areas and digitizing, for instance, our clients' front offices. We're seeing terrific results. Now they are overshadowed at this point by some of the price pressure we're seeing in other areas of the market. But it really is on us here to shift those resources as we can free them up from doing the work they're doing for our clients. This is not a business that is in long-term secular decline. This is a business that relies on us to drive the shift as quickly as possible. And I think when you have a business that is so powerful and our clients with such industry expertise, we -- that gives you 2 things: it gives you the visibility to how powerful that model can be, but it also says that it's going to take a little while. So some of this is clearly the pricing environment we're in. I don't think, though, that there's any reason we shouldn't be able to shift this business. And again, the results we see when we do shift are better margins, and we see a real ability to influence and to lead our clients into new areas. So those are a pretty powerful part of our overall model, and it really is up to us to keep driving that transformation. But it's a big labor-based business, so it's going to take some time.",275

I know you talked about that a little bit, but maybe be a little bit more specific in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape?

Thanks, Maynard. So on storage, I think this is the most we talked about storage, by the way, on this call in over a year, but I'm glad because this is an important part of the business and we see a lot of opportunity in storage. The storage environment and the pricing environment that we were noting in terms of pressure is really in that high-end spinning disk environment. So I don't see that changing dramatically given the industry landscape. In fact, our view has been and continues to be that the faster we can move to flash and the faster we can continue to build out our high-value Software-defined storage platforms, and we've had some pretty exciting announcements this year, as you know, the sooner we'll see a return to growth in storage. Now as I noted, the storage market is being -- is part of the cloud and part of the future of cloud, but it's got to be around object store because that plays such a critical role in the kinds of use cases that clouds are using. So we'll take, as I mentioned, the Cleversafe technologies and embed it within our storage. So when we look at the future of the storage business, we see terrific growth in flash, up again more than 50% in each of the last 3 quarters, so all this year. We introduced, as I mentioned, Spectrum software, which is around our software storage products. And we've also announced intentions to continue to invest and drive our investment where we're seeing those returns, and those look quite positive. And then as I mentioned, the other part of our strategy here is to be -- have a more cloud-based offering. And that means hybrid and that for us means Cleversafe and embedding our object store. So a lot of price pressure in the spinning disk business but there is a future in storage and it's all about flash, it's all about Software-defined and it's all about object store.",336

You cut out at the end, but I'll answer what I think you asked. So first of all, boy, I'd love to assume a static currency environment. I'd be thrilled. Now we know that's not true, so we know that we're going to be facing a currency headwind over the next -- over at least the next 9, 10 months. But that wasn't your question. Your question was around how do we wrap and what do we look like -- how do we wrap on the mainframe and what do we look like when we come out of the next few quarters? And I think a few things. We'll have to see how the year plays out in terms of what eventuates from this weaker transactional performance we saw right at the end of the quarter. It's too soon at this point to determine if this is something that is going to persist all the way through the fourth or it's going to persist into the first. We don't know, that's why we gave a range, by the way. Because as we head into the fourth quarter which is, as you know, our largest transactional quarter, that phenomena against a much larger transactional quarter says it's prudent to guide the way we did. Now we will wrap on a mainframe cycle at some point, but the mainframe cycle is not going to have a profound impact on the overall IBM. It does have -- obviously, it does provide a good bit of revenue tailwind when we're in that cycle. But remember that the margins start to expand in the mainframe business as we get toward the later parts of the cycle. So we'll see how we put together 2016 based on how we come out of this year. But our guidance right now reflects, at the low end, a slowdown, if you will, on the revenue trajectory on a year-to-year basis. And the high end reflects a slight improvement so -- in the trajectory. So again, too soon to tell how this plays out for next year.
Let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as we've been talking about on these calls frequently, we are going through a significant transformation. And where we've been investing, we've been driving tremendous growth. And that obviously gives us tremendous confidence that the strategy is right, the offerings we're delivering into that marketplace are right on and resonating with customers, and we're seeing the returns. Now as everyone knows, some of the investments we're making have much longer tails. So we're investing heavily in Watson. We're investing heavily in Watson Health. Those returns aren't even in our revenue streams yet, but they are the right things to do because those have tremendous futures to them. Within the current transformation, though, we're also improving margins as we continue to manage the portfolio. And we're expanding margins on what year-to-date has been a fairly stable revenue base. And that also includes some pretty aggressive investments that we think is important to drive. And as I mentioned, we're seeing the results so we want to keep driving those investments. And -- but we also did say from the beginning of this that it would take time and we also said we're going to manage for the long term, and we're confident in our strategy and we're confident we're on track to get to that long-term trajectory. So thanks, again, for joining us today.",590
