112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2010",2010-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,8100.0,46210.0,3523607.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,3,"Thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped off a great year for IBM, driven by continued margin expansion, profit growth and cash generation, all in an uncertain environment. Let me start out by sharing a few financial highlights.In Systems, we had substantial share gains in POWER four points, System x three points, Blades six points and Storage one point. In Software, we had share gains at WebSphere, Tivoli and Key Branded Middleware. And in Services, we brought $18.8 billion of Services signings and $57 billion for the year.In 2009, outsourcing signings were up 9% or 11% at constant currency. Once again, we had great profit and margin performance. This quarter, PTI grew 10%. We expanded margin and grew pretax profit in every segment. As we indicated in October, we had double-digit profit growth in Systems and Technology, up 15%.For the year, PTI margin was up 2.8 points, led by Services, up over two points; Software, up over five points; and Financing, up over six points. When you put this all together, we delivered EPS of $3.59 which is up 10% and $10.01 for the year, up 13%, making this our seventh consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.Now let me give you another perspective on 2009 EPS. In May 2007, we established our roadmap with an EPS objective for 2010 of $10 to $11, and with EPS of $10.01 in 2009. Despite a challenging economy, we got there one year early. In 2010, we expect to deliver our eighth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, or at least $11 of earnings per share for the year with consistent EPS growth throughout the year.For the first quarter, we expect a four- to five-point improvement in IBM's year-to-year revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter at both actual rates and constant currency. This would result in mid single-digit revenue growth at actual rates, with Software posting double-digit growth. We are confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margins, grow profit, generate cash, return value to shareholders and return to revenue growth of 2010.Now before moving on to details of the quarter, I want to take a step back and talk about our performance over the long-term. You can see that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since the last recession in 2002. So let's look at what we've accomplished recession to recession.Since 2002, we've added $12 billion to our pretax profit base. Our pretax margin is up 2.5 times, our EPS is up four times. And cumulatively, we generated about $80 billion of free cash flow. This is the result of a dramatic transformation we started at the beginning of this decade. It is driven by a combination of shifting our business mix, improving operating leverage to productivity and investing to capture growth opportunities. Let's take a look at these three initiatives.First, we've been remixing our business to move to higher value areas. We exited commoditizing businesses while at the same time acquiring 108 companies since 2000 for a total of almost $22 billion. This portfolio actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of businesses. In 2000, Services segment PTI was $4.5 billion and in 2009, it's over $8 billion.Our Software profit growth is even more impressive. In 2000, Software segment PTI was 2.8 billion. And in 2009, it's also over $8 billion. That's almost tripled. In 2009, over 90% of our segment profit came from Software, Services and Financing. With Software and Services, each contributing 42% of our segment PTI. The unique portfolio businesses we built heavily weighted towards Software and Services, generates high profitability and we'll continue to remix [ph] to higher value through organic investments and acquisitions.Second, we had an ongoing focus on driving operating leverage through productivity. We are leveraging our scale and global footprint to improve processes and productivity in a number of areas like support functions and service delivery. In 2009, we yielded $3.7 billion of cost and expense savings from our structural actions we've taken. Along with mix, these helped drive our 1.7 point improvement in gross margin and 9% reduction in operational expense for the year. These actions are reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance points. This will provide a real advantage as the expanding [ph] environment improves, with solid operating leverage off of our now leaner cost base.Third, our strong margins and profitability enable us to make significant investments for growth. We have been investing to capture the opportunity in the emerging markets, as these countries build out their public and private infrastructures. In 2009, while the economic environment flow globally, our revenue growth in the growth markets remained eight point faster than the majors. We've been investing in capabilities that differentiate IBM and accelerate the development of new market opportunity, areas like Business Analytics and Cloud Computing and Smarter Planet.In 2009, we invested almost $6 billion in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership. Lastly, we announced that for the 17th consecutive year, we were number one in U.S. patents with over 4,900 in 2009. That is more than the total for Microsoft, HP, Oracle, Apple, Accenture and Google combined. And consistent with our shift in business mix, about 70% of our patent portfolio is for Software and Services.We've complemented our organic investments with acquisitions. And one of our primary investment areas is Business Analytics, which provides a solid platform for our Smarter Planet initiatives. Since 2005, we've invested $10 billion or $8.5 billion net in 14 strategic acquisitions to build our Business Analytics capability. These acquisitions delivered strong results in 2009, generating 9% revenue growth at constant currency.So over the last decade, we have driven a significant transformation of our business. And we will continue to shift to higher value areas, improve efficiency of the business and invest where we see the best long-term opportunities. All of this, positions us for growth as we move into 2010.Now I'll turn to the detailed financial results for the fourth quarter. I'll start with a quick walk on the P&L for the quarter. Our revenue was $27.2 billion, that's up 1% year-to-year and down 5% at constant currency. With continued strong margin performance, we increased pretax income by 10% and net income by 9%. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points due to better margins in Services and Systems. Our expense was better by 5% year-to-year, driven by actions we've taken to continue to transform and globalize the business and focus expense management.Pretax margin was up 1.9 points year-to-year to 23.4%. With an increase in our tax rate year-to-year, net income margin expanded 1.3 points to 17.7%. And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year-to-year, though it was up sequentially due to increased dilution because of the higher stock price. So bottom line, we delivered $3.59 of earnings per share, up 10% from a year ago. And I'll remind you, that we had 18% EPS growth in the fourth quarter of last year. So this is double-digit growth off a very strong base.The balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our strategy. Our liquidity position remains strong. We've finished the year with $14 billion of cash on hand. Now let me get into the fourth quarter detail starting with revenue by geography.In discussing the geo results as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. The major market growth was consistent with the last couple of quarters. In the fourth quarter, U.K. had solid growth. And sequentially, we improved performance in Canada and Japan. The growth markets once again outpaced the major markets in the fourth quarter by nine points of revenue growth. For the year, the growth markets grew eight points faster, and contributed 19% of IBM's geographic revenue. This quarter, the BRIC countries were up 7% driven by growth in India, Brazil and China. And for the full year, China grew 10%.In China, we're leveraging our broad portfolio to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Recently, we announced one of the largest and most comprehensive Consulting engagements to date in China, while we're helping to build smart eco cities across the country. We see growing opportunity around the world, much of which is outside the traditional IT opportunity to help our client drive efficiency in their physical infrastructures.Turning to the results by segment. I'll get into the specifics within each of the segment's discussions. But let me give you a snapshot of the revenue and growth profit performance. Our total Services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with third quarter. And we had year-to-year growth in both signings and backlog. In Software, we gained share in Key Branded Middleware. We had a number of transactions that didn't close this quarter, and we're entering the first quarter with a very strong pipeline.Systems and Technology year-to-year growth improved again in the fourth quarter, with share gains in most brands and particular strength in System x. Across all of our segments, we had great margin performance. Our productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our growth margin over time. This is the 21st quarter of the last 22 that we've expanded our gross margin. Now that's quite a streak. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense in spending profile.Our total expense and other income was down 5%. And our expense to revenue ratio improved 1.5 points year-to-year. The expense reduction was driven entirely by operational expense, which improved 15 points year-to-year. Mitigating this improvement, currency impacted expense growth by nine points and acquisitions by one point. We've been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale in our global footprints. We focused on all areas of the business. And this year, we yielded $3.7 billion of costs and expense savings from a number of initiatives, such as the globalization of our support function and rebalancing our workforce. These actions reduced our cost base to make it more variable, a lower level of fixed cost improve our operational balance point. So as we returned to growth, we'll get better operating leverage off of our cost base.To close out the discussion on spending, as always I'll lay out the roadmap of items that have significant year-to-year impact to our profit. First, accounts receivable provision was better by about $70 million year-to-year, driven by a lower level of addition versus last year. Our reserve coverage is flat year-to-year at 2%. Second, we had a year-to-year benefit of about $80 million from investment transactions, driven by a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to an investment in a joint venture.Third, consistent with what we told you in October, we had workforce rebalancing charges of about $100 million in the quarter, virtually all of it in Europe. These charges are down $340 million from last year's fourth quarter. Impacting profit growth, our retirement related plans were worth by $100 million in the fourth quarter. As we described last quarter, we had a one-time curtailment gain associated with a non-U.S. plan of about $120 million. We also had an unprecedented regulatory charge in Germany. Let me explain.Companies with German pension plans are subject to mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage. In the fourth quarter, we received notification of a significant premium increase due to the level of insolvencies of other companies in Germany in 2009. This does not relate to the IBM plan, it's other companies plan in Germany. This premium increase resulted in an annual charge of almost $140 million, a year-to-year impact of $120 million in the quarter. So the cash impact will be spread over five years. So this quarter, we had a large gain and an unanticipated offsetting charge in our retirement related costs, neither of which is related to our operational performance.For the full year 2009, retirement related plans including this insolvency insurance charge cost about $1.4 billion. This is relatively flat versus 2008. Let me comment on the performance of our pension plan.In the U.S. plan, return on assets was up 11% for the year. Our non-U.S. plans which comprise about 40% of our assets, in aggregate, were up 14%. So globally, our pension plans were up 12% for the year.Looking forward, we will hold our expected U.S. long-term return assumption at 8%. And we'll take our discount rate down to 5.6%, reflecting the current interest rate environment. In 2010, with these assumptions together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumption, we expect retirement-related cost expense at $1.5 billion, a year-to-year increase of almost $100 million.From a funding perspective, we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plan of $82 billion. Our U.S. plan is fully funded. And globally, our qualified plan are 99% funded. So we've made great progress in the year. I'll comment on two other items.The year-to-year change in currencies, our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in fourth quarter 2009 as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact in the fourth quarter was over $430 million, which is roughly half in expense and half in cost of goods sold. Our tax rate was 24.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points year-to-year. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was 26%. And for 2010, we expect the tax rate in the range of 26% to 26.5%, still fairly consistent on a year-to-year basis.Now let's turn to our segment margins. This is a snapshot of both growth in pretax margin by segment and as you can see, the improvement is broad-based. Our PTI margin improvement of 1.9 points was led by Systems and Technology, up 2.6 points, Software, up 2.4 points and Global Financing, up 4.5 points. I'll comment briefly on our Global Financing business.We are emerging from a challenging credit environment with strong financial results in Global Financing. Our Financing business remain focused on core competencies, providing IT Financing for our IBM customers and business partners, and deliver both gross profit margin and PTI margin expansion this quarter. And we ended the year with a return on equity of 34%. Now let's turn to the segment starting with Services.In the fourth quarter, the two Services segments delivered strong margin performance and good growth in outsourcing signings to cap off a very strong year. For the full year, the combined Services business delivered $8.1 billion in pretax income, up 11% year-to-year. Pretax margin was up 2.3 points to 14.1%. This improved margin was the result of the structural changes we've made to service delivery over the past several years. The global delivery capabilities we've built proved to be dynamic and flexible enough to deal with very tough market conditions.Our backlog at the end of the year was $137 billion, up $7 billion year-to-year and over $2 billion sequentially. We delivered $57 billion in new Services business with outsourcing signings up 11% at constant currency for the year. Outsourcing signings growth was broad based. We grew across all major geographies, the Americas, Europe and Asia. And we grew in each of our outsourcing category, strategic outsourcing, business transformation outsourcing and applications outsourcing. Overall, we have very strong margin and signings performance in what was a difficult economic climate.Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Our Services segment delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 2% at actual rate but down 5% at constant currency. Total signings were $18.8 billion, up 9% at actual rates or 2% at constant currency. Within that, total outsourcing signings were up 15% at actual rate and 8% at constant currency. And we signed 22 deals greater than $100 million. Now I'll go to the key drivers of performance in the two Services segments.In Global Technology Services, total GTS signings were up 3% at actual rates but down 4% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 5% at actual rate, down 1% at constant currency. For the year, GTS outsourcing signings at constant currency was up 8%, with major markets at 7% and growth market, up 14%. Integrated Technology Services signings continued to be impacted by client deferrals and capital constraints. However, we have seen stability in the past two quarters in smaller transactions under $5 million.Global Technology Services revenue in the quarter was $10.1 billion, up 4% at actual rates or down 3% at constant currency. Revenue trends in outsourcing should improve in 2010 as we start to see the benefits of 2009 signings.In Integrated Technology Services, revenue performance largely reflects signings performance, which continued to be impacted by declines in OEM as we shift our portfolio to higher value offerings. Global Technology Services improved gross margins nearly a point and pretax margin 60 basis points to 15%.  For the full year, Global Technology Services gross profit margins expanded in all lines of business and total pretax margin was up three points.In Strategic Outsourcing, we have improved gross margin for five consecutive years while improving overall service delivery quality. We have accomplished this through a disciplined and innovative approach to delivery, focus on both labor and non-labor productivity actions. As you know, we've been executing a strategy to deliver services out of key Global Delivery Centers. Using consistent Global Delivery methods and processes. We're continuing to expand our capability with new centers in Dubuque, Iowa; Cairo, Egypt and Wroclaw, Poland. We are also improving labor utilization with analytics and by applying supply chain tools and techniques to our labor base.In Integrated Technology Services, we improved margin by mixing towards more profitable labor-based services. And in business transformation outsourcing, to improve the reflectivity and delivery performance.Turning to Global Business Services, signings were up 20% at actual rates and 13% at constant currency. Application Outsourcing signings were up 65% at actual rate, 55% at constant currency and for the full year, signings were up 25% at constant currency. This performance illustrates the strong value proposition that Application Outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost savings.Consulting and Systems Integration signings were up 3% at actual rate, down 3% at constant currency, a significant improvement over third quarter. This quarter, small deal performance improved as the quarter progressed. Journal business and Distribution sector grew, and the growth market were up 34% at constant currency.Global Business Services revenue was down 3% at actual rate, 9% at constant currency while pretax margin improved 1.1 point to 16%. This was a record level of pretax margin, driven by strong utilization in our delivery centers, good subcontract resource management and spending management.Throughout the year, this dynamic delivery model has enabled us to perform well in a tough economic climate. In this quarter, we saw some of the leverage our delivery model can provide with profit growth on lower revenue. Overall, we feel encouraged about the business as we saw improving trends in revenue, margin and signings.So our two Services segments did a good job in delivering value and managing margin in a very challenging year. We believe that our dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities are paying off. It's what enabled us to deliver on our profit objective of $8 billion for the year. And we are well-positioned heading into 2010, with double-digit outsourcing growth in 2009, backlog of $137 billion, improving trends in Global Business Services and a delivery structure that has enabled us to perform exceptionally well in a tough environment.Turning to Software, revenue of $6.6 billion was up 2% year-over-year, down 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware grew 6% and was flat at constant currency. Branded Middleware gained share for the ninth-straight quarter, as we continued to solidify our lead in the Middleware market. In fact, it represented 63% of our Software revenue in the quarter, that's up two points year-to-year.Software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin up 2.4 points year-to-year to 41.5%. And for the full year, we delivered 14% profit growth in Software and expanded margins by five points. Software delivered over $8 billion of pretax income, nearly tripled the profit in 2000.Now let me take you to the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter, growing 13% or 6% at constant currency and gained share. Business Process Management, Commerce and DataPower product segments all grew double digits. ILOG which drives business rules management did very well again this quarter and contributed to WebSphere growth.Information Management Software was up 7% or 1% at constant currency and held share. Business analytics continues to be a key growth area, Cognos posted strong double-digit growth and gained share providing a proof point on analytics demand in the markets. IBM's acquisition of SPSS further strengthened our Business Analytics and Optimization strategy by delivering predictive analytics capability that help customers drive better business outcome.InfoSphere warehouse which helps our customers turn information into a strategic asset, also grew double digits. Tivoli grew 7% or 1% at constant currency and gained share. Enterprise Asset Management, which is part of IBM's Smarter Planet strategy, grew over 40% in emerging markets. Tivoli Storage continued its robust growth as customers managed their rapidly growing storage data. Data protection as well as Storage management grew double digits, with broad-based geography and sector growth.Lotus software declined 5% or 11% at constant currency. Rational declined 4% or 10% at constant currency and held share. Other software faced a difficult compare against the very strong fourth quarter of last year, we saw a continued strength in the demand for software in the growth market. Strong growth from our recent acquisition and an increase in the volume of small deal activity in North America. So all very encouraging signs. There were a number of large deals however, that did not close during the fourth quarter and have contributed to a very strong first quarter opening pipeline. And consequently, we expect Software to grow revenue double-digits at actual rates in the first quarter.Systems and Technology revenue was $5.2 billion, down 4% at actual rates and 9% at constant currency. While our revenue performance bottomed in the second quarter of 2009, the rate of year-to-year decline have sequentially improved in each of the past two quarters. We had strong growth in System x and Blades and improved performance in micro electronics. We gained share in System p, System x, Blade and both Disk and paid [ph] Storage. Gross profit margins improved year-to-year in all brands. And for Systems and Technology in total, this quarter marks the highest gross profit margin for this business since fourth quarter of 2007. Driven by improvements in our System x Server business and Converged p.And bottom line, Systems and Technology pretax profit grew 15% year-to-year in the fourth quarter.System z revenue declined 27% year-to-year. MIPS declined 19% in the fourth quarter. Over the past two years, MIPS grew 4% compounded. This is consistent with what we would expect at this point in the product cycle. Later this year, we are releasing the next generation System z. Converged System p revenue declined 14% year-to-year and gained four points of market share. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of market share gain. System p has gained share in 10 of the last 12 quarters. In the fourth quarter, our success with competitive units displacements continues, with almost 200 competitive wins totaling $200 million in the quarter. For the year, we had over 500 competitive wins, which generated sales of over $600 million.Later this quarter, we'll introduce the next generation POWER system, which will deliver two to three times the performance in the same energy envelope, so quite an announcement for this product line. System x server revenues grew 37% year-to-year, taking three points of share. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance. Total System x Blades grew 56% year-to-year and we expect to gain six points of share in Blades. Storage revenue grew 1% year-to-year but were down 4% at constant currency. This grew 6% in gain share. This growth was driven by strong growth in mid range and XIV. In fact we added more than 130 new customers to our XIV platform in the fourth quarter and 400 since the acquisition.Tape declined 10% but gained share again in the fourth quarter. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 2% year-to-year. Our 300-millimeter fab is near full utilization and our 45-nanometer process output was sold out again this quarter. Systems and Technology closed out 2009 with improving year-to-year revenue dynamics, gross margin improvements in every brand and pre-tax income growth of 15% year-to-year and a margin of 15.4%, up 2.6 points year-to-year. Quite a performance for our Hardware business.Turning to our cash performance, we generated $7.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down $600 million year-to-year. For the year, our free cash flow was up $800 million to $15.1 billion. This is our seventh consecutive year of free cash flow growth. The year-to-year improvement was driven by growth in net income, higher cash from sales cycle working capital and lower CapEx. This was mitigated by higher retirement-related payments. When I look at uses of cash for the year, we reduced our debt by $7.5 billion and we returned $10.3 billion to shareholders. $2.9 billion of this was through dividends and we bought back almost 69 million shares for $7.4 billion, including $3.1 billion this quarter. At the end of the year, we had $6.1 billion remaining from our last Board authorization.Turning to the balance sheet, we finished 2009 with a substantial cash balance of $14 billion. Cash is up $2.5 billion from September and $1 billion from last December. Our strong free cash flow enabled us to add to our cash balance while reducing our debt by almost $8 billion from last year. Our total debt balance is now $26.1 billion. Of this, $22.4 billion is in support of our Global Financing segment, which is leveraged at 7.1:1. So our non-financing debt was $3.7 billion, down almost $6 billion from a year ago. As a result of the debt reduction and growth in equity, our non-financing debt-to-cap is now 16%.The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long-term.I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings-per-share performance. This quarter, revenue growth contributed to our earnings growth. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity, which together contributed $0.30 of the $0.32 of EPS growth. We also had a modest benefit from share repurchases but it was offset by a higher tax rate.For the year, you can see the benefit of the shift to higher value areas and focus on driving efficiency in the spending base, as margin expansion and expense productivity by far were the largest contributors to our earnings growth. Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed another $0.34 and tax rate provided a very modest help of only $0.03.All in, we delivered EPS of $10.01, our seventh consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. This was a great year in a tough environment. All a result of the strategic transformation of our business. We've been shifting to higher value businesses. This better positions us to meet client needs and drives a more profitable mix. In 2009, Software and Services each contributed 42% of our segment profit.We've also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency. Our ongoing productivity initiatives have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point, generating more profit from each dollar of revenue. With a spend base of almost $80 billion, we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more efficient. This operating leverage will provide a real advantage as revenue performance improves in 2010.We're using our strong profit and cash base to drive the significant investment needed to expand our base of opportunity, both organically and through acquisitions. We're positioned to capture the secular growth opportunity in the emerging markets and we're investing in areas like our Smarter Planet solution, Business Analytics and new compute models such as Cloud Computing.In addition to supporting investments and growth initiatives and acquisitions, our great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to return capital to shareholders. This year, we spent over $10 billion on share repurchases and dividends, and increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year. Bottom line, the changes to the company have allowed us to deliver strong performance since 2002, and even over the last two years in a tough environment. But more importantly, the transformation has positioned us to come out even stronger in 2010. And as I said earlier, for the full year, we expect EPS of at least $11 for the year.Now Patricia and I will take your questions.",4795

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2010",2010-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,8100.0,46210.0,3523611.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,7,"Let me put this in context. As we go into 2010, we should go back and look at the overall roadmap for 2010 because frankly, the progress that we anticipated making in EPS is going to be very similar to the rollout and the balance that we had in that original roadmap. Now just to go back and review that, it had an element of our typical revenue growth, our margin expansion actions, our share repurchase actions, our investment in growth, our acquisition focus and then lastly, [indiscernible] pension. But I would contrast 2010 to 2009. In 2009, working through a recession, as much pressure as we had on the revenue line, it really required us to overweight the contribution for margin. And you saw the actions that we put together to do that when we took out $3.7 billion of spend. We achieved some very strong margin performance across our business lines, but if you look at 2010, I would contrast it. Will we still have margin expansion? Absolutely, consistent with our overall roadmap, but I don't think it's going to be overweighted to margin as it was in 2009. In 2010, it should be a more balanced performance on revenue performance at new products and a more stable economic environment. You saw that, as we described improving our growth rate from fourth quarter to first quarter, between four and five points both at constant currency and at actual rates. You'll see that ongoing focus and contribution from margin. Now let's face it, as we get to better revenue performance, that revenue could now take advantage of the improved leverage in our business, as we've been able to take on the spend out as a matter of efficiencies. In addition, we're always driving tools and content to drive that efficiency, profit proficiency, standardization, tools and analytics. And if you look at the first quarter, we'll have a gain from the sale of our PLM business, offset by a charge, predominantly in Europe and Asia for productivity actions. So those will continue to drive our margin performance. Then in addition, still very focused on share repurchase and on share repurchases, contrasted a little. Remember that we closed out last year with a fairly high core debt-to-cap at 49%. So we were relatively cautious I think, conservative during the end share purchase, [ph] Well now we enter our 2010, they're recovering those pension funds. So now, our core debt-to-cap is at a very, very conservative 16%. So share repurchase is still [indiscernible] out. You got to admit, share price is higher, we'll still have a lot of dilution at that share point price, but we'll still have good contribution from share repurchase. But I'm most interested to see the momentum that we picked up from our growth investments. Our investments at Smarter Planet and Business Analytics, and Cloud Computing and the contribution that we did from those, as well as the ongoing performance in our acquisitions, and this is on a per quarter acquisitions, performed very well, very well. So again, the way I would look at it, Richard, is that in 2010, we should see a more balanced contribution to our EPS growth from all of the elements of the overall roadmap, as opposed to 2009 where it was overweighted on margin, given the recessionary end. Now when you look at the segment that has the most room for further structural margins content, they'll all benefit from the structural actions that we're taking across the board in the corporation. And I would say, as you look at overall margin, though we have had very good growth profit margin, I'm very encouraged by the last 22 quarters, I think we have expanded the gross profit margin, 21 of those 22. We're still not in that top quartile of margin performance through the S&P 500 or the Tech Universe [ph] of the top 330 companies. So IBM should be -- our objective should be set to firmly engage in that top quartile.",670

Last quarter, you grew at minus 5% at constant currency. But the comparison was actually easier this quarter. So given what appears to be from your commentary an improving economic environment, were you surprised you didn't see better revenue growth. And I know you called out from Software deals not closing, maybe you can dimension how significant that was in the quarter? And whether there were other reasons why maybe we didn't see better revenue growth in light of a modestly easier compare year-over-year and an improving demand environment?",100

And that smaller deals across our Hardware business, our Software businesses, our Services business, both in major markets and GMU, in our growth markets. Number one, smaller deals are a significant portion of our revenue stream but what we have seen in smaller deals, they've been more characteristic of a leading indicator. So as we enter the recession, those smaller deals produced a portion of the revenue more aggressively and we see them coming back, especially as it went into the end of the quarter. But what was interesting about it, it was across our business units, as well as with our major markets and growth markets. So with that stronger, small-deal performance entering the first quarter, that gives us a level of confidence.  Secondly, we did literally have a lot of large deals that were fairly well progressed in the fourth, rollover to the first quarter, especially in our Software business. That's why Software, at actual rates, we see in the kind of double digit level of performance as we go into the first quarter. And then additionally, we've seen this trend through the year in our Hardware base business, after we kind of bottomed out in the second quarter, that rose of growth rate, improved every quarter as we went from third quarter to fourth quarter and with our new announcements that we see in pSeries in the first quarter, we think that should also help improve that level of performance. So you put all those together, as well as all the work that the teams and the general management has done on their pipeline and their deals, and that's why we felt pretty confident that we should be able to improve the relative growth rate by four to five points, as we go from fourth quarter performance to first quarter performance, both at constant currency and actual rate. Then that would put us at actual rate kind of a mid-single digit level of growth.",357

You said you have more leverage in your OpEx given things you've done and you have room for a buyback and your pension expense is in line with where you said it would be. So I guess my question is, are you just being conservative or is there anything out there with the economy or anything else from the P&L that keeps you conservative? And that hedging loss, maybe year-over-year was the big number that kind of surprised me at the $430 million, maybe that's the hit in upcoming quarters? Are you being conservative? If you can just go through that?",134

I think that's a pretty strong statement. And so, to those who come off this early and peg that, I think it's pretty strong. Obviously, if the revenue performance turns out to be stronger than what we are looking at now, then we should have upside to that number. Now frankly, as we look at that, I pegged the $11, the at least $11, and I remind everybody that's an at least number, but I pegged that at least number, a kind of flat constant currency performance for the year. If it would be better than that, then we'd certainly have upside. And on that base, we do see some encouraging signs in our business but frankly, our indicators are best on that 90-day framework. So I'd like to get into the first quarter and get a little more validation that this is an ongoing recovery before we take this up further than we have. I think 10% growth, in what would be our eighth consecutive year, coming in at the very high-end of the road map that we set for 2010, I think that's a pretty strong position.",230

Within that, it had strength in the growth markets. We saw that clients within Financial Services actually [ph] continue to focus on cost reduction, capital climates, risk and compliance, so that, that was very consistent. Distribution likewise was consistent, though you got to look at it and Distribution has now improved for two quarters in a row. And frankly, underneath that the retail industry returned to growth for the first time in seven quarters. But as you said, you look at Public Sector and Public Sector had the strongest performance though in the quarter, and for the year, Public Sector was up by 4%. If you look underneath that, in the quarter where it grows in Healthcare and Life Sciences that mark the 11th consecutive quarter of growth there. Growth and growth markets across all industries, as well as government, where we continue to focus on solutions that will reduce cost. So as I look at it going into 2010, that kind of map to the value propositions that we are putting on the table. And within each of these sectors, I can tell you, with the CFOs and client meetings that I have, they're very interested in this transformation capability for their business and the benefit that clear business analytics kind of provide there. And within Public Sector, across major cities, the advantages of Smarter Planet.

David, that's been a part of the 2010 road map and that should continue. So we're going to see good cost and expense productivity now. It's not going to be at that level of $3.7 billion spent take out that we saw last year. The dollars that we're investing to try that are more focused on Europe and Asia. But we're going to have group spend takeout. And it's going to be complemented this year by, I believe, better revenue performance that will capitalize on the improve leverage we have in the business. So those two together should, I think puts us in pretty good shape as we continue to drive our margin performance.",137

And where our factories are much better loaded as we go into 2010. I think the important part of the overall Hardware performance is number one, that year-to-year growth rate has improved every quarter since we bought about in the second quarter, very strong performance across some elements like xSeries. And I think we're seeing some of the effect of the overall product cycle in our businesses as we enter 2010, where  we'll have new announcements in the zSeries and new announcements in pSeries. So I think what we saw was an improving level of performance. And within that characteristics, more driven by our position in the product cycle.

And that was characteristic for both sides of the business. I'd also say you look at major markets, major market signings, deals, very focused on cost take up capital conservation, transformation. But GMU markets, still very focused on big infrastructure plays. And we saw some really strong deals in that GMU content. So as we go in to the first quarter, recognizing that the fourth quarter, we had in our total signings 2% growth, constant currency 9% at actual rates. And as we look at the first quarter in total, I think we could be a little stronger than that but that the trend underneath it is improving performance on a year-to-year basis in our short-term deals and long-term deals continue to an ongoing growth.",164

Now we do see major market performance improving as we go into the first quarter and we did a very strong performance in the U.K., and some sequential performance in the areas. I thought it was a fairly tight band around that. The thing you've clearly saw though, is the difference between major market performance and growth market performance actually expanded in the quarter to about a nine-point differential. And when we look underneath it, I thought we had a pretty good performance in Brazil, India, China, all in that mid- to high-single digit. But the element that really stabilized underneath that is Russia, came in at relatively flat performance, and Russia has actually been declining for the first three quarters of the year, given the concentration on the raw materials. Russia did better stability prospect, growth markets now going faster than major markets by about nine points for the year. It closed at about eight point,s, which has been very consistent for the last couple of years. And I thought the performance between North America and Europe was really fairly tight.

I mean, our objective there was to exit businesses that we're commoditizing, didn't have strong margin potential. But more importantly than that, it was businesses that didn't have good value propositions to our customer set. And that's where we're moving towards. So if you look at the money that we spent buying those 108 acquisitions since at year 2000 for $22 billion, and you go down that, what you're going to see is those are big value place for us with better growth prospects. So we're moving out of business that we don't think has the same growth prospects and don't [indiscernible] margin, and moving into businesses with better value contribution and better growth prospects that fit within the solution orientation. There's no better example than that, than Business Analytics. And look at Business Analytics, we think that opportunities that could be as big as CRM or ERP, we'll see. But we put -- invested about $10 billion gross in that about $8.5 billion net, acquiring 14 companies to build that capability. They weren't just add on both on capabilities. It was really moving the corporation into this higher growth, higher margin, to our customer's higher value opportunity space. And that's our objective. It should have the compounded opportunity of moving into better growth, with better margins. You can see that underneath as well that mix of strategic Middleware within our Software business is one of our highest levels that we've ever had. And those strategic Middleware products have by their nature, better growth characteristics. Let me take the opportunity now just to wrap up. So we feel very good about our performance. In fact, I'd say we're pretty remarkable given the economic environment. We achieved 2010 EPS objective, I'd say one year earlier. And I don't think I'm overstating it. We look back at the comments that we all pool together, when we announced that in second quarter of 2007, I think we got kind of validation that was achievable to get into that $10 to $11 by 2010, but to hit it one year early, I think is pretty strong performance despite a two-year recession. And as you look at 2010, we've guided to the high end of the range in an at least characterization. All of this, consistent with the last question, was the result of the transformation that we began a decade ago. But it's also very good execution in utilizing [ph] the flexibility in our business model to adapt to the market conditions. The structural actions and continued investments throughout the downturn have a better position going into 2010 than 2009. We've got improved revenue growth performance in a better operating leverage, a good set of opportunities in emerging markets in areas like Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. So you put all of that together, and we see another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2010, with at least $11 of EPS for the year. So thank you very much for joining us today.",529

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2010",2010-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,,56780.0,4278138.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,2,"Thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we delivered $1.97 in earnings per share, which was up 16% year-to-year. Our improving business mix and focus on driving productivity again delivered solid market and profit performance. We increased pretax margin by a point, and both pretax and net income were up 13%.
We had a great tax performance, increasing free cash flow by $400 million to $1.4 billion. We returned another $4.7 billion to shareholders, with $700 million in dividends and $4 billion of share repurchases. 
The balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our full year objectives. Our liquidity position remains strong, as we finished the quarter with $14 billion of cash on hand. This was a very good start for the year.
Our key investments are unique to the IBM strategy and are paying off. This quarter, our growth market were up 8% year-to-year at constant currency, led by the BRIC countries, which were up 14%, as these countries build out and integrate public and private infrastructure. 
Business Analytics is one of the fundamental drivers of our software performance. Software revenue was up 11% or 5% at constant currency, with shared gains in each of the five middleware brands. And across top line services, our Business Analytics revenue was up double digits.
In services, an increasing portion of our Consulting business is driven by our Smarter Planet engagement and Business Analytics. This quarter, consulting signings were up 18% or 12% at constant currency, with the strongest consulting performance in over three years. So our growth initiatives helped drive our first quarter revenue performance.
You may recall that in January, we expected to improve our revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter to the first, resulting in mid-single digit revenue growth at actual rates. Let me tell you how we did and give you a few highlights. 
Our first quarter revenue was up 5% year-to-year, though it was driven more by our business operations and less by currency. With the strengthening dollar, currency was less of a help, only contributing five points of growth versus the six to seven points based on mid-January spot rates. This impacted revenue by about $250 million, so our underlying business performance was better than expected. 
The improvement in revenue growth from our fourth quarter was broad-based, with improvements across each of our major segments and geographies. In our segment performance, Systems and Technology improved 11 points; Software, nine points; Global Business Services four points; and Global Technology Services three points, all at constant currency. By geography, Americas revenue growth improved six points, EMEA five points and Asia four points. The major markets rate improved five points; and the growth markets six points, led by the BRICs. Keep in mind our solid annuity base, so our transactional growth rates drove these gains. 
And now, after a very good first quarter, we are increasing our earnings per share expectation for the year to at least $11.20, which is up $0.20 from our previous view of at least $11.
Now we'll turn to the detailed financial results for the first quarter. As I just mentioned, our revenue was up 5% year-to-year to $22.9 billion. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points due to better margins in Services and Software and more favorable business mix. 
Our expense was up 2% year-to-year. Within this, our operational performance was better five points, but was more than offset by a seven-point impact from currency and a point of acquisition expense. 
Pretax margin was up a point year-to-year to 15.4%, and net income margin expanded nearly a point to 11.4%. With continued margin expansion, we increased both pretax and net income by 13% year-to-year. And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 2% reduction in our share count. So bottom line, we delivered $1.97 of earnings per share, up 16% from a year ago. 
Now I will turn to the revenue details, starting with the geographic view. In discussing the geographic results, as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. As I just mentioned, the improvement in revenue growth was fairly consistent across our geographies, with Americas better by six points, Europe better by five points and Asia by four points. 
Driving the five-point improvement in the major markets growth rate, we had better performance in each of the G-7 countries. The best growth, again, came from the U.K., which was up 8% year-to-year. In the growth markets, growth accelerated as market conditions improved in most countries. With 8% growth this quarter, growth markets outpaced the majors by 10 points. 
The growth was led by the BRIC countries, which represent about a third of the growth market. The BRIC year-to-year increase of 14% included strong double-digit growth in Brazil, India and Russia. 
Government spending and programs remained a tailwind in most countries, and our strongest performance again came from the public sector. Within the growth markets, our biggest improvements from fourth quarter was in sales to our small and medium business clients, driven by growth in services, POWER, Storage and System X. We're having great success expanding our footprint in the growth markets, which provides the base on which to software and services stack. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Our services revenue growth improved from the fourth quarter in total and in SO, BTO, ITS maintenance and GVS. This was driven by growth in outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-month basis, and growth in core consulting signings this quarter. 
Our software performance was excellent, up 11%.  Targeted investments over the last several years have positioned us to capture growth in key areas like Business Analytics, Storage Management and Business Integration. This quarter, our Systems and Technology business returned to growth, and we gained our held share in every brand. 
Turning to gross profit, our improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time. This quarter, better margins in services and software and the relative strength of our Software business resulted in growth margin expansion of 20 basis points.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total expense and other income was up 2%. And together with a 5% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved 0.08 year-to-year. The operational expense improved five points year-to-year, but it was more than offset by currency, which impacted expense growth by seven points and acquisition accounted for one point. 
We're continuing to execute initiatives to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale on a global footprint. This strategy has worked well over the last five years, and will continue to produce over the next five. As always, I'll lay out of the road map of cost and expense items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit. First, in March, we completed our sale of our PLM operations to DSO, and we booked a gain of about $590 million.
In our call in January, I mentioned that the gain from the sale would be relatively offset by a charge for productivity actions. This quarter, our workforce balancing charges were about $560 million. The majority of the spending was in Europe and Asia, and we expect payback by the end of the year, with most of the benefit into second half. If you recall in the first quarter of last year, we had a gain of almost $300 million associated with outsourcing our Logistics business to Geodis. And this was effectively offset by our workforce rebalancing charges of to $65 million. 
So a very similar dynamic, with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges. In fact, when you look at the combined impact of the two unique items last year and to this year, there is no impact on IBM's year-to-year performance in the first quarter.
Our bad debt expense was less than $10 million in the current period come on improvement of about $90 million from last year, reflecting the improving credit environment. Our AR reserve coverage of 2.1% and down 30 basis points from last year, though it is up slightly from year-end. Finally, I'll comment on the impact of currency. 
As you know, we had our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. For the year-to-year change in currencies, this ahead of cash will program generated in the first quarter of this year as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact of the first quarter was over $350 million, which is roughly 60% in expense and 40% in cost of goods sold. Keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigated the translation gain elsewhere in the P&L.
Though it was a difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line, due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we do not believe that currency net of hedging activity, contributed to a proper growth in the quarter. So now let's turn to our segment pretax margin. 
This is a snapshot of our margins by segment. The combination of the four unique items I just mentioned have no year-to-year impact on IBM's total results. But they do impact of the year-to-year performance of the segment. 
For example, the workforce rebalancing activity this year was incurred in every segment, by the PLM gain was booked in software. We provided a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing their unique gains and charges in both year to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segment. Now let's turn to the segment starting with services.
The two services segment delivered $13.7 billion in revenue, up 4% year-to-year and down 2% at constant currency. This is a three-point implementing growth rates at constant currency versus the fourth quarter. Total signings were proper $3 billion, down 2% at actual rate and 7% at constant currency. If you exclude Application Management Services signings, signings would have been up 4% come out of about our AMS performance in a moment.
Total outsourcing signings were down 3% at actual rates and 8% of constant currency, though strategic Outsourcing signings were up 6%. As you know, outsourcing signings can be very and even by quarter and it's important to look at the longer-term trend. Total outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 5% at actual rates and up 4% of constant currency. Total transactional signings, which include Integrated Technology Services, Consulting and AMS systems integration, were down 1% actual rates and 6% at constant currency. In the quarter, we did see a shift in demand towards our consulting offerings, with consulting signings up 18%. Overall, we signed 13 deals greater than $100 million. 
And backlog at the end of the quarter was $134 billion, up $8 billion year-to-year or up $1 billion adjusting for currency. Within the backlog, we saw improved stability within our base accounts, with backlog erosion at the lowest level in two years. 
Now a growth key drivers performance in the two services segment. In Global Technology Services, revenue in the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% year-to-year as reported and flat at cost and currency. GTS outsourcing revenue improved in the quarter and return to growth to constant currency reflecting demand for BPO and Strategic Outsourcing over the last 12 months. 
In Integrated Technology and Services, the revenue growth rate also improved from the fourth quarter.
Total GTS signings were up 1% at actual rates, down 5% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 1% at actual rates, down 4% at constant currency. Strategic Outsourcing signings were up 6% at actual rates, with strong growth in North America. 
Integrated Technology Services signings were flat at actual rates, down 5% at constant currency. The strongest performance was in the growth markets, up 29% year-to-year and we had improvement in labor-based services in North America. Global Technology Services gross profit was up 8% year-to-year, with margin of 0.5., total pretax income was down 13% year-to-year as we absorbed a significant increase in workforce rebalancing charges. 
Looking at a normalized view of GTS margin, excluding the items I discussed earlier, PTI would be up 9% year-to-year, with a pretax margin expansion. This rebalancing activity will provide PTI benefits mainly in the second half of the year. And with this activity behind us, we expect that GTS will return to PTI growth and margin expansion over the remainder of the year.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was flat as reported, down 5% at constant currency. This improved revenue performance through fourth quarter was driven by strong growth in consulting signings, which yield quickly in the quarter. And revenue from Application Management Services signings over the last 12 months. 
Total GBS signings were down 6% of actual rates, down 12% at constant currency. This quarter, I'm going to describe our signings performance for GBS the way we manage it as two distinct businesses, Consulting and Application Management Services,  Improved growth application outsourcing and Systems Integration. 
In Consulting, signings were up 18% at actual rates and 12% at constant currency. This is the first quarter we've had constant currency growth in Consulting since the fourth quarter of 2008. We're starting to see a shift in customer buying patterns towards more transformational offerings, which are reflected primarily in our consulting business. We have reengineered this business to align with a strategy around Smarter Planet and Business Analytics, making investments and adding significant balance. We are gaining good traction from our growth initiatives, consulting signings in growth markets were up 35% at constant currency. And our Smarter Planet and this is analytic offerings were 25% of total consulting signings.
Now turning to Application Management Services, signings were down 23% at actual rates and 27% at constant currency, versus a strong quarter of last year, were we had a handful of large deals. This is where we came up short versus our expectations in the quarter. MS signings were down $700 million compared to last year. Now AMS has grown on a trailing 12 month basis but obviously, it had impact on our signings performance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, services signings, excluding AMS, would have been up 4%.
Global Business Services gross profit margin expanded $0.07 up in this quarter to 273%. Pretax margin was down 1.6% year-to-year. Adjusting for the unique item, PTI margin was 12.4%, down 0.5. year-to-year. Now to wrap up services, we had good improvement in revenue performance, driven by outsourcing signings growth in both GTS and GBS over the past 12 months, and a return to signage growth in Consulting. This is important, because Consulting has been a good leading indicator and has a greatest impact on near-term revenue performance. Both of these give us momentum going forward and we expect our Services business to return to modest growth in the second quarter.
Software had a terrific quarter, with revenue of $5 billion, up 11% year-to-year or 5% at constant currency. These results are the direct results of our sustained investment in this phase. Organic investments, complemented by strategic acquisitions, have enabled us to deliver unique capabilities and tremendous value for our customers. This quarter, Key Branded Middleware grew 13% or 8% at constant currency and gained a share for the 10th straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead  in the middleware market. Every one of the key brands gain share. We had very strong performance, specially in our business integration, analytics and Storage management software. This contributed to great run and performance, with WebSphere up 13%, Information Management up 11% and Tivoli up 23%. The Software segment pretax income grew 54% or 25% after normalized for unique items. Pretax margin was up 9.6 year-to-year to 36%. Normalized, we improve the pretax margin of 2.8 points to 27%.
Now let me take you through some additional details on the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter. Business integration offerings, deliver fat our customers by enabling them to make that are more predictive , collaborative grew over 20%. ILOG, which placed a key role in IBM's Smarter Planet initiative, by providing business management did very well again this quarter, growing over 30%.
Information Management software had a great quarter. Business Analytics continues to be a key growth area for us. Cognos, which was our largest acquisition ever, posted strong double-digit growth and gain share, providing a proof point on Analytics demand and market. 
Tivoli had an excellent quarter and gave share across all three market segments. Within systems management, enterprise asset management, which include maximum product grew double-digit. This is a key component of Smarter Planet strategy, growth was broad-based across geographies, most notably, in the growth market. 
Storage mentioned software also do double digits, which complemented the strong growth in Storage hardware. We've had over the second quarters of growth and Tivoli Storage software. Finally, security had solid growth, driven by strong sales across the portfolio. Lotus revenue growth improved significantly from the fourth quarter driven by 31% year-to-year increase in advanced collaboration. This software improved our customers' productivity by enabling the efficient sharing of information.
Rational software had a solid quarter, with revenue growing 7% year-to-year. Rational provides an integrated suite of products to manage the business process with software and systems delivery. This quarter, we completed the sale of our PLM operations, where we have acted as a sales channel. Our participation in this business has been declining for some time, and this transaction is in line with our strategy to divest of a low value businesses. The sale would have a positive effect on sofware margins immediately and improve our software revenue profile over time. Over the next year, the loss of PLM revenue will impact our software revenue growth by 10 to three points. Will provide at the U. of our Southern revenue growth without PLM for the next four quarters to better reflect our ongoing business performance. Software had a great quarter, reflecting the strength of the portfolio and the value it deliver to our customers. We expect to continue the same level of revenue performance in the second quarter, of course, adjusting for the PLM transaction.
The Systems and technology revenue was $3.4 billion, up 5% year-to-year, 2% at constant currency. This is an 11. sequential improvement in year-to-year growth rates at constant currency. We gained a share in Storage, both systematics, which includes 55% growth in Blade, retail store solutions and the mid-range of POWER, which was driven by the introduction of a POWER7. We held share  in high-end servers. 
Gross profit margin improved in Storage, System X, retail store and Microelectronics OEM. And systems and technology, we expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in second quarter and our new high-end products to help accelerate revenue growth throughout the second half to double digits by the fourth quarter. Now let me take you through more details on the brand.
POWER Systems revenue declined 17% year-to-year, and we held market share. We have been taking share in units for years. In the first quarter, our success was competitive units strength and continue with over 170 competitive lands wins totaling over $125 million for the quarter. 
This quarter, we took share in both low-end and mid-range systems. In the mid-range, where we introduced POWER7 in February, we gained better than two points of share year-to-year. POWER7 systems further extend our press performance advantage versus other competing and the UNIX space. We expect our shared gains to continue in the high end when we the announce our POWER7 products later this year.
Storage revenue grew 11% year-to-year. This grew 18% in gain share, with double-digit growth in enterprise, mid-range and low-end products. In the high-end, growth was driven byVXIC, where we added 75 new customers to our X. have the platform in the first quarter. Tape declined 5% that we again gain share. Our hardware Storage results complemented the strong performance in Storage software. Our Storage hardware and software together grew 14%.
System X blades revenue grew 13% year-over-year, this was our fifth consecutive quarter of share didn't end. Our improved sales model and enhanced product offering by the key contributors to this performance. System x Blade grew 55% year-over-year and gained two points of share their growth profit margin expanded year-to-year, driven by improvements in MDM operational efficiencies and the strong performance in Blade.
System the revenue declined. Decline 19% in the first quarter after growing 18% a year ago. This performance is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle. That of this year, we were leasing the next-generation System z. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 15% year-to-year. Our 300-millimeter fab full year utilization and a 45-nanometer a major output was sold out again this quarter. Systems and technology returns revenue growth this quarter, with strong performance in System x, Storage, microelectronics and retail store solutions. I expect this growth rate to accelerate through 2010. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow, up $400 million year-to-year. Now growth was achieved off of a strong first quarter of 2009. The increase in free cash flow was driven by a higher net income and improved the cash from sales cycle working capital as collections remained strong. And we delivered this $400 million increase in free cash flow, even taking into account significant higher tax payments. So this is quite an achievement. 
Below the free cash flow line, we received about $450 million for the PLM sales, which is reflected in the Investing Section of our cash flow and on the line labeled Other in this chart. Looking at our uses, we completed five acquisitions for $800 million, which is a good start for the year and a return to a $4.7 billion to shareholders. $700 million was in dividends and $4 billion was in share repurchases, which helped drive a year-to-year reduction in average diluted shares of just over 2%. We have $2 million remaining from our board authorization.
Overall, this was a great quarter for cash flow, specially for our first quarter. Now let's turn to the balance sheet benefit of our strong cash performance.
Even after return to a $4.7 billion t, shareholders. Even after funding investments and returning cash to investors, we've maintained a healthy cash balance of $14 million. Which was flat from year-end and an increase of $1.7 billion from the first quarter of 2009. Total debt was $26.3 billion. Over $22 billion of debt is in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged by the appropriate seven to one ratio. For the one doing is not financing and debt, which is up $400 million from year-end. We continued to have a high degree of financial flexibility in our model. Not financing debt to capital is 18%, up two points from year end and down 25 points from a year ago.
The balance sheet remains strong and positions us to support the business over the long term. I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Starting with revenue, which contributed $0.09 of benefit or about a third of the total growth, this was the largest contribution we've had from revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in growth margin expansion and expense productivity, which together, contributed $0.13.
We also had a modest benefit from tax and share repurchase contributed another $0.02. So our growth was delivered in a very balanced way through revenue growth, profit expansion and effective use of cash.
Our performance in the first quarter was driven by the investments we've made to capture growth opportunities and our ability to deliver value to our clients. We had broad-based improvement in revenue growth, across our segments and across our geographies. This improvement, together with a shift to higher value businesses, and focus on driving productivity, again, delivered solid margin and profit performance. We took actions in the first quarter to continue to transform the company, shipping to higher value areas and improving our structure. 
We've completed five acquisitions in the first quarter, investing in key capabilities that support our growth initiatives. We divested off our PLM operations and after we get through the comparison in the next two quarters, this will improve the revenue growth in margin of our Software business. 
We introduced new mid-range POWER offerings, and will deliver high-end POWER and mainframe systems later in the year to drive share gains in the second half. And we continued to increase the productivity of the business.
These actions will improve our strategic position and our business model going forward. Given what we've seen in the short term and our work with a business unit, we expect to return to revenue growth at constant currency in the second quarter. With services delivering modest revenue growth, hardware improving to mid-single digits and software continuing its strong performance. 
We're confident in our ability to continue to improve our revenue performance, leverage our business model through expanded margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to our shareholders. So consequently, we are increasing our expectations for the year to at least $11.20 of earnings per share.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.",4228

So while the IT spending side, you think we are back to a fairly normal IT spending environment. And by that, I mean, I may sequential patterns in terms of market revenue growth? And then for IBM specifically on the revenue growth side, perhaps you could just go through one more time their expectations for revenue growth if something new you typically you don't comment on revenue growth for IBM. But if we are in a more normal spending environment, given that IBM historically has grown 3% to 4% a year of constant currency or maybe call it did 5% of that range, should investors be expecting that IBM can grow in that range at constant currency for the remainder of this year?",141
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2010",2010-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,,56780.0,4278142.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Let me start with your first question about the IT spending environment and revenue growth characterizing that compared to more normal IT spending growth. First of all, we went through it. We made it the second chart in the release. You can see how our growth rates improved across our brands and across our geographies. So to me, SCG software GBS GB is very good uniform performance on that content, highly driven by the strength of our transactional performance in our SCG and Software business. But I think even more interesting to me if you look across our geographies, look at how uniform that improvement and growth rate is going from the fourth quarter to first quarter, Americas up six points EMEA, up five, a shop for her hit in Asia markets improving five-point, growth market uptick and within that, the BRIC at seven with IBM five.
Now that is very consistent with the direction that we gave when we closed the fourth quarter. I mean, we talked about, we have seen it improve the performance in our growth rate both in actual constant currency going from the fourth to the first. Actually, within that, at the time we had assumed of that currency would be in a fifth, six to seven-point and actually, more like five points. So given that we actually exceeded our own objectives here, we did much better on the operational performance to compensate for that currency impact. The second thing that I'll say across the spend environment, we are seeing a transition in the kinds of deals in the IT spend mix that our customers are looking for. Specifically, in this quarter, you could see the transformational offerings, especially within consulting signings now up driven with consulting signings now out 18% to 12% in constant currency, I mean, that is very. We haven't had that growth rate resulting business and over three years. So I thought that was very good unit in an area that yield more quickly. Now whether were back to normal IT spend, I mean, that's a longer-term view of the world. Obviously, I would like to see this momentum continue but out what I see the IBM equation is that we have a very strong place to improve our revenue performance now going into the second quarter, with the Services businesses now returning to modest growth. Software continuing it's very powerful performance, up 11% in the first quarter. I thought that was very encouraging to see. That kind of growth in our most profitable business, continuing to fuel the remix in our business is equation. And Hardware now taking advantage of improved transactional content, with within our transaction base and now moving into a second half, we have substantial announcement coming up. So I think it's all good and positive performance in the transaction side the way I see it. Now it will be the offset with PLM and that's about two- to three-point impact, normalize on a going forward. But generally, the characteristics, I feel I presented good and going into the second quarter.",514

Can you talk about maybe the benefits of the cost cutting and other reasons why you raised the guidance and maybe even high currency the puts and takes?",62
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2010",2010-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,,56780.0,4278145.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Let me go through that. First of all, when you look at that guidance, to be 90 days into the new year and take that bet it's upside a sense, I think that's a pretty significant improvement in our view of the year. And that improvement was really driven by the strength that we see in the quarter, the strength in the operational performance. I covered a number of these points in the last question with Tony, but much better signing performance in our Consulting business. Software transaction performance in the first quarter, up 28% at constant currency, 24% actual. Hardware returning to growth, with good announcements in the quarter, but very exciting announcement as we move into the second half. So if you look at what account for the improvement going from 11 to 11.20 and improvement is based on our confidence as we now have closed a very good first quarter. Now within that, there are a number of different mechanics under the hood that we could talk about. Now first of all, one that you had mentioned, Ben. If you look at the workforce rebalancing work that we did, that was predominantly in Europe and Asia. First, it has a slightly longer payback. We said it payback within the year. If you look at that, that's about $550 million of benefit, predominantly in the second half of the year. i would say that, that would yield, I don't know, 2/3. Because the balance of the third more of a growth mode, a balance that can use now for investments that have our growth. I would say about a third of that 550, that would be about $0.20. Now as I have pointed out earlier, that's partially offset by the $0.07 impact from PLM. The PLM impact start of the second quarter in the benefit of a workforce rebalancing is really in the second half of the year. And I think that gives you kind of a framework. But I also want to comment that if you look at improving the guidance from $11.00 $11.20, remember that we really were in the second quarter 2007, we established the roadmap having completed the year at $6.05, we thought we had a very good hand to improve that that at least $9 by the time and got into it 2010, with a potential range of $10 to $11 depending on the performance of our pension fund. Here we are talking about $11.20, well beyond blood that roadmap asked objective. We've done pretty well especially having got through a recession and within that recession, recording earnings per share growth every quarter substantial way. Sew I feel good about the guidance, through about the business as we exited the first quarter. And the workforce rebalancing will have benefit that will be predominately in the back half of the year. And frankly, when you look at year-to-go increase based on our increase in our EPS guidance, I would reserve most of that to increase for the back of the year.",507

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2010",2010-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,,56780.0,4278151.0,Answer,Samuel Palmisano,,Executives,15,"Yes, sure absolutely. Last length in the discussion on divestitures with acquisitions because they are part and parcel, partners in the strategy of ours. Now first of all, if you look at the ongoing strategy, we have, we want to move it to intellectual property-based business that are highly scalable and related to driving the solutions offerings that we have. Solution offerings like business analytics as an example. What we're doing on the flip side, on the development side, is moving out of businesses that have lower growth prospects and lower margin prospects. So if you look at the divestitures and the acquisitions in the quarter, I think the perfect examples of that strategy. The PLM business was, we remarketed other products. We didn't know their intellectual property. They owned the intellectual property. As we work through this, it makes so it made more sense for marketing themselves rather than for us. But at the same time, we invested five very strong candidates that do have a lot of intellectual property in that intellectual property is in line with the strategic objective that we have set for ourselves. So I think this is actually a perfect example, divesting of lower growth, lower margin, commoditizing content and moving that investment base into higher growth, higher margin intellectual property that we think is highly scalable and aligned with our strategic trajectory.",229

We're looking at the next year, IBM's centennial. We're investing in driving for another centennial. So this is going to go on all the time. This is going to be a constant process of regeneration and renewal in transforming our business base into new opportunities that we think have better margin, and better growth prospects.

Now it year were they grew those signings than 3% and they had a handful of very large deals. So it was a challenging quarter for that business. And that business did quite well last year. We grew signings 14% for the year. So a good double-digit performance in '09 particularly strong first quarter to compare to. If you look at across the services base of business on a signings base, we do think that when we go into the second quarter, we have a very good deal and we have a with a good odd. So there's no reason we shouldn't be growing signings at a reasonable level as we go into the second quarter. So if look at booking expectations, I mean, that's going to be characterized quarter by quarter. Right now, we see a pretty good pipeline go in the second quarter. As I said, we'll be returning to signings growth.",171

Now if you look at the consulting performance as we pointed out, signings were up 18%. Underneath that performance, it's interesting to note that North America was up 26% and GMU was up 25%. In fact, we have growth in four of our major seasons, pretty broad-based phenomena with real strength not only our major market but also in our growth markets, up 35%. If you look at the content underneath consulting in our base of business, it was about 25% of base of business was in Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. So you can see the linkage consulting momentum through to other part of our business. I mean, Business Analytics where's the biggest component growth obviously in Software. We reviewed with you the acquisitions and organic investments that we've made in business analytics and software as well as the organic investment in mathematical expertise in research, given that we are now the largest private sector math department in the world. All of those work together to help drive that equation and move that transformation through a number of our business units. And given to the investments that we've made in this, obviously, we're looking for a multiquarter, multiyear growth in that business analytics opportunity. So with that, Business Analytics is a great example moving into solution offering with a big software base in the framework of the deliverable. And that's software base comes at a high margin. And it's part of the mix shift that you've seen starting in 2000 and driving much more of our profitability throughout high margin business.",281

How you're thinking about IBM in 2010. A different way for look at the EVS bridge for the first quarter, of 2010 versus '09, about 1/3 of your EPS growth was related to revenue at actual. If you think about what you provided of at least $11.20 for the year, how do you think the revenue growth will contribute to that, is it more than 50%?",78
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2010",2010-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,,56780.0,4278162.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,26,"Well, I'm not going to give specific percentages to break that down. I mean, we do think that we are clearly, based on the improvement in the revenue growth rates and fourth and first, and then the comments that we made working with our general management going first versus second, we believe we're in a better framework for revenue as we go through the year. But when you look at the component underneath the $11.20, we run multiple scenario. We run scenarios with higher revenue growth rates in different geographies, how we're just business major markets. Higher revenue growth rates with higher margin content along Business Analytics. We do alternatives as the growth rate comes in the more transactional as opposed to content, what's the impact of currency, I'm interested in currency alone if you just look at the 90-day change in spot rates, quarter, that alone has impacted the actual revenue growth by $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So there is not just one scenario that we look at to drive our view of the year. We look at multiple scenarios. We look at our flexibility to drive that, and what we're delivering, I think, is a view of the world that it a lease number. So to me, that's a high probability based on looking forward.",218

Can you maybe update us as to what you expect to use your liquidity going forward? What will acquisition set versus buyback? How you think about that equation going forward?,45

That $1 billion of acquisition by very strong opportunity for us in demonstrated our commitment to acquisitions is an ongoing play. At the same time, we repurchased $4 billion in the quarter. Now if you compare that to the prior years, that does look like a large first quarter. But I caution you that really the prior year was impacted by the equity impact that we had in the business leaving 2008. So In other words, when we had the tension impact due to lower return, that in turn impacted our equity and our debt to cap was about 48%. So last year, we had to be fairly careful about equity-based transactions and the impact on that. We are not in that situation this year. We're not in that situation. So if you look our debt to cap down, it's 18%. That's very conservative. We've got $14 billion of cash. We just finished the quarter with $1 billion of growth acquisitions, $4 billion share repurchase, $700 million in dividends. So now I would tell you, as you all know, this is a power reserve to the board, and we have about $2 billion left in our authorization. So I would think it will be more practical to compare this year acquisition opportunity in this year's share repurchase opportunity, essentially the later base to what we saw in 2008 as opposed to '09. 
So thank you very much for your questions. Let me just wrap up here. We had a very good start to the year, including real progress on the top line. Our best growth came from software, which is our most profitable and highest value area. We had great growth in consulting signings, which is you know, tends to be a leading indicator. And we've started the introduction of our high-end server, which will continue to rollout there in the year and second half. So overall we're encouraged by our performance in the first quarter and the position we're in for the rest of the year. 
And that's why 90 days into the year, we're taking up our EPS expectations for 2010. Now with at least $11.20 EPS for the year, we're well ahead of our 2010 rag road map objective. And we'll talk to you again at our investor briefing on May 12. But for now, as always, it's back to work.",417

This quarter, we continued to trend at improving business performance, increasing constant currency revenue growth, expanding margin and once again delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. We've now grown EPS in each of the last 30 quarters. And since the beginning of our 2010 roadmap, we've grown EPS at a double-digit rate in 12 of the last 14 quarters. 
Our revenue growth of 2% was two points better than our constant currency performance in the first quarter and seven points better than our fourth quarter growth rate. Our revenue growth would have been about a point higher adjusting for the divested PLM business. So on this basis, the improvement was broad-based across all segments and all geographies, including Europe.
Our performance is driven by the investments we've been making to capture growth opportunities and to deliver value to our clients. We've been investing heavily to build out the infrastructures in the emerging countries. This quarter, our growth markets were up 14% or 9% at constant currency led by the BRIC countries, which were up 16% at constant currency. Our performance in the growth market has consistently outpaced the major markets. And as a result, for the first half of this year, our business in the growth markets is now as large as our Eurozone business for the first time.
We've been investing to extend our technology leadership. Earlier this year, we introduced POWER7 technology to our mid-range UNIX servers. And this quarter, the mid-range of grew 11%, which resulted in four points of share gain in POWER Systems. In the third quarter, we'll have a POWER7 across our entire UNIX product line, and will introduce and ship our next-generation mainframe solution. 
We've been investing in key growth areas such as
business analytics. Our Business Analytics revenue was up 14%, which contributed to strong performance in both software and Global Business Services. Global Business Services revenue growth improved to 3%, and software Key Branded Middleware was up 10% at constant currency, and we took share again this quarter in software.
We've been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiative. In the first half, we have closed six acquisitions and announced another three for a total of about $3 billion. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in areas such as industry solutions for Smarter Planet initiatives, and Business Analytics, and Cloud Computing. 
And this quarter, we also continued to improve our profit profile, expanding pretax margin by a point and growing earnings per share by 13% to $2.61. And remember, we've delivered this profit performance compared to a strong second quarter of 2009, where we expanded pretax margin by over four points and grew EPS by 18%.
So now based on our first half performance and our view of the second half, we're increasing our expectations for the full year 2010 to at least $11.25 of earnings per share. That's up from our view in April and up $0.25 from January. Now let's turn to the financial results for the quarter, with a quick walk down the P&L.
We delivered $23.7 billion of revenue. That's up 2% as reported and at constant currency. We completed the sale of the software PLM operations at the end of the first quarter. This divestiture impacted IBM's revenue growth by about a point and our software growth by about four points. 
This quarter, we dealt with the sharp strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. Currency provided 40 basis points of revenue growth, as compared to the 200 to 300 basis points projected based on mid-April spot rates. So that's a two- to three-point impact to our revenue growth. So the currency movement since April impacted second quarter revenue by about $500 million. And if you consider the currency movements since mid-January, second quarter revenue was impacted by $1 billion.
We expanded gross margin driven by better margins and Global Business Services and software. Our expense was down 1% year-to-year. Our operational expense performance was five points better, mitigated by impacts from currency and acquisitions. We increased pretax income by 7% and pretax margin was up a point to 19.3%. Our tax rate was down just over a point year-to-year to 26%, in line with first quarter and our expected rate for the full year. Net income improved 9% and margin expanded nearly a point to 40.3% (sic) [19.3%]. And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 3% reduction in our share count. 
So bottom line, we delivered $2.61 of earnings per share, up 13% from a year ago. And while it's certainly more difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we estimate that currency, including hedging activity, impacted earnings growth by $0.10 or $0.11 per share. So it's important to note that we're achieving this 13% growth off of strong profit performance in second quarter 2009 and in the face of a significant currency headwind. I'll address that in more detail in a few minutes.
Now I'll turn to the revenue details starting with the geographic view. In discussing the geo results, as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. 
After substantial improvement in the year-to-year growth rates from fourth quarter to first, we again had an improving trend in year-to-year revenue growth from the first to the second quarter across our geographies, with the Americas and Asia-Pacific each better by two points, and Europe better by a point. The major markets also improved a point, with the best growth again coming from the U.K., which was up a very strong 11%. And the U.S. returned to growth for the first time in seven quarters.
Our growth markets grew 9%, outpacing the majors by nine points. In the BRIC countries, which represent over a third of the growth markets, revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in each of the four countries. Our strong performance extended beyond the BRICs. In fact, we had double-digit growth in over 35 countries this quarter, up from 30 in the first quarter. 
Our ongoing investments have positioned us to capture the fast-growing opportunity in these markets, and we've been rapidly expanding our base of business. As I mentioned earlier, our growth markets business is now as large as our Eurozone business. And at this pace, we expect our growth markets to be larger by the end of the year.
Turning to revenue by segment. Our Services business returned to revenue growth at constant currency, led by an eight-point improvement in Global Business Services' growth rate compared to the first quarter. Our software performance was excellent, with Key Branded Middleware up 10% at constant currency and total software up 6%, excluding the divested PLM business. 
We're capturing growth in key areas like business analytics, storage management and business integration. This quarter, our Systems and Technology business delivered mid-single-digit growth as expected, and we gained or held share in every brand. So in this basis, similar to the geo performance, we had improvement versus the first quarter growth rate in all segments at constant currency.
Turning to expense. Our total expense and other income was down 1%. With the 2% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved 9/10 of a point year-to-year. The expense decline was driven by operational expense improvements of five points year-to-year. But this improvement was mitigated by currency, which impacted expense growth by two points and acquisitions for another two points. 
We've had an ongoing focus on increasing efficiency and driving productivity across the enterprise. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement. Some of the savings from our productivity initiative goes to the bottom line and some is reinvested back in the business. As an example, this quarter, while overall SG&A was down 4% excluding currency and acquisitions, SG&A in the growth markets was up 10%. This is consistent with our investment profile over the last two years, where our operational SG&A spend for the growth markets was 10 or more points higher than the majors.
I want to mention just a couple of items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit this quarter. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing charges were less than $20 million, down about $50 million from the second quarter of last year. When you look at the year-over-year benefit in other income and expense, remember that last year, we had a charge of almost $120 million related to investment in a joint venture. 
Other income contains a significant portion of the impact from our hedge of cash flow programs. As you know, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. While our hedging programs generated a gain this quarter, it wasn't as large as the gain last year. The result is a year-to-year impact to profit of over $130 million, which is roughly 70% in expense and 30% in cost of goods sold. This $130 million hedging impact is about $0.07 per share year-to-year. 
We also estimate that we had a translation impact to our earnings growth of about $0.03. So the total impact of the bottom line from currency is estimated at $0.10 or $0.11 overall. 
So now let's turn to our segment pretax margins.  Our improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our margin over time. This quarter, software and Global Business Services had great margin performance, each up over a point. Our Systems and Technology margins declined due to mix of business and a higher level of investment to support our new product introductions this year. 
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Services. The two services segments returned to growth at constant currency this quarter, delivering $13.7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-to-year as reported, and up 1% at constant currency. This revenue performance was largely driven by Global Business Services, which improved its year-to-year growth rate by eight points sequentially. Total signings were flat sequentially at $12.3 billion, down 12% year-to-year, with Global Business Services signings up 2% at constant currency. Backlog remained steady at $129 billion, up $1 billion adjusted for currency. 
The biggest driver of the signings decline was Outsourcing, down 19%. Based on an assessment of our large outsourcing contracts, we had a significant decline in contract extensions as a number of large deals rolled out of the quarter. Contract extensions have little to no benefit to near-term revenue. In contrast, we had good growth in new business signings, which have a more immediate contribution to revenue. 
When you look at the revenue that will be generated from these outsourcing signings, we will actually get more revenue over the next 12 months from this quarter's outsourcing signings of $6.5 billion than we did from last year's second quarter signings of $8 billion. So the strength of new business signings in Outsourcing contributes to an improving revenue trend for the rest of the year, and shows why it's important not to put too much emphasis on just the absolute signings number. 
Moving to Transactional Signings, which include Integrated Technology Services, Consulting and AMS Systems Integration, signings were down 3%; again, an improvement from first quarter at constant currency. You can see improving performance in Transactional Signings over the past several quarters in our supplemental charts. It shows a positive trend in good momentum as we move into the third quarter. This quarter, ITS growth improved from first quarter rates at constant currency and AMS grew. In Consulting, signings were up 17% in North America, and up in total for the first half, although total consulting was down in the quarter as a number of deals rolled out of the quarter. 
Overall, we signed 15 deals greater than $100 million. And as I said, total services backlog at the end of the quarter was $129 billion, up $1 billion adjusting for currency, though down $2 billion at actual rates. And we had another quarter with very low backlog erosion. 
Now I'll go to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.2 billion, up 1% year-to-year as reported and flat at constant currency. GTS Outsourcing revenue was up 2% in the quarter, and Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 2%. We had good performance in the growth markets, with revenue up over 8% at constant currency in each of these businesses. 
Global Technology Services pretax income was up slightly in the quarter, with margin at 14.9%. With the benefit of the first quarter rebalancing activity coming in the second half of the year and an improved revenue growth trend, we expect to expand margin in the second half.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 3%, both as reported and at constant currency. We saw an improved performance in many areas of the business as we grew revenue in both the major markets and the growth markets, in all sectors with the exception of communications sector, and in both Consulting and AMS, where we had particular strength in North America, with combined revenue of 8% at constant currency. From an offering perspective, we had double-digit growth in both Business Analytics and Smarter Planet.
Global Business Services pretax profit was up 12% year-to-year with margin expanding 1.3 points to 14.6%. This expansion was driven by higher utilization and benefits from the continued implementation of our globally integrated capabilities. At the same time, we are continuing to add to our skill base and invest for future growth.
To wrap up Services, we saw a number of positive signs in improving trends in the quarter. We had improvement in the revenue growth rate sequentially, with a return to growth at constant currency for total Services. GBS revenue was up 3% with eight points of improvement in the growth rate. We had good recovery in AMS. We had very good new customer signings in Outsourcing. Backlog was up $1 billion year-to-year with a low level of erosion and we have a good pipeline of deals going into third quarter. 
With this level of performance, the total Services revenue growth rate should improve in the second half. This improvement will be led by GBS, with its higher transactional content. And the with benefits of the first quarter resource rebalancing, we expect to see margin expansion in the second half as well.
Software had another strong quarter of revenue performance with revenue of $5.3 billion. That's up 2% year-to-year or 6% adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business. Key Branded Middleware grew 9% at actual rates and 10% at constant currency and gained a share for the 11th straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market. The share gain was broad-based across WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational. Key Branded Middleware accounted for 62% of our total software revenue, up four points from this time last year. Both the WebSphere and Tivoli brands grew at double digits year-to-year and we had strong performance in the Business Analytics product set. 
Segment pretax income was $2 billion, up 7% year-to-year, and pretax margin improved 1.3 points to 33%. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of margin expansion in the Software segment. 
Now let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 17% and gained share in all segments with strong performance across the portfolio. Application servers, which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for mission-critical business applications, grew 32%. Business integration software, which includes our ILOG and Lombardi acquisitions, grew 12%. Information Management also had a strong quarter, growing 7%. Information Management software offerings provide the foundation for IBM's Business Analytics and Optimization offerings.
Tivoli had another terrific quarter in all three market segments and grew 18% in total. Enterprise Asset Management within the Systems Management portfolio grew double-digits. This continues to be a critical component of IBM's Smarter Planet solutions. In security software, we had strength across the portfolio and in all geographies. Our Tivoli storage products also continued to perform very well, growing double digits and gaining share. As an example, XIV software, which provide ease of use and lower total cost of ownership, more than doubled, and Tivoli Storage Manager grew 10% this quarter, driven by its market-leading data reduction capabilities and related cost benefits. 
The breadth and diversity of our Software portfolio, combined with strategic investments in high growth areas, have enabled us to achieve consistently strong results in the Software segment. We expect to deliver similar levels of revenue performance in the third quarter.
Systems and Technology revenue was $4 billion, up 3% year-to-year or 4% at constant currency. Revenue was driven by a continued growth in Systems X, Storage, Retail Stores and Microelectronics. We had strong performance in the growth markets. BRIC countries grew 20% year-to-year, with growth in all brands, and we expect the strength in growth markets to continue in the second half. 
Gross profit margin was down one point driven by mix. In the third quarter, we will announce new high-end servers. Both the System z and high-end POWER servers will be refreshed, with availability in the middle of September. 
Now let me take you through more details on the brands. POWER Systems revenue declined 10% year-to-year. Our new POWER7 products drove mid-range growth of 11% and POWER blades growth of over 65%. This performance drives our ninth consecutive quarter of share gain. 
In the second quarter, we had 225 competitive UNIX displacements, of which almost 2/3 were from Sun. This resulted in $225 million of business in nearly four points of share gain. This is a sequential increase of over $75 million from the first quarter where we gained over seven points of share. We have now won 620 deals from Sun, totaling nearly $650 million over the last six quarters. The win rate has been increasing, and we expect these takeouts to continue throughout the second half. 
This quarter, we will announce our POWER7 entry and high-end systems with availability in September. Our high-end systems will scale up to 256 cores and are capable of running 1,000 virtual images, which is 4x more than our current high end POWER6 processors. Additionally, the energy efficiency of these new high-end systems will be 5x to 7x more efficient than the latest UNIX items from both Sun and Hewlett-Packard. 
Storage revenue grew 5% year-to-year. Disk revenue grew 12%, or 14% at constant currency, driven by continued strength in high-end offerings, XIV and DS8000. XIV, added more than 130 new customers to the platform in the second quarter and revenue more than doubled year-to-year. 
System x revenue grew 30% year-to-year led by our high-volume offerings in our System X blades. X blades grew 16% year-to-year. The high end of System X was up 17% and gained share. This high-end performance, combined with the growth in blades and improvements in end-to-end operational efficiencies contributed to improved gross profit margin performance in System x. 
System z revenue declined 24% year-to-year. This week, IBM will announce the next generation of System z, the fastest and most scalable enterprise server in the industry. This server provides 40% more performance on a mix of workloads than the equivalent z10. Some workloads can achieve greater performance improvements such as Linux, which has 60% better performance and 35% lower cost. This announcement is the foundation for IBM's first system of systems, which provides the capability to manage 10x the virtual machines of VMware by extending mainframe governance to our other industry-leading technologies. 
Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 23% year-to-year. Both our 300-millimeter and 200-millimeter fabs are fully utilized. Systems and Technology continued its revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in Disk Storage, System x, Microelectronics and Retail Store Solutions. And with the introduction of new high-end systems in third quarter, I expect this growth rate to improve in the third and fourth quarters and to deliver double-digit PTI growth for the second half of the year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which was down $400 million year-to-year, driven by higher capital investments of $100 million in support of hardware product announcements, as well as a prior-year foreign tax refund of $360 million. 
In the first half, our free cash flow of $4.4 billion was flat year-to-year. We had strong operating performance driven by higher net income of $600 million and sales cycle working capital improvements of $350 million year-to-year. This was offset by higher capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology, and a year-to-year impact of over $700 million for unique, one-time tax refunds as previously disclosed. Excluding these unique tax refunds, free cash flow would have been up $700 million. 
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we spent $1 billion for six acquisitions in support of our growth strategy. The largest of these were National Interest Security, Initiate Systems, Lombardi and Cast Iron Systems. In addition, we returned almost $10 billion to the shareholders in the first half. $8.1 billion was in the form of share repurchases and we have about $6 billion remaining from our last board authorization. 
We took our dividend up 18% in April and paid out $1.6 billion in dividends. This is the 15th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and we've more than tripled our dividend over the last five years. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet where we'd see the impact of our cash performance. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, more than 2/3 of which was in the U.S. Our collections remain strong. 
Total debt was $26.7 billion. $21 billion of debt was in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged at 7.1:1. $5.5 billion was non-financing debt that was down from $6.6 billion a year ago. 
Non-financing debt-to-capital is 23%, up from 16% in December and down from 35% a year ago. With this level of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Our revenue growth, at constant mix and margin, contributed $0.05. The largest contributor was operating leverage driven by gross margin expansion, improving expense productivity and a year-to-year improvement in the tax rate, and a 3% reduction in share count contributed $0.08. 
So once again, our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion and an effective use of cash. And while it's not uniquely identified in the  bridge, we overcame a currency headwind of $0.10 to $0.11 in our way to 13% earnings per share growth.
Now for the last several years, we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth. Since early 2007, when we first introduced our 2010 roadmap, we've delivered double-digit EPS growth each year and in 12 of the last 14 quarters. Compared to the Dow, IBM is the only company to have positive year-over-year growth in each of the 14 quarters. 
In each of these periods, which spanned a variety of economic environment, we faced unique opportunities and challenges. There are many dimensions of IBM's business model, from business mix to global scale and structure, to financial strength and flexibility, that have allowed us to overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities while we consistently deliver. 
This quarter, we dealt with a significant currency headwind caused by the sharp strengthening of the dollar and still delivered 13% earnings per share growth against a very strong second quarter of last year, which had 18% EPS growth. So while some companies would show growth this quarter as they recover from losses in the recession, IBM is building on our strong performance over the last eight years. 
We continued our steady improvement in the business in both revenue growth and margin expansion, and we used our strong profit and cash position to invest and expand our base of opportunity while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. 
Looking forward to the second half, we'll have exciting new product introductions with our new mainframe system of systems and POWER7 technology across our POWER Systems product line. We'll continue to leverage investments in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Business Analytics in growth markets. We'll integrate the acquisitions announced this quarter. We'll yield the benefit from our first quarter workforce rebalancing actions, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies and increase productivity, all while continuing to invest in innovation throughout the business.
All of this supports our expectation of at least $11.25 of our earnings per share for the year. Now Patricia and I will take your questions.",4150

On software, you said you expect a similar kind of growth rate to continue. For hardware, you stated that it should improve. And for services, you stated it should improve as well. Can you clarify that those are constant-currency statements? And given the currency outlook at current spot rates, is it realistic to believe that either Q3 or Q4, IBM could grow its revenues above the 2% rate year-over-year that it did this quarter?",93

I mean, we look at the impact of currency and give some analysis on that and the supporting chart. But it's very difficult to look at how that's going to affect, given the volatility in current periods. I mean, as an example, just look at how much currency moved in the last week and a half. I mean, frankly, we are revising this supplemental chart on a daily basis because the change was so significant. So at least from my perspective, Toni, the important part from the IBM team in a operational mode is to be able to build a fundamental business model and capability to deal with that fluctuation in currency. And so if you look at it on today's spot rate, we would look forward on an EPS basis and project about the same level of currency impact in the second half that we had in the first half, and we are certainly able to deal with that in the first half, and I would expect that we'd able to deal with that in the second half. And I think you can kind of make that same statement if you look over longer periods of time. We've certainly been in periods where currencies have gone against us and with us. And each of those quarters over the last four, five years, we have grown EPS. So from my perspective, the statements we made looking at the individual businesses on a constant-currency basis, I look at our capability to deal with fluctuating currencies in the first half, and we should be able to do the same in the second half. And on an earnings-per-share basis at current spot rate, we will look at that earnings per share impact in the second half being about the same magnitude as the first half.",314

On a signings basis, as we analyzed it, we had in the GBS business, we had good revenue growth, we had positive signings performance. So then when you look at Global Technology Services, the issue that we wrestle with was really in our Outsourcing business. And the point I was making on the Outsourcing business is that if you look at the kind of the complexion of those signings, by analyzing the larger deals, we actually did very well on a year-to-year basis on the new business signings content. And it was not only a year-to-year basis but it is also quarter-to-quarter. So if you look at deals greater than $50 million in outsourcing, those new business content was up 33% year-to-year, it was up 36% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That frankly generates a better near-term characteristics than we'd see in extensions obviously and it gives us confidence. As you look at $6.5 billion of signings and outsourcing this quarter, we'll frankly get much better characteristics in the revenue line from those signings than we did last year at $8 billion. Now to your point about the trend line on this and the characteristics, as we look at the analysis, frankly, we believe that last year, we've had a high level of extensions because our customer base was wrestling with the economic difficulty of the recession, and there were a lot of contract renegotiations, and in part of those contract negotiations, we saw a number of extensions. But I think, frankly, as we work with the operational team, we believe the bulk of that trend is in the rearview mirror. And I do think it's quite reasonable to be encouraged by the strong growth rate that we did have in new business content. And now that's what really led us to project on a forward-looking basis that we ought to have improving revenue characteristics even as we move into the third quarter in GTS, as well as GBS.",332

I mean, on public sector basis, if you look at the U.S. Federal performance, we did pretty well. Revenue was up about 5%. So if you look, as you kind of mentioned in your remarks, Ben, it was really state and local was more challenging. And as you look at it, I think it's more indicative of the state and local governments wrestling with tough local budgets. When you then say, well, how did we perform a growth market basis? Like the U.S. state and local, I mean, Australia was down but we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth market. As an example, ASEAN was up 11%, India was up 14%, China was up 16%, Korea was up 10%, Latin America was up a whopping 77%. So I did see public sector challenges in state and local in North America. I think U.S. Federal did pretty well, up 5%, and we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth markets unit. Now turning to your second question, on Europe in general, really, Europe had pretty good performance if you look at that growth rate compared to first quarter. That was in fact an acceleration. And they were more affected than North America by the PLM divestiture to the to Dassault [Dassault Systemes]. So frankly, weren't not for that, they would've been flat. I do think, however, it's interesting when you look at the characteristics and the overview of our business, that this is the first quarter where our growth markets unit has equaled in size the content that we have in the Eurozone. So that will obviously be an ongoing trend. We've had our growth markets growth rate exceeding that in major markets now for, I think, it's ten quarters in a row. And generally, it's in that magnitude of about eight points. Interesting this quarter, it's in fact 10 points. But we saw improvement year-to-year growth rate across the board even in Europe. We did well in some countries of Europe. If you look at that U.K., we're up 11%. Last quarter, U.K. was up 8%. In the fourth, they were up 4%. So it does vary quite a bit by individual country.",383

I mean, I think what you saw in the quarter is a function of the anticipation of the announcement content that we have coming out in the third quarter. And by the way, these are very strong announcement. I mean, the zSeries, this is a major new announcement. It's not just a new z. It's now a new z in a system of systems implementation, and we'll be able to tell you much more about that during the announcement later this week. On the POWER side, we're now announcing the high end of POWER, as well as the entry POWER content. If you want to look at how POWER is performing, let's look at the content in the mid-range where we did have the POWER announcement. The new POWER7 technology and that mid-range system grew 11%. And if you look at the Blades content, the POWER7 technology when it was on, it was up 67%. So if you snap out those elements with the new announcement, we did very well. We're still taking strong market share in this platform. You saw I would imagine in the first quarter, it was 7.5 points per share. In the second quarter, four points a share, now moving into the third quarter, where by the end of the quarter, we're going to have POWER7 technology across the board, coupled with the fact that we'll have the new zSeries announcement, I think we should have a very strong quarter as we move into the third.",251

First of all, if you look at the progression through the quarter, Richard, we had double-digit signings growth for our services right through week 10 of the quarter. And what we saw is we had a number of contracts roll into the third quarter. So as I look at the Outsourcing business on a forward-looking basis in the third quarter, we should have pretty strong double-digit growth in our Outsourcing business going into the third. Again, I think the impressive part on the new business was the growth rate not just year-to-year but also quarter-to-quarter where it was up 36%, now generating more impressive revenue implications as we go into the third quarter. But overall, on a forward-looking basis, we did have a number of contracts rolled from second quarter into third quarter. We are generally on a trendline for a double-digit signings growth through week 10. And now given that, as we look forward to the third quarter, that Outsourcing business should have a good double-digit growth rate in signings for the third.",185

Clearly, the year-on-year revenue growth trend improved. But if you look at linearity through the quarter and the pipeline going into the back half, is it fair to expect that the growth rate in Europe continues to improve in the next couple of quarters? Or should we expect that to flatten out conservatively?",62

And in the first of the year, certainly, Europe was wrestling with those individual economic challenges. It's not like they just occurred at the end of the quarter. And we had overall kind of steadily improving performance in our European business. And as I said, we had some very strong performances like the U.K. I mean, Katy, when you look at a country like the U.K. growing 11% a quarter, that's pretty powerful. And you could pick even Greece and Spain, they were relatively flat even amidst the turmoil that they had. So from my perspective, as I look at the data, I do think we should expect that Europe should have an improving trend as we go into the third quarter. And overall for the IBM Corp., it should see the same.",157

It sounds like outsourcing booking slowed. And I believe, previously, you said you saw some deal slippage in the Consulting business outside of the U.S. So maybe hoping to get some more color on kind of the global IT demand as you see it and whether or not customers are delaying or deferring signing large contracts to wait to see how this European situation shakes out.",88

And the reason I say that, remember, we're talking about contract extensions. Those can be driven by a number of different things. First of all, I've already said that we think it was a high level of extensions last year given the economic environment. Secondly, they can be influenced just by contract dates and when those contract dates end. So we had a number of those extensions rolled to the third quarter. But as I said, as you look at that outsourcing performance moving into the third quarter, we expect that to have double-digit growth rate, and that's pretty strong. And additionally, I would say within the quarter, we saw that new business content with very strong growth on a year-to-year basis and on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Additionally, we had a very strong close with our Software business. Software had a very, very powerful third month in the quarter. So overall, revenue trends in the quarter were very measured and steady throughout the quarter. So I do not think I would take this and interpret a reflection that there is a pullback in spending. And I think my remarks are in a way indicating the reverse in that we think that rollover deals should accelerate performance in the outsourcing signings content in the third quarter. And we should see measured improvement once again in revenue performance for services and the IBM Corp. as we go from second to third.",249

How should we think about some of these puts and takes here in terms of some of these services extensions that maybe not being renewed? I know they can be higher value. And also, we have the refresher too with the POWER and the mainframe, will there be any sort of margin impact, either good or maybe some headwinds temporary from a hardware perspective in 3Q versus 4Q?",76
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2010",2010-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3494.0,67748.0,4993500.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,29,"Sure, let's take those in separate parts. First of all, let's look at margin. For the IBM Corp., as a whole, when we have taken you through our business model in either the roadmap to 2010 or to 2015, we are looking for productivity on PTI margin, and the model is up 4/10 to 5/10 of a point. As we look at that PTI margin improvement, it was a point. So I would look at it and say, ""Pretty good performance."" If you look at the gross margin, it was up a tenth of a point. And remember, within that tenth of a point, it was absorbing some of the impact of currency and the hedge that is within the cost element. So I think margin did a pretty good job. I think our productivity actions did a good job. And frankly, if you just took a real steely eyed view of that year-to-year improvement in our productivity versus the model, you'd have to say that it was about 2x the model. Now the other point that you had asked about is on services base. So if you look at services, again, at the PTI margin base, overall, services had an improvement of about 4/10 of a point. Again, I would say that's very close to model. I mean, 4/10 of a point within the quarter in the Services business, that in and of itself is absorbing some of the impact of currency and the hedge. Outside of currency and the hedge, that margin would've been up about 8/10 of a point. So once again, I look at that content, I think performance was pretty positive. And then the last question, as we go into the third quarter, the product announcements that we had and high E&P in our zSeries content, are high-margin end of the product line. So they are absolutely going to drive stronger hardware margins in the third quarter. And frankly, you're going to see that on a forward-looking basis because we should have very strong double-digit PTI growth rates in our Hardware business in the third quarter, as we announce these newer high-margin platforms in both the POWER Series, as well as our zSeries mainframe.",369

The weakness in the staying local I think makes sense, but from a federal level, I think that was more backward looking.

I think what they have said is that they're reassessing kind of the mix of their spend, not necessarily a reduction of the spend, but a mix of they're spend towards project that are yielding the best productivity and yield against our business cases in their platform. And I think that sounds like a very logical thing for them to do. As we look at it and we look at our contracts, we think we have very strong contracts. We think that they're performing well. So on that kind of a base, I would not project a big impact, but I got to wait and we got to see how this rolls out. But that's how I have heard it described.",153

But on the transactional side of the business, bookings have remained negative against I think which was negative comps last year on a constant-currency basis, although they are improving. Yet, the GBS revenue growth has turned positive. So again, it seems like there's a little bit of a disconnect between what's happening in the bookings and what's happening in terms of revenue growth. Can you help us understand and reconcile what's going on now in the short-term side of the business that may be leading to that decoupling?",108
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2010",2010-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3494.0,67748.0,4993508.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,37,"Well, first of all, we had a shorter duration in some of the contracts. Second of all, we had a very positive consulting performance in the first quarter. Third, you look at this quarter, our North American Consulting business did a very good job, signings were up 17%. And I think lastly on that point, that's why we included that supplemental chart, you could see just draw that trendline yourself into the third quarter, measured performance increasing every quarter as we go into the second half, and now against an easier set of comparison. So I feel quite confident that we're going to have good transactional performance on that base as we move into the third quarter and the back half of the year. 
So within that, let me take a minute. Let's wrap up. Now for revenue, let's look back at our April earnings call. Now we said we'd have modest revenue growth in services, and we did that. We said we'd have mid-single-digit growth in Systems and Technology, and we did that. We said software performance would be consistent with first quarter, we did that, in fact, we grew a point faster. And overall, we said we'd return revenue growth at constant currency for the corporation, and we did that. So for revenue, we did exactly what we said we're going to do. 
If you really look at the difference to analysts' expectations, the difference is all currency. Due to the strengthening of the dollar since our first quarter earnings announcement, that impact as we included in the supplemental is about $500 million. So our operation's performance is really right on target. Now we delivered 13% earnings per share growth despite a $0.10 to $0.11 currency headwind, and that's compared to a very strong second quarter 2009 base. And we have a strong hand going into the second half and improving profile in services, ongoing momentum in software and great high-end hardware product announcements. 
So with all that, and with at least $11.25 of earnings per share for the year, we're now well above our 2010 road map objective, building on 30 straight quarters of EPS growth. So again, thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work.",372

This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rate, expanded gross pretax and net margins and delivered earnings per share of $2.82, up 18% year-to-year. And this EPS growth was on top of a very strong performance in the third quarter of 2009, which was also up 18%. We achieved all of this while investing to drive future growth and delivering strong shareholder returns.
Revenue growth of 4% at constant currency was up two points from our second quarter growth rate, continuing the trend of improving business performance. Growth markets had a great quarter, up 13% at constant currency. We've been investing to expand into new regions and build out IT infrastructure in support of economic growth. 
Systems and Technology had its best revenue growth in six years, up 10%, and profit was up 46%, capitalizing on new product introductions and continued strong growth in System x, midrange Power and Storage. We had good growth in Global Business Services. Revenue was up 5% year-to-year.
Our transactional signings returned to growth, and we've been investing in resources in key opportunity areas like Business Analytics. Across IBM, which includes services in software, Business Analytics revenue was up 14% year-to-year. Overall, we delivered $24.3 billion of revenue. That's up 3% as reported and 4% at constant currency. And once again, we had good profit and margin performance. We expanded gross margins by 20 basis points, driven by better margins in Software and Systems and Technology. 
Our expense was up 1% year-to-year. Underneath this, our operational expense performance was better by a point. We increased pretax income by 7%, and pretax margin was up 70 basis points to 19.3%. Our third quarter tax rate reflects an updated view of the full year rate to 25%. Our net income was up 12%, and margin expanded over a point to 14.8%.
Finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a reduction in our share count of 5%. All of this contributed to earnings per share of $2.82, up 18% from a year ago. We've now had 31 consecutive quarters of EPS growth.
Based on this performance and our view of the fourth quarter, we're increasing our expectation for the full year of 2010 to at least $11.40 of earnings per share. That's up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $11.25 in July and represents a 14% year-to-year increase over 2009.
Now I'll turn to the revenue details, starting with a geographic view, where I'll focus my comments on constant currency. We again had an improving trend in year-to-year revenue growth rate from the second to the third quarter across our geographies, with the Americas better by a point, Europe by two points and Asia-Pacific by four points. In the major markets, we significantly improved the year-to-year growth rate in Canada, France, Germany and Italy and continued our strong performance in the U.K.
So we're encouraged by what we're seeing in several of the major market countries. The U.S. growth was consistent with second quarter levels. And Japan posted very modest growth for the first time in 12 quarters. 
As I mentioned in the opening, our growth markets had terrific performance, up 13%, which outpaced the majors by 12 points. The combined revenue in the BRIC countries was up 26% with strong growth in each of the four countries: Brazil was up 15%; Russia, 56%; India, up 15%; and China, up 36%.
A few years ago, we established a play to capture the opportunity in the growth markets, and our investments are really paying off. We have three growth strategies that were aimed at creating new markets. Now you may recall that Bruno Di Leo, our General Manager of the growth markets, discussed these at our Investor Briefing in May, and I want to spend a minute describing our results this quarter in the context of these strategies.
First, market expansion, which is about reaching new clients and new enterprises, expanding into new countries and into new territories. We've prioritized 16 countries for investment beyond the BRICs. Together with the BRICs, the growth market 20 grew 13% this quarter, and we had 32 countries within the growth markets that grew double digits. Historically, the vast majority of the revenue within these countries came from relatively few cities. To increase coverage in new territories, we have a systematic approach to opening branch offices in new cities while leveraging the global infrastructure. Year-to-date, we have opened 40 branch offices, bringing our total to 103 in the growth markets. This quarter, the fastest growth came from these new expansion territories. 
The second strategy is IT infrastructure development in support of economic growth. Each year, tens of millions of people are moving from rural areas into cities. This creates a demand for banking, telecommunications, transportation and energy. Our strategy is to provide the IT that supports the build-out of this infrastructure. That means high-end systems, software solutions and large services projects. 
Now here are a couple of examples of kind of work we're doing. In China, IBM and Peking University People's Hospital have built an evidence-based patient center care system to enable resource sharing among service providers for improved patient care. And in India, IBM has delivered to Kianex, a mainframe-based education solution, to enable the government client to offer a more sophisticated, advanced technical curriculum to their corporate clients.
We're seeing the benefit of the IT infrastructure work in our systems’ results. This quarter, we had 25% growth in total systems and technology with almost 30% in servers. This led to share gains in system and technology, as well as our growth markets overall.
The third strategy is to develop industry leadership in selected industries, which we believe are most relevant in the growth markets: banking, energy and utilities, healthcare, transportation and rail and natural resources. We've been investing in industry-specific skills by both hiring and deepening our employee skill sets. 
In the third quarter, we had 21% combined growth in these industries and double-digit growth in four of the five. With this strategy and the investments we're making, we expect performance in the growth markets to continue to outpace the major markets and to continue to grow faster than the market overall.
Turning to revenue by segment. As expected, the Services business continued to improve its revenue growth at constant currency. The biggest lift came from Global Business Services. The growth rate is up three points from second quarter to 5% year-to-year growth in the third. Global Technology Services, which has a higher percentage of long-term annuity content, improved to 1%. Our software growth was in line with last quarter. Software grew 6% at constant currency, excluding the divested PLM operations, a view that best represents our ongoing business. Software growth continues to be led by key areas like Business Analytics, Storage Management and Business Integration. The strongest growth came from our Systems and Technology business, up 10%. 
Our System z mainframes were up 15%, capitalizing on a new product introduction and strong performance in the growth markets. Midrange Power had double-digit growth. Storage had double-digit growth in disk. And System x, once again, posted very strong growth. I'll get into more details when we discuss the segments.
Turning to expense. Our total expense and other income was up 1%. With a 3% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved a half a point year-to-year. The expense increase was driven entirely by acquisitions, which drove a three-point year-to-year increase. We've been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives such as Business Analytics and Cloud Computing. 
Through the third quarter, we've closed 11 acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion. This higher level of acquisition expense was mitigated by currency, which improved expense by one point. And finally, we had a one-point improvement in operational expense. With our ongoing focus on driving more productivity and efficiency in our spending base, this is now the ninth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement.
Underneath this, we've been increasing investment in several areas. I'll give you a few examples. We're investing in industry sales skills to support Smarter Planet. We're building sales capabilities for Business Analytics and have established eight analytics solution centers around the world. We're investing in development, sales and marketing to support our new high-end technology introductions. And we're continuing to deploy sales resource and build sales enablement to drive growth market performance. 
This quarter, the SG&A in the growth markets, excluding currency and acquisitions, is up 7% year-to-year while overall IBM is flat. Bottom line, we've been able to drive a higher level of investment in these initiatives while still expanding margin.
To wrap up the expense discussion, this quarter, there are no items that provide significant impacts or benefits to our profit growth. The year-to-year change in other income and expense is driven by the combination of charges in the third quarter of last year for investment losses and a gain this quarter associated with the disposition of a joint venture. None of these items are material. We have no significant gains or losses from our hedging programs either in the period or year-to-year. Now before turning to the segment discussions, we've got a snapshot of our margin by segment.
Once again, our margin expansion was broad-based. Both Services segments improved pretax profit margin. Software gross margin was up a point, and pretax margin was flat at 32.1%. Systems and Technology expansion was driven by improvements in Microelectronics and Storage, and Global Financing margin improvement reflects the interest rate environment and higher margin on equipment sales.
So now moving on to the segment details. The two Services segments delivered $14.1 billion in revenue, up 2% at constant currency. Global Business Services grew 5% at constant currency, and Global Technology Services grew 1% at constant currency. Both segments had sequential improvement in their year-to-year constant currency revenue growth rates versus second quarter, and both segments grew pretax income and expanded pretax margin year-to-year. Transactional signings were $5.4 billion, up 4%. This was driven by Global Business Services, which was up 7%.
Outsourcing signings were $5.7 billion, down 14% at constant currency. Including a deal we signed on October 8, we would have reported outsourcing growth of 14% at constant currency. And this would have increased the total signings reported from $11 billion to $12.7 billion. It's very difficult to predict precisely when these deals will close, and eight days is not going to make any difference in the yield to this contract, which kicks in quickly in the fourth quarter. 
Backlog was $134 billion, with a very low level of erosion. This is up $5 billion from the second quarter and flat year-to-year at actual rates. At constant currency, backlog is also flat year-to-year and down $2 billion quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we signed 10 deals over $100 million.
Now let's move on to the two segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.5 billion. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency in the quarter, and Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 1% at constant currency. Both of these represent an improvement over the second quarter. Global Technology Services pretax income was up 4%, and pretax margin expanded to 15.5%.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, up 5%. This was the best growth since the third quarter of 2008. We delivered improved revenue growth in many areas of the business, with sequential improvement in the growth rates of both the major markets and the growth markets and across our key offerings of core consulting, application management outsourcing and systems integration. 
In fact, we gained share in consulting, held share in AMS and gained share for total GBS. We're getting good traction in smaller deals in GBS, particularly in areas that help customers drive global integration, drive efficiency and standardization and deliver cost savings. These smaller deals are helping to fuel near-term revenue performance. We had good performance in our growth initiatives in GBS. We grew revenue and transactional signings in the growth markets and GBS had revenue growth of almost 40% in Business Analytics. With increased client demand for specific industry knowledge, we've added 2,000 consultants in the last two quarters and now have over 7,000 dedicated consultants in our Business Analytics practice.
Global Business Services pretax profit was up 5% year-to-year with margin expanding to 14.6%. The continued rollout of our globally integrated capabilities and good delivery performance are adding to margin. At the same time, we're increasing resource spending to support future growth. To wrap up Services, GTS improved revenue growth to 1% at constant currency, and at 5%, GBS had the highest revenue of revenue growth since 2008 and gained share.
Software revenue of $5.2 billion was up 1% year-to-year and 2% at constant currency. Software grew 6% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business.
Key Branded Middleware grew 7% at actual rates and 8% at constant currency, and gained share for the 12th straight quarter as we continue to enhance our lead in the middleware market. We gained share in four of our five Key Branded Middleware brands. Gross margin was up over a point, and pretax margin was flat at 32%.
Now let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another terrific quarter, growing 14% or 16% at constant currency. The WebSphere Software portfolio connects business processes and delivers application infrastructures in an SOA environment. ILOG, which provides business rules management, grew about 30%. WebSphere Commerce provides a scalable unified platform to drive sales in the retail, B2B and business partner marketplace. We had real strength there with strong double-digit growth. With our recent acquisitions of Sterling, Coremetrics and Unica, we expect continued market momentum in this space.
Information Management also had a strong quarter, growing 5% or 7% at constant currency. Relational database was up 5% at constant currency driven by a 7% constant currency growth in distributed database. Information Management provides the foundation for IBM's Business Analytics and optimization offerings. We continue to expand our Information Management capabilities both organically and through acquisitions. We expect to close on the purchases of Netezza and OpenPages in the fourth quarter. 
Tivoli had another good quarter, growing 9% or 11% at constant currency. Tivoli provides an integrated approach to service management. This quarter, we had solid growth in two elements of our integrated service management strategy: storage management, which was up 20%; and security, also up double digits. Lotus returned to modest constant currency growth. Rational also grow at 1% at constant currency and gained share. Our Software business had a solid quarter and is well positioned as we enter the fourth quarter.
Systems and Technology revenue was $4.3 billion, up 10% year-to-year or 11% at constant currency. Revenue was driven by double-digit growth in System z, midrange Power, System x, disk storage and microelectronics. We had very strong performance in the growth market, up 25% at constant currency. BRIC countries grew over 40% with double-digit growth in all brands. Gross profit margin expanded one point, and PTI margin expanded almost two points with 46% growth in pretax income.
Now let me take you through more details on the brands. System z revenue grew 15% year-to-year and gained share. MIPS grew 54%, the highest growth in six years. Late in the third quarter, we shipped the zEnterprise 196 server, which delivers 40% more performance than the z10. This performance is driven by the world's fastest processor, which operates at more than five gigahertz.
In the fourth quarter, we'll begin shipping the zBX, IBM's first system of systems. zBX extends mainframe governance to select POWER7 and System x blades. POWER systems revenue declined 13% year-to-year and continued to be the market leader by a wide margin. We first introduced POWER7 into the midrange during the first quarter. And in the third quarter, midrange systems grew 11%. We continued the roll-out of POWER7 with the high-end and entry products in mid-September. Shipments were limited, though, with just two weeks of general availability in the quarter.
Our competitive takeouts continued in the third quarter. We drove over 250 competitive UNIX displacements, which resulted in approximately $225 million of business. Storage hardware revenue grew 7% year-to-year, or 8% at constant currency, and held share. Storage revenue in our growth markets was up 23%. Disk grew 14%, driven by continued strength in high-end storage, DS8000 and XIV. We added more than 130 new customers to our XIV platform in the third quarter, and XIV hardware revenue nearly doubled. Tape declined 8% but gained share this quarter. Taking a broader look at our storage performance, our storage hardware, together with storage software, grew 10%.
System x revenue grew 30% year-to-year and gained share. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-to-year revenue growth of 30% or better. The high end of System x was up 27% and gained share. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 28% year-to-year. We had strong revenue growth from our OEM customers in networking and wireless communications infrastructure. Overall this quarter, Systems and Technology delivered double-digit revenue growth, expanded margins and grew profit 46%.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down $200 million year-to-year, driven by increased receivables associated with a higher level of revenue. Our collections performance remains strong. Through the first three quarters, our free cash flow of $7.6 billion was down $300 million year-to-year, driven by higher capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology, and a year-to-year impact of over $700 million for unique onetime tax refunds, as previously disclosed.
Adjusting for these unique tax refunds, free cash flow would have been up over $400 million year-to-year. Looking at the year-to-date uses of cash, we spent $3 billion in acquisitions in support of our growth strategy. In addition, we had returned over $14 billion to shareholders, $2.4 billion in the form of dividends and $11.8 billion in share repurchases. We have $2.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion, more than two-thirds of which was in the U.S. Total debt was $27.5 billion. $22 billion of debt was in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged at 7.1:1. $5.5 billion was non-financing debt that was up from $2.5 billion a year ago. Non-financing debt to capital is 22%, up from 16% at the end of last year and 14% a year ago. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility to execute our strategy. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Our revenue growth at constant mix and margin contributed $0.07, operating leverage contributed $0.21 and a 5% reduction in share count contributed $0.14. So once again, our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion and an effective use of cash.
I said at the beginning of the call that our 18% earnings growth was on top of a strong 2009. If you look back further to the third quarter of 2006, we delivered $1.45 of earnings per share. So we've almost doubled the level of earnings per share in four years. And based on our expectations for 2010, we'll almost double full year EPS over the past four years as well.
So it's pretty clear that we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth. This quarter, we continued the trend of improving business performance. By segment, the improvement was led by Systems and Technology and Global Business Services, up 10% and 5%, respectively. From a geographic perspective, we had outstanding performance in the growth markets with 13% growth as we execute our market expansion plans. We again expanded margins, gross up 2/10 of a point, pretax 7/10, and net margins up 1.1 points. We continued a strong pace of investment in SG&A to capture the growth in emerging markets, in R&D and capital to support products introductions and in acquisitions to add to our capabilities in areas like Business Analytics and Cloud Computing.
Bottom line, we delivered $2.82 of earnings per share. So to sum up the quarter, we continued our steady improvement in the business in both revenue growth and margin expansion, and we used our strong profit and cash position to invest for future growth while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. All of this supports our expectation of at least $11.40 of earnings per share for the year.

The first one is that your lower tax rate, I think, adds about $0.16 relative to your prior tax rate to earnings in the second half. You raised guidance by $0.15. How should we think about that in terms of your confidence relative to a quarter ago? And the second issue I'd like you to try and address is the quarterly signings. Your last three quarters’ worth of signings year-over-year, you're down 7%. You've missed your signings estimate effectively for three straight quarters. Should investors be worried given that signings growth is often a good leading indicator of future services growth? Can you address this question as well?",127
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3262.0,80043.0,5746212.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Yes, let me take your first question, Toni, on the lower tax rate. The benefit of the lower tax rate in the quarter was $0.10. The benefit over the balance of the year will be another $0.05, so it's $0.15. So we raised the guidance consistent with that tax rate benefit. And we view tax rate as an operational line item like any other. And I'd add that as we look at our tax position, we see that extending into the 2015 roadmap. If you’ll remember, the tax rate that we looked at on an operational basis was 25.5%, and we see that now closer to 25%. So operational execution on optimizing our tax position, not only for the year but extending into the 2015 roadmap. At $11.40, we're up 14%. That's a very strong year. And that's against some very strong years historically. So if you look at it, since announcing the roadmap at $11.40, and that's an at least number, Toni, that's almost doubling the $6.05 that we quoted when we closed out 2006. So I think the roadmap’s been effective. I think it caps off the year at pretty strong position. And I think we've got a very good play as we move into the fourth quarter. So now, let me go to your second question on quarterly signings. First of all, let's look at the shorter-term content. I mean, short-term signings were really pretty good. They were up 4%, and the GBS content was up 7%. So this is consistent with our expectations. As you saw, we had much better revenue performance this quarter of our GBS business. We expect that to continue as we go into our fourth quarter. The real issue is around outsourcing. Signings are down 14%. But with the big deal on October 8, this would have been up 14%. So now we're talking about eight days. Had this signed on the 30th, we frankly wouldn't be having this conversation. And though the contract does have good yield in the quarter, because a lot of that contract is actually new content that kicks in, in the fourth quarter, it's not an extension, an extension in time-wise, an extension in scope that we get to start exploiting initially. About half of that is actually new content for us. The performance that we get in the fourth quarter isn't going to be any different whether we had signed it in September 30, October 8. And the reason it delayed out through October 8 was frankly pretty good reasons. Because we expanded scope and got a lot more opportunity, very successful deal for us. If you look at outsourcing dynamics overall, you see that at the beginning of the quarter, the revenue was really driven more by backlog. And signings are really just one input to backlog. In addition to duration, mix of new versus extension, the mix of new within extension, like the deal that I was discussing, are erosion growth in the base here [ph]. There's a lot of content that goes into that backlog. But it's really backlog that establishes where you're going to be in that next quarter more than signings. I look at signings as an impact of that broader perspective not the base driver. So going into the fourth, there's really only about 5% to 6% of outsourcing revenue coming from new prospective signings. To IBM, that represents less than 1% of IBM's profit. So if you look at the role, the way I will look at it for our outsourcing business, it's big, it’s powerful, annuity-based business, provides real stability, throws off a lot of profit in cash. But it moves more slowly. You just don't see big swings like you would in transactional businesses. So the signings number report has very low impact on the revenue in the near term and even less influence on profit. So it's really that annuity characteristic of the portfolio over the longer term, gives you a lot of time to deal with changing revenue dynamics and your game plan to exploit your opportunity of deals. And we do have a strong deal list for outsourcing business going into the fourth quarter, I’d add in addition to the large deals we’ve signed on the eighth. We have the big Bharti deal in Africa that now expands into new continent. But in the fourth quarter, our performance, as we look forward, is going to continue to be driven by the more dynamic elements of our product portfolio and the transactional elements of the business, like hardware, which was up 11% in the third; Software that was up 6%; Consulting, that was up 6%; North America Consulting, that was up 9%. And we expect to see those trends continue. And if anything, I think, though GTS, GBS and Hardware will probably be consistent, growth rates in the fourth compared to the third, I do think that we're going to see an acceleration in our Software business and our software growth rate going into the fourth to cap off a strong year.",847

If you look at the performance in the quarter, let's start with the major markets. I mean, in North America, we were up 2%. That was an improvement in the growth rate compared to the second quarter of a point. In Europe, we're up 1%. That was an improvement of two points compared to the growth rate in the second quarter. Japan returned to growth for the first time in a long time. So major markets did improve, though at lower rates of improvement compared to the growth markets. The real slugger in the quarter was GMU. I mean growth markets up 13%. That's four points stronger than we had seen in the second quarter, and that gives us a differential now to the major markets of 12%. Now we've been quoting that number for some time. And you remember through '08 and '09, our growth markets were generally about eight points plus or minus a point better than major market performance. But growth markets now 12 points better. That's very, very strong. BRICs up 26%. They were nine points better than we saw in the second quarter. So looking at that data, I would have to conclude that one, we called the right play going after the growth markets with strong investment content to exploit that opportunity. And I think on the recovery basis, the growth markets are simply out-of-the-blocks faster than the majors.",239

I mean, z was up 17%. MIPS were up 54%. That's the highest level of MIPS growth we've had in six years out of our mainframe business. So very strong performance. And I’d say, as we look at the fourth, we should have another very strong quarter for our zSeries content. Now we'll have an entire quarter of availability. In addition, we're going to announce the new system of systems for zSeries, that gives you the ability to use mainframe governance and apply it to other technologies, which will really position us for market leadership. So I think we’ve got a very exciting play on a zSeries basis. And if you look at that, to your later part of your question on the longer-term kind of cycle. There are early part of the cycle on the zSeries business, defers four or five quarters, and more structured around volume growth in base placements. And then, the latter half of that cycle with microcode upgrades, less revenue but much higher profitability. So we should have, be able to exploit this over a longer period of time. We're quite excited about it. I thought the results were really terrific. You look at the pSeries business, I mean, let's go to the content that was announced in POWER7 in January. That's now been available full time, so we could build our plays in the marketplace. It was up 11% in the third quarter, much like the second quarter, midrange P was up 11%, very strong performance there. If you look in the quarter, about competitive displacements again, we're talking 250 customers, $225 million of business there. So continuing that strong position in the market. And as we now go into the fourth quarter, with a full quarter of availability for the high end and the entry, we should see an improvement in the overall growth rate for the total platform. I mean, you can't expect that, I think, in the third quarter. We had only a couple weeks of availability for both the high end and the entry. So I think we’ve got a very strong position. And I would not limit it just to our zSeries and pSeries content. We had strong performance out of our storage base. It was up 8%. Within that, Disk was up 14%, 15%. In Disk going forward, we had third quarter real strength with XIV, real strength with our high-end DS8000. And now going into the fourth, we'll announce our new storewide 7000 midrange system with a lot of new content from our Research division. So we're quite excited about that as well.",451

And in some respects, there is some relationship there as we go into the fourth because in the fourth quarter as we look at the pipeline, the deals, and opportunity, we see an acceleration in our Software business going into the fourth. So I think there is a relationship. It's a longer-term kind of a relationship, but we'll start to see improvements on our software business coming out of the third quarter, which I frankly thought was pretty good at 6%. We said it was going to be 6%. When we closed out the second quarter, we came in right on target, and I expect the fourth to be a pretty good acceleration off that base.",136

And if that’s an accurate statement, the last major cost action I think was taken in the first quarter, which will anniversary early next year. Should we assume that the operating leverage and mix shift in addition just to the day-to-day steps you always do to take cost out will be the primary margin driver next year? Or is there more to think about? And then also, how should we think about the level of investment spending as the revenue growth accelerates?",104

To answer your question, I want to put it in context of the total model framed around the third quarter to better illustrate that. So if you look at the model, we were pretty clear, I think, at the Analyst Day that it's going to be a combination of revenue performance, leverage from both mix and spend optimization, as well as share repurchase. And this quarter, frankly, on a revenue basis, coming in at 4%, and remember, that was impacted by about a point from PLM, I think we came pretty close to the model, right? I mean 4%, one-point impact. PLM, we had said we were shooting to get this at a more like a 5%, to very close to model. On a leverage standpoint, what we were counting on, on a kind of an annual base that would compound over the model period was really about 4/10 of a point at net income. And so, you look at this quarter, I mean, we’ve got 7/10 of a point of leverage PTI and 1.1 points at net so if you want to compare either pretax or net to our objective of about 4/10, we did very, very well. And of course, we had a lot of momentum in our share repurchase as well. So going forward, we're very, very focused on long-term achievement of that 2015 model, and that's going to be a combination of ongoing attention to our revenue growth rate as the economies recover, and we see the fruits of our labor to expand. In GMU, that was up 13%; or in Business Analytics, that was up double digits as well. Ongoing focus on driving for that 4/10 or 5/10 of a point improvement in our leverage. And as always, repatriating a value for shareholders through ongoing share repurchase and dividends.",307

So I think that would probably not be good judgment on my part. But I think that your point really is, what do we see as the opportunity set across this for in an accelerated kind of a pace? And I'd make a couple of comments there. Number one, if you look at since 2000, I believe we’ve spent about $33 billion. So if we annualized that, say $3.3 billion. So do we think in the next five years or 10 years, there's not going to be $4 billion a year? I mean, I find it hard to believe. Number two, we're hunting, just to use that terminology, in a lot of different spaces. And we did have a number of acquisitions in the Software business. But I'd remind you, we’ve had some very powerful acquisition performance in our Hardware business. Now that performance, if you looked at the content that we acquired, it was really intellectual property within the hardware content. So frankly, XIV has turned out to be one of the best acquisitions we've done. Very, very strong performance on that low latency part of the market. Deduplication, that was a very strong place for us to acquire, and they’ve had real synergies not only within that business equation but for the rest of the organization. We now have broader plays that cut across our segments that pull us into opportunities, I think, that have broader scope. And as always, I'd remind you of a point that we made at the Analyst Day, I mean, intellectual property and the opportunity for acquisitions to have a meaningful impact on the business are not constrained to the borders of the U.S. Right? This is a global opportunity set and the three acquisitions that we chose to highlight on Analyst Day, Cognos, ILOG, XIV, those were all acquisitions that we made outside the U.S. borders. So I think it's a pretty rich ongoing set of opportunities. But as I said initially, I think the last thing I'm going to do is start telling our competition where we're hunting.",365

It's so deal dependent. I mean, you can see how much one deal can recharacterize the quarter. And now, we see big opportunities now in new growth markets, and I don't want to overemphasize it, but we're quite excited about the new opportunity we see with Bharti in Africa. That does open up a new continent of opportunity for us. So pretty deal dependent there, and I really would not remark on significant changes driving different performances in the future.",89

And so, as we look at December versus the constant currency growth rate you did this quarter of, call it 4%, will that be up or down relative to that number?",56

On the GTS business, the way I would look at it, I think in the fourth quarter, we'll probably have a very similar rate of revenue growth that we had in the third. On GBS, I think we'll continue that ongoing higher rate of growth that we saw in the third. Looking at the deals they have, how they wind up their resources, their investment in new resource to drive and continue growth and expansion in their organization. So I think they have a good platform for the fourth quarter and the growth rate should be again similar to what they saw in the third. On a hardware standpoint, again, I think the hardware group did a great job. Revenue up 11%. That's the best growth rate we've had from S and TG in six years, and I think that should continue at a pretty high rate of growth. So I think GTS, GBS, hardware going into fourth will probably have very similar growth rates to what we saw in the third. And I'd remind you, on the GTS, that's a pretty big statement because it's the seasonally biggest quarter for our Hardware business. On the Software growth, however, I think that should accelerate as we go into the fourth. And I think we should see a meaningful improvement in the growth rate again based on the deals and the characteristics of the deals that we see in the fourth quarter.",249

In the past, you've given some direction on what you think bookings will be up double digits, up mid-single digits. How are you thinking about bookings in Q4? And if you just want to give us a context, are you including a large deal that crept over into Q4?",62

It's going to be dependent on the Outsourcing business and our ability to exploit these larger deals. They had some very good deals, so I'm optimistic that we should see some good performance on our bookings as we go into fourth.",82

Well let me just wrap up, then, and make a few comments. First of all, we delivered another good quarter. We had revenue growth of 4%. And as I said earlier, when you adjust for the PLM divestiture, our revenue growth was very close to our model. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, GTS revenue growth should be pretty consistent with the third. I think GBS will continue its strong performance similar to the third quarter. With new product introductions and STG and in mainframe with our new system of systems and our ongoing mainframe announcement, three quarters of opportunity across pSeries, new announcements in our server product line, we're going to have another good hardware quarter in the fourth as well. And in Software, based on our pipeline of deals, we should see improvements in the revenue growth rate in the fourth. So overall constant currency revenue growth should be pretty similar to the quarter’s strong performance, with software providing some more opportunity. On a margin basis, I would have to say, we're above the model level. The model was about 4/10, 5/10 of a point per quarter on a net basis, and we exceeded that on a pretax basis, up 7/10, and certainly on a net basis up 1.1 points. We're leveraging our profit and cash, delivering good shareholder returns and investing for the future. And with all that, we delivered EPS of $2.82, up 18%. That's on top of 18% growth last year. So we're increasing our full year EPS to at least $11.40. And I would remind you, that's an “at least.” So over the last four years, whether you look at the third quarter or the full year, we've almost doubled our earnings per share since we introduced the 2010 roadmap. So thanks very much for joining us today. And now, as always, back to work.",312
