112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001565.0,Presenter Speech,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,2,"Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within net income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. 
You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. 
Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. 
There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. 
With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. 
Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income up 12% and pretax margins up 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. 
POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last week, we established a new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. 
We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.
So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15.

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001568.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,5,"I was wondering if you could comment on the services business. I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realize its public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that grow from here for the remainder of the year?",131
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001569.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Okay, Toni, a very good question. Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good purview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as an aside I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter, and we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year.",466

How should we think about the drivers of pretax margin this year and frankly, beyond this year? You've had some pretty substantial improvements here. So how do we think about how much room you have left, a steady state on pretax services margins, which are certainly approaching record levels on an annualized basis? And frankly, where do you have room left to enact further savings?",79
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001572.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Sure. If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number 2, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And in the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward.",312

And I was wondering if you agree with that comment. And then otherwise, what would be the upside drivers to those? Would there be cost-cutting? And/or is there any potential for revenues to start beating expectations as you go throughout the year with this IT environment?",93
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001575.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,12,"Sure, Ben. Very good point. If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but reasonably uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that to build base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number one -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic.",484

And I'll rephrase the question a different way. IT departments have fixed budgets a year, so if they use or buy PureSystems, what are they not going to buy either of your portfolio and or competitor's portfolios?",57
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001578.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,15,"Yes, I think that's a very good question. When you look at -- let's look at our IT budget within IBM. If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, if you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend into new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015.",281

I wonder if we could get the same type of color on what your expectations are for the public sector and Europe in the second half of 2012.,34
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001581.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,18,"Yes, sure. Let's talk about public sector first. As you could see, within public sector, we had 3% growth. In the quarter, if you break that down, the real strength in public sector was driven by 1, education. And frankly, within education, we have research laboratories as an example. We have a lot of very strong performance on our high-performance computing in our research centers. And secondly, we had real strength in health care and life sciences. They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis. And the growth markets, I think, are showing some real strength.",277

Can you just give a little more clarity on the potential size and timing of that gain flowing through the P&L?

So if you look at the point-of-sale transaction, first of all, let me describe that as really a partnership between IBM and Toshiba TEC. So our objective with this is on a combined basis, to have the best commerce offering on the planet, so this is a real partnership for us. The gain associated with this is in the range of $450 million to $550 million. And we would expect to complete the transaction either late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Within that, we're going to maintain, for a 3-year period, a 19.9% equity again as a partner, and we're very confident about this combined offering going forward. Now with that gain, Katy, it gives us the opportunity, 1, to continue the workforce transformation and productivity initiatives we have going. And to your questions on acquisitions, I mean, look at the base free cash flow performance in this business. I mean, $1.9 billion in a first quarter, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Admittedly, even if you took the tax payment of $300 million, believe me, we have sufficient free cash flow in the evidence of the base business we have today to continue to drive our priorities in our own internal capital, our acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends.",213

If we add back the $225 million of rebalancing back to the GBS number, and I don't know if that's right but just assume you do, and take the $60 million, I guess my math is coming out that the margins in GBS would be up modestly year-over-year. And I guess, number one, is that math right? And if so, what really drives the GBS numbers up beyond that in the second half of the year?",87
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001587.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,24,"Well, first of all, all of that does not apply just within GBS, when you look at the workforce rebalancing number, so that's implied across IBM. And so you can't really look at it that way. You can however -- if you look at those 2 contracts that I described that were more challenging in Japan, that $60 million, if you strip that out, it would have grown on a year-to-year basis and obviously, given the  revenue characteristics, that would have been expanding margin. Now on a go-forward basis, we expect them in the second quarter to get a lot of those large challenging contracts, that we had in Japan behind us from a financial perspective, get back to more normal operating conditions. But to your question on the robustness of our margin performance, I would look at the total services base of business. I mean, this was a very powerful aggregate margin performance from services. And again, as I went through those characteristics that were driving the workforce productivity initiatives with Linda Sanford, the systematic approach to deal with low margin content, the higher margins that we're seeing in Total Services, not just GTS but Total Services and our growth markets unit put all those together, we feel quite confident that we will see margin expansion for the year and generate double-digit profit growth for services.",227

It's been a real win for us. In a way, I kind of look at it and say, what a good proof of concept that is not only its application in current deal pools, but as an indicator of the kind of opportunity we have with PureSystems going forward. So I think that's been very, very successful. On the software base of business, they had a great quarter. I mean, if you look at that performance, the profitability in the first quarter, $1.9 billion profit, up 12%; the base software content, up 7%; real double-digit strength in that WebSphere platform. I think we have a very, very competitive offering. So the software base of business is doing very, very well competitively.

And just the  -- you spent sort of, whatever, $1.3 billion year-to-date, but you only spent $1.8 billion, I believe, last year. So as part of your 2015 roadmap, you had, I believe, earmarked, call it, around $20 billion for acquisitions. But you're sort of 25% of your way time-wise there and you only spent about 15% on acquisitions. Does that signal any change in your view? Or is it simply that the reality of the math is never that linear and we should be still thinking about similar acquisitions strategy in something around $20  billion?",110
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3047.0,284843.0,14001593.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,30,"Well, my advice to you is that the best indicator to use now is $20 billion for acquisitions through 2015. Now let's just go back to the math and the way we've describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at that kind of $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap.",368

So that, combined with the $225 million you took this quarter implies $700 million, $750 million of workforce rebalancing charges. Can you talk about the payback on those efforts, the timing on the execution and when we should start to expect that to flow through?",59

If you look at the overall view, I would use the 2010 as kind of a guide here. Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out. On a full year basis, the vast majority is going to be spent outside the U.S. So we'll have slightly longer payback periods. But in the dollars that we spent on workforce rebalancing at the first quarter, we expect that to payback in the year. So I think we have a good plan. We still have a lot of work to do. We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do if you get to closing that deal. But I think I would use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. 
So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work.",374

In the second quarter, we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins, delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year-to-year and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%. So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. 
Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $15. I'll comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment.
In Software, we had mid single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very strong performance a year ago.
Services growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue and profit. Our backlog was flat year-to-year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined Services segment profit by 18%.
Our Hardware business declined, as you would expect at this point in our product cycles. Though we continue to extend our share leadership in our 2 high-end server brands.
In total, IBM's revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days. When you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or $1 billion of revenue. But in spite of this headwind, we generated strong operating performance, with pretax and net income each up 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 points, with 2/3 due to improvement in segment margins and the other 1/3 from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points. So this quarter, again, we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up 9%, slightly faster than net income. When you consider the last 12 months, we've generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.
Now I'll get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas, Canada was up while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year, slowing just 1 point from last quarter's growth rate but in total, still relatively stable. As in the past, there is a good bit of variability by country.
We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain, Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined. Overall, revenue in our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough comparative, BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 12%. 
We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact, China was up over 20% this quarter, again gaining share. We're continuing to build our capabilities here. We've expanded the number of branch offices and now have 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China.
Across the growth markets this quarter, more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate, so our strength is broad-based. We're capturing the opportunity from these faster-growing economies and importantly, we're taking share, due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative. In fact, this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
So now, let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by segment. For Total Services, both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% at constant currency and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets countries. 
In Software this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings. Our Systems and Technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate. This quarter, we again took share on POWER, driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of Software.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.  Our total operating expense and other income was down 6%. This is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. And our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was down 1 point. I'll comment on a couple of expense items.
First, though it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year, we had about $150 million of workforce rebalancing in the quarter, primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs which, as you know, cannot be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. 
We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning.  Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact to expense of $195 million while this year, the programs generated gains of about $85 million in expense. This represents over 3/4 of our hedging activity. The balance is in cost.
This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies. But again, this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now, let me go into the segments.  The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 18% and expanded pretax margin by 3 points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency. 
Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency.
Within the major markets, looking at revenue, North America was stable; Japan was still down, though we did see some improvement over last quarter; and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings. Overall, profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pretax profit and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving onto the 2 segments.  In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency.  Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pretax income up 24% and pretax margin up 3.6 points.
Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about 1/3 of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there would be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency.
Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter at 10% growth or better. North America was relatively stable while Japan was down. This quarter, revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter.
Now looking at the growth initiatives. Within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value-growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in business analytics, which was up 28% and Smarter Planet up 15%. But GBS value extended beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pretax income grew 7% and pretax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue was $6.2 billion, was flat as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market.
Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our Global Software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through the year end.
Now let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands.  WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in commerce and portal offerings. This quarter we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices. 
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide.
This quarter we closed 2 more acquisitions, expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM's Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli storage management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Within our security offerings, we're utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1 Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the cost and complexity of security.
Turning to profit, software pretax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion and pretax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9% or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago. 
Systems z revenue declined 9% at constant currency and MIPS declined 8% with a mix towards specialty engines. Systems z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle.
POWER revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world and we earned 3 of the top 4 spots on the top 500 project, which ranks the world's most powerful computers.
We continued our success and competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our 17th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency, our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we're having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. 
In the third quarter, the Pure application system will become available and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. Pure application will do for software what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. For the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income.
As I've mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we've spent almost $2 billion to acquire 8 companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf, which closed in the second quarter.  We returned almost $8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buy back almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
We took our dividend up 13% in April and through June, we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion, of which $22.6 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our nonfinancing debt was $9.8 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvement in gross, pretax and net margins year-to-year. An ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare; and second, we're dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM's business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value on high-growth markets, emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth market countries delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. 
In cloud, we doubled last year's revenue with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions.
And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry-specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we're getting real performance from the investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity business and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software and reflect our long-term relationship with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. 
This quarter, we again expanded our margins and this year, we'll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our road map.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So a combination of our strategy and our business model enable us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. 
And now looking at our first half performance, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.

Absent from that with any commentary on the macroeconomic environment, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance. Because I think when we enter 2012, you said 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog, and that 70% will be up 3%. Well, your Total Services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps you can address the macroeconomic question in the context of the fact that the services revenue that you're generating this year appears to be very weak.",108
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3000.0,327211.0,15811578.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Okay, Toni, very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown, going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up by 2%. In the first, it went to 1% in the second quarter. Really, that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter, just based on a compare basis, we'll pick up another 2.5 points. So I feel pretty confident about that content as we go into the third. Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter. We'll talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia. If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, it was relatively linear. In other words, it didn't have big fluctuations across the month. But if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter. So June was a little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware-based business in fact, we noticed that against typical -- rates of performance had a pretty darn good last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we go into the third. So that's the way I'd give kind of an overview. Now from a markets perspective, let's talk about the growth markets. They continued to perform well across the board. BRIC countries were up 12%. They represent about 1/3 of our overall growth market business. Within that, China was up a very impressive 24%. And I remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China. We have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpaced the majors again by 9 points this quarter, up 8% on a constant currency basis. And within that, we had 32 countries up double digits. Every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10%. Our z business in the growth markets was up 11%. So I think this reflects a really kind of broad-based strong performance in those markets. Major markets, as you would expect, a little more mixed. I was going to spend a little time on Europe. Within Europe, we did see growth within U.K. and Spain, U.K. for the 11th quarter in a row; Spain, the seventh quarter. Germany was flat, and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth out of Germany. But again, Italy and France were down. So kind of mixed performance within the European geography. Third, I kind of look at brand performance. So on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America it was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares, which we can talk about a little later. Hardware, at this point in the cycle, no real surprises. And I said earlier, if anything, z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up 11% in growth markets. And services, I would say really pretty consistent with last quarter. Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog runout would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that conformed conform with that kind of relationship. In GBS, we were down 1%. We did see, in GBS, some improvement in Japan and public sector, but they were still down. Now within the GBS business, what I'd point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource from kind of historical big rollout, complex product structures that are oftentimes custom into our growth initiatives, you'll see some impact in that translation. But what we see in those growth initiatives within GBS, really strong growth performance, up double digit across the board within GBS. And likewise, within IBM, up strong double digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about 3 points richer than the balance of the business, and that helped contribute to return to profit growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%.",735

And regarding the sale of the point-of-sale business that you talked about last quarter, how should we think about the timing of that gain now and the timing of the workforce rebalancing charges that will theoretically counter that gain?",64
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3000.0,327211.0,15811581.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Sure. Great question, Bill. So if you look at the full year, we've taken our guidance up to at least $15.10. And that would imply, for the second half, about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it's reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter. If anything, a little skewed to the fourth quarter with the new product announcements. Currency, in the second half, is going to be a headwind of about 4 to 5 points in the third quarter, 2 to 3 points in the fourth. And that spot rates, that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter. On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity for -- with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of your question, we regard this really as an all-in forecast. We realize that we do have some tax headwind as we entered the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our Retail Store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those countries and get the cash. And I would expect the bulk of that to happen in the third quarter. But based on country closing, some may extend in the fourth. Now as we've discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business, and that's why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So consequently, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little really of it in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see.",387

And I can get about $0.17 from share repo, but I get like $0.23 from GTS margin expansion, considering revenue was down a little. That was a really good margin performance in GTS. I guess the question is how sustainable is this 3.6 percentage point improvement year-over-year. Can you just -- you went over it already in the call a little bit. Can you reiterate what you're doing to make that sustainable in GTS and maybe how those rebalancings are working into the equation as well?",98
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3000.0,327211.0,15811584.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,12,"Sure, absolutely, Ben. So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our Services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good had as we go into it. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution. A couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we have very good margin performance in our business there. Our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%. That's 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact over time, that's driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit. Our transactional business -- if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud has more than doubled. So consequently, we see our backlog up 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in that transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we're doing on an ongoing basis on productivity, because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the core of our services organizations, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year. A lot of that is driven by automation and the partnering that they've done with research that gives us unique capability that I don't think you'd see in our competitors, as well as utilizing the global scale. But once again, I want to return to the work that we've done on the distribution of profitability in our contracts. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitably within the services contracts, they did a very discreet piece of work on how to improve the value contribution and the context of those -- contracts in that weaker end of the distribution, and that contributed about 1/3 of that 24%. We should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year and I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, it will continue to contribute. Again, if you wanted to put that in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our Outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again, you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog and I think it's very consistent with our overall objective to manage this business for profit and cash generation.",445

So where are we in that process and how much has that been helping the margin? And should we expect that to continue here for 6 months or 12 months? How do you think about that whole dynamic?",66

So -- and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on the engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity on an ongoing basis as well? And so to start that it seemed very logical, let's pick the contract that really in that left tail of the distribution contracts. So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value-add content. And these are elements that when you apply them to the left-hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average, it has tremendous impact. So I think that approach, that approach of really, on an ongoing basis, working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses. And they really had substantial impact that contributed to that operational performance that we saw in GTS.",201

And then with System x, I guess that would be -- it was weaker even with the new runway cycle. And it looks like you lost a little share. Is that -- is there anything positioning-wise going on there? Or do you think it's just the product cycling or any change within IBM, do you give any, so the high end was strong?",107

Well, if you look at the high-end performance, I quite agree with your observation. For this position in the product cycle, we did really have stronger System z performance than you would have statistically kind of expected to have. A lot of that, in my opening remarks, we saw darn good growth in our z content in the growth markets. And so the growth markets z content was up 11%. Well, if you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets that have new opportunities for us, that obviously has substantial leverage in our business. So the z performance did improve. Some of that was back-end loaded in the quarter and we did see, as I pointed out earlier that, that last week of the quarter we saw an uptick in our STG business as we left the second, entering the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough compare last year. If you remember, they were up 15% in 2011, so I think that really did contribute to a lot of it. The high end, we did have double-digit growth and we've had double-digit growth on the high end for 8 of the last 9 quarters, including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content. The x series business will take advantage of their content within PureSystems, and they will be part of the move as we go into our second half announcements of volume rollout.",259

Now within cloud, we do drive public cloud, but we also drive the enterprise attention for cloud in the mechanisms for our customers to set up their cloud operations within their business and then sometimes are more responsive to their requirements for real security and which we can provide as well but overall we think that the cloud business, both in 2011 and the first half of 2012, has been spot on for us.",143

In the back, you give your industry numbers. And on constant currency, I think finance is up 1%, public is up 4%. They're actually among your better performing sectors. So perhaps you can explain that. And is there a risk that you've yet to see the cliff in a sense?",72
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3000.0,327211.0,15811600.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,28,"Well, that's a great -- that's really a great point, Steve. I think as you look across the sectors, it really gives an interesting perspective on our business. So if you look at General Business, GB, I mean that was up 5%. Frankly, within GB, we have really 60% of our Smarter Planet references. So it's a pretty strong sector in its own right, but is also a good vehicle for many of our growth initiatives. And that plus 5% is representative of 10 consecutive quarters of growth. Secondly in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath the public sector, government was up 4%; education was up 16%; and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. So very good performance in public, and an indication on the kind of rollout our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3%. That was highly driven by automotive. That was up 11%. And as you said, when you opened -- Financial Services was in line with IBM. Interestingly within Financial Services, our growth markets unit was up 12%. So really, really strong performance in the Financial Services in our growth markets business.",223

I think you said earlier that IBM expects to  hire 200 to 300 new sales reps each month for the rest of the year. You also talked about Middleware -- Key Brand Middleware growing in line with the market. What should we take from that? Does that mean the runway of above market growth is starting to peter out here? Is there anything competitively speaking here going on? If you can kind of give us a little more color, that would be greatly appreciated.",92

No, I think that's a very important question. So if you look at the Software business -- let's first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business. So for Software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe. Now that's very, very good performance in my book in Europe in current conditions. In Japan, we had 6% growth in Software. In growth markets, we had 10% growth in Software. So all of those constant currency references, all strong performance from my perspective, all were meeting the objectives that we had set. The U.S. organization really faced just a difficult compare in last year. I mean that's kind of a function of their achievement. In the prior year, they were up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business of 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter, that's about 8% growth. So we're going to pick up about 2.5 points just on the compare as the Software business moves into the third quarter. Now the other point I wanted to make is we're continuing to invest in the Software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing to hire 100 to 200 software reps every month. So we think if anything, we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good. And in the third quarter, we should see growth rates that were consistent with the first quarter performance.",266

We've heard from some of your competitors that pricing for new deals has gotten more aggressive, and you're not growing your bookings or your backlog much on an organic basis. Is IBM making the decision to be less aggressive on competing for new deals in order to reap the gains from your productivity initiatives? Or is something else going on?",80

So I think that's pretty good performance on that transactional side of the house. And if you look at the operating base for the outsourcing side of the house, we do have very strong growth in our overall Services business in our growth markets. So I think we are driving aggressively around the world. I think we're driving leadership costs. I will say that consistent with the IBM business plan equation, we are driving for real profit and cash generation and return on our investments, but I think we've got a good play with some areas of very strong performance.",133

Can you help us better understand the composition of the mix in that geographic segment and the visibility over the next several months relative to the other geographies that you serve?",40
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3000.0,327211.0,15811609.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,37,"Yes. One way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector -- let's look at it from a sector standpoint, then let's look at it from a brand standpoint and then we'll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them to once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by 9 points -- and that's a trend line that we've seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We've seen that for a long time. 2011, first half of this year, that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And that if you look at the individual quarters, it's been pretty strong by individual quarters. Now if you look at the BRICs, the BRICs were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business, we had real power within the z side of the house in China. But if you look at across the sector dimension and the brand dimension, I mean we had really strong growth in our sectors. Every single sector had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand. Our Software business grew double digits. Our Services business grew double digit within our STG content, with z growing 11%. And I remind you that it's just not constructed within the BRICs, that's about 1/3 of our business. So 2/3 of our business was also growing very, very well. And we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries. So I think the composition of our growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth markets.
So with that, let me wrap up the call. Now I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBM's business model, delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough top line compare, we delivered strong performance: 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS, both in the quarter and for the first half. 
But I don't want you to miss what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that's our cash performance. I mean we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that's a milestone for IBM. 
Let me put that in perspective. We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion. So in the last decade, we've increased the level of free cash flow generation by 3x. And I think that's a real achievement, because it's that free cash flow that's in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work.",543

For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. That's up 12% over last year. 
Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography, Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter; Japan's revenue stabilized; the BRIC countries, in total, performed well again; but North America declined.
When I look at our skew of business in the quarter, through the first 2 months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter, we delivered double-digit operating earnings per share growth, driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity. First, we continued to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that addressed key demand areas like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Second, our annuity businesses, which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit. And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives, together with our mixed and more profitable businesses, help to drive our margin expansion.
Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter, we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sale business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue and profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I'll clarify the impact of each of these. 
In the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5%, including the currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency, we were down 2%, or down 1% if you normalize for the RSS divestiture. But despite of this revenue decline, we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. 
Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. 
This quarter, our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate, excluding one-time items in the range of 24.5% for the year. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62, which was up 10% year-to-year. 
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 5% decline in revenue of constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity, another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce for balancing activity for an impact of $0.24. 
Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed to balance at a level fairly consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year.  As you can see, the dynamics are very similar to our first half performance. 
Now I'll get into the third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis. Americas revenue was down 3%, with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software was up 4%, services was down, and we had a double-digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. 
Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew, the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined. Turning to Asia Pacific, last quarter, I said that I expected our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter, our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year. So certainly, an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment.
In our growth markets countries, which we refer to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. We had double-digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%; India, up 13%; and China, up 19%. Brazil, however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continue to do well. In fact, this quarter, 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.
Looking at IBM revenue and gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat, as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume-related activity. Software performance was driven by double-digit growth across our solutions area like Business Analytics, commerce and Social Business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month, though performance in September improved as we introduced our next-generation System z. 
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software. 
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency, which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth. So consequently, our base expense was better by 5 points. 
Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity, which, at IBM's average tax rate, impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had 2 drivers. First, a pretax gain for the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million. With the discrete tax rate on that gain based on the countries closed, the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.
Turning to the hedging activity, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility and our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses, resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million. While these year, the programs generated gains of about $100 million in expense, roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was an expense. The balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
Looking at how all of this translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics, by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software. 
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with services. The 2 services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, grew pretax profit 9% and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion, up 1% year-to-year. We continue to see strong performance in the growth markets, with backlog up 15% at constant currency. And globally, transactional backlog was up 7% at constant currency. 
Turning to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we've previously discussed, there were 3 primary sources of revenue in outsourcing: First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year; second, revenue from new client signings within the year; and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.
This quarter, we continued to get revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency, with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter, though excluding workforce rebalancing charges, pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion. 
This quarter, there are a number of drivers of margin expansion: First, increased contribution from the growth markets, which continued to drive higher gross margin than our major markets; second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives; and finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within Strategic Outsourcing. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter, with revenue up 2% at constant currency, while North America and Europe were both down 6% at constant currency. Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continued to drive strong growth. We had solid double-digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. Together, these initiatives represent about 1/3 of total GBS revenue. 
So we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives, and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional packaged application projects. 
Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points.  Margin expansion benefited from prior quarters' workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency. 
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak, particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year, while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat. 
Now let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continued to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings, which target not only the CIO but also the CMO, so we're reaching new buyers. This performance was bolstered by our recent acquisition of Tealeaf, which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our Business Analytics offerings, led by Algorithmics, which, together with our deep analytics expertise, helps our clients manage risk and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week, Software announced new members of the PureSystems family, the IBM PureData systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high performance data services for transactional and analytics applications. 
Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our Storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency, reflecting the value of Storage software. Tivoli Security was up 9% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs, which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Although Notes declined, we had strong performance in our Social Business offerings. In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Kenexa, which further expand our solution portfolio for Social Business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter.
Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, Software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. 
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion, down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency. 
System z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter, we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server, which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity, making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.
POWER revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter in POWER high performance computing solutions. We continued our success in competitive takeouts. This quarter, we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER. 
Early in October, we announced the new POWER7+ based servers. These new systems offer performance boosts of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. 
System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while Storage software, which is reported in Tivoli, was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. 
Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS8870, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increased performance in our new high-end enterprise servers. We're expanding our Storage software capabilities as well. Last week, we announced a virtual storage center, which integrates multiple software solutions to deliver fast backup and restore in a virtualized storage environment.
As you look to the fourth quarter, we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power Systems based on the new POWER7+ architecture and new storage systems, including the high-end DS8870.
Across all of our segment, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency, and we've gained share. Our business analytic solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of analytic solutions was up 14% through the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice. Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue, so far this year, has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. 
All of this comes together on our Smarter Planet solutions. Through the third quarter, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction in our Smarter Commerce and industry solutions.
When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software. So the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. 
Now let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the nonoperating items this quarter is a charge for U.K. pension. On October 12, the U.K. court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after tax. Though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income. And since it's a noncash item, it's reversed in a fee cash flow analysis. 
Looking at the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on the increased tax, capital and restructuring payments.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. 
Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquire 10 companies, including Texas Memory Systems, which closed in the third quarter. 
We've returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 46 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion. Total debt was $33.7 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion, and our nonfinancing debt to cap was 36%, consistent with June. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
Wrapping up our discussion on the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contribution from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we have new product introductions in our systems portfolio, not just in System z, but also in POWER and Storage. We've just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities. And late in the quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa.
Taking all of this into account, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.

Relative to expectations, revenues were short. Your tone, I think, sounded a bit more cautious and you made several references to the U.S. being weaker and the third month of the quarter being more challenging. So specifically on those latter 2 points, can you help us understand what you think happened? Is this being driven by macroeconomic issues? Are these IBM execution issues? And if we roll -- if we look forward, are you expecting either the execution or the macro issues to reverse or improve in the fourth quarter?",103
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3141.0,365536.0,17451993.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,6,"Yes, good question, Toni. So if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first 2 months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory that we saw for the full quarter as we saw a falloff in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now within that third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective, it was really a falloff that we saw in our GBS business, number one; in our software business, number two; and from a geographic perspective, it was really a falloff that we saw in North America in our growth markets unit, which we refer to as GMU. Now elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And those software deals were also part of the GMU performance. So just as our software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the roll up of those, that handful of deals, so would our GMU performance. Now as you look at our growth market performance in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So that would be Mexico and Australia. They're both down double digits. Our BRIC countries, as a whole, were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance, very consistent with what we've seen historically, Brazil was, in fact, down 3%. But on the other countries, Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up a very strong 19%. Now let's look at the countries in GMU outside of the BRIC countries. Again, if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double-digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of the BRICs grew double-digit. In fact, we had 35 countries with double-digit performance. So I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions base, but we did have a more challenging environment for the more traditional packaged solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important that we do well there. So now if you take that data forward into the fourth quarter, I think on the software business, in the hardware business, outside of the impact of the Retail Store systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single-digit performance from both of them and driving double-digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter. But let me add, the services profitability that they each drove, that 9% growth was right in the midpoint of their model performance. And with that, as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have a new z, we have a new POWER7+ entering the high-end of our pSeries. We've got new storage content. We feel quite confident in the at least 15, 10 [ph] for the year.",566

I believe you said the hardware and software revenue growth rates. Can you talk about what could get better in the fourth quarter and even next year in cost? You had a very larger -- well, put in perspective, your workforce rebalancing for us and what cost levers you have going into the fourth quarter and beyond, please?",76
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3141.0,365536.0,17451996.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,9,"Sure. I think the overall opportunity we have in cost really goes back, fundamentally, to the business model and how we drive that business model over longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we've done this year, in total, that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback of about 15 months. Now we are constantly driving, workforcing, balancing to attune our population to the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that in a period of currency headwind, that impact that, that has in the overall translational effect of currency, that's mitigated and partially offset obviously by the hedge. And you could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points. Our PTI was up 2.5 points. In that differential, a large part [indiscernible] is the offset of the hedge helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and this flow-through the gross profit margin. The 1.2 points that we had in gross profit, that had a very solid mix component, about 4x a points for mix and a very solid spend component. And I think both of those are strong ongoing plays that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013. That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the Software that we've been driving for a decade. And the spend efficiencies are part of that overall $8 billion plan that we have for the 2015 roadmap, obviously, break that down by year, it's $1.6 billion; by quarter, it's about $400 million, if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage of about $150 million. The balance, I remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, giving us the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities.",344

I've seen some CIOs stress some concern about, actually, the election, but the fiscal cliff and questioning whether we're going to see the normal budget flush. Maybe you could tie into that what you've seen in verticals. It look like demand for public slowed a bit, but it actually held in relatively well, I mean do you think there's much downside risk [indiscernible]?",89

But I think I heard the substance to your question, so let me answer that. I think, as I'm not going to kind of comment on the environment as if I were an economist, but I can tell you the facts that we saw in the substance of the business, which I kind of described so far. When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I've kind of react to the position because I don't think it'd be a responsible kind of a performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we have spending requirements, I don't think people would roll out and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was my business and one of my controllers, the CFOs, was ""driving a budget flush"", I'd be driving them out of business. So certainly, the Controllers that I have met in government, they're very responsible. They're driving to do exactly the right thing. And if they see spending pressure, they're doing their work to help respond to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world. Governments are under pressure. Spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody. But I think, Steve, from my perspective, when you look at this proposition that there'll be a budget flush, to me, as I had said earlier, I couldn't react to that because it implies, I think, that they wouldn't be responding to the base economic challenges they have and I don't think that's the case.",295

And can you help us reconcile that with the continued loss of revenue momentum within the services unit?",53
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3141.0,365536.0,17452002.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,15,"Sure. If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1%. Within that, our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog, if you just do the math, was up 7% now. There are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So when you look at that outsourcing backlog, and you break that down by unit, you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets, the backlog in our growth markets is up 15%. And that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we've seen in our services business in the growth markets. If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there. And actually, the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter and remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability distribution of our contracts. And as we took that action on the weak tail, that enhances, it improves our overall profitability, you saw in the first 9 months of the year, this year, with the strong performance we got out of the GTS business, but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. And we knew that and we made that trade-off. Because our objective is to derive real gross profit and real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through a services business and drive big signings, but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in your relationship with your customer. And our objective is to establish a strong relationship right up front with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business. You've got to recognize that there was some revenue impact as we optimize to profitability.",360

We're obviously seeing a pretty big dislocation and restructuring effort at one of your largest services competitors, more than we've certainly seen in a while in this sector. Is that having any noticeable impact on the competitive landscape? And in outsourcing, in particular, are you expecting to see any competitive tailwind as we go into 2013?",66

And I got to say, the services business is not like the software business. It is not like the hardware business. It is a specific skill set. So to the point that there is impact to one of our competitors' profile, that certainly should provide us opportunity. But when you look at the kind of broader trends that I think are more significant, I think you got to look at the opportunity we're seeing in the growth market. And again, when you look at an opportunity set in growth markets where we have about 20% of our backlog to be up 15%, that's a pretty strong statement at very strong levels of profitability where if you want to see where we can really put talent on the field differentiated from the competition, there are a lot of examples in the growth markets.",179

Has that had any impact on the business in terms of visibility or some of these deal push outs related to the [indiscernible] on the sales force?",58
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3141.0,365536.0,17452008.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,21,"No. I mean as we hire, and we're going to continue hiring as we go through the fourth quarter, you take that resource and you train it and make it more productive and drive it into your overall sales organization. Now that period of bringing that sales resource up to speed takes some time. But underneath that, if you look at our software business, the solutions content underneath it had a very strong quarter, up double-digit once again. And the solutions content is both organically generated, as well as the implementation of the integration with our acquisition profile, and that's been very strong across the portfolio of offerings. It was a little more challenging and muted performance on the infrastructure side. But as you look at the fourth quarter, I think we have opportunities across both. And so again, adjusting for that handful of deals in software that fell out of the quarter, we would have seen performance more consistent with what we saw in the first 2 months of the quarter. And I think we have the opportunity to close those deals and get back on a stronger trajectory as we go into the fourth quarter. So I think we've got a good software play here, and I would look for them to generate mid-single-digits revenue growth in the fourth.",221

And the context of the question is, GBS on a constant currency basis has been down 1% in each of the first 2 quarters, was down 3% this quarter on, frankly, an easier compare. You mentioned that Japan had stabilized, which is usually a positive impact on GBS. So it continues to disappoint. How does growth improve? What causes this to improve? Or is this the right kind of run rate for GBS as we look out over the next few quarters?",103

I can provide more background. I do think we certainly do have the opportunity to improve. I think the business did what we said we were going to drive in Japan. We did stabilize our business in Japan. I think the team in Japan did a nice job. What we really wrestled with a little here was the challenge that we had in those more traditional packaged solutions. And they were generally kind of third-party offerings and HR supply chain or ERP. On the flip side of the coin though, we did a great job in GBS on those key growth initiatives in the solutions attached to those. So on one hand, I would have liked to have seen -- I know the team would have liked to have seen better performance in those additional packaged areas and we're going to be rebuilding capability as we go into the fourth quarter in 2013, but I thought they did a very nice job on the solutions business, which is so important because it cuts across our business profile into hardware, software and services business. And let me remind you, as we all know, those solutions drive about 50% mix in overall software business. So we can do better as we work on that traditional packaged solutions, but I think they deserve a lot of credit for the work they have done on the solutions business.",244

Specifically, are you looking for growth across all the server products in the fourth quarter? Do you think growth can carry into next year? And is there a structural shift towards better margins just given that your innovation seems to focus on the higher-margin categories?",66
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3141.0,365536.0,17452014.0,Answer,Mark Loughridge,,Executives,27,"Sure. I would break the new announcements into kind of 3 categories. The first 2 we are introducing the new high-end POWER7+ and we're -- I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. It's only a part of the product line however, but it is a high-end. So we look at that as a real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the Storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content, introducing POWER7 to our architecture, and we think that likely has real opportunity in a high-end for not just revenue but margin contribution within their product line. But clearly, the big announcement for the quarter is the new z series. And as we look at the new z series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity. In third quarter, we're really only shipping the new z for about 11 days in the very back end of the quarter. And in front of that ship date, we only had about 3 weeks of selling time. So now it gives us the opportunity for a full quarter's worth. And as I look at it, I think they have a very strong case on hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth. So within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business ought to be generating about 5% revenue growth outside of the impact of the divestiture to the Retail Store systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4-point impact to the hardware base of business and about a 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have a good hand on that content, and we'll see it improve, the overall hardware performance, not just in North America, but as we go through the global rollout as well.",308

Again, if you look at the backlog content, and I think that's the best metric to use here, while backlog was up 1%, overall, it was up 15% in a growth market. And if you look at the components of total backlog between outsourcing and transactional, outsourcing relatively flat, while transactional was up 7%. But the more -- I would not say there were some kind of very unique contracts that were inconsistent with our overall rollout contributing to that.

So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the corporation. When you look at it, we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spend takeout across the business and as I had said earlier, if you just kind of mathematically break it down, it's about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter, that content is in some respects outside of the business unit purview. And it gets to applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics and participation. So in other words, if we take big spend rate out of the back-office support organizations, the business units are the beneficiary that's been take out, but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage on a globally integrated enterprise. And that's a very structured play that we're driving, not only across our back office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic. And as I had said earlier, our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do, just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population, of course, they're going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me, on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So as you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013, I mean, believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012. We're going to draw a plum line to that 2015 objective, and then we're going to base our profitability, our free cash flow, all of those content and our budget to support it, as well as our compensation. So that's how we'll be driving that.
So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Now despite facing challenges, we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS. And I think consistent with the last conversation, that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. The quarter we had 10% growth on our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We're continuing to move up the value chain, shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum in our growth initiatives, both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, as well as our Cloud were all up strong double digits. And this quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Retail Store Solutions business. 
The benefits from our ongoing work on productivity showed through to our margin. And we're returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward, as we enter the fourth quarter, as always, we need to execute. And we need the growth market in software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packaged transactions content, while maintaining the good momentum they've shown in our growth initiatives. And I think North America needs to capitalize on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with the new z, a new p and storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this, we are confident in our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. 
So once again, thanks for joining us and now, as always, it's back to work.",673
