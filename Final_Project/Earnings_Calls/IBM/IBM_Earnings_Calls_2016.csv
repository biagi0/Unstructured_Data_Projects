112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3798.0,951168.0,40442245.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. Let me start by saying we're pleased with the progress we made again this quarter. We delivered revenue of $22.1 billion, operating net income of $4.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $4.84. As we get into our results, you'll see that our fourth quarter and full year performance reflects the transitions in our business as we address the significant shifts in our industry as well as some of the cyclical challenges of the global business environment. So as always in January, I'll start out with some comments on the year, show you the progress we've made in our transformation, discuss the details of the quarter and then wrap up with our view of 2016.
For the full year, we delivered nearly $82 billion of revenue and $14.7 billion of operating net income, and our operating earnings per share were $14.92. As we've said, this transformation will play out over time, and with revenue down 1%, for the second consecutive year we've had modest improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures. I'll comment on year-to-year revenue performance on this basis throughout.
Our strategic imperatives continued strong performance, up 26% for the year. This now represents 35% of IBM's revenue. Our profit and margin reflect our portfolio actions as we shift to higher value as well as the level of investments we're making to drive our transformation. We generated over $13 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. This is 98% of our GAAP net income, in line with our expectations that free cash flow realization will be in the 90s.
A couple of years ago, we laid out our strategic imperatives around big data and analytics, around cloud and around mobile and security, the areas where our clients are looking to us to help move them to the future. I want to spend a minute on the progress we've made since then in shifting our business toward these strategic imperatives and in the investments we've been making, which aren't yet reflected in our revenue streams. We've said we expect these strategic imperatives to deliver double-digit revenue growth, and in 2015, our performance in our strategic imperatives accelerated. Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security grew 26% and delivered $29 billion in revenue. As I mentioned, they now represent 35% of IBM, which is up from 22% 2 years ago.
With 57% revenue growth over the last year, cloud is now a $10 billion business for us. This made us the largest cloud provider in 2015, which is what you'd expect given our extensive relationships in enterprise IT and incumbency in the data center, positioning us to help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments. Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 60% to $4.5 billion for the year, and we exited 2015 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $5.3 billion. The $10 billion also includes $5.6 billion of revenue from our foundational offerings, where we provide software, hardware and services so clients can build their own clouds. In either case, what we've been saying for some time is that clients are utilizing the cloud not just to reduce costs but to gain agility and enable innovation. And whether they're consuming as-a-Service or through their own clouds or as in the case of most enterprise clients who are implementing a hybrid environment, we're leading that move.
To address opportunities we see in this space, in 2015, we made 7 cloud acquisitions, including Cleversafe for object storage, Gravitant for cloud brokerage services and Clearleap for cloud video services. We also invested nearly $1 billion in capital, expanding our global cloud data center footprint to 46. We already have an ecosystem of millions of developers globally, and our Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service has already expanded to over 1 million users, adding 15,000 developers a week.
With nearly $18 billion of analytics revenue, we're also the largest analytics provider, and we'll extend that lead by moving into new areas, including Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things. In Watson health, we're integrating our own organic capabilities with content acquired through Merge, Phytel and Explorys. Health care is a new revenue and profit opportunity for us as we change the face of health care through our cognitive platform to provide value to providers, payers and partners.
We're also addressing the IoT market. Our Weather Company acquisition not only gives us tremendously valuable data and digital content but a high-volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform that will integrate with Watson to address significant new opportunity spaces. We'll talk about how we're addressing these opportunities at our investor briefing at the end of February.
And while we're investing in capabilities for the future, we're also returning significant value to shareholders. We paid out nearly $5 billion in dividends, and we've reduced our average share count by 2.7%.
So we got a lot done in 2015. To sum it up, our revenue for the year was down 1%. We expanded gross margin. We invested heavily for the future, and we've returned capital to shareholders, all while transforming the business. The progress we're making gives us confidence that we're on the right strategy, and the actions we've taken not only advance our transformation but also will contribute to our growth rate in the future. I'll come back to the full year and 2016 after going through the details of the quarter starting with the financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter of $22.1 billion was down 2%, reflecting the transition we've been describing. I'll spend just a minute on currency, which continues to be a headwind. Currency impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points or $1.5 billion, which is about $350 million more than the spot rates suggested 90 days ago. For the year, currency translation reduced our revenue by over $7 billion. That by itself is the revenue of a Fortune 500 company. And currency was also a headwind to our profit performance. We estimate it impacted our profit growth by about $300 million in the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the year. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit again in 2016 not just from the translation but from the year-to-year cash flow hedging dynamics. I'll come back to this.
Our margin performance reflects some ongoing dynamics in the business like higher levels of investment and an impact from the mix of contracts and resource shifts in our services business. But it also reflects some unique items in the fourth quarter of last year, the largest of which was a $1.4 billion gain from the sale of our x86 server business. This prior period gain represents effectively all of the year-to-year decline in PTI margin. I'll talk more about the margin drivers in the segment discussions.
Our underlying effective tax rate was 20%. In this quarter, the rate also reflects the recent U.S. tax legislation and the settlement of our U.S. tax audit, which we've talked about throughout 2015. And so bottom line, we delivered $4.84 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, this is 98% of GAAP net income. We returned about 3/4 of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and gross share repurchases.
Now turning to the revenue by geography. We had good performance across many of the major markets. Europe returned to growth led by continued growth in Germany, France and the U.K. In fact, Germany posted double-digit growth, and in December, we announced Munich as the headquarters for our new Watson IoT business as well as our first European Watson innovation center. In Asia Pacific, Japan continued to post growth led by services. In the AP growth markets, we had double-digit growth in India and Australia, though China declined. Our U.S. revenue was down. We had strong growth in the U.S. in all hardware platforms, z Systems, Power and storage, but it was offset by weak services and transactional software performance.
The growth markets, in total, were down 4%, roughly in line with the last 2 quarters. And from a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia Pacific.
Turning to the segment perspective. Our total revenue was down 2%, and gross margin declined about 1 point. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew as we help our clients transition to a hybrid cloud services platform, bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services. This contributed to our backlog growth for the year. Our GTS gross margin decline is driven by investments in cloud data centers and the ramp of new contracts, which generally have lower upfront margins.
In Global Business Services, we're adding resources and growing quickly in strategic areas while transitioning away from some of the more traditional areas. This shift of resources impacts productivity in the near term, which puts pressure on margin.
In Software, our annuity content grew, but transactional performance has been impacted by the flexibility we've been providing in ELAs with our larger clients. The transactional performance in the fourth quarter was consistent with what we saw in September, but a larger transactional mix in the fourth quarter drove a deceleration in the overall software growth rate.
Our Systems Hardware revenue was up, driven by z Systems and Power. This caps a very strong year in our Systems business, reflecting that our leading-edge servers run the most contemporary workloads. The Systems margin is driven by the lower mainframe margin as is typical at this point in the cycle.
Turning to expense. Our operating expense and other income is up 9%. There are a few large items that impacted the growth rate this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the sale of our System x business in the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in the gain of $1.4 billion in that period. In this quarter, we took a charge of about $85 million for the write-down of the equity component received as consideration. So together, these were $1.5 billion year-to-year impact to our expense.
We also had a year-to-year reduction in workforce rebalancing. We had $580 million of workforce rebalancing charges in the fourth quarter of last year with essentially none this year. So this reduced expense growth by 10 points.  And currency reduced expense growth by 8 points between the translation of non-dollar spending and the cash flow hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. This is pretty consistent with what we've seen all year.
Outside of these larger items, our expense dynamics have been consistent throughout the year. We're accelerating shifts within our operational expense base, driving productivity and efficiency in some areas while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives. This year, we've shifted $5 billion of spend to our strategic imperatives. That's across cost, expense and capital expenditures.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. We ended the fourth quarter with a services backlog of $121 billion, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. We continued to see momentum in our services offerings that modernize our clients' IT systems and move their operations into the cloud-based mobile world. We've seen reports that suggest the adoption of cloud means shrinking deal sizes, but this is not what we're seeing. Clients are looking to transform their most critical systems into hybrid cloud environments, and the complexity of these partnerships, in many cases, results in larger engagements. In fact, this quarter, we've signed 26 services deals greater than $100 million, and for the full year, we signed over 70 of these substantial transactions, which is 40% more than last year. So with a growing backlog and a 40% increase in large deals during the year, we're not seeing shrinking deals. Now about 70% of those transactions feature hybrid cloud content, which reflects both the value our clients see in hybrid and the reality that not all of their workloads will be optimized for the cloud.
Just recently, we signed a $1.4 billion expansion in the scope of our relationship with the European Bank, BNP Paribas. This is a joint GBS and GTS engagement. And as part of the agreement, we'll operate 2 of the bank's data centers in Belgium as hybrid cloud centers, providing cloud infrastructure and a full suite of business transformation services spanning applications testing, business intelligence, security and core banking solutions.
Global Technology Services delivered $8.1 billion of revenue and grew for the third consecutive quarter. Our strategic imperatives, including our hybrid cloud services in GTS, grew strong double digits this quarter and for the full year. This includes strong demand for SoftLayer, which again grew double digits this quarter. This Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud platform provides our clients with a full range of cloud services, including virtual and bare metal servers along with a dedicated dark fiber network infrastructure. As clients evaluate their technology road map, they're looking for agility and innovation and to gain insight into data from all sources. And our hybrid cloud stack is an open platform that enables this innovation. Our clients can choose from public, private and dedicated environments based on their needs such as workload, performance, data sovereignty and regulatory requirements. Entire industries and value chains are being disrupted, and our clients are looking to us for competitive advantage.
To expand our cloud capabilities, this past quarter, we announced the acquisition of Gravitant. Gravitant develops cloud-based software to enable organizations to easily broker software and computing services across multiple suppliers and cloud environments from a single screen.
We also announced the acquisition of Clearleap, a premier provider of cloud-based video services. This will provide our enterprises with a fast and easy way to securely manage, monetize and grow user video experiences. The Clearleap video platform is optimized for massive scalability, which enables clients to ramp up and support millions of concurrent users within seconds to support special events. The innovations have attracted leading brands such as HBO, A+E Networks, the NFL and Sony Movie Channel. 
Finally, our maintenance business continues to contribute significant revenue and profit by delivering a wide range of support services to maintain and improve our clients' IT infrastructure. We continue to see strong demand for our multi-vendor support services where clients can leverage our global distribution and inventory capabilities.
Our GTS PTI margin is up about 2 points year-to-year. This was driven by lower workforce rebalancing charges and savings from actions taken throughout the year to drive efficiency in our delivery model. Mitigating these savings, we continue to invest to contemporize our clients' IT systems, transforming them into digital enterprises. We're scaling our SoftLayer footprint with 46 cloud data centers opened around the world.
Finally, as we've talked about throughout the year, currency is impacting margin and remains the largest impact on year-to-year profit growth given the strong dollar environment.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.3 billion in the quarter. We continue to transform our GBS business, and our signings were up double digits this quarter driven by our digital offerings. Revenue from our strategic imperative practices was again up strong double digits. Our analytics practice grew over 20%. Our cloud services were up over 60%, and our mobile practice more than doubled. Our revenue continues to be impacted by the wind down of traditional enterprise application implementations. Clients are moving away from ERP engagements to initiatives that focus on digitizing their business with analytics, cloud and mobile technologies.
In December, we announced that as part of our partnership with Apple, we've now delivered over 100 MobileFirst for iOS applications. This unique partnership brings together the simplicity of design and ease of use of the Apple mobile device with our ability to build applications that scale securely and efficiently to the enterprise, helping to transform the way work gets done across 14 industries and 65 professions. These apps allow our clients to securely access their most critical data and processes, so they can redesign workflows and drive productivity. Since we announced the partnership with Apple, we've generated over $1 billion in signings from the program.
GBS profit margin was flat year-to-year. Let me talk about some of the dynamics within that. We have a benefit from lower workforce rebalancing charges. In parts of the portfolio where the market is declining, we're seeing price and profit pressure, and we're taking actions to optimize our cost structure. We continue to invest in our analytics, cloud and mobility practices. We've hired and shifted significant resources to these areas, which impacts productivity and margin in the near term. We're also scaling a new cognitive consulting practice launched last quarter that is focused on helping our clients unlock the transformative value of cognitive business.
Our Software revenue was $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Our annuity content grew year-to-year, while transactional content declined. Our Software profit performance continues to reflect the revenue trajectory, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson, Watson Health, IoT and Bluemix and an impact from currency translation. Let me spend a minute on the revenue dynamics.
Looking at the transactional content. Recall in our last earnings call, we talked about weaker transactional performance at the end of September, which impacted the third quarter. Our fourth quarter transactional performance was very similar to what we experienced in September. Given the much higher transactional mix in the fourth quarter, this had a larger impact on our total software performance, resulting in a deceleration in software growth in the fourth.
Looking ahead to first quarter, which has a lower transactional mix, we will see an improvement in our revenue trajectory. We've said in the past that our performance reflects that many of our large clients with multi-year contracts are utilizing the flexibility on deployment of their software as they build out their environments with our broad portfolio, and this is continuing.
Outside of our top 250 clients, our Software revenue was up low single digit in the fourth quarter and for the full year. On an annual basis, about 70% of our Software business is annuity-like, including Software-as-a-Service and subscription and support. Our renewal rates are steady. Our SaaS business is growing, and our overall annuity revenue grew in the fourth quarter and the full year.
Middleware serves the purpose of integrating different environments, on-prem and cloud. To enable hybrid environments, our key capabilities have now been delivered on SoftLayer or as part of our IBM Bluemix platform. IBM's middleware remains the #1 integration platform in the world and now integrates across cloud environments. To put it simply, this allows clients' existing apps to access the cloud and new born-on-the-cloud applications to access clients' existing assets. To accelerate the integration of middleware in a hybrid cloud environment, we've made an organizational change at the beginning of this year, moving a portion of our middleware business into our cloud business, reflecting the importance of our middleware in the hybrid cloud marketplace.
We're also adding substantial new capabilities into our software and solutions portfolio. One example is the Weather Company acquisition, which will provide the basis for our IoT platform. This acquisition brings with it a high-volume platform that can ingest sensor data at scale. This platform can handle enormous complexity, taking in 4 billion weather forecasting points and 26 billion queries in its cloud service each day. This is the fourth most used mobile app, handling 7x more transaction volume than the world's leading search engine. Some of this has been running on our cloud already, and of course, we'll move all of this to the IBM cloud.
And then we will layer in Watson to give it the cognitive capability to apply machine learning at scale. This then gives us the ability to expand this platform capability to industries beyond weather like health. The power of the platform is its ability to use Watson cognitive capabilities to gather new insights by connecting data at scale from multiple industry domains.
Our Systems Hardware segment revenue was $2.4 billion. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in both the z Systems and Power. We've continued to deliver innovation to our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. In fact, about half of our systems segment revenue in 2015 was to address analytics workloads or hybrid and private clouds.
This quarter, z Systems revenue was up more than 20%. Since the launch of z13 in the first quarter of 2015, we've delivered growth of 35% with strong double-digit growth in every quarter since the launch. z13 was contemporized for the workloads around mobile, hybrid cloud and analytics, which continues to resonate well with our existing customers and bringing new customers to the platform. For the year, we added 50 new clients across 25 countries.
Power revenue grew 8%, which is the strongest performance of the year. In Power, we're serving a high-value market while adding capabilities and finding new economic models to grow over time.
UNIX is a declining market, but we continue to address it because it's a very high-value space. At the same time, we introduced low-end LINUX-based Power Systems to capture the growing LINUX market and are building an IP stream through the OpenPOWER ecosystem. Even though the UNIX market is declining, by delivering innovation and repositioning the platform, our Power Systems have grown 4 quarters in a row. This is a good example of how we transform ourselves.
The growth in our servers was mitigated by a 7% decline in storage hardware, which continues to be impacted by weakness in traditional disk and tape. As we've said, value in the storage market continues to shift to software and offering requirements that are driving demand for flash and object-based storage. We're well positioned in these new areas with growth in flash and our recent acquisition of Cleversafe.
Looking back at 2015. Our Systems results reflect a successful transformation and repositioning of the business. Revenue was up 8% for the year and profit up about $600 million. This performance reflects our solid mainframe product cycle and the successful Power transformation with Power revenue growing for the first time since 2011.
So moving on to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $1 billion in CapEx and generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we generated $17 billion of cash from operations. We invested almost $4 billion in CapEx this year with a significant amount going to support our growing services backlog and for cloud as we build out cloud data centers.  And so we generated free cash flow of $13.1 billion, an improvement of almost $700 million year-to-year. The primary driver of this improvement was lower cash tax payments of about $3 billion. Our cash and tax book rates for 2015 were fairly consistent, and so the year-to-year benefit to cash flow was driven by a much higher cash tax rate in 2014.
We also had over $1 billion of improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by a decline in our profit performance and payments of performance-based compensation.
Looking at uses of cash. We've invested over $3 billion on acquisitions this year. We've acquired 14 companies, including 7 in the fourth quarter. The Weather Company acquisition I mentioned earlier will close in the first half of 2016.
Over the course of the year, we've returned $9.5 billion to shareholders, including dividends of nearly $5 billion and $4.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 30 million shares, reducing our average share count by 2.7%. At the end of the year, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.2 billion. Total debt was nearly $40 billion, of which $27 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains just over 7:1.
The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade. You can see this in our supplemental charts. The year-to-year reduction in investment grade was driven by rating changes to our existing portfolio not by changing our approach to the market.
Our non-financing debt of $12.7 billion was almost $1 billion lower than September and up just over $1 billion year-to-year. Our non-financing debt to cap was 54%, 4 points lower than September and 5 points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to currency translation and pension remeasurement. Together, these impacted our equity by about $3.5 billion.
The performance of our retirement-related assets and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts. You can see our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax qualified plans at a 101% and 97%, respectively. And importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
And now let me wrap up where I started the call by saying that we're pleased with the progress that we made again this year in the transformation of our business. We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to drive the transformation. In 2015, we spent over 6% of our revenue in R&D. We invested about $4 billion in capital and over $3 billion to acquire 14 companies. We are integrating acquired content with our organic capabilities and leveraging partnerships in a broader ecosystem to build new high-value platforms. And we're applying our cognitive capabilities to more of what we do.
Within our spend, we're shifting to key opportunity areas, and we're seeing the returns in our strategic imperatives results. With $29 billion of revenue, these now make up 35% of IBM. In 2015, we had a successful mainframe cycle, and Power grew as we repositioned it to address a broader opportunity. Our services backlog was up, and we exited the year with a $121 billion book of business. Our software annuity base, which is about 70% of our software revenue, also continued to grow. Our overall software performance reflects reduced transactional levels as our largest customers utilize flexibility we've provided and commit to our platform for the longer term.
The macro environment, as always, is mixed, and currency continues to be a significant headwind. While we're focused on remaining competitive in local markets, the translation impact is significant. It was an 8-point impact to revenue growth in 2015, and at current spot rates, currency would be another 2- to 3-point impact this year. The profit impact is substantial as well, and given the sustained period of dollar strengthening, the profit impact in 2016 will, in fact, be greater than 2015, both because of the translation impact and the roll-off effect of cash flow hedging gains. At current spot rates, we expect currency to impact pretax profit growth in 2016 by about $1.3 billion with nearly 3/4 of that coming from a year-to-year reduction in cash flow hedging gains.
But now as we look forward to 2016, we'll continue to deliver strong growth on our strategic imperatives. We expect some modest expansion in gross margin, and we'll continue to invest at high levels. And we'll continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Taking all of this into consideration, we expect operating EPS of at least $13.50. This reflects an impact from currency of over $1 of EPS, which is about a 7.5-point impact to the growth rate. Our free cash flow will follow our profit performance, and we continue to see our free cash flow realization in the 90s.
Looking at the quarterly skew, as you know, the first quarter represents the smallest quarter in terms of contribution to our full year earnings. At this point in prior years, our first quarter view has been from 14% of the full year to a few points higher than that. Given the magnitude of the currency headwind and the skew of our investments this year, we would expect the first quarter of 2016 to come in at about 15% of the $13.50.
Bottom line, we remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute, and we look forward to continued progress in our transformation in 2016.

And you anticipated or hoped that Software would improve in the second half. What we saw was the opposite, is that Software decelerated significantly in the second half of this year. And I'm wondering if you could reflect on, a, what happened. And b, while there should be some improvement next quarter because of less transaction, and I gather the Weather Channel will be added into that division, how do we think about Software in 2016? Should we be expecting a business that's down low single digits at constant currency again? And perhaps you can talk about kind of the forces at play, both, again, what happened in terms of deterioration in the second half and how we should think about the forces at play in 2016.",162

Thank you. Thanks, Toni. A few comments on Software. So as we said in our prepared remarks, the deceleration, third to fourth, really was driven by this -- by the mix shift and the continuation of the transaction closing rates that we saw in September. So we talked about -- coming out of September, we talked about a slower rate of closing in some of our larger deals, and that's what we experienced as well in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the mix shift alone, we see an improvement. And as you point out, the Weather Company and other acquisitions, by the way, to the extent that they are -- have software in them, they will obviously bolster that growth rate. A few things, I think, are important to note within Software. First, as we said in our prepared remarks, and the phenomena is really no different in the fourth than what we've seen all year, our annuity business within the Software business. So that's about 70% of our overall Software stream. Our annuity business continues to grow, so that has as-a-Service in it. It has our subscription and support business in it as well. So that continues to grow. And then outside of our largest clients, and this is a phenomena that we've been talking about, outside of our largest clients, where they don't have as broad access to our Software portfolio, we continue to see growth as well, both transactionally, and they're obviously part of the as-a-Service stream. Within the large clients, as I mentioned earlier and as we talked in our prepared remarks, we provide flexibility. It gives them -- it gives our clients an ability now to manage their projects, and they deploy maybe differently than they had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And from my discussions with our clients, a lot of that depends on the visibility they have both to their demand patterns and the visibility they have to sort of the kinds of projects they might have to implement in the near term. So I don't think that's any different than what we've experienced in the past. I would say that one of the things we look at closely, particularly with regard to the usage of our software and how it's getting deployed, is our ability to maintain these renewal rates on our subscription and support. And our renewal rates around the world remain very high, in the mid-90s globally. And if we look in the U.S., where we had a weaker software transactional performance, actually our renewal rates in the U.S. are even higher than that. They're higher than they are in Japan. They're higher than they are in Europe. They're higher than they are in Australia. So our renewal rates continue in a very good track, and that suggests that our annuity business within Software has some good growth prospects. But as we said in our prepared remarks, again, just from the mix benefit of having more of that annuity mix in the first quarter, we will see an improvement. And then as you noted, the acquisitions will sit on top of that.",533

Your question actually cut off a little bit. I think you said we're finishing at a high note in the fourth quarter. I'm going to assume that was the question, Katy. So I'll answer for mainframe and for Power on how we're entering 2016. So first on mainframe. Another very good cycle in mainframe. So as you know, we announced it in the first quarter. The growth rates have been pretty consistent throughout it. We doubled in the first, growth in the second, good third quarter. Again, in the fourth quarter, we finished at about 20% year-to-year at constant currency. And the adoption rates are consistent with what we would expect. So for the full year, the mainframe was up 35%. And as is typical in the mainframe cycle, margins in the announcement year tend to be a little bit lower, and we will see margin improvement as we get to the latter half of the -- or the latter part of the mainframe cycle in 2016. From a Power perspective, what I'll tell you, the Power team has done a wonderful job of transforming a business. And I think it's a really good example of how IBM transforms its businesses. So since -- as we put in the prepared remarks, we have not grown since 2011. In the fourth -- in 2015, we grew each of the 4 quarters in the Power business, finishing the fourth at plus 8. And I think what underpins that and what's important to note is we continue to serve a declining market for part of that Power business. The UNIX market is declining. It has been declining. But it's still high value, and it still serves a very important role in our clients' environments and does some of their most important work. So it continues to be an important marketplace. But at the same time, the team has been able to reinvent the platform, make it relevant in the Linux space. So we're seeing very good Linux placements in Power. And the applicability of that POWER8 platform in clouds spaces, for instance, and running other ERP-type missions is -- has been a terrific boost to the overall growth rates. And then keep in mind that we've also -- the team has also put in play, from a business model perspective, the OpenPOWER Foundation, which is an intellectual property play. So that will also boost margin. So the Power -- again, the Power team has done a terrific job of repositioning a product which had a very strong acceptance and was delivering high value in a declining market space into now a business that has grown 4 quarters in a row with a lot of leverage from here as our OpenPOWER Consortium members start to deliver their own systems into that Linux space.",470

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3798.0,951168.0,40442255.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Thanks, Tien-tsin. So a couple of comments, and I'll disaggregate I guess. We'll talk about GTS and GBS separately. So first, we did -- as we said in our prepared remarks, we finished with a very good backlog growth of 1% ex currency. Now that is a $121 billion book of business. So even 1% growth is a lot of additional business. So we feel quite good about the backlog we're entering with. And even when we look at the signings progress throughout the year, for the full year, GTS, Global Technology Services, grew signings and GBS grew signings. And in fact, GBS exited fourth quarter with double-digit signings growth in the quarter, so very strong return to growth, which put them into growth for the year. So from a backlog perspective and from a relevance of our offerings perspective, I think those signings numbers suggest that there are substantial deals out there. There are deals that play well to our high-value view and our ability to move our clients into hybrid environments and our ability to continue to grow that backlog. From a margin perspective in GTS, keep in mind that at a total GTS level we have very good margins, but we also have a maintenance business in there, which has a lot of margin within it. When you pull out the maintenance margin and just look at the SO business, we still see opportunities to expand margins in that area. And keep in mind, with regard to workforce rebalancing, while we didn't have a charge in the fourth, we'll continue to remix our skills, and we'll continue to move our work to where the global delivery centers can best do it. So that will not be a, necessarily, a year-to-year impact in the first quarter, but we will continue to remix skills. And so as we bring on new contracts, as an example, and we've seen a lot of contract growth in Europe, we've seen a lot of contract growth in Asia, we will have an opportunity. We do have an opportunity to continue to expand our margins as we globalize some of that work. Our movement of work into global delivery centers, it varies by geography, and quite frankly, it varies by country. In the U.S., we're in pretty good -- we're in a pretty good spot here, but where we sign new contracts, obviously, we take a -- we take on a lot of people, and we got to figure out how do we optimize those delivery platforms. And then in GBS, as we've talked about, we continue to work our way through a transformation toward higher value. And what we see from the margin perspective is that the work we're doing to digitize our clients' front office, the work we're doing to provide a cognitive solution to our clients, which is just starting now to roll into our consulting result, that is all high margin. And we see a lot of opportunity continue to generate those kinds of margins. In the work we're transitioning out of, that is pretty price competitive, and then -- and so we're seeing declining margins. But more importantly, as we shift the resources and as we move those skills, there is a productivity hit to the overall business. So we're not relying on a dramatic snapback, if you will, of our GBS margins going into the year, but we do see a very good opportunity on the other side as we finish that transition.",585

Thanks. So a few comments. I think what we're going to see in 2016 is really the phenomena that we've been talking about now for a couple of years, which is our clients are investing heavily in these growing areas of cloud, of analytics, of mobile, social and security. And as you saw in the full year of 2015, we grew that 26%. Right now it's 35% of our business. So our client discussions today are still built around those -- that shift into those parts of the business. We'll also see a continued discussion around parts of our business where they're focused on us delivering productivity to them. Now productivity to our clients means reduced revenues for us, but that's the phenomena we've been in. And so when we look at 2016, I think we'll see a continuation of both of those. As you know, in 2015, we ended the year with a revenue base that was about 1% smaller than it was the prior year given those 2 dynamics: strong growth in the strategic imperatives and delivering productivity to our clients in the rest. So that probably -- that trend is what we're going to see. Now the mix will obviously be different. The strategic imperatives are representing a larger part of the business than they did in -- than where they started in 2015, but that trend will continue. On a segment-by-segment basis, GTS has grown now 3 quarters of the year and as I said, with a -- with pretty good backlog growth, and we think that trajectory continues to hold. GBS improved in the fourth relative to the third, so a sequential improvement in its year-to-year growth rate. But we're not relying on that bouncing back rapidly. As we know, we're going through a transition there, and we want to get through that transition as rapidly as possible. But having said that, about half of their business now is in strategic imperatives, but half isn't. So we're going to continue that transition. The systems business will continue to see momentum, as I mentioned, in the Power business, where the team has done a terrific job of repositioning the platform. But the mainframe's coming into the back half of the cycle, and so we won't see the same growth levels that we saw. And in Software, as I mentioned in response to the prior question, that transactional mix will not play as big a role in the first quarter as it did in the fourth, and so obviously, we'll see how we transition through the year. But bolstering that software growth will also be some of the acquisitions. So I think the discussions with our clients, as I started with, discussions with our clients are going to reflect these 2 halves of our business, which is discussions around moving to the future and the other discussion around helping them drive productivity.",487

You said free cash flow will follow profit. Does that literally mean you expect about $13.50 in free cash flow per share?

So maybe you could go through cash taxes, pension, working capital, CapEx, some of the swing factors and where you think that'll come out on free cash flow this year.",79

You're right. We -- my recorded remarks -- my remarks were not intended to say we're going to do $13.50 in free cash flow per share. That was not the intent. But what I -- we do want to say is that our free cash flow performance in absolute terms will follow the profit performance. So a few comments. First, we did have a year-to-year reduction in our cash taxes. But keep in mind that in 2015 our cash taxes -- our cash tax rate and our book rate were pretty similar, and so the relationship you see in 2015 is the right relationship. Yes, year-to-year, there was a benefit, but that's because we had a very high cash tax rate in 2014. So the 2015 relationship, which we -- where we produced 98% of our GAAP net income was the realization for free cash flow, is the one we're talking about for 2016 as well. We see that relationship. Now within that, that 20 -- that -- the guidance at $13.50 -- at least $13.50 would translate to free cash flow kind of in the $11 billion to $12 billion range. And within that, we have assumed some growth in CapEx for the year as we continue to drive our cloud platform and our investments in our system -- our services business. The operational performance that's embedded within that obviously will have an impact. Then the rest -- and I'll give you a few pluses and minuses here. The rest kind of translates to basically flat, so it really is the profit performance. So we'll have slightly higher income tax payments as an example. We'll have a less -- a little bit of a less benefit of working capital. We have slightly lower pension payments. We have slightly lower workforce rebalancing payments assumed. So you put all that together, and what I meant by free cash flow will follow profit is that free cash flow at $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow roughly translates to what we see in profit performance at that at least number. Bear in mind that, as we talked about on profit, there is about $1.3 billion impact to profit year-to-year from currency, and while the dynamics are a little bit different in cash flow, that does translate roughly to the impact to free cash flow as well. So what you're seeing in here in our guidance, which was a big impact from currency, is also a big impact in free cash flow for next year.",427

So Martin, if I read the press release right, it said the strategic imperatives decelerated to about 16% growth year-over-year at constant currency. And that's obviously down from where you were in the first 3 quarters. What were the primary components driving that deceleration? And what would be a reasonable target for growth in those strategic imperatives in 2016?",60
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3798.0,951168.0,40442264.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,21,"Sure. Thanks, David. So a couple things. As we said, for the year, we were at -- we had very good growth at $29 billion. What we saw in the quarter was about a $1.7 billion sequential increase in strategic imperatives revenue, and that's better than it was first to second, better than second to third. So we did see a kind of a typical seasonal sequential improvement in our strategic imperatives from third to fourth. When we talked about our strategic imperatives at Investor Day, we said they've been growing kind of in this uncanny rate of 18%, 18%, 19%, 19%, 19%, very steady over the last few years. And we said that our model assumes that we will transition to those areas at a similar kind of rate. I think we had 15% to 19%. Think of it as high teens if you will. As when we went through this year and as we said at the beginning, the first quarter, we printed over 30%. And as we said, we're not relying on that throughout the year. So we finished the year on a full year basis now relative to that 15% to 19% range where we finished at 26% growth year-to-year. So we're ahead of what we expected. We're transitioning into those areas faster than we had expected back at Investor Day. And so we finished at 35% of the revenue streams. And again, in Investor Day, we said by 2018, we get to about 40% or at least 40%. We think we're on -- in good shape to make it there. But the 26%, we're pleased with because we're transitioning faster than we have over the last 4 or 5 years, and again, it's on a higher base. So we're pleased with the progress we're making in continuing to grow these strategic imperatives.",307

So a few things. One -- and I'm not saying you implied this, but ELAs are a very -- ELAs are enterprise license agreements for all of our listeners. ELAs, enterprise license agreements are a very powerful way for our clients to consume our software. It gives them broad access to the portfolio we offer like our middleware platform, which is quite valuable to them as they think about their hybrid cloud environments. So we do more ELAs, more enterprise license agreements. We did more in 2015 than we did in 2014. We haven't seen a dramatic change in the length of time our clients commit to the platform for those. As I mentioned on an earlier question, our renewal rates for the subscription and support that underpins their deployment of those continues at very high rates. So the ELA structure is one that we think is and our clients think is a terrific way to consume our portfolio. Now parts of our portfolio will continue to be consumed on an EL basis -- ELA basis. And as you saw us, maybe you saw us earlier this year, we moved parts of our middleware portfolio into our cloud business. That's really a reflection of the importance our middleware plays in these hybrid cloud environments. So some of that could get -- start to get consumed in different models from ELAs that maybe they get consumed on a more individual basis. Maybe they get consumed on and as-a-Service basis. But the ELA construct remains quite powerful. As I noted earlier, the big difference we saw was in the breadth of the access that some of our clients have, and they -- because they don't have the visibility they need to their demand environment or because they don't have visibility to the most immediate need they might have, they'll move around the deployment of those licenses into different areas. But again, with our renewal rates staying high, we know that they're still consuming those. So the ELA construct, quite powerful. It's the right way, I think, for our clients to consume our software and the right way to give them flexibility to deploy it.",365

So just sticking on the Software. If you go back to the second half of 2014 when the flexible pricing started to hit Software growth in a meaningful way, then, obviously, you hit it all through 2015, when are we going to get to the grandfathering position where we can get past the flexible pricing, which I know that you -- when we've talked about this before, you've said that it was the right thing to do for the customer, but customers want everything for free. And I assume you're not trying to move to an open-source type of model. So I'm just wondering when we can get past it or what else you could do to try to get Software growth in your most profitable area in the company.",134

So a couple of things that I'd say. First, this is the right thing to do to offer our clients flexibility as they try to get insights into their demand environments and as they try to deploy their projects. So it is absolutely the right thing to do. We felt that way when we started talking about it, and I think it's still the right thing to do. Again, what's important to us is that they commit to the platform, number one; number two, that they are actually deploying the software. And we see that, as I mentioned, in our renewal rates, where as long as our renewal rates are staying high, we know they're using our software. So all of that is good for the model. And in the long term, we think that we will benefit from all this. Now bolstering our Software growth this year and our Software performance this year will be some acquisitions we made, so those will certainly help as we go through the year. But this is -- again, it's the right thing to do for our clients. And as we continue to move our software into a broader and broader ecosystem, we'll continue to see growth in those clients that don't have access to so much. So that will continue. But from an overall perspective with the acquisitions, which will help a bit, and again, our renewal rates staying high over the long term, this is a terrific business for us.",251

And more specifically, I don't think we've gotten a specific answer on can you grow Software in 2016 and will your margins be up, down or flat.",83

So a few things. So our SaaS revenue overall as a percentage of our total Software business is still a fairly small percentage, but it is growing and is growing quite well. And we are always releasing new SaaS and acquiring new SaaS opportunities. So we see continued very strong growth in our SaaS portfolio into 2016. Now it's small, and so relative to the total, it's not going to drive a ton at the top line. But over the long term, this will be a good economic model for IBM. Additionally, the new businesses we're building have this strong SaaS component or as-a-Service component to them. So Watson, for instance, is an as-a-Service offering. Our new Watson Health business is built heavily on an as-a-Service offering. And others as well are moving into much more heavily weighted towards as-a-Service. So the as-a-Service piece, which is part of our overall as-a-Service exit run rate at $5.3 billion has pretty good growth in it. In terms of profitability, we talked in our prepared remarks about continued margin expansion in 2016. And part of that, quite frankly, is going to be driven by additional volumes on our as-a-Service platforms. That's both Software-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service and our Platform-as-a-Service, our Bluemix property. So we will see -- as those revenues climb, we will see profitability and in fact, margin expansion out of those -- excuse me, as-a-Service properties. Within SaaS specifically, our margins in Software are quite high. While the move into a SaaS model is not a -- it's not accretive to margins in Software, it's not a big impact. And it is accretive to margins in total IBM because we don't have a lot of these SaaS properties. So in 2016, we see margin improvements across our as-a-Service properties. Margins within SaaS specifically are accretive to IBM, and we see that continuing in 2016.",313

Can you explain and talk about what do you think the margin and the free cash flow profile of the strategic imperatives asset is versus overall IBM. I think that would be helpful for people to understand. And then is the mix of strategic imperatives, Software service and Hardware, changed a whole lot from the last Analyst Day that you guys talked about it?",99
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3798.0,951168.0,40442276.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,33,"Sure, Amit. A few things. I'll -- I will -- I'll answer the strategic imperative revenue part of your non-multi-part question first. So on strategic imperative revenue, I guess the margin profile of that for the bulk of that business, which is focused on, again, cloud, on our analytics business, for a lot of that, it just looks like our existing margin profile. So where we're selling our hardware, where we're selling our software in -- for our clients to build an analytics solution or for them to build their own cloud, then the margin profile looks like IBM's. And as you know, IBM's a high-margin solution company. For the as-a-Service component of that, the margins are a little bit lower than that. Now a lot of that is because we don't yet have the scale that we'd like, or said differently, we're investing very heavily in order to drive that platform into our clients' environments. And so we'll see margin improvement as we go into '16, as we add more scale or take advantage, if you will, of the investments we've made. So in total, the strategic imperative revenue over time will not have a dramatically different margin profile than what we see today, again, because most of it has what is our margin profile today. And the rest will continue to improve margins as our investment rates -- as our revenue growth rates meet up and the capacity meets up with the investment rates. Relative to the mix, our Software mix within our strategic imperatives is still at about twice as high as the rest, if you will, the rest of the business. So as you know, in -- across services, Hardware and Software, if you look at the mix of those, the Software piece in the strategic imperatives, twice as high as what we see in the rest of the business. Now it's down a little bit year-to-year. As we -- in any given year or any given quarter, we have a different mix. We have certain programs that roll in. But it remains, on -- in total, at about twice as high a mix as what we have in our core business.
So let me just wrap up the call with a couple of comments first, and I think we've been clear about this. We manage our business for the long term, and in 2015, we made a lot of progress, a lot of very good progress in transforming the IBM company. You see this not only in the growth rate in the strategic imperatives, but importantly, you see it in the big steps we've taken to address some of these new opportunities. We had an opportunity last year to invest quite a bit of capital. We bought 14 companies. We will continue to be acquisitive. So with the returns we're seeing on our investments, we are more and more encouraged that the strategy is right and that we're executing to transform IBM.
In 2016, we'll have our Investor Day in February. We're going to talk more about both the transformation of IBM. We're going to talk about how we present our information to the financial community to help understand IBM, particularly as we emerge as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. I think it's very important to understand what IBM is emerging as, and again, we'll talk about that in our Investor Day. So Thank you very much for joining the call today, and we'll see you in February.",585

This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter Earnings Presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.
I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website or from us in investor relations.
Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.
Before turning the call over to Martin, I want to remind you that at our investor briefing in late February, we discussed a number of changes to our management system and our organizational structure. As a result, our segment reporting structure has been updated to reflect our business structure. We provided 2 years of historical financial information by quarter on these segments a few weeks ago. This can be found on our investor website.
Today, we'll be discussing our first quarter results in this new segment structure. In addition, you'll see that we've updated our earnings presentation slides not only to address the new segment structure but also to provide additional disclosure on our strategic imperatives and to provide more commentary on the business drivers.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.",320
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718973.0,Presenter Speech,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Patricia. Again, this quarter, we made a lot of progress in transforming our business, and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. We delivered $18.7 billion in revenue, $2.3 billion in net income and operating earnings per share of $2.35. Importantly, we also made significant investments and took significant actions to accelerate our transformation and move our business into new areas.
Our enterprise clients are looking to get greater value from their data and their IT environments. They're not just focused on reducing costs and driving efficiency, but using data to improve decision making and outcomes. They're looking to become digital enterprises that are differentiated by cognitive.
Our strategy is based on the point of view that this requires a solutions-focused industry expertise and innovative technology, all supported by leading-edge skills. And so to move our clients to the future, we've been making significant changes to our business. We're not only transforming our existing businesses, but building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. We're creating Cognitive Solutions that marry digital business with digital intelligence. We're bringing our industry expertise together with these Cognitive Solutions, and we're building it all on cloud platforms. And because we're running our clients' most critical business processes today, we're in a unique position to move them to the future.
We've been shifting investments and resources, and as we move our business forward, we've also changed the way we run the business to be more aligned with these opportunity areas. 
We have proof points that we're making progress. This quarter, we continued our pattern of strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. This revenue was up 17% at constant currency, which is consistent with our performance in the fourth quarter and continues to be substantially faster than the market's growth. I'll talk about our revenue results on a constant-currency basis throughout the presentation.
So now over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $30 billion in revenue, which represents 37% of our total revenue. That's 2 points ahead of where we were 90 days ago. In the quarter, our total cloud revenue grew 36% to $2.6 billion, with the as-a-service components growing 46%. Our annual run rate for the as-a-service revenue is now $5.4 billion.
Our Analytics revenue grew 9% on a large base; you'll recall it was an $18 billion business for us last year. And mobile and security each posted strong double-digit growth. As we transform our business and move into new areas, we need to transform our workforce, not only the types of skills, but how we operate. This quarter, we took significant actions to transform our workforce and shift our skills base to new areas and to improve our structure, primarily outside the U.S. This resulted in a pretax charge of just under $1.5 billion. As we discussed in late February, we also had a tax refund in the quarter of $1 billion plus interest, and so the amount of the tax benefit was essentially equivalent to the charges on an after-tax basis. It's important to recognize that these actions are impacting our profit and margins this quarter while improving our position for the future.
We're continuing to invest and to add capabilities to build out our cognitive and cloud platforms. I'll comment on a few items from just the first quarter alone. We completed the acquisition of The Weather Company's digital assets. This is not only a source of valuable weather data, but a high-volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform. We're bringing this together with our organic Watson capabilities to form the basis of our Watson IoT platform. This quarter, we announced a number of partnerships with companies including VMware to accelerate the adoption of enterprise hybrid clouds and GitHub to advance the development of next-gen cloud applications for enterprises. And we've brought Swift to the cloud, enabling mobile developers to build end-to-end mobile hybrid apps. We've integrated a portion of our software business into our cloud business, and all of IBM's relevant software is now on the IBM cloud.
We acquired Ustream, and we'll bring it together with SoftLayer and our object storage capabilities to extend our leadership in cloud video services. At the end of the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, a top Salesforce partner and leader in cloud consulting and implementation services. GBS is already the largest digital design agency, and this quarter, we extended our capabilities with the announcement of 3 acquisitions that will be integrated into IBM Interactive Experience.
We're continuing to expand our Watson Ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300%, and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled. Watson Solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. And this quarter, we significantly added to our Watson Health platform with the acquisition of Truven, a leading provider of cloud-based health care data, analytics and insights. This was announced in February and closed just over a week ago. I'll expand on these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions, but first, I'll turn to our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind to our reported revenue performance; over 2.5 points this quarter. This is 0.5 point better than the low end of the range we provided in mid-January or about $90 million translation benefit. On a constant-currency basis, our decline of 2% is consistent with last quarter. Now, within that 2% decline, when you consider the impact of the mainframe cycle and the additional content from acquisitions this quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate improved by 2 points versus the prior quarter.
From a geography perspective, our performance in the Americas was consistent with last quarter, with improvement in the U.S. and decline in Latin America driven by Brazil. We've built a strong business in Brazil over the years, though the last few quarters have been more volatile. This quarter, Brazil was down, in part due to a tough compare, but also an economic environment that looks uncertain. We've taken some action to refocus our business, which impacts our growth in the short term. EMEA posted a modest decline, while Asia Pacific grew for the first time in quite a while.
Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment and a mix impact within our segments. Our Systems margin was up, consistent with the product cycle dynamics in our z Systems as well as improvements in power and storage.
You can see our expense was up significantly, driven by charges for the actions to accelerate the transformation of our business. These charges impacted pretax income by $1.5 billion and pretax margin by 8 points in the quarter. I'll talk more about the charges and implications for the future later.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 19%, as well as the benefit from the resolution of a tax case outside the U.S. This was a discrete item and drove our tax rate negative. From a cash perspective, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, about half of that coming from the tax benefit. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $14 billion of free cash flow, and this is 110% of GAAP net income. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, it's best to look at realization on that trailing 12-month basis. And in the last year, we returned about 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases.
With the changes we've made to our management system and our organizational structure, we've implemented a new segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we provided historical information on this segment structure a few weeks ago.
Before getting into results for this quarter, I want to spend a minute on the structure. Our segment discussions will also be a little longer than is typical, to address the drivers of performance on this basis and the progress we're making in moving our business to the future.
So looking at the segments. Cognitive Solutions includes the solutions software addressing many of our strategic areas, including analytics, security and social, as well as the transaction processing software. Many of these are new opportunity areas like Watson Health and Watson IoT, opening up revenue and profit pools beyond traditional IT. Because we're building new businesses in new markets, they'll ramp over time.
The scope of our Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged, but we're now providing our revenue results for consulting, global process services and application management, which is aligned with the way we're now organized in going to market.
GBS has been shifting its business toward the solution areas, including creation of a cognitive consulting practice. And earlier this year, GBS strengthened its industry capabilities. As we bring the industry expertise together with Cognitive Solutions offerings, we'll put more focus on the combination of these 2 businesses, which we refer to as Cognitive Solutions & Industry Services.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms includes our Global Technology Services business and IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities. This business now includes WebSphere and related software products, reflecting the importance of integration software to enterprise-grade hybrid clouds. Systems include our hardware offerings of z Systems, power and storage and now also the related operating systems software. Global Financing is unchanged, consisting of client and commercial financing and used equipment sales.
Now, as we've said, the primary driver of the changes to our operating structure, and subsequently our segments, is the realignment of our software portfolio, as software value shifts to new areas. Software is made up of our Cognitive Solutions segment, integration software and operating systems software. We've broken out the revenue and gross profit results within the segments, but as we transition to the new structure, we'll also provide a perspective on total software. I'll talk about it after going through the 4 segment discussions, and we've also provided information in our supplemental charts. 
Given the solutions nature of our offerings, our strategic imperatives are included in each of our segments and so, going forward, we are providing additional information on the strategic imperatives revenue within each segment.
So now let's turn to the segment performance, and I'll start with Cognitive. I mentioned that solutions software includes analytics, security and social. To give you some context, analytics is the largest part of our solutions portfolio and includes our traditional analytics platform, industry solutions, commerce and the Watson-related businesses. Transaction processing software, on the other hand, primarily runs mission-critical systems in industries like banking, airlines and retail. This includes our offerings such as CICS, TPF and IMS running on z Systems, which were primarily reflected in other middleware in our previously reported software segment. Most of it is on-premise and annuity in nature and not a growing opportunity in the software market. 
In the first quarter, Cognitive Solutions generated revenue of $4 billion, which was up modestly year-to-year. Solutions software grew, mitigated by a decline in transaction processing software. Our solutions software growth of 3% was a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Contributing to this growth was strong double-digit performance in our Watson cloud-based offerings and acquisitive content. From an offering perspective, the growth was led by analytics and security. In both of these areas, we have highly differentiated strategies and capabilities.
Security isn't just about trying to keep things out. We approach security as a big data problem. On average today, organizations use 80 security products from 40 different vendors, and they're looking for us to bring all this together. We're in a unique position as we not only provide our own leading capabilities, but bring it all together for them in an integrated solution.
Security solutions are a mix of on-premise software and software as a service, and we believe we have the largest enterprise security software-as-a-service business. Our leadership and momentum continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth in our security software outpacing the market. In addition, we continue to invest to build our security platform, and we recently acquired Resilient Systems, which provides leading incident response capabilities. This acquisition expands our overall leadership in security, where we lead the market in 4 out of 6 security segments. With our differentiated strategy and our market leadership, we can attract the best talent in a very competitive market. We now have more than 7,000 security experts, adding more than 1,000 in the last year. We can attract top talent because we're not just identifying problems and doing audits, we're solving security problems.
Our approach in analytics is also unique and differentiated. We're building an industrial-strength cognitive platform that is cloud based and leverages Watson. It's also supported by industry-specific data and an ecosystem to help provide new insights in key industries. This allows us to go after a new $2 trillion market opportunity beyond the $1.2 trillion traditional IT market. So it's a new and incremental opportunity for us.
Watson Healthcare is our first industry focus area, where we're creating a new market. This is an industry with billions of dollars of new revenue opportunity for IBM. We started to move into the cognitive healthcare space just about a year ago and have invested $4 billion through 4 acquisitions. We're scaling rapidly, moving from effectively no employees to more than 6,000 in a year. Most came to us through the acquisitions, but we've also hired nearly 700 employees, who are highly skilled health care professionals, who will now make a difference in millions of lives.
We believe success will be based on building platforms, and we're focused on leveraging partnerships and ecosystems. We're now working with clients such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and Under Armour, in addition to initial partners of Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, CVS and many more.
As I mentioned, in early April, we closed our Truven acquisition that brings more than 8,500 clients to our Watson Health portfolio, including employers, health insurers, hospitals, clinicians, life sciences companies and government agencies that support health programs. Data and insights from Truven inform benefit decisions for 1 in 3 Americans.
We're already seeing the signs of our strategy playing out. In the first quarter, we closed deals with a few large U.S. health care insurers, who have millions of members that can use our Watson Health cloud-based solutions. We believe that the health care industry is moving to value-based care. It is still early stages, but as the market shifts, we're positioned to deliver value. 
We're also broadening the reach of Watson as it starts to support an increasing number of decisions. Let me share a few more examples. When we first introduced Watson, it could reach a population of 400 million English-speaking people. As Watson has been taught more languages, it can now speak with another 1 billion people in their native language. We are working on our Watson Oncology solution with a number of hospitals that have a combined reach of more than 3 million patients. 
You heard from a few of our health care clients on Investor Day. Let me comment on another in insurance that has Watson in production. GEICO is using Watson in 46 states to enhance aspects of their industry-leading digital channel. They're encouraged by the results they have seen with existing and new policy holders in areas including online experience, engagement and sales.
So now looking at the profit results for the segment. The gross margin is impacted by a lower level of transactional revenue and the fact that more of our new areas where we're investing are cloud based and build over time. The pretax income performance also reflects a higher level of investment in areas like Watson platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT, as well as an impact from workforce rebalancing charges and currency.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue, which is down 2%. As I mentioned earlier, Global Business Services segment content in total did not change, but within GBS, we are now reporting consulting, global process services and application management, consistent with the way we're running the business.
Our application management business helps modernize a client's application processes and brings apps to market faster through digital cloud platforms like Bluemix. Our application management revenue represents about 45% of GBS revenue. Performance was relatively stable last year, and that continued into the first quarter.
In consulting, which is another 45% or so of our revenue, the process of shifting to the new areas continues to impact our growth rate, but we did see some improvement versus the prior quarter. Global process services revenue, which is less than 10% of GBS revenue, was down 1%. 
At our investor briefing in February, we spent time on the shift that we're driving in GBS, away from some of the more traditional areas and to the more strategic areas. This quarter, GBS revenue in the strategic imperatives was up 22%, with strong growth across our cloud, analytics, mobility and security practices. We're expanding our design capabilities as consumer-grade experience is becoming a new strategy for enterprises. This quarter, we announced 3 acquisitions that will be integrated into the IBM Interactive Experience, the largest global, digital agency.
Through our experienced design capabilities, we're able to bring clients the distinct combination of industry insight, design thinking and end-to-end digital transformation. We are delivering high-value digital services in over 25 studios worldwide, including a new studio in Dubai that we announced this quarter.
We're investing and expanding our skills in other areas as well. We recently announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, which has over 500 resources across the U.S., Europe and Australia. This will extend our industry consulting leadership with one of the world's leading Salesforce consulting practices to deliver differentiated, consumer-grade experiences through the cloud.
Our Apple partnership continues to redesign workflows and drive productivity for our clients. We recently announced strategic mobile transformation products with RWE Generation in Germany for mobile maintenance of heavy mining equipment, with Alior Bank in Poland to transform the way clients experience banking services and with Etisalat in Egypt to deploy the Expert Tech app and transform how its remote site support technicians deliver services to their customers.
Turning to GBS profit. Our gross margin was down about 1.5 points as we continued to invest to drive our transformation. We're engineering the shift of our resources to higher-value services, which has a near-term impact on our margin. Our strategy is based on moving to higher value, so we'll continue this shift. We continue to see price and profit pressure in some parts of the portfolio. Looking at pretax profit performance, more than half the margin decline is driven by the structural actions we took this quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our digital and cognitive practices. These actions will help us progress our transformation in GBS.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms delivered $8.4 billion of revenue, up 2%. For the segment, our strategic imperative revenue was up 45%, driven by our cloud revenue, which was up 50%. Our view on cloud is that enterprises see the most value in hybrid cloud solutions that enable new business models while leveraging existing systems and data. We brought Global Technology Services closer together with IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities to better position us to deliver these solutions to our clients. So we'll provide a view of infrastructure services, technical support services and integration software.
Infrastructure services reflects our evolution from a systems integrator to a services integrator, driven by the move to hybrid cloud. It includes our previous Strategic Outsourcing and Integrated Technology Services lines.
Technical support services provides a complete line of support services to maintain and improve the ability of clients' IT infrastructures. This includes maintenance for both IBM and non-IBM products, as well as some support previously reported in Integrated Technology Services.
Infrastructure services was up 4% this quarter, as clients continued to turn to us as the trusted partner to modernize their most critical IT systems and move them to hybrid. For example, at Chubb, we're implementing a new hybrid cloud model designed to enhance customer service and strengthen their industry practices. This new agile infrastructure will be designed to fit a wide variety of business needs, including enhanced user experience, faster deployment of services and increased speed to market.
We're also working with Indosat, one of Indonesia's largest telecommunications and services providers, that serves 70 million mobile customers. They need a cloud partner with scale, and we will deliver solutions on the IBM cloud that will help Indonesian businesses drive innovation and agility, streamline their process and improve productivity.
We continue to see strong momentum in SoftLayer, which again grew strong double digits this quarter. We continue to invest to build out our global capability, announcing a new cloud data center in South Africa to support large regional service provider clients like Gijima and Vodacom.
Earlier this quarter, about 25,000 clients and partners attended our Global InterConnect Conference, where we made some important announcements as we continue to evolve the IBM cloud. We announced that 100% of our relevant software is now available in the cloud through a series of offerings such as WebSphere Connect, where more than 200 million global licenses can now access the cloud. This fundamentally transforms how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the cloud.
We also announced we are the first to bring the Swift programming language to the server. Swift is used by about 11 million developers to build Apple iOS applications to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and help enterprises reach new levels of productivity.
We also launched several important strategic partnerships as we continue to build out our ecosystem. With VMware, we've jointly designed an architecture and cloud offering that will allow nearly 0.5 million VMware customers to extend their virtual machines to the IBM cloud. And with GitHub, we'll be delivering an enterprise offering to the more than 12 million developers that will allow them to build and run applications consistently across public and private environments.
We continue to expand our cloud capabilities with the acquisition of Ustream and formation of the IBM Cloud Video Services unit that will provide our clients with a powerful portfolio of video services and digital analytics. Ustream provides cloud-based video streaming and on-demand video to about 80 million viewers per month for customers such as Facebook, Nike, The Discovery Channel, Samsung and NASA.
Looking at the software content in the segment, integration software was down 2%. Our annuity content is growing with stability in our on-premises content and acceleration in the adoption of SaaS, specifically in the products that integrate a hybrid cloud environment like application servers and our Connect family of products. 
Looking at profit. Technology Services and Cloud Platforms gross margin was down just over 1 point year-to-year. Margin is impacted by the revenue trajectory of integration software as we move more of the portfolio to an as-a-service model delivered through the cloud. Within infrastructure services, we are investing to contemporize our clients' IT systems as we bring on new contracts.
At the pretax profit level, our margin decline reflects the continued investment to build out platforms such as Bluemix and SoftLayer as we drive our transformation, as well as currency impacts. This quarter also includes the impact of the workforce transformation actions, which is about half of the decline.
Our systems segment comprises our systems hardware business and operating systems software. Systems revenue was about $1.7 billion this quarter, which was down about 20%. Our hardware revenue was down 25%, primarily reflecting the product cycle in our z Systems. Operating systems continued to be a headwind to growth. This quarter, the revenue was down 7%.
So looking at the hardware performance by brand, our z Systems revenue was down 42% on the back of a very strong performance of up 130% last year when we launched our new z13. Typically, we see better margins in z Systems as we move into the back half of the cycle, and we did see some good margin improvement this quarter.
After 4 quarters of growth, power revenue was down double digits as we wrapped on the strong performance in UNIX-based entry systems from last year. But we had continued momentum in our Linux offerings and expansion of OpenPOWER efforts. We've been focused on the growth in power-based Linux systems, and they have now grown to about 10% of the overall revenue base.
We recently signed a deal with a large enterprise in China that is dramatically growing its Linux server footprint and has chosen Linux on Power, partly because they can do it with half of the footprint they would have required with x86. The relationship will lead to the installation of thousands of Linux on Power Systems.
We also continue to see good traction with the OpenPOWER Foundation-based innovations, which will ultimately drive adoption of the power platform and provide intellectual property income.
Just a few weeks ago, Google, a founding member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, announced that it is working with Rackspace, an Open Compute Project founding member, to codevelop an open server specification based around IBM's new POWER9 architecture. The 2 companies will submit a candidate POWER9 server design to the Open Compute Project. 
Turning to storage. Hardware revenue was down 6%, which continues to reflect weakness in the overall storage market. We are well positioned to capture the strategic growth areas of flash, software-defined storage and object storage, which together grew in the quarter. Our systems gross profit margin was up, with improvement across z Systems, power and storage. Our pretax income decline reflects the improved gross margin on the lower revenue and the impact of the actions we took this quarter, which is about half of the decline.
So now let me come back to the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was down less than 1%. This is a significant improvement from our performance last quarter, which was down 6%. We got the improvement we expected from the higher mix of annuity versus transactional content in the first quarter. In addition, we've been adding a lot of new capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, and this quarter, software growth reflected the acquisitions which closed over the last year. These acquisitions contribute revenue growth but impact our profit performance in the first year.
Our annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter, with steady renewal rates and growth in our SaaS business. From a product area perspective, growth in our solutions software was offset by a continued headwind in operating systems and transaction processing software.
Let me make one other comment on our software performance. As I mentioned earlier, total software includes Cognitive Solutions, integration software and operating systems. This includes a portion of our software support line revenue that was previously reported in our GTS segment. The addition of support line did not impact our software growth rate this quarter. Our software revenue was down 0.8 points including support line and would have been down 0.8 points without support line.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables, and $2.3 billion of free cash flow. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year. This year-to-year increase was driven by the tax benefit of $1 billion plus interest. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions that impacted our profit this quarter and will impact our cash flow over the next several quarters.
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter. We invested just under $1 billion in capital expenditures, with continued investment in cloud capacity. We closed 6 acquisitions this quarter, and acquisition spend was over $2.5 billion, with the largest being The Weather Company transaction. The Truven acquisition closed about 1.5 weeks ago and so will be included in our second quarter acquisition spend.
We returned over $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.2 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 6.5 million shares. At the end of March, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion in cash and $46 billion in total debt, both of which are up an equivalent amount from year-end, driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances. About $27 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.
I want to mention that the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 51% investment grade, which you can see in the supplemental charts. We had a few point reduction in investment grade over the last couple of quarters driven by rating changes in our existing portfolio, not by changes in how we approach the market. Now this data is based on the credit ratings of the companies in our portfolio. We do take actions to transfer exposure to third parties, where we then get the credit ratings of the insurance companies. We've done this for many years, and on that basis, our investment-grade content increases by 14 points to 65%.
Our non-financing debt was $18.8 billion, up year-to-year, driven by the timing of our debt issuances this year relative to the maturities and, as I mentioned, the increase is equivalent to the increase in cash. We continue to be very well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy.
Let me spend a minute on some of the larger items that impacted the first quarter results and give you a sense of the implications of these actions for the balance of the year. The tax benefit contributed about $1.20 to EPS. As I mentioned, our underlying tax rate was 19% in the quarter, consistent with the range we provided at the beginning of the year of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points. This, of course, doesn't include discrete or onetime items.
As we transform our business, we need to transform our workforce, and this quarter, we took a pretax charge for workforce rebalancing of $1 billion or $0.84 of earnings per share. Some of this charge is used to take action where we've been dealing with underutilization, but the vast majority is to shift and rebalance our skills. As we build new businesses in areas like Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things, this requires different skills and to be in different places. I mentioned earlier that over the last year, we've added over 6,000 resources in Watson Health and added over 1,000 security experts. These are specialized skills in highly competitive areas.
So this is not about reducing our capacity. This is about transforming our workforce. We started the year with just under 380,000 people. We have people leaving the business, but we're also adding large numbers of resources. We currently have tens of thousands of open positions, and we're hiring aggressively. So if we have similar hiring dynamics to last year, we could end the year with an employee base that is about the same as where we started. Our hiring will be aligned to where we see demand, by skill area and by geography. As we look at the resource actions, about 90% of the spending is outside the U.S.
Now looking at the returns on this action. We expect we'll save about $500 million this year, maybe a little more, and nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. When you look at the makeup of the $1 billion charge, a couple of hundred was in the run rate and drives the bulk of the $500 million savings this year. The balance of the charge was for actions that yield the remainder due to the geographic mix and timing. But as I said, this is about rebalancing skills rather than capacity reduction. And so we think about this as spending that is freed up to be reinvested in building capabilities in our strategic imperatives. 
As we transform our workforce, we're changing how we're working: more agile, more collaboratively, and this requires a different work environment. So this quarter, we took a real estate charge of over $300 million as we change the way we work: moving to agile with less space required. We also took actions to reposition the business in Latin America in light of the macro conditions. I mentioned earlier that we've refocused our business in Brazil, including reducing exposure in our financing and services portfolio this quarter. We also reduced our exposure in Venezuela. 
As you know, we've always had some unique items in the quarter, but we've included here the items that accelerate our transformation. We didn't include, for example, the nearly $40 million loss from the sale of our remaining equity position in Lenovo. We have no future exposure there. 
So we made good progress in transforming our business this quarter. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, and as I said earlier, they now represent 37% of our revenue. We added significant capabilities this quarter through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships, and we took significant actions to improve our position for the long term. 
As we look forward, we expect much of what we saw in the first quarter to continue. We expect to drive strong growth in our strategic imperatives. 
Our acquisitions are starting to contribute to our top line, and while they are a drag on profit in the first few quarters, they will certainly contribute to the profit base over time. We will continue to invest at a high level. Much of the capabilities we're building are cloud-based and delivered as a service. Both the higher investment levels and the return profile put some pressure on our profit in the near term, but we're confident it's right for the long term. As I just mentioned, we'll start to yield some of the benefits from the actions we just took, though we do expect much of it to be reinvested. When we take all of this into consideration, we continue to expect at least $13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year. 
You'll recall last quarter I said that we expect free cash flow realization of GAAP net income in the 90s, which implied a range of $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow for the year at the $13.50 level. We have now improved our view of free cash flow for the year and now expect free cash flow to come in at the high end of that range at that same profit level. 
As we look at the second quarter, we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. In fact, last year, it was a $1 billion increase in pretax income. This year, we expect more, given the significant charges in our first quarter, but we'll also have an impact from the acquisition ramp and quarter-to-quarter impact from currency hedges. Put it all together, and we see about a $2 billion increase in pretax profit from first to second quarter. 
With our anticipated tax rate and our share repurchase at that profit level, we'd achieve between 38% and 39% of the $13.50 of earnings per share by the end of the first half. 
So to finish, again this quarter, we made a lot of progress in transforming our business, and we got done what we set out to do to start the year.

Thanks, Tien-tsin. So you're right. If we were just to line up the math of where we finished relative to the at least $13.50 at that base level, we'd be about 17%. So the first quarter, I would say, I'd characterize a couple of ways. One, on the top line, we got done what we wanted to get done. And in fact, the signpost that we've given to our investor community around driving double-digit growth while we continue to invest in those areas played out pretty much as we expected. And we are growing our revenue in those strategic imperatives faster than the marketplace, which we think is an important element as we transform the business. At the -- on the profit side, the first quarter played out kind of the way we said we would get done what we would in February, which was we were going to get a tax benefit and that we were going to accelerate the transformation. So we put all of that together, and while -- because we had some of the restructuring already in the run rate, if you will, we sort of -- we did better, if you will, than what the original guidance implied. So the math you're doing is kind of spot on relative to that $13.50. We are seeing the dynamics and the revenue lines that we had expected. And we're seeing the profit equation come together as we kind of expected, again, given that nuance that we had some of the restructuring in the run rate. The other thing I'd point out, what's not in yet is obviously some of the newer acquisition content. We closed on Truven about 1.5 weeks ago. We closed on The Weather Company's digital assets during the quarter, so not a full quarter. Those come also with our intent to grow the spending in those, to create new solutions. So when they come in, at whatever profitability they were, we build our business cases around substantial investment in those 2. So we'll get the revenue, but the profit impact will -- as we said in the prepared remarks, will last for a couple of quarters.",363

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718979.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,8,"I just wanted to clarify something, just to be -- because you said it very quickly at the end of the call, and then I have a real question. So you're guiding for 38% to 39% of earnings in the first half, which I think implies $2.85 in EPS for Q2. That's about $0.60 below consensus and only about 21% increase sequentially. Historically, I think you're at 30% or 35%. So I just want to be sure I did the math right on that. That's the clarification. And my real question is it's really just where you think you are in the transformation. We continue to see really good growth on the strategic imperatives, but revenue growth at constant currency was minus 2 and I think, on an organic basis, was probably about minus 3. And that's kind of at the low end of what you've done over the last 8 quarters or so. So maybe you could help us understand, is it just the combination of the transformation still requiring time? Or is there something about the move to an as-a-service model? But why aren't we starting -- why aren't we seeing some gradual improvement in revenue on a constant-currency basis? And can you help us understand is there something that you either over anniversary or overlap or when investors should think about seeing that inflection point in terms of improving revenues?",233
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718980.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks, Toni. So first, on your clarifying non-question. I think the way you described it is what we said. We said we'd get 38% to 39% of the first half done. And your math was right on. The one thing, though, I think it's important to remember, and I know you know this, but I think we have to bear in mind. The business looks fundamentally different as we transform it. And so using first half averages from days gone by when currency was different and the level of transformation and the pace of transformation was different and the levels of investment were different, I would caution our investors to make sure they understand the underpinnings of that. And so that's why we laid out, if you will, within my prepared remarks, that's why we laid out what we saw happening in this quarter from first to second. So again, your math was right. We said 38% to 39%, but again, there is a lot more going on within the transformation than just the statistics. And I think it's important to understand the componentry. In terms of where we are in the transformation, I think I'd make a few comments. One, continued growth in the strategic imperatives. As you said, good growth, and we're pleased with the double-digit growth. It's a big part of how we are measuring our progress. The other element that we're measuring, and we talked about this on -- at Investor Day and it holds true as well in the first, is are there spaces we're going to, are they generating higher value than the spaces we're moving from? And as we showed in Investor Day, our margins, our gross margins in those new areas continue to be higher, and they were higher again in the first. So that's an important element for us. Again, grow those businesses and make sure they're higher value. At the same time, part of our transformation is to create new opportunities. And so we spent a bit of time in Investor Day, as you know, talking about not only the traditional IT opportunity. And I would put things like our new cloud video services unit into that, where we get to apply a globally scalable cloud approach on an industry basis with our industry expertise. And so that's a good example of how we're shifting into new areas in the cloud world in the traditional space. But part of this transformation is all about moving into businesses that don't yet exist. And so when you mention, is it as a service? Is it something else? These are as-a-service businesses. And so they do take a while to -- we do expect they'd take a while to ramp. But we did get to put a lot of money to work over the past 12 months. In fact, our acquisition activity over the last 12 months, if you include Truven now, so we just closed Truven about 1.5 weeks ago, we spent about $9 billion now over that time period on acquisitions, which is more than we've spent in any 12-month period in IBM. So part of this is also on building those new businesses. So where are we in the transformation? It is continued focus on shifting our investments into those strategic imperatives. It is making sure that the space we're moving to is higher-margin and higher profit opportunity for us and then making sure we're investing aggressively to keep those businesses growing.",583

And both of those declines improved from what you outlined happened in 2015 at the Analyst Day. At the same time, deferred revenue grew for the first time in almost 2 years, which is tied to at least the software portion of the business. So just curious, if you isolate those 2 segments where you've had some big headwinds, do you feel like you're moving beyond that and you've seen a sustainable turn in those businesses? Or is there something about annuity versus transactional mix in the first quarter, where we shouldn't assume that those businesses continue to get better?",112
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718983.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Sure, Katy. So a couple of things. First, on Software. We did talk about, in January, that we would get an improved trajectory in our Software business just from the mix of transactional and annuity. We did get that. So we did see an improvement from the mix in lower transactional content in the first than in the fourth. That drove some improvement. Secondly, we also got a benefit from the acquisition content that closed. That added about 2 points as well to the Software performance. So with the annuity component of our Software business continuing to grow, with the acquisition content coming in, I do feel okay about our Software business going forward. And the acquisitions that we've completed more recently will also help support that Software business. So from a revenue perspective, I feel okay about the investments we've made and the future of the Software business. Now, on the profit side, those take spending to create the kinds of solutions that we think will create new markets. So we'll continue to invest heavily. But the improvement we got from the mix was what we said we would get in the first, and then we got the benefit of acquisitions as well. Oh sorry. I'm sorry, Katy. You also asked about GBS. So on GBS, we did see a sequential improvement from fourth to first. And we saw that in our consulting business as well. Now, in the GBS businesses, the strategic imperatives content continues to do fine in the GBS business. And we'll continue to shift our labor pools and our expertise into those. And you saw that we made some acquisitions in that digital channel to create -- again, to keep our lead, I should say, in being the world's largest digital agency. What you also saw us do in -- over the last few months now in GBS is we moved -- we continued to move our business to where we see the greatest consulting opportunities. And quite frankly, we stayed in these big ERP implementations a bit too long. And so now what you saw us buy a few months ago was a company called Meteorix, which is really built around helping companies move into Workday solutions. And then you saw us recently announce the acquisition of a company called Bluewolf, which works on Salesforce implementations. And so as the world moves into what we've always said it would, which is that the shift to cloud creates consulting opportunities because companies have to fundamentally change workflow, we did, quite frankly, move a little bit late. So we're playing a little bit of catch-up in that part of the business. But with these 2 acquisitions, we'll drive growth in what are 2 pretty hot market opportunities, and we'll continue then to pull resources away from that commoditizing content and drive more the shift into the strategic imperatives.",482

So based on current visibility, can growth stay on this trajectory in the more seasonally difficult second quarter? And will acquisitions actually contribute more in the June quarter, given the first quarter activity?",45
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718986.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Yes. So the simple answer is that acquisitions that we've gotten done now will add again to the growth rate in the second quarter. If I looked at -- if we look at just the Cognitive Solutions segment as an example, part of that business, our transaction processing system business, that's a very high-value business. It declined 5% in the quarter. But it's in a declining market opportunity space. And so we're providing very high value to our clients. We run their most important transaction systems. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to refresh those products to deliver some new capability. But quite frankly, that is an opportunity that will decline over time. But again, we'll decline with it. We won't lose share. When we look at the Software solutions part of that cognitive segment, you saw that we got back to low single-digit growth in the first. And with the acquisition content, we see that continuing to accelerate even in the second already. So that acquisition content will help bolster the Software results as we go through the rest of the year.",184

You have strategic imperatives there at $3.1 billion and that the total category is $4.1 billion. So when we look at the revenue, should we assume that, that $1 billion that's not in the strategic imperatives not growing is what's basically got to wind down? And maybe you could give us an idea as how quickly you think you can transfer that over? Or maybe the -- or maybe I can do the math on the percent decline, if that's accurate?",87

I guess, the way to think about it is that within the Global Business Services, that the areas we're moving out of have a lot of price pressure. So implementing these large-scale ERP implementations, we see a lot of price pressure in there. And the areas we're moving into are continuing to grow pretty well. But we're building those, by the way. They're going to take a while to build. Some of them are brand-new practices. So as an example, we just announced the creation last year, the end of last year, of a cognitive practice. That doesn't exist anywhere; it's the world's first. We're building skills there. So within the GBS segment, again, this shift we've been working on, we were a little bit late in some parts of it and moving more into -- if you will, moving more into the consulting side of this. But we have the total of strategic imperatives is -- within that segment is about $2 billion of the $4.1 billion. The chart that you may be looking at is not additive, right. Those are -- the strategic imperatives are $2 billion. The cloud element is $600 million. That's within the $2 billion. As then the as-a-service is half. That's within that as well. So it's not additive. It's not $3.1 billion of the $4 billion. It's $2 billion of the $4 billion, with those 2 as the components.",237

Thank you for the non-multipart -- it's okay, Steve. As you said, they're good questions because they're -- it's all important data. So first, on constant currency. We said that, in total, the currency impact would be over $1 billion for us in the year. Now, bear in mind that a big part of that, the bulk of that, almost all of it was because of the hedges we had last year which we're not going to get this year. So we had to work our way through that. Now, at current rates, obviously, we see -- we still see the same size impact from the hedges because those are there last year. At current rates, we would get a bit of a translation benefit. But I think it's really important to recognize that while as much as we'd like to think this is uniform on both sides of a dollar move, and we do believe that a weaker dollar on balance helps us, a weaker dollar also drives renegotiation and price and other things that come into the equation. So the impact, at this point, the hedge impact on constant -- on the currency rates today is obviously exactly the same. We do a little bit better at this point in profit. If we were able to keep it, we do a little bit better there for the rest of the year. On free cash flow, I'd say it really is -- I wouldn't attribute it all to the tax that we got back. I would attribute it to we're through 90 days. We've got a $100-plus billion balance sheet. And when we look at the ins and outs and the efficiency of that balance sheet, we feel incrementally more positive about the realization for the year. And then on restructuring, this is something where you -- and we tried to go through this a bit in the prepared remarks, it really is about shifting the workforce from a set of skills that have value in the marketplace today to a new set of skills where we're trying to build new businesses. The minority of the charge, if you will, is for reductions in usable capacity. And most of that's outside the U.S. The bulk of this is to get new set of skills. So as we build a Watson Health business, as we build our security practice, we are adding new skills. So we'll see. We think about our ability to acquire skills. In many of these sectors, we will hire them as quickly as the world can create them. We hired 1,000 security experts last year. And quite frankly, if the world created 2,000 of the caliber and the kind of talent we needed, we would have hired 2,000. But the world creates these skills at a certain rate, and we'll hire them as aggressively as we can. We have some limits in terms of how do we put them to work and where is the demand and does that all match up? But we will hire people as aggressively as we can as we build these businesses. We are relying on some pretty unique talents in some of these businesses.",536

You had a very strong signing quarter last quarter, but that was not so strong this quarter. I think it was down 17% year-over-year. Understanding that, that can be very lumpy. Does it say anything about the discretionary outlook for service among your clients? And can you maybe just address when we might expect to see that margin inflection in GBS?",85
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718995.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,24,"Sure. So a couple of things. On services, in terms of signings, as you said, they are -- they tend to be lumpy and maybe not the most elegant of words to describe it. But it is an accurate description of what happens in any 90-day period. Quite frankly, when you look at the kinds of relationships we're building with our clients, neither the IBM teams involved that are building these, nor our clients are thinking about these on a 90-day cycle. These are pretty big, transformative partnerships that we build, and they are running and trusting us to run their most important and most critical systems. So it's completely understandable why a 90-day reporting cycle may not work. We also have looked, and we've told our investors over time to look at the backlog. And so when you look, for instance, within the GTS business, our backlog, even with the signings performance in that quarter, but because we've had strong signings last year, we grew the backlog 1%. And I think that's indicative of the kind of demand profile we see for those kinds of services. Remember, within that business, there is certainly an element of productivity, i.e. our clients are asking us to do and manage that for them in a way that gets them to a sustainable economic model, which means we need to deliver productivity quite regularly. And then it also includes a lot of what they want in terms of moving into hybrid cloud environments and taking advantage of the investments they've already made in their own systems, plus getting the agility from us running their cloud. So that services business, again, the demand profile I see looks more like that low single-digit kind of growth rate, which is evident in the backlog. And then we'll -- again, given the transformative nature of some of these deals, we'll sign them when they're ready and when they're complete. In terms of margin on GBS, we've talked a fair bit about what we're going through with GBS. The only thing I'd add to the comments we've made is that, again, we continue to see that the areas and the spaces we're moving to are more valuable as measured by gross profit margin, if you will. They're more valuable than where we're coming from. And so we see certainly a bright future. Now it's just a matter of getting that waiting right and working our way through the transition and the transformation of that, where we have a bit of a productivity impact as well.",427

What sort of growth savings are you guys targeting to get? I realize the net number may be fairly modest. But what sort of growth savings do you think you can get? When does that start? And then the M&A contribution. Could you just talk about what total revenues and strategic growth looks like on an organic basis ex currency, ex M&A?",79
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40718998.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Sure, Amit. A couple of things. So on savings, if you will, and as you pointed out, we're going to -- we expect that we'll reinvest a lot of the savings as we start to realize them and as we start to achieve the savings. So in the prepared remarks and in the charts we've distributed, we've actually laid out, quarter-by-quarter, when we would expect to get about that $500 million or so of savings this year. And then we've also identified, on a full-year basis, that this frees up -- for our spend rates, it frees up about $2 billion that we will now look to shift into these new areas. That's how we think about it. Again, this is not about capacity reduction. It's actually about moving into these new areas where we see new opportunities. And then from a revenue perspective, as we -- as I covered in the prepared remarks, in the first quarter, the contribution from acquisitions in terms of revenue growth was under 1 point. Now we've since closed Truven in April. And we didn't have The Weather Company, for instance, in the full quarter. So we'll get a bit over 1 point as we go into the second. But we don't see -- it's not adding 3 or 4 or 5 points here. It really is 1 point to 2 points as we go into the second in terms of acquisition contribution to revenue growth.",242

And I understand that they're kind of lumpy. Could you address the service backlog, which was down 1% year-over-year and help us understand how mathematically if that number is adjusted for acquisitions that are coming in the year?",58
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40719001.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,30,"Sure. So the first one or the second part of that, the acquisitions we're making are in things like software businesses. They are in as-a-service businesses. There's nothing in the backlog from acquisitions. So in the backup information, and first, Jim, I would -- do want to say since we put so much time into all these backup charts, I do appreciate that someone's looking at them also. Thank you for that. In service backlog of down 1%, there really are 2 components. One is, as I mentioned a couple of questions ago, the GTS component of that continues to grow about 1%. So think of it as low single-digit. And I think that's a good reflection of the demand environment for the kinds of services integrators that our GTS business is becoming. The other piece of that is the GBS backlog, which is down 5%. So that down 1% is up 1% for GTS down 5%. And that's a reflection of our shift out of these large ERP implementations and the need for us to build some of these new businesses like cognitive. So there's not a lot of, obviously, cognitive signings in that backlog yet because we've created the practice within the last 6 months. And we're building the skill base, and we're building the relationships with our clients. So it's really those 2 dynamics, it's pretty good -- it's stable growth, stable but growing in GTS and a decline in GBS as we shift into those new areas.",251

How should investors think about that acceleration? Would you get to your goal and strategic imperatives revenue faster than 2018 because you are now investing at a higher pace and acquiring these skill sets or perhaps throw off higher cash flow faster? And if accelerating the transformation is the right move, then why not like increase leverage and reinvest more aggressively for the remainder of the year as well instead of sort of waiting for the tax refund?",97
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4172.0,959223.0,40719004.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,33,"Well, a couple of things, Wamsi. So we are investing quite aggressively here. And I run the Deal Committee. We have pretty active discussions still on what else we should acquire in order to build again new businesses to extend a lead that we have in a business. So we'll keep doing that and we'll think prudently about where we deploy our capital. Now, in terms of spend rates, as I mentioned, investments are shifting our workforce, if you will, investing or changing the way we operate. It's changing the way we -- the change in the way we engage with one another. So if the world created -- if the world created 5,000 cognitive experts, we would hire 5,000 cognitive experts. We already have, by the way, the largest private math department in the world. And so we are absorbing, if you will, the skills that we need for our business in order to drive these. But there is a rate at which it doesn't make sense for us to keep putting money into these because the world doesn't create them anymore. It's not a problem that can be solved by spending more money; it's a problem that is constrained by the kinds of skills the world's creating. So we have a global search on for talent. People come to IBM, and we got about 1.2 million applications -- applicants, I should say. We got more applications, about 1.2 million applicants. They come here in order to work with the leaders in their fields. What we find is that skills have gravity, and highly skilled people want to work with others in their field who are also highly skilled. So they come here to work with our unique data sets, with our unique technologies, with our unique industry expertise in order to change the way the world works, in order to change the way industries operate, in order to change professions. And we'll do that as fast as we can. But you can get a sense, I think, we talked earlier, not in this call but in prior calls, that we hired 70,000 people last year out of the 1.2 million applicants. It takes a while to find the right people. So we'll invest as fast as the world creates the skills we need. 
So let me wrap up the call. Because we got a lot done in the quarter, and quite frankly, I think we're pretty well positioned for the future. The new structure that we have been talking about, which reflects our management system, we expect that it will facilitate our move to a Cognitive Solutions and cloud platform company, and it will also help our investors understand where we're making investments and where we are seeing returns. 
We introduced the structure just in February. We provided the history back in March as we said we would. And now it's the first quarter that we're reporting. So hopefully, with what we've done in this transition to this new reporting structure, you found all the information helpful and helps conceptualize the results you're looking at and hopefully getting some insight into the businesses as we move through the transformation. 
So thank you for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in July.",546

In the second quarter, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in pretax income and $2.95 of operating earnings per share. 
90 days ago, we told you what we expected for the second quarter. We said we continue to see strength in the strategic imperatives, and we delivered 12% revenue growth, led by cloud. We said we'd continue to build as-a-service capabilities. Our cloud-as-a-service revenue was up 50%, and we exited the quarter with an annual run rate of $6.7 billion in our cloud-as-a-Service businesses. That's up from $5.4 billion last quarter. Certainly, we have a benefit from the acquisitions that recently closed, but we had solid organic growth as well. We said we'd continue a high level of investment as we move into new areas and build new markets. And we did that, both organically and through acquisitions. And we said that given seasonality and actions we took in the first quarter, we'd grow our pretax income by about $2 billion quarter-to-quarter, and we grew a bit more than that. 
In total, we got done what we set out to do, and we saw some improvements in trajectory relative to long-term trends. Though as always, the rate and pace varied by business unit and geography. Let me touch quickly on some of the drivers for the quarter. 
As I said, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $31 billion in revenue and now represent 38% of IBM. Growth was led by cloud, where our revenue was up 30% to $3.4 billion in the quarter and over $11.5 billion over the last year, so good progress in cloud. 
Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, the strongest growth came from Cognitive Solutions, led by our analytics and cognitive capabilities and security. In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, our infrastructure services revenue continues to grow, while integration software declined as we shift those offerings to cloud. And our GTS backlog grew on the back of strong signings. Our Systems business again reflects the product cycle dynamics in terms of revenue and margin. And Global Business Services continues to reflect a shift in our business. We're continuing to deliver double-digit growth in the strategic areas, led by mobile and cloud, and our application management business is stable, though pressure in the more traditional areas of consulting and some inconsistency in our execution, continue to impact the GBS results. 
As we shift IBM's business overall, it's important to understand that we're not only moving into new spaces but, in fact, creating entirely new markets. So as I said, we're investing at a high level, both by growing organic investment in areas like our Watson platform capabilities and our cloud data center capacity and getting acquisitions into our run rate. 
Our investments, together with currency, product cycle dynamics and the actions we took in the first quarter, are reflected in our profit performance in the first half of this year. I'll talk about how the second half plays out relative to the first later in the call, as we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year. 
Let me spend a minute on what we got done as we move into new areas and become a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Clients are looking to become digital businesses, and our Cognitive Solutions bring together digital business with digital intelligence to improve decision making and add intelligence into all products and processes. For example, companies such as Kimberly-Clark, the ISS Group and Sesame Workshop announced in the second quarter they're working with IBM on innovative Internet of Things solutions for everything from facilities management to early childhood education. Health care organizations, such as the U.K.'s National Health Service, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the American Diabetes Association, were among many in the quarter that announced they are leveraging Watson to create new approaches to treatment and patient care. And in the second quarter, we announced Watson for Cyber Security, a new cloud-based version of our cognitive technology trained on the language of security. 
What these innovative client initiatives have in common is that they are industry-based cognitive solutions enabled by the IBM Cloud, and all of this is supporting the movement of our clients to hybrid environments. This quarter, we extended our cloud innovations available on Bluemix, including the first Apache Spark development environment for data scientists to more quickly and easily analyze big data. We delivered new IoT services using Bluemix OpenWhisk, our event-driven programming model, to speed development of IoT applications on the IBM Cloud. We announced blockchain agreements with banks such as Mizuho and Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, and we opened a Bluemix Garage in New York City to help financial services clients rapidly design, build and pilot their own blockchain solutions, as well as other emerging fintech applications and services. We leveraged recent acquisitions in Clearleap, Cleversafe and Ustream to announce new video-on-demand services deals with major brands such as Mazda, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Comic-Con. 
We also continued to partner with major IT industry players, leveraging IBM's unique hybrid platform to grow and extend their own offerings and client migrations. For example, we announced that IBM Cloud would be a strategic partner of Box Zones in Europe and Asia. Box Zones and the IBM Cloud will uniquely enable clients to store and manage data across hybrid environments in the country of their choice. And we expanded our global partnership with VMware to deliver desktop services in a security-rich environment on the IBM Cloud. 
We also announced a breakthrough in making quantum computing available in the IBM Cloud. The IBM Quantum Experience is a great example of how cloud is making emerging technologies available that wouldn't have been accessible in the past. This kind of open innovation will allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology and help push a universal quantum computer to reality even faster. Now quantum isn't a new idea. Researchers have been working on it for a long time, but it's not a niche either. On the day we announced it, it generated 138 million Twitter impressions. And to give you a sense of that level of interest, it's fewer than Andy Murray when he won Wimbledon, but it's more than the impressions generated by Phil Mickelson's record-tying score in the first round of the Open last Thursday. Since the launch in May, we already have active users in nearly 150 countries that have run more than 175,000 experiments through the IBM Quantum Experience. 
As we move into new areas, we're also continuing to deliver innovation in the quarter. For example, in infrastructure services, we're shifting from being a systems integrator to a services integrator, connecting and streamlining multiple environments and delivering as-a-service solutions to our clients. You see this in our recent engagements with Pratt & Whitney and Emirates. To help systems innovation, this quarter, we acquired EZSource to help developers quickly and easily update mainframe applications. And in software, we entered into an agreement with a strategic partner to license the intellectual property of some of our assets within our core software portfolio to accelerate product innovation and extend the capabilities to hybrid cloud. 
I'll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions. But first, let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter. 
Our revenue for the quarter was $20.2 billion. While there was a lot of movement in individual currencies, in total, currency translation had a 20 basis point impact to revenue growth. I'll talk to our performance at constant currency. 
Our revenue was down 2.5% and, on a geographic basis, Americas was down 2%. This was an improvement from last quarter's rate across the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Europe was weaker due primarily to Germany and Switzerland, and Asia-Pacific was down about 2%. And with strong growth in India once again and sequential improvement in all of the BRIC countries, the BRICs returned to growth. 
Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment, especially in Cognitive Solutions and the fact that we're building scale in our as-a-service businesses. 
Looking at expense on a year-to-year basis, there are a few items to note. First is an increase in investment levels. We also have a higher level of IP income this quarter due primarily to the licensing partnership I just mentioned. And while not an impact to this year, we did have workforce rebalancing charges last year, as well as some gains that mitigated those charges. And finally, we have a year-to-year impact from currency, as last year's hedging gains roll off. In fact, at a PTI level, when you consider both the hedge and the translation impact, currency impacted profit growth by about $250 million. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 19% all-in, at the higher end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year, which you'll remember was 18%, plus or minus a couple of points, without discrete items. 
From a cash perspective, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and more than $13 billion over the last 12 months. This is over 100% of our GAAP net income. And over the same period, we returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases. 
As we get into the segments, remember our strategy and point of view is that to be successful, you need to bring together cognitive solutions to improve decision-making and outcomes, to approach that with an industry context and skills and to enable that in a hybrid environment to get the agility of the cloud while leveraging the breadth of an enterprise's data and processes.
Now I'll talk about how each of our segments plays a critical role on how we capture these opportunities, starting with our Cognitive Solutions segment, where revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the second quarter. We had sequential improvement in both solutions software and transaction processing software. Our solutions software revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Our strong performance in SaaS continued with double-digit growth in revenue. Growth was led by analytics and security, and acquisitions clearly provided lift. Our analytics business is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio. Analytics grew in key areas, including Cognos, information integration and big data and, of course, Watson as we add to our capabilities. The Weather Company acquisition is off to a good start as we integrate it with Watson technology.
In June, we introduced Watson Ads, leveraging the weather platform, which delivers as many as 26 billion forecasts daily. Consumers will be able to interact with IBM Watson through advertising, by asking questions and receiving relevant product information. Campbell, Unilever and GSK Consumer Healthcare will be the first marketers to collaborate with The Weather Company on Watson Ads. 
Security had strong revenue growth, and together with our security services, we outpaced the market by 3x. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position. We have built an extensive security portfolio, tailored to the needs of our clients for integrated security across their entire operations. As a result, we're the #1 enterprise security software and services provider and hold a leadership position in 12 of the 14 segments, according to Forrester, IDC and Gartner. This quarter, we closed our Resilient acquisition, adding leading incident response technology and expertise to our portfolio. We had strong demand for our Guardium offerings, as we saw clients moving to our database security offerings across a range of industries, including information services and banking. And in May, we announced Watson for Cyber Security, a new cognitive system we've been training and will make available in a beta program later this year for use by our customers. As part of this announcement, 8 leading universities will also train Watson in the language of security. 
We're growing and broadening the reach of Watson with new capabilities, partnerships and engagements to accelerate adoption. Clients across industries are expanding their Watson engagements, moving from pilot use cases and consulting engagements into long-term production. As an example, in the second quarter, design software leader, Autodesk, signed a multi-year production SaaS agreement with Watson to leverage Watson Engagement Advisor. This engagement builds on the value and strong usage proven during the pilot to resolve customer inquiries. This is one demonstration of our focus on the core conversational service for client applications and the developer community. We also introduced new offerings, such as Watson Company Analyzer, which helps companies reduce the time and effort required to collect, digest and synthesize information for building strategic business relationships and understanding competitive market spaces. 
And in Watson Health, we continue to capitalize on our differentiated ability to understand, reason and learn with industry specialization. We launched Watson Care Manager, which provides structured programs and tools to support care coordinators in delivering care to patients. This offering enables patients to avoid rehospitalization. In the second quarter, we extended partnerships with the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association, which are examples of the strong support and momentum Watson Health has with leading clinical and research communities. And at the White House Cancer Moonshot Summit, we made a commitment to utilize our Cognitive Solutions to help doctors offer personalized care to 10,000 veterans fighting cancer. We're working with Teva, a large pharmaceuticals client, to improve drug efficacy for millions of patients with complex and chronic diseases by leveraging the IBM Watson Health cloud solution. We formed a medical imaging collaborative with 15 industry leaders to put Watson to work extracting insights from invisible unstructured imaging data. And in April, we closed the Truven acquisition. The data and insights from Truven will be integrated into our Watson Health cloud. 
So now looking at the profit results for the segment. Gross margin was down, largely driven by mix shift to SaaS and higher investments, including acquisition content. Pretax income performance continues to reflect our higher level of investment in strategic growth areas like Watson platform, health and IoT again this quarter. 
Global Business Services delivered $4.3 billion of revenue. Our performance was similar to recent quarters, with continued growth in our strategic imperatives, offset by declines in the more traditional consulting areas. 
We saw a double-digit growth in our digital practices around cloud, analytics, mobility, security and cognitive, and we continue to aggressively shift resources and investments to drive these businesses. Our GBS team leads the industry mission for IBM, as we've amassed over 100,000 industry resources. Our consultants build strategies that help our clients gain new insights on data and launch new business models for competitive advantage. We're scaling the industry's first cognitive consulting practice, which draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals, spanning machine learning, advanced analytics, data science and development. 
We continue to ramp the IBM Interactive Experience. We've opened over 30 digital studios around the globe, including new studios in Singapore and Seoul. We also completed the acquisition of Aperto, a digital agency in Berlin, with over 300 employees and a roster of enterprise clients such as Airbus and Siemens. 
We're shifting away from traditional on-premise ERP to cloud-based application management and consulting. We closed on the acquisition of Bluewolf this quarter, a top Salesforce partner and a recognized leader in cloud consulting and implementation service. We're also growing our services on Workday applications, leveraging the skills we brought on through our Meteorix acquisition last year. Overall, we delivered 60% growth in our cloud practice this quarter. 
Application management remains stable, as clients look to us to manage the lifecycle of their applications and bring new applications to market faster through digital cloud platforms. 
Turning to profit. GBS gross profit and PTI margins are down year-to-year. These margin declines reflect the investments we're making in our digital practices, as well as some issues in our execution. And in some of the traditional service areas that are not as differentiated, we're seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to invest and shift resources to our higher-value services around digital and cognitive. We're also taking actions to improve our delivery efficiency and execution while remaining focused on our commitment to our clients' success. 
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms delivered nearly $9 billion of revenue, with growth in infrastructure services offset by declines in technical support services and integration software. Across the segment, our strategic imperatives were also up strong double digits. We had strong signings performance in GTS, and the backlog for the segment continued to grow. 
We saw continued momentum in infrastructure services, as clients turn to us to optimize their IT environments and move them to cloud. We again had strong growth in the IBM Cloud. Our point of view is that clients can unlock the most value for their businesses by moving to hybrid cloud infrastructures, which provide agility and enable new business models while, at the same time, tie back to their core systems of record. We always said that hybrid capabilities are critical for an enterprise-grade cloud, and we continue to lead in the rapidly growing hybrid cloud market. 
We're shifting from systems integration to services integration, as we connect multiple environments and build out hybrid infrastructures delivered as-a-service to the client. Our as-a-service revenue for the segment was up over 50% for the quarter. We continue to sign transformative agreements with clients to optimize our infrastructure and help digitize their operations. At Pratt & Whitney, we'll move their business, manufacturing and engineering enterprise systems to a fully managed environment on the IBM Cloud. They're expecting to double their engine production by 2020, and we'll provide them with the means to manage, analyze and grow their infrastructure dramatically to accommodate the company's growth. And this quarter, we signed a 7-year $1.3 billion agreement with CSC to expand our cloud partnership and build a secure, scalable and flexible mainframe infrastructure that will enable CSC to economically scale up and down demand to address current and future client needs and reduce its capital outlays. This builds on an announcement earlier this year that integrated Bluemix into their cloud management platform. Bluemix provides our clients with speed and agility in launching new business models and applications in the cloud and, along with the rest of integration software portfolio, is at the heart of our hybrid cloud strategy. 
Overall, integration software revenue declined. From a product perspective, we had continued strength in our Connect products, as clients integrate applications, data and processes for both on-prem and cloud-based applications. Across integration software, our annuity content is growing, and we accelerate the shift to an as-a-service consumption model through new cloud capabilities delivered on our Bluemix cloud platform. For example, this year, Kaiser Permanente began its move to the IBM Cloud and Bluemix as the strategic platform for their transformation to a more agile, data-driven organization, engaging with millions of individual members and patients. This will allow them to take advantage of new technologies, existing data and back-end systems in a hybrid model. 
Turning to profit. Our gross profit was down year-to-year, driven by the mix of businesses within the segment. Our PTI margin also reflects this business mix impact as well as the investments we're making to build out our cloud platforms. Additionally, this quarter, we entered into an agreement with one of our strategic business partners, where we will license the intellectual property of select assets within the integration software portfolio while jointly going to market to ensure our client's success. This will shift our spending profile for these assets to a more variable cost structure going forward. 
Systems revenue was down, consistent with the cycle. Our Systems Hardware revenue was down 28%. Operating Systems software revenue was down 4% this quarter, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. But as we said, we expect Operating Systems to continue to be a drag on growth. 
Revenues for our z Systems declined 40% in the second quarter, while margins improved, consistent with where we are in the product cycle. We're continuing to expand the z client base, adding 13 new clients in the quarter and nearly 70 since the beginning of the cycle. We had our first major z13 win in China this quarter, with a large Chinese bank migrating its mainframe install base to our latest technology. We're continuing to drive innovation in the z Systems platform. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired EZSource, which will help our clients modify applications for their digital transformation, while also supporting agility and hybrid cloud. 
Power revenue was down in the second quarter, with growth in the mid-range offset by declines in the high and the low end. The UNIX market is a high-value space that's been declining, and we represent the majority of the market. Our performance here reflects the replacement dynamic, following strong performance in the high end of POWER8 in the second quarter of last year. While the midrange has been growing year-to-year, we will see a similar replacement dynamic in the third quarter as we ramp on the midrange POWER8 introduction. We're also addressing the growing Linux market. And this quarter, we grew year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter with our Linux on Power strategy. It is becoming a more meaningful part of our business, with over 10% of our Power revenue in the second quarter. We've seen particular success with HANA, a play that we started a year ago. We will expand the Linux-only portfolio. By leveraging OpenPOWER, we plan to bring 2 new servers supporting cloud-enabled big data and cognitive applications to our portfolio and release our second generation HPC server with POWER8 processors connected to an NVIDIA GPU acceleration. 
Turning to Storage. As we said in the past, storage value is shifting to software, which is reported in our Cognitive Solutions segment. In storage software, we're continuing to grow software-defined storage, which includes object storage and our newly introduced Spectrum Suite offerings. Storage hardware revenue decreased 13%, which continues to reflect weakness in the traditional disk storage market. We released the new all-Flash DS8K storage offering during the second quarter, giving us competitive differentiation, with plans to deliver all-flash offerings across the entire portfolio. 
Our Systems gross profit and pretax income declined, reflecting the revenue performance. Our Systems gross profit margin was flat, with margin improvements in both z Systems and Power, offset by lower Storage margins and the impact of mix. 
So now, after going through the segments, I want to address the performance of Software across our segments. Our total Software revenue was up 1%, driven by an acceleration in the annuity content. Subscription and support revenue was up, reflecting increased deployment by our clients and steady renewal rates. And the investments in new areas are paying off, with growth in SaaS. Acquisitions contributed to that growth, and we also grew our annuity base on an organic basis. I will remind you that while these SaaS acquisitions add to the top line, they are a drag to profit in the first year. Looking at annuity growth by business area. We had strong growth in Cognitive Solutions as well as integration software, while the annuity content in operating systems declined. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. After $1 billion investment in CapEx, we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. For the first half, free cash flow of nearly $4.5 billion is essentially flat year-to-year, with lower cash taxes offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. These first half results support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier in this year. This takes into account the cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken early in the year, as well as the timing of tax payments in the second half. 
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half. We've invested $5.4 billion in acquisitions. So far, this year, we've acquired 11 businesses, including Truven Health Analytics and the digital assets of The Weather Company. In the last 6 months, we've returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend. And with that, we've now doubled our dividend per share since 2010. In the first half, we bought back over 12 million shares, and we ended June with 956 million shares outstanding and $3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended June with $10.6 billion in cash. Our total debt was about $44.5 billion, of which $26.5 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1, and the portfolio remains strong at 52% investment grade. You can see more on this topic in our supplemental material in the backup. 
Our nonfinancing debt was $18 billion, and our nonfinancing debt-to-cap was 59%. The increase in both reflect the timing of our debt issuances relative to maturities this year. Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term. 
So now let me wrap up and talk about our view of the second half and put it in context of the first half performance. We thought we'd lay it out on a slide for you. You'll recall in the first quarter, we took significant actions to transform our workforce and change the way we work, resulting in significant workforce rebalancing and real estate charges. As we said, this is about rebalancing skills more than capacity reduction, and so these actions free up spend that can be reinvested to build capabilities, as well as contributing to the bottom line. We started to see some savings already, but the majority of the gross savings we'll see in 2016 will come in the fourth quarter. We mapped all of that out in our last call, and we're right on track. 
As expected, our mainframe product cycle also had an impact to our EPS growth in the first half. As we enter the second half, our mainframe compares will get easier. In fact, we expect mainframe to be fairly neutral to EPS growth. 
Over the last 12 months, we've been investing at a high level, both organically and through acquisitions, as we build cognitive and cloud capabilities. The organic investments had a mid-single-digit impact on our EPS growth. As we ramp on the higher level of spend in the back half of last year, this will have less of an impact on EPS growth over the next 2 quarters. We've completed 20 acquisitions over the last year. The acquired content is contributing to our top line and will continue to do so in the second half. Because these are primarily as-a-service capabilities and require additional investment as we create new spaces, they have a return profile with a longer payback. The acquisitions we've completed to date had a low single-digit impact to our EPS growth rate in the first half. They'll continue to be dilutive in the second half, though at a lower level. Many of these new capabilities are delivered as a service. As these ramp, it'll benefit our second half relative to the first, not only from a software mix perspective, but adding scale will also help our margins. 
And of course, we've talked about the impact of currency on our profit growth in 2016, due primarily to the roll-off of last year's hedging gains. We can't predict where currency will go from here but, at current spot rates, the impact from currency will moderate in the second half due to year-to-year hedging dynamics and a slightly better translational environment. 
And finally, you'll recall we had a significant discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Relative to the ongoing effective tax rate, we continue to expect to be in the range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
Put it all together, and we expect our second half EPS dynamics to be significantly improved over the first and continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS for the year. 
So with that financial context to our second half, from a business perspective, we'll continue to focus on using Cognitive to help clients get value from their data, to improve decision-making outcomes, moving our clients to hybrid cloud environments and with a strong industry dimension. As we do that, we're moving into new spaces and, in some cases, creating entirely new markets. 
We'll continue to shift our business toward our strategic imperatives, with strong growth in our as-a-service offerings and continued growth in software. And we'll continue to invest to add capabilities and to deliver innovation across the business, all while returning value to shareholders. 
And so with that, we'll take your questions.",4830

Thank you. So we certainly don't think -- I don't think that Brexit, coming at the end of the quarter, helped us at all. But we obviously finished kind of right where we expected to finish. And when we look at our full view of the year, we don't see an impact, if you will, that has any real materiality on us, and that's why we continue to hold our operating EPS. So it certainly didn't help. But again, no -- nothing that said we should change our operating EPS for the year. What I typically observe in these kinds of instances is that our discussions with our clients have to go through a process of reprioritization, if you will. And remember, the extent of the discussions we have with our clients is about their most important processes. So as they reprioritize, the length of time that takes, it depends a lot on how much uncertainty they're faced with. And obviously, the political leadership in Europe and in the U.K. can help reduce that uncertainty, but we didn't see -- we didn't -- again, we don't think it helped, but it didn't cause us to change our guidance.",200

And if that's the case, then company revenues declined about 4% or a bit more, and software revenues declined about 5% or a bit more. I was hoping you could clarify if those numbers are correct because, if they are, it actually suggests that both company revenue and software revenue decelerated from Q1 even though the compare was actually a bit easier. So I was wondering if you could address this notion of what appeared to be some deceleration in the business on an organic basis.",106
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3287.0,1007693.0,42451879.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,9,"Sure, Toni, a couple of things. First, the acquisitions are part of IBM. So when you say company revenue, I think of the total as kind of company revenue. Within the total, as we've talked about, we did it at Investor Day, and I think this is generally true, given the volume of acquisitions we do, we generally, over the long term, see about a point help. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got about twice -- so we got about 2 points of help in total. Now that's not all software, obviously. There's also, as you know, we've been acquiring some businesses for our GBS business. So on an acquisitive impact across IBM, it was about 2 points. What we saw in Software in the second quarter, I would describe the dynamic as very similar to what we've seen over the past few quarters which is we -- in our largest clients, we see continued deployment and, therefore, we continue to grow the annuity base in those large clients. And outside those large clients, we continue to see growth in total. And then, again, the transactional business, which tends to have an outsized impact in the second -- in the fourth quarter because of our mix of revenue, of our transactional versus annuity, also plays into this when you start looking at it sequentially because they're not fully comparable, if you will, the mix is a bit different. So acquisitions, clearly a benefit to us, about 2 points, as I said, in total mix of software and services and a set of software dynamics underneath that, that suggests to us continued deployment, continued growth in the annuity base and still some transactional growth pressure, if you will, in some of our largest clients.",297

Anything unusual there? And can we see an eventual pull-through there, with consulting maybe following behind it? And, Martin, you did mention some inconsistency on execution, I think, a couple of times. Can you elaborate on that?",49
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3287.0,1007693.0,42451882.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,12,"Sure, Tien-tsin. Thanks. So we did have pretty good signings, and that signings kept the backlog, in total, flat year-to-year. What we're seeing in the marketplace, if I start to disaggregate between GTS and GBS for a moment, we continue to see very strong growth in GTS. You saw that in the signings numbers, and you see that in the growing backlog. And that profile, if you will, of what we're working on for our clients is very consistent with what we've talked about in the past, which is our clients are looking to move to hybrid clouds. Our clients are looking for us to help them develop and deploy and run some of the latest technologies such as mobile. So that trend continues. The size of those deals continues to be quite substantial. Not every deal is a big deal, but we haven't seen any reduction, certainly, in deal sizes. In fact, we've had some of the biggest deals -- some of the volume of biggest deals that we've seen over the past few years continue in the GTS business. And when we look forward at that GTS relationship, if you will, over the last, now call it, 10 quarters, over 2.5 years or so, we've had a pretty good, consistent book-to-bill, greater than 1. So the booking rates, as you know, are the signings we report. And then on the billings side, in GTS, you have our maintenance business as well. And so obviously, that doesn't go into the bookings side of the equation. So you got to do the math right, but book-to-bill in GTS has been, over the last 10 quarters, very consistent; again, reflects, I think, the strong value we bring to clients. On the consulting side, in GBS, we did have a good signings quarter. There is plenty of business out there, and we see good uptake of our most advanced offerings, if you will, those that help digitize our clients. We continue to pull back on that enterprise kind of wide application installation, where -- when we say pull back, by the way, that means we're moving resource, and we moved, again, more than 1/3 of our resource out of that part of the business. So it's not a surprise that, that part of the business is declining. So the consulting opportunity is certainly there. When we talk about execution, when I talk about execution issues, I guess the way I'd say it is, look, we take on and our industry skills take on some pretty complex projects for our clients. And sometimes, we have to spend a bit more money than we would have thought in order to make it all working properly and making sure our clients are satisfied. So that's on us. That's on execution. The teams, they'll work through these things, but I wouldn't call it widespread.",478

And I know you reiterated at least $13.50 in EPS. But in light of the macro headlines, I was wondering if you're thinking about weighing Q3 and Q4 any differently in the second half of the year.",53
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3287.0,1007693.0,42451885.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Greg. Sure. So we included a pretty detailed chart, I think, on some of the first half to second half trajectory changes. And I think the one point to make kind of across the board on that chart is that everything there, it gets either the same or better in the fourth. And so when we look at all of the impacts, as an example, we've got the chart that shows as-a-service scale helping and a chart that shows the actions we took in the first quarter helping in the second quarter, all of those have a bigger impact in the fourth than they do in the third. And the rest do as well, but those are just, again, 2 examples. So I guess the way I think about third versus fourth in a total perspective, in total, third quarter for us tends to be in a fairly tight range. Our annuity business plays a bigger role in our overall revenue streams than our transactional business does in the third. So in that EPS range in the third, we've typically been kind of 22% to 24% of the full year. And when we look at that with the momentum we have on the things that are on that chart, I'd say that we're more in the middle to the high end of that range in the third and then the rest, obviously, in the fourth. So while those statistics are good indicators in total, when we're going through a transformation like this, at the margin, again, in the third, we'd say kind of mid- to high end of the historical range for third quarter EPS.",276

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3287.0,1007693.0,42451888.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,18,"Sure, Joe, a couple of things on margins. First, we've talked a bit about what drives margin in the IBM financial model at length. And as you'll remember, we talked about mix of our business. We've talked about productivity in our services business. We've talked about portfolio actions. And in this year, we started talking about kind of as-a-service based on scale. And you can see 3 of those 4 elements in our more detailed list of what changes first half to second half, the ones not -- that's not there, obviously, is portfolio actions because we don't have any big divestitures planned here that are going to drive portfolio. And in fact, the way to -- the way I'd say it is that when we look at the portfolio, we think each of the elements can drive value for our clients, and we still see high value in the elements. Part of the way we get comfortable with each of those elements driving value is that when we look at the margins on the strategic imperative content relative to the rest, the margins on the strategic imperatives content has been, in second quarter again, higher than what we see on the core business. So I interpret that as the places we're moving to, the places we're building value for our clients looks like a pretty high-value marketplace. And we'll continue -- it's one what's worth us continuing to serve. So we think we build on margin with 3 of those 4 components that we typically have from a -- and as-a-service perspective, I don't think we're through the capital requirements by any stretch. We'll continue to shift our capital to the cloud business to make sure that we've got the right scale that we need for our model. So we're not through it. But again, I don't think IBM's becoming more capital-intensive overall. That, a lot of times, is just a shift from one to another. And then, obviously, we'll keep investing in the capital we need to drive our acquisitions as we integrate those as well.",348

And what's been the trend there the last few quarters?",73

Thanks, Steve. So on the core, if you will, everything outside the strategic revenue -- everything outside the strategic imperatives, that's kind of been flattish, right. It's been flat quarter-to-quarter, I should say. It's down, but it's kind of flat quarter-to-quarter. So no change in trajectory on that part of the business. In the strategic imperatives, when we started talking about this 1.5 years ago at our Investor Day, and we put on the table at the time that, that business would grow to $40 billion or 40% of our revenue by -- at the end of 2018, we think and we draw that plumb line, we think we're, I'd say, probably a little bit ahead of the track that we need to get there. We're certainly ahead on the percentage mix because 38% of our business is already there, and we only got 2.5 years to go from a timing perspective. So we're on track to the $40 billion because with $31 billion now trailing 12 months, we actually don't even have to grow at this rate to get over the line. Now the acquisitions will play a role in this, and we see continued momentum here. But we don't even have to grow at this rate in order to get where we set out to get 1.5 years ago.",223

Has the cloud business reached the bottom in the margin profile and is on an upward trajectory? Or do we still have a little bit more of a decline? And if you could just put us -- give us some type of an idea, where are you in cloud margins versus where you hoped to be optimally in, say, 4 or 5 years?",76

So 2 things. Remember our cloud business, we're really -- if I had to oversimplify it, we have part of our business helping our clients build their own clouds. And that includes hardware, it includes software and some services as well. And when we do that with our clients, the margins we see in those businesses are exactly what we kind of see in the rest. I mean that's kind of the demand profile of where some of that business is going. The margins don't look any different from that perspective. To the extent the mix is different between how much hardware, how much software and how much services go in, there may be a different margin on the solution. But as I mentioned, in total, our strategic imperatives are mixing a bit richer. And so we're seeing better margins in total across the imperatives, so that's the kind of help our clients build their own cloud. On the as-a-service side of this, I think that, as we put on the chart, the as-a-service component, even though we're going to continue to drive a fair bit of investment here, the as-a-service component will start to add, be accretive to our margins on a year-over-year basis starting in the second half already. Now we'll see where the marketplace goes, and we'll see where -- how much we rely on getting -- or keeping, if you will, that margin growth as opposed to reinvesting. But we see, again, on -- a big part of some of that cloud business, we see margins that are consistent with what we see in other parts. And the as-a-service business, we start to see year-over-year accretion in the margins from that even though, again, we'll continue to invest quite heavily.",296

But in GBS, strategic imperatives is already over 50% of segment revenue. But yet, overall GBS revenue was down 3%. So I think there's a notion of people expecting aggregate IBM to eventually get to growth, as you see strategic imperative mix increase over time. But I was wondering if you could comment more specifically, with respect to GBS, what some of the offsets were on that revenue line. I think execution, you're alluding to margins but, more specifically, on the revenue line, which caused deceleration, what would imply strong deceleration in the core on GBS?",107
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3287.0,1007693.0,42451897.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,27,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. That's right; we did see some pretty strong deceleration or declines in the core of that. And as I said, we're continuing to shift our skills and our resources out of that part of the marketplace. So in a business which, if you oversimplify it, it is really about how do industry experts charge or bill for their time, your billing is going to be limited or constrained by how much resource you have applied to it. That won't surprise you. And then, as I mentioned, we moved about 35% of our resource applied to those core parts of the business over into the strategic imperatives. So that has 2 effects. One, it obviously reduces the ability of us to grow revenue in those places when you constrain the resource. And two, because the productivity is not one-for-one, someone who's billing on an implementation in an enterprise resource kind of an application doesn't immediately become a cognitive expert or doesn't immediately become a mobile expert. So there's a productivity impact. And what we give up, while we give up 100%, let's say, of that billing capability, we don't get 100% back right away. And that's really what you're seeing in our consulting business. In GBS, outside of the consulting, those -- the application management, the Global Process Services businesses, they're fairly stable within the overall GBS equation, but the consulting business continues to go through this transition as we pull resources off and we put them into -- and devote the resource or the investments, if you will, to the strategic imperative areas.",266

It sounds -- given what you just said about the continued pricing headwinds that you're seeing in the traditional ERP implementations and maybe the execution issues, that that's going to be a persistent headwind even in the back half of the year. So can you maybe give us some kind of commentary around when you would expect at least the impact of the runoff of some of that more commodity-like business to start to not be a headwind anymore? And can you see kind of the end of the execution issues in terms of the cost of some of those implementations that might have been overrun?",114

So a couple of things. One, on when do we kind of work our way through this, I mean, one thing to look at here is the signings performance in the quarter. And GBS did grow signings in the quarter. Now there is obviously a lag, it sits in the backlog. And as you saw -- and our total backlog is flat. I'd mentioned earlier that GTS was up in backlog. And obviously, therefore, the GBS component of that is down a little. So while we are growing signings, which are a pretty good leading indicator of the kind of business, and that's a function of all the people we've moved into those new areas while we pull back from the others, that total signings equation is now starting to work. We grew signings in total, right. So the new stuff is offsetting, if you will, the old stuff, but not enough yet to get the backlog back to growth. And we got to get that backlog back to growth in order to have -- kind of turn the corner for that signings equation which we got back to growth, to get the revenue equation, if you will, back to growth.",203

Can you help us understand what known factors there are today, headwinds or tailwinds, that we should consider for conversion next year?",38

Thanks. So as we said, we reiterated our view of free cash flow in -- at the end of the first, we were comfortable at the time and remain comfortable to be at the high end of what we had originally provided. So within that, realization for us is a pretty good measure of how we're converting our cash. Our model is to be in the 90s, and I think with kind of the headwinds, tailwinds we see within free cash flow for the year, I'd say we're probably more likely to wind up in the high 90s in 2016. Now, as we get into next year, there's a lot that we have to get through in order to understand what next year is going to look like. But I am comfortable that -- while we'll finish again probably high 90s this year, I'm comfortable that our model is right even for next year, that we'll be in the 90s again next year when we look at all of the pieces. 
So let me conclude the call by reminding everyone that we're running our most -- our clients' most critical process, and that puts us in a pretty unique and a terrific, quite frankly, position to move them to the future. And it's not just about the infrastructure, which is obviously important. We've always felt it important, and we think it's important today, but it's also about helping them become digital businesses and helping them inject cognitive into everything they do. It's what they're asking for, and it's, quite frankly, been our perspective on where the world is going. So we're not only doing that in -- with our existing clients and not only doing that in kind of a traditional IT but, in some cases, we're building entirely new businesses and entirely new markets. And so that, for many, is beyond what some of you would focus on in terms of infrastructure, but it's becoming a bigger and bigger part of what IBM is becoming. And again, it's our view of where value will be created for clients and for our investors. 
And so as we make those shifts and as we build these new markets, we take our temperature, if you will, at the end of June, and we'd say we're right on track with what we wanted to get done for the year. 
So with that, thanks for joining the call.",406

In the third quarter, we generated $19.2 billion in revenue, $3.7 billion in pretax income and $3.29 of operating earnings per share. As we think back to the discussion 90 days ago, it was around Brexit and its impact on Europe, global spending and sectors like banking and the attractiveness of investment in the emerging markets. All of these topics have the capacity to drive some volatility in results, but what you see in our third quarter results is stability in our revenue with continued strong growth in strategic imperatives and a top and bottom line consistent with what we expected. Our revenue was essentially flat relative to last year.
Looking at the revenue dynamics, I want to point out a few things. Our clients are focused on becoming digital businesses, and our strong growth in cloud, security, mobile and across our analytics portfolio reflects this. In total, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives led by our cloud business. Cloud delivered as a service is part of a solid recurring revenue base across software and services, and our annuity revenue continued to grow. Of course, the acquisitions we've made in the last 12 months contributed to growth, about the same amount as last quarter. And for the first time in quite a while, currency was a modest tailwind to revenue growth. I'll talk to our revenue at constant currency going forward.
Looking at revenue from a segment perspective. We had very good performance in both Cognitive Solutions and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. Cognitive Solutions was up 5%, and within that, solutions software was up 8%. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue also grew with continued strength in our infrastructure services and growth in integration software as we help our clients build hybrid cloud capabilities. And with another quarter of signings growth, our GTS backlog is up year-to-year. Global Business Services made some progress this quarter in revenue trajectory as we continue to shift and mix toward digital offerings. Our Systems revenue was down this quarter. The z Systems performance reflects the fact that we're 7 quarters into the product cycle, while POWER reflects the secular decline in UNIX mitigated by growth in Linux.
There's a tremendous amount of change in our industry, and we're continuing to invest where we see the best opportunities. With this, we're addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets as well as delivering innovation in our existing businesses. We're investing organically, and we're acquiring key capabilities. We're remixing our skills, and we've had success in rebuilding our IP income base, utilizing partnerships that enable us to continue to innovate in some of the more traditional high-value areas of the business. With all of that, we continue to have a very high-margin business, and we generate a lot of profit and cash.
Our results reflect the success we're having in helping our clients to leverage cloud for speed and innovation and become cognitive businesses. You see this in the growth in our strategic imperatives, which were up 15%. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered nearly $32 billion in revenue and now represent 40% of IBM. We had strong performance in our cloud offerings, which were up over 40% led by our as-a-Service offerings. We exited the third quarter with an as-a-Service run rate of $7.5 billion. That's up from $6.7 billion last quarter, and the bulk of the increase is organic. So we're building scale in these businesses.
We also had strong revenue performance in security and in mobile, and we had strong growth in our analytics offerings, which were up 14% this quarter with contribution from the core analytics platform to cognitive offerings, including Watson platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT. We are building the industry's broadest and deepest cognitive solutions and cloud platform portfolio, and we're extending our capabilities. For example, this quarter, we continued the global expansion of our cloud footprint, and we now have 49 cloud centers. We formed a partnership with Workday, where IBM Cloud will become the foundation for Workday's development and testing environment. And we extended our partnership with VMware to enable easy hybrid cloud adoption. 
As we've talked about in the past, cognitive is about using data and adding intelligence into products and services to help clients make better decisions. It's about augmenting human intelligence. This quarter, we introduced and expanded Watson platform offerings, including Watson Conversation service and Watson Virtual Agent for customer service. We're training Watson for cyber security, expanding the amount of security data Watson is ingesting. In Watson Health, we launched Watson for Drug Discovery and Watson Health Core. And in Watson IoT, we added new capabilities around blockchain and security to draw insights from billions of sensors embedded in everything from machines to cars to drones to ball bearings to buildings and even to hospitals.
Where we're seeing real value is in providing cognitive capabilities in the IBM Cloud. The third critical element of our strategy is our industry focus, and in the third quarter, we introduced an industry platforms business that integrates cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystems capabilities to provide targeted solutions in specific industries. Initially, industry platforms will address 2 substantial opportunity areas: Watson Financial Services and blockchain solutions. We believe blockchain has the potential to do for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information. We're building a complete blockchain platform and are now working with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for business, including: CLS, who settles $5 trillion per day in the currency markets, to implement a distributed ledger in support of its payment netting service; and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi for smart contracts to manage service level agreements and automate multiparty transactions. And in the third quarter, we opened a blockchain innovation center in Singapore to accelerate blockchain adoption for finance and trade. And we now have blockchain garages open in New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore and San Francisco.
In Watson Financial Services, just a couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. So just as we trained Watson on clinical research and medical guidelines to work with doctors treating cancer, we will apply the expertise of Promontory to train Watson to directly address escalating regulation in risk management requirements in financial services. I'll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions, but first, let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.2 billion. As I just mentioned, currency was a modest tailwind to growth, about 80 basis points this quarter. On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Europe. The Americas revenue was flat as compared to last year, and the U.S. was also flat. Latin America was up 5%, led by Brazil. While the environment remains uncertain, double-digit growth in Brazil this quarter reflects the importance of our z Systems platform to the banking sector. Europe performance improved 4 points sequentially, driven by the U.K., Germany, France and the Nordics. Asia Pacific decelerated, including a decline in Japan and weaker performance in China. India continued to post strong results.
Our gross margin was down this quarter. Across the business, the decline is driven by higher level of investments, including the acquisitions we've made and the mix to as-a-Service businesses that aren't yet at scale. I'll address the margin dynamics that are segment specific within the segment discussions.
Our expense overall is down versus last year. I want to spend a minute on a few of the expense drivers.
We've been investing at a higher level, both in organic capabilities like cognitive, security, cloud and blockchain but also through acquisitions. When we look at the acquisitions we've done over the last 12 months, this drove about 5 points of expense growth. As we look at our investment levels, we want to allocate our skills to where we see the most opportunity and growth.
Some of our assets are high value but not necessarily in growing markets. So we are licensing, not selling, our intellectual property to partners who are allocating their skills to extend the value of these assets. This quarter, we signed 3 such agreements, resulting in a higher level of IP income. Licensing as a part of a broader partnership to drive future innovation is a relatively new model for us. It allows us to retain and potentially grow the revenue stream while shifting our spending profile to a more variable cost structure. IP income is just one way that we monetize our technology: sometimes, selling our intellectual property; other times, licensing IP.
The last thing I want to mention relative to expense is that we continue to have a year-to-year impact from currency not only from the translation but also as we wrap on last year's hedging gains. This drove a 3 point impact to expense. So while currency is a modest help to the top line, it continued to have a meaningful impact to our year-to-year profit. Put it all together, and our reported expense is better 2% versus last year.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate of 18% for the year, which is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points. It also includes a discrete benefit for closure of a foreign tax audit, which lowered the tax rate in the quarter by 2 points.
From a cash perspective, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and nearly $13 billion over the last 12 months. This is over 100% of our GAAP net income. And over the same period, we returned about 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now turning to our segments. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 5%, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter's rate. Our solutions software revenue was up 8%, while transaction processing software was down 2%. Analytics was a growth driver, and we grew revenue in all spectrums of Watson. We saw strong SaaS performance with double-digit growth in revenue. Overall, gross margin was down due to the mix shift to SaaS and the acquisition content. Our pretax income performance also reflects ongoing higher levels of investment in strategic growth areas like our Watson businesses.
Our analytics business, which is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio, grew again in key areas such as information integration, big data and Watson. Watson underpins our cognitive strategy and continues to gain momentum. Watson's Conversation service, launched in July, provides developers a simple and easy entry into the next generation of engagement. Through quick setup and tooling, developers without deep machine learning expertise can leverage the science of Watson to develop engagement experiences across multiple channels.
We introduced our Watson Virtual Agent for customer service, building on our conversational capability to provide a cognitive repeatable application trained for customer service. For example, we recently announced that the Royal Bank of Scotland will begin using a Watson-powered chatbot for customer service. The chatbot will help seamlessly route customer service requests through the correct channels and answer specific banking queries.
Turning to our vertical plays. We're focused on scaling our Watson Health business. We have over 7,000 employees and target 4 major areas: life sciences, oncology, imaging and value-based care. We launched new offerings such as Watson for Drug Discovery, which is a cloud-based, scalable platform that helps life science researchers discover new disease pathways, new drug targets and additional drug indications. We had several major client wins, including UPMC and Best Doctors. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with Siemens to help health care providers deliver value-based care to patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. With Siemens, we'll focus on accelerating U.S. adoption of Watson's population health management offerings. Siemens will use the Watson Health cloud as its preferred global technology platform.
We've also been growing our geographic footprint, expanding into China, South Korea, Finland and the United Kingdom this quarter alone. Hospitals in both China and South Korea announced plans to adopt Watson for oncology. And in Finland, we announced a partnership with the Finnish government that will utilize Watson cognitive computing to help doctors improve the health of its citizens. Their vision is to build an open health care ecosystem based on compliant and efficient utilization of health care data. So Finland will put their health care data on our Watson Health cloud. When you think about an entire country entrusting us with its health care data, this should give you some perspective as to how clients believe we have the right technology and consider us a trusted partner to drive health care innovation. This builds on a similar announcement we made with the government of Italy earlier this year.
We also made great progress in Watson IoT. We opened our German location where we will co-create with our clients. We added new capabilities to our offerings. So now you can share IoT data from connected devices on a blockchain, proactively identify potential security risks and protect devices and tap the Watson IoT platform to develop new voice interfaces for customers, all by leveraging these capabilities. IBM's leadership in IoT was recently highlighted by IDC. We more than doubled the number of new clients on our IoT platform in the quarter, including Schaeffler and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Schaeffler, one of the world's leading automotive and industrial suppliers based in Germany, is using Watson IoT to transform its business from its supply chain through to manufacturing and sales. This is a good example of how deeply embedded into our clients' businesses we are becoming, down to the ball bearings themselves. We are seeing exponential growth in both devices and developers, and now we're expanding our industry differentiation and our reach with Watson Financial Services. As I mentioned last month, we announced plans to acquire Promontory. Together, we will create Cognitive Solutions for risk and compliance.
Global Business Services delivered $4.2 billion of revenue with a 1 point improvement in growth trajectory from last quarter. Our digital practices, which now make up more than half of GBS, were up double digits with strong growth in cloud, analytics and mobile. Our cloud practice was up nearly 70% this quarter as we build and implement digital strategies to move our clients to the cloud. By line of business, we grew 2% in application management, driven by growth in our digital foundation and mobile platforms. This was offset by a decline in consulting revenue as some larger contracts wound down and clients continued to move away from on-premise enterprise application work to new business models focused on digital and cloud.
Enterprises are looking for new ways to reach their customers and empower their employees to make faster decisions. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in our enterprise mobility solutions that are helping clients redesign workflows with specific industry context. Our growing collection of MobileFirst for iOS applications are delivered on the cloud and can connect back to their core systems and infrastructure. This is reinventing the way employees make real-time decisions by putting the power of the enterprise in their hands.
We continue to bring new customers onto the platform, including VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, Rimac Insurance in Peru and Amica Insurance here in the U.S. We also opened a new IBM MobileFirst garage in Bangalore, part of a network of centers that helps clients around the world achieve mobile-led digital transformations at speed and at scale.
Turning to profit. GBS gross profit margin was down 90 basis points. We expanded margins in application management as we mixed to new cloud and digital platforms. And with the benefit from our workforce rebalancing actions, we're driving productivity in our delivery model. Consulting gross profit margin was down, reflecting the investments we're making to grow our digital practices. Also, there were some accounts that required additional spending to deliver on important commitments. These dynamics are also reflected in our PTI margin.
We're continuing to shift the business as we've added nearly 10,000 resources over the past year to our strategic imperatives. The acquisitions we've done over the last year impact our near-term profit but add important capabilities like cloud consulting skills around Workday and Salesforce.com. We've also expanded the IBM Interactive Experience and our digital design capabilities. We're focused on integrating and scaling these new skills as we continue to expand our digital practices.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms delivered $8.7 billion of revenue and grew 1% year-to-year. Global Technology Services again grew signings and backlog and has now grown revenue for 6 consecutive quarters. As we shift from systems integration to services integration, we continued to see momentum in our new offerings. Across the segment, our strategic imperatives were up over 40%, with cloud up over 50% and the as-a-Service run rate up over 60%.
Looking at the lines of business. Infrastructure services was up 2% as our hybrid cloud strategy continues to resonate with our clients. We provide enterprise-grade cloud solutions that are secure, agile and leverage the data and investment in their core systems. We continue to expand our cloud infrastructure, announcing the opening of new cloud centers in South Korea and Norway this quarter. We now have 49 centers around the world, enabling low-latency connectivity to cloud infrastructure.
In moving to the cloud, our clients need to be sure their data is secure. Those in regulated industries need to know where their data is, and many need to keep it in-country. Our cloud infrastructure allows clients, automatically, to provision virtual with bare metal servers while meeting their data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.
At JFE Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, we announced a 5-year outsourcing agreement that will migrate core systems to the IBM Cloud through a hybrid solution that will consolidate their infrastructure and streamline business operations. This will allow the company to speed up system development and services deployment, strengthen IT governance and reduce costs.
And last week, we announced the new cloud object storage service that will enable clients to scale large unstructured data volumes across hybrid cloud environments. Bitly has adopted this new object storage service to more quickly and easily analyze data that's being produced by the more than 10 billion clicks it processes each month.
Looking at the software component of our hybrid cloud solutions. Integration software grew 4%. We saw continued strength in our connect products that integrate applications, data and processes for on-premise and cloud environments. We also grew in some of our mission-critical offerings such as WebSphere Application Server. We continue to shift more of our portfolio to an as-a-Service model through our Bluemix cloud platform, which continues to scale across a broad catalog of high-value services, including cognitive, weather, Internet of Things and blockchain APIs.
We continue to build our partnerships and ecosystems to help clients move to the IBM Cloud. Through our partnership with VMware, nearly 1,000 clients have begun moving their VMware environments to the IBM Cloud, including Marriott International, Clarient Global and Monitise. We're helping organizations extend existing workloads to the cloud in hours versus weeks or months.
Turning to profit. Our gross margin for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was about flat year-to-year. We expanded margins in infrastructure services as we see the benefit from productivity actions we've taken and continue to streamline our processes. We're investing in our technology and using our cognitive capabilities to shift to a more automated delivery model to improve performance and drive efficiencies. Our technical support services margin declined, driven by the mix to our multi-vendor support offerings. Our PTI margin also reflects these dynamics as well as the continued investments we're making to build out our cloud platforms.
Turning to our Systems segment. There are some important market shifts in this business like spinning disk to flash, the rising importance of the hyper-scale data market and new opportunities in blockchain. We're shifting our business, delivering innovation in our offerings and introducing significant new capabilities. As always, our performance in the period is based on product cycle dynamics and portfolio transitions. And given where we are in the transitions in power and storage and in product cycles more broadly, our revenue and profit is down after a strong 2015.
Our z Systems results reflect the product cycle dynamics. Seven quarters into the z13 cycle, revenue was down, while margins continued to expand. We continue to add new clients to the platform, and we are introducing new technologies like blockchain. We announced new services to make it easier to build and test blockchain networks in a secure environment. As we build our blockchain platform, it's being engineered to run on multiple platforms but is optimized for scale, security and resilience on both the IBM mainframe and the IBM Cloud.
Our z Systems are well suited for these new workloads due to its advanced security features that help protect data and ensure the integrity of the overall blockchain networks. We're currently working with over 40 clients on pilot blockchain use cases running on z.
Our Power performance reflects both our performance in a declining UNIX market as well as our growth in a growing Linux market. While our margins were relatively stable at the high end of Power, mid- and low-end margins were down, driving a decline in overall Power margins.
We've been shifting our platform to address Linux, and in the third quarter, Linux grew at a double-digit rate and faster than the market. It now comprises over 15% of our Power revenue. Supporting that is our success with HANA, where we're bringing in new clients, and we're replicating this strategy with others. This quarter, we expanded our Linux-only server portfolio, leveraging OpenPOWER partnerships to deliver a new high-performance computing chip and system with NVIDIA GPU acceleration and new data optimized servers. And our Power Architecture had another win, this time for a major hyper-scale data center with one of the world's largest Internet providers based in China.
And finally, at the end of September, we introduced new Power mid-range and high-end systems designed for hybrid cloud computing and flexible consumption models to transform on-premise IT to the cloud. So in Power, we're shifting to Linux while continuing to serve the high-value UNIX space, but this is a long transition. In the near term, we're focused on stabilizing the margin base.
Storage hardware was down 9% this quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift in value toward software. Gross margin is down, reflecting both volume and price pressure. The hardware decline was mainly driven by low-end and mid-range traditional disk storage. Our high-end disk storage grew this quarter. All-flash array revenue grew as we have expanded all-flash technology across our product portfolio. We recently rolled out new products and transitioned to a full suite of flash offerings, making us competitively positioned. And while not in our Systems segment, we also continued to see double-digit revenue growth in software-defined storage. So across Systems, we're facing product cycle headwinds and some transitions in power and storage while continuing to deliver important technologies and capabilities to address cognitive and cloud.
Now let me wrap up the segment discussion with the performance of Software across our segments. Our total Software revenue was $5.7 billion, up 3%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our Software revenue growth trajectory. We've got a broad software portfolio from solutions that provide cognitive, analytics and security solutions to core transaction processing to connecting on-prem data and processes to private and public cloud environments. Our software is open, running on IBM and non-IBM environments.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had solid growth in Cognitive Solutions and integration software, while operating systems continued to be a drag in line with the longer-term secular trend. Across Software, software annuity revenue was up mid-single digits led by our SaaS offerings. Acquisitions contributed to our SaaS growth, but SaaS was up organically as well. Our transaction revenue declined mid-single digits, which is a significant improvement in the trajectory as compared to the last several quarters.
As is typical in a third quarter, our transactional software content was less than 20% of our Software revenue. But remember, in the fourth quarter, due to seasonality, transactions represent a larger portion of the Software revenue.
Moving onto cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. After $850 million of CapEx spend, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our free cash flow of $6.9 billion was a little lower than last year with lower tax payments largely offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. Through September, our CapEx spending is consistent with last year. As I mentioned earlier, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was over 100% of our GAAP net income. This performance continues to support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this year. This includes the expected cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year as well as the expected tax payments in the fourth quarter.
Looking at the uses of cash. So far this year, we've invested nearly $5.5 billion in acquisitions. We've acquired 12 companies, the largest being the digital assets of The Weather Company and Truven Health Analytics. And in the last 9 months, we've returned $6.6 billion to shareholders, including nearly $4 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 18 million shares. We ended September with just over 950 million shares outstanding and $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We ended September with $10 billion in cash and $42.5 billion in total debt. About $26 billion of our debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at about 7:1, and the portfolio remains strong at 51% investment grade. Our non-financing debt to cap was about 54.5%, which is essentially unchanged from December and down about 4 points from a year ago. Our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to support our business over the long term.
As I said upfront, in an environment where there are a lot of open questions, our business is showing a lot of stability. That stability is driven by the kind of work we do for our clients. We are applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest to create new offerings in markets and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property. In the third quarter, we made progress across our business with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation in declines in our core businesses, remixing our skills and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships.
You'll recall in July, we said that we expected our second half EPS dynamics to be improved over the first, and we laid out a half a dozen or so areas where we expected to drive that. Now based on our third quarter performance and our view of the fourth, we'd say the second half improvement is pretty much in line with our view 90 days ago. While we may see a little less improvement from software revenue mix, we're more successful in monetizing our software through IP income. So bringing it all together and as we look at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS and free cash flow at the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
And so with that, we'll take your questions.",4679

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3593.0,1056079.0,44251389.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,4,"Martin, I have a hopefully straight-forward clarification and then a question, please. Just on the clarification. The year-over-year IP gains were about $340 million or $0.30, and I appreciate that you're licensing real software IP to get that. But how do we think about this as being sort of more one-off rather than ongoing IP? And should we be thinking of IP income increasing on an ongoing basis? And similar, if you could just clarify the tax rate. I had 14.2% as your tax rate. You talked about 2 points being helped from a discrete tax item. Was there something else that was impacting the tax rate that appeared to get it down to, at least by my model, something that's closer to 14%? So if you could clarify those 2, that would help. And then the question is just around free cash flow and how to think about it. This year, you're going to be at the very high end of your range, probably free cash flow being 100% or more than 100% of GAAP net income. As we look forward next year, given your guidance is typically lower than that, should we not be thinking about free cash flow declining in an absolute -- on an absolute basis in 2017?",212

Well, I think I got them all, Toni. So we'll do the clarifications first, and we won't count that as a multi-part question. We'll count it as a multi-part clarification, and then we'll talk about free cash flow. So a couple things on IP, and this is actually a really important point, I think, Toni. Our IP income has been flat to down over the last, say, 3, 4, 5 years, and we've been thinking about how do we continue to drive IP income. If you look back -- and I'm sure you have by the way. You have all the data as well. If you look back 15 years ago, we had as much as $1.7 billion of IP income. Now a lot of that was driven from the fact that we developed really good semiconductor manufacturers and really good semiconductor manufacturer processing technology, and our ability to license that technology drove a lot of income. We've been thinking about how do we reinvigorate, if you will, the IP income business, and part of it is what you're seeing now is we're realizing some of these. So the clarification that you asked about, is it about $340 million year-to-year? That's -- yes, that's right. That's about $340 million year-to-year. But more importantly, we are going to continue to drive IP income. Now we got a good third quarter on a year-to-date basis. We're about $1.1 billion, so we're kind of flat. I don't think that we have enough to set a new annual record when we look back at the $1.7 billion that we printed 15 years ago or so, but it is certainly a focus. And keep in mind, I think, that the -- these are relationships. They're long-term relationships, right? So they're not all public because a lot of our -- some of our partners don't want to talk about what they're doing. Those that are public, though, they're multi, multiyear relationships where they can drive now some of the value that they see they can capture within the marketplace. We -- again, we license it to them. We don't sell it to them, so we have an interest going forward as well and can get some of the upside here. So this is a really -- it's a terrific model. It's got a lot of legs. We see an opportunity for this over the next few years to continue doing this. So I think that handles your clarification. On tax, the 2 points, as you -- your notes were right. Two points were from the discrete piece of it, and then we are -- our view of the year now because of the mix of our business has an operating ongoing effective rate of 18%, plus or minus, which is where we were at the beginning of the year. So it's really kind of a view of where the mix of our businesses looks for the rest of this year. On free cash flow, your question, we have been running at a realization which is above our model. Now keep in mind, we got -- we won a tax case earlier in the year, and that means we got our money back, right? So that's -- that was a pretty substantial inflow, though we also had some pretty substantial outflows in terms of our workforce rebalancing payments and things through the year. So as we said in our guidance, we would expect to finish at the high end of the guidance. We said that already 180 days ago. We still feel confident about our ability to generate cash. As we start to look at next year, we don't see anything that fundamentally changes our realization from where we are in our model. So our model, as you know, is in the 90s, so somewhere between 90% and 100% realization. And we don't see anything. Knowing, again, everything we have now year-to-date plus what's coming in the fourth, we don't see anything that would say our free cash flow realization is going to change. And so when we get through now the fourth and we see where we are for 2017 in 90 days, then we'll talk more about the absolutes, but we don't see anything in the realization that's going to drive our realization to be anything other than, again, 90% to 100% for next year.",731

Should we not expect to see improving margins as the as-a-Service revenues scale on the fixed cost base of data centers? And then Martin, just connected to that, you mentioned that the one variance to your plan for the year is that the Software business margins aren't tracking to plan. Can you maybe touch on why that is?",81
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3593.0,1056079.0,44251393.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,8,"Sure. So I'll address actually the second one first, Katy. So when we talked about first half to second half and we laid out where we saw the business in the second half, one of those elements we had on that chart last quarter was the idea of software mix and as-a-Service -- software mix and as-a-Service margins, and it would go -- it would turn into a modest positive. And I would say that's more neutral now. So not a dramatic change, and it really has to do with the mix of business. We're getting the kind of growth rates we would expect. You saw, third quarter, we had Software up 3%, which is an acceleration from the prior quarter, but it really is -- we're also seeing good momentum in our cloud platforms business. So it's really a mix statement that is driving that as opposed to something happening with our Software margins. On the cognitive margin component, you are -- the phenomena you described is absolutely accurate. As we slow down those investments, we'll see the as-a-Service margins scale. We're starting to see the as-a-Service business scale, but we still see so much opportunity. We're going to keep driving the investments. And so we haven't gotten to that point yet where the scale overtakes the investment levels in that as-a-Service business.",224

Curious if there's any good line of sight here into the fourth quarter and what you might expect there in relationship to -- in relation to what you saw in the third quarter. And maybe this is a stupid question. Should we start to think about transactional sales and sort of IP income maybe together? I don't know if there's any correlation between the 2 in any way.,79
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3593.0,1056079.0,44251396.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Tien-tsin. So a couple things. The transactional business, as we noted in the third at down 5%, was an improvement from where we were in the second. So it -- we had reasonable transaction closing rates. Now the thing to keep in mind as we go into the fourth, it is a much bigger transactional quarter for us. And so while we have, what I would call, a good opportunity pipeline, we've got now 85 days or 75 days to see how the environment holds up, and that will obviously drive the fourth quarter and drive the full year. When we look at -- when I look at the revenue streams in the fourth, our annuity business, which, again, smaller piece in the fourth, our annuity business has been growing pretty consistently quarter to quarter to quarter. And I would expect that growth to continue into the fourth. That transactional business, which is, again, much larger, tends to get a pretty good quarter-to-quarter sequential bump, if you will, about $1.5 billion. And based on our opportunity pool, we'd say that that's -- that looks about like what we'll get done in the fourth as well. But there's some uncertainty in the environment, and here in the U.S., we've got an election to get through. But right now I'd say that my line of sight into 4Q says the quarter-to-quarter impact in third to fourth is about $2.5 billion as we head for -- just for that transactional business.",249

You mentioned, I think, 4 or 5 ways you were looking to monetize Watson at that meeting. I guess, which ones are working?

So I'll -- Steve, I'll start with the last question first, and the last answer to that question is no. Watson runs on our cloud and our technology, and Watson will run on the IBM Cloud. With regard to the progress we're seeing, we've talked a bit about -- and you've seen many of our announcements around where Watson is showing up and the kind of work it's doing. All of that, as you know, gets reported within our strategic imperatives, and all of it goes into the Cognitive Solutions space. That's where our Watson Health business is. That's where IoT business is, and that's where the Watson platform is. So I'd say that with the Cognitive Solutions business, we talked about it in total at plus 5%. The subsegment of that where the Watson content shows up, which we also provide, is up 8%, so good growth in that software solutions space. But keep in mind that we're also -- there'll be new markets here. And it's going to take some time for us to take the technologies and the processes that we bought, for instance, in our Watson Health business and now layer on the Watson technologies to get the ramp and growth that we expect to get out of some of them. So yes, good progress. Yes, it's a long-term investment. And again, all within the Cognitive Solutions segment, and no, it's not going to run on anything but the IBM Cloud.",246

As you said, Software, up 3% and acceleration from where it is. There is -- across IBM, the acquisition impact was about the same as it was last quarter. It's about 2 points across all of the businesses. Now the -- a lot of those businesses are software so obviously, an impact in Software in the quarter but not dramatically different again from what we saw in the second. We have -- we continue to have good annuity content performance. So our annuity business continues to grow. The phenomena that we've talked about with regard to our largest customers is still part of the discussion with every large customer. It's a question of how do they best view the deployment of their licenses. How do they best view the use of our technologies in order to make sure they're optimizing their own workloads and make sure they're optimizing the projects they have going on. One of the things and an important thing to us is are they -- to make sure they're still using our software and are they still, for instance, paying S&S and are they renewing that. And our renewal rates have stayed very high and very consistent through the third quarter as well. And so we're confident that our Software business has the right appeal, if you will, to our clients because they continue to use it, they continue to deploy it. On any large customer basis -- on any large customer, the discussion could be a little bit different but again, good software performance in the quarter, some benefit from acquisitions. But I would expect that our annuity base will continue to keep growing as well.",287

So Martin, when you alluded to sort of moving into this high transactional quarter in the fourth quarter, I think you alluded to about $2.5 billion sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter in that business. Is that the baseline that is needed to achieve the $13.50 in guidance? That's my clarification. And for my question, if you'd think about sort of the unique onetime benefits in 2016, so you had tax, which was a big driver for first quarter. I know you had associated investments. And then now you look at the third quarter, there's some significant IP other income, and I appreciate your comments around the increasing nature and sustainability of this. And I know you're not guiding yet to 2017, but conceptually, these elements make it seemingly tougher to grow earnings in 2017, especially at a time when the base of buybacks are moderating at sub-$1 billion for the last 4 quarters and gross margins continue to compress. So maybe you can help us think through at a high level maybe some puts and takes and what potentially the positive drivers are offsetting some of these headwinds in 2017.",198

And again, this -- the multi-part clarification with a question is an interesting approach. So first on the revenue quarter-to-quarter. Yes, so when we look at our third to fourth, as I said, we typically get about $2.5 billion in transactional revenue in the quarter, and that's sort of built into one of -- I mean, we have a lot of different scenarios on what the year might look like, but that is certainly the predominant, if you will, scenario on how the fourth comes in. On the view of '17, which I'll come back to in a moment, again, I know you -- and you said it. I think you did listen to my answer around IP, but this is not a onetime thing, right? Again, IBM has had as much as $1.7 billion of IP in our income statement. It is one of the ways we monetize all of our intellectual property. It's only one, right? We also obviously sell a lot, too. But we license our IP as part of our business model. It is -- I don't think about it as onetime. We're going to continue to drive this and, hopefully, grow it. We've got a reasonable pull in the fourth of clients and partners who want to license our technology. So you shouldn't think of it as onetime at all. Now as we go into '17, with our big transactional quarter coming up, obviously, in 90 days, we'll talk about what we saw in the environment and what that positions us for 2017. But I do think we know a few things as we head into next year already today. So we know, for instance, we've got good momentum in our strategic imperatives, and we continue to see, with our investments and our view of the market, how that resonates with clients. And I think we would expect to continue to see good strategic imperatives performance, which also, by the way, will drive some investments. But keep in mind that with everything we got done this year, the bulk of the spending and the bulk of the investment dollars we freed up next year, that's a much bigger number next year. So we can -- we have a freedom and an ability to invest more heavily given what we've gotten done so far this year. So that's one thing we know. Secondly, we're seeing good signings and backlog performance in our GTS business. That was both signings and backlog up again. And within the GTS business, the biggest part of that, our infrastructure services business, which drives, by the way, that backlog, also expanded margins in the quarter. So that's a big deal for us obviously. We also saw expanding margins in our -- in parts of our GBS business in our application management business, again, as we drive productivity. So we know, again, good performance and momentum in strategic imperatives. We have good signings and backlog growth in our GTS business with margin expansion in some of our services businesses. And then at this point -- we'll see where currency winds up in the next 75 days. At this point, it's kind of neutral-ish if you will. It's certainly not the $1 billion plus impact we took this year as we wrapped on all the hedging from last year. So it's far more neutral next year. Now at the same time, as you said, we don't have another tax case that we're going to close next year, but at the same time, most of that was reinvested, if you will, or consumed elsewhere. It didn't show up in the bottom line. So yes, too soon to tell. We'll get through the fourth. We'll talk about the 90 days when we see. But there are some -- there's momentum here in parts of this business that we'll be spending more time on.",649

And then it looks, at least if my math's right, it bounced back this quarter. And you did a good job of telegraphing that last year's growth was not sustainable. That said, the number just seems to be a little bit more volatile than expected. Is there any way you can help us parse this disclosure and just help us better understand what drove the deceleration and then what drove the subsequent rebound this quarter?",108

I think the best thing to do, David, is to look at all of this on a trialing 12-month basis. We recently started giving this on a quarterly basis. It's good disclosure in the sense that everyone's asked for it, and we try to provide the components of our strategic imperatives within each of our new segments. And I think, in general, people appreciated having that level of detail. But to your point, if you're looking for my advice on how best to interpret this, I'd interpret it on a 12-month trailing basis. Our clients aren't making big, big investment decisions like who do I trust with my data and what cloud am I going to move on to. That's a decision that is going to last much longer than, say, a 90-day reporting cycle. So in any given reporting cycle, there will be volatility. My advice, look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, and you can see the trend.",162

You've mentioned that the rollout of SaaS, if you will, or Software-as-a-Service, is impacting the margins. Yet it's still a very small part of the total. It's perhaps 10% of the current revenue base. As that ramps, won't that continue to place pressure on your margin structure? Or to say it a different way, could you characterize, as we look at '17, would margins in Cognitive Solutions be, at a minimum, flattish? How are you thinking about that? And one clarification also. Just did you mention what the total revenues in organic sources was? Or was M&A about 2 points of help this quarter as well?",114

So in total, Keith, our acquisitions contributed about 2 points of growth, same as second quarter. [indiscernible] quarter. So on our Cognitive Solutions and our margins. So first, keep in mind, this is our highest-margin business. It is primarily software, and within that, it's got very heavy high-value content in the on-premise category, if you will, right? And so these margins, which are very high, we want to and we're moving some of this business and investing in the as-a-Service. So as that moves into the margin profile, the Cognitive Solutions, could it see a little bit of margin pressure over the long term? Yes, but it's coming from a very, very high base. And the as-a-Service component that's going in is still better margin than all of the other segments in general. So yes, the as-a-Service component of Cognitive Solutions may have a bit of an impact just on that segment, but overall, it will still help IBM. And again, this is a very, very high-margin segment at north of 80% here. So...",175

Can you help us understand incrementally going forward, so not, say, year-over-year but kind of incrementally going forward, the efforts you've been doing kind of this year? Should we expect the same type -- or incrementally, do you feel like you're going to have to incrementally do more investments forward or just kind of at this level?",72

Sure, Jim. I'd say that given -- yes, we -- one, yes, we will continue to invest. Do I think the rate of growth of investment has to continue? Well, the short answer is it may, but again, remember how much we got done this year in terms of making room in the overall IBM equation and the productivity we're driving in parts of our services business. As I noted, we're seeing margin expansion in some of those. So yes, we will continue to invest. And in fact, I think that some of these markets require this level -- or the markets require this level of investment in order to be at the leading edge with our clients. But we do make a lot of -- a lot more room, if you will, in the overall IBM equation given everything we got done this year. And we'll spend more time in 90 days on how all of that plays out for 2017. But again, we made a lot of room for investments for ourselves for next year.",178

I'll keep it to one clarification and one question. I guess, the question is when I look at your free cash flow usage over the last 4 quarters, it's been more skewed towards acquisitions versus what one would have thought in the past. As you look at 2017, do think it optimizes more, i.e. buybacks could be much more than the $1 billion run rate you guys are running at and acquisitions could be small? Just help us understand the mix as we go forward. And then just to clarify, when you talk about 90% to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow in '17, is that off a GAAP or non-GAAP number?",119
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3593.0,1056079.0,44251420.0,Answer,Martin Schroeter,,Executives,35,"Sure. I'll do the clarification first, Amit. So that's our GAAP net income realization. We've just kept it consistent in terms of GAAP net income. It was the most straightforward for -- we think for everyone to understand. So the free cash flow realization data is GAAP net income. On how free cash flow skews next year and the application of our capital, I'd say, first, you can be assured that we are going to put all of our money to work as we have. We don't tend to -- we don't keep capital here to the extent it's excess. After we've invested it organically and after we've purchased what we think we need to through acquisitions and after we've paid the dividend, we do return capital to shareholders. Over the long term -- in the form of share repurchase. We -- over the long term, as we've said now pretty consistently, we think, over the long term, we can reduce our share count by 2% to 3%, and that obviously recognizes that we will continue to be acquisitive. So I would say that, Amit, again, we'll talk more about what we have assumed when we get to 2017, but we will absolutely continue to invest organically. We'll absolutely continue to be acquisitive. We'll absolutely continue to grow the dividend. And then to the extent that we have excess capital to return, we will return it. And over the long term, that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.
So let me conclude. Let me conclude by reminding you that we're running a highly differentiated play here. We're building, obviously, cognitive capabilities well beyond what others are doing with individual AI services, if you will, and we're building the platforms to help deliver that. And we're making all of that available on another platform, the IBM Cloud. And it came up, as you heard on the call, will Watson run on someone else's cloud, and no, it won't. It will run on the IBM Cloud. And we're doing all of that with deep industry expertise, and that's what our clients are looking for, that cognitive capability on the IBM Cloud with deep industry expertise. And you can see that in our health. You can see that in our IoT. You can see it now in financial services, which we just announced a couple of weeks ago. So we are very excited about what we're doing, and we're very excited about the businesses we're building. And of course, we're very excited with the help and what -- our allowing and enabling our clients to become, which is cognitive businesses.
So as we do that, we'll continue to be deeply embedded in the fabric of how they run their businesses in the most important work they do. They trust us with their data. They trust us to be their partner in becoming cognitive businesses. And quite frankly, that's how we make sure that we're successful over the long term. So thank you for joining our call today.",510
