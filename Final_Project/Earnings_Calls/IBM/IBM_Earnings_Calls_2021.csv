Thank you for joining today, and I'm pleased to be speaking with the investment community again. Over the next 15 minutes, I'll talk about where we stand in the execution of our strategy as we begin 2021 and how we are running the company to align with the strategy. I'll provide a perspective on the current environment and our results. Then in the spirit of being as transparent with you as possible, I will speak to our expectations for the next 2 years. Jim Kavanaugh will then cover the quarter, give more detail on the separation process for our Managed Infrastructure Services business. I've also asked Martin Schroeter to join us to make a few comments as the recently named CEO of this business. Jim will conclude with additional color on our 2021 expectations, and then Jim and I will take your questions. I'd ask you to please bear with us if we go slightly longer than usual on this call. 
When I was appointed CEO in April, I laid out my approach to growing the value of the company which is straightforward. We will significantly increase our focus on our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, the 2 most important transformational journeys for our clients. In the 9 months since then, we have taken a series of important actions to redefine our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. This is where we are focusing the bulk of our efforts, time and investments. 
In spite of the many challenges in 2020, we have made good progress. In 2021, and we believe you will see that progress showing up in our results. With that said, we know it's not necessarily going to be a straight line. The operating environment remains difficult because of what clients are experiencing at the moment. We can see that in the quarter just past. Our revenue was slightly behind typical seasonality, but we finished strong in free cash flow, which is important as it's the fuel for investments. 
Our performance reflects the fact that our clients continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic and broader uncertainty of the macro environment. This puts additional pressure on larger software transactions this quarter and project delays in some services engagements. 
Our revenue growth was also impacted by IBM-specific headwinds of our product cycle and compare challenges. Notwithstanding the short-term market dynamics, we believe we have the plans in place and the focus inside the business to be able to grow in 2021. 
That said, in the midst of all this, I'm seeing an ever greater need from clients to accelerate their digital transformation, and this bodes very well for us now and over the long term. As I've told you before, the opportunity in hybrid cloud and AI is enormous. In fact, we see the hybrid cloud opportunity at $1 trillion, with less than 25% of workloads having moved to the cloud so far. 
Our approach is platform centric. Linux, along with containers and Kubernetes, provides the foundation of our hybrid cloud platform. And Red Hat OpenShift is the core product that captures all this and more. Our hybrid cloud approach is also differentiated by a vast software portfolio, modernized to run cloud-native, and our GBS expertise which plays a key role in driving consumption and is currently helping hundreds of major clients on their own hybrid cloud journeys.  
With this foundation in place, we are successfully leveraging Red Hat as a unique platform to address what our global, complex and highly regulated clients need. A hybrid cloud platform that is open, flexible and secure. Our hybrid cloud approach allows clients to connect their back office to their front office to modernize mission-critical workloads, to build cloud-native apps and to securely deploy and manage data and applications across various clouds. We are confident that we have the right strategy for our clients and for IBM. 
Let me comment on some of the proof points we have seen over the last few months as we execute on our hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. First, to drive leadership and focus as a hybrid cloud platform company, a key element of this strategy is to win the architectural battle in cloud. And with our cloud foundation in place, client consumption continues to grow. We now have 2,800 clients using our platform, a number which has grown 40% over the last year. In the fourth quarter, clients such as Barclays, Walmart, GEICO, Airbus, Ford, ABB are all leveraging our hybrid cloud platform to accelerate their own digital transformation journeys. We're also making good headway in our focus on industry clouds which are designed to tackle the specific needs of mission-critical and highly regulated industries.  
Following the successful launch of our cloud for financial services last year with more than 75 IS suites and SaaS partners, including Adobe, Infosys Finacle, Persistent Systems and many others, we launched our cloud for telecommunications in November. So far, more than 35 partners have joined our cloud for telecommunications. For example, Samsung is working with IBM and Red Hat to develop new user experiences for business. We're also helping major companies like Verizon, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and AT&T to transform their IT and telecom network operations. 
Second, to be the trusted partner of clients for data and AI. The opportunity in AI is massive, while the current enterprise deployment rate is in the single digits. Clients are now at the point where they are moving from experimenting with AI to deploying it at scale. To seize this opportunity, our AI platform is focused on data, automation and security, and now includes more than 30,000 clients who have turned to IBM to unlock value from their data. We're helping clients across industries build intelligent workflows by infusing AI into their core business processes, such as hiring, supply chain and customer service. 
When it comes to data and AI, trust is paramount. IBM is unique in that we make a hard commitment not to monetize or use our clients' data. We also offer the industry's strongest commercially available cryptographic technology. And we give clients the ability to retain control of their own encryption keys. 
In the fourth quarter, clients such as Air Canada, Sprint T-Mobile, State Street and Humana used our rich data and AI capabilities to drive business outcomes. 
As we look forward, we are also investing to develop and address future market opportunities, such as quantum computing. Quantum has the potential to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value for our clients by the end of the decade. To seize this opportunity, we have a road map to build 1,000-plus qubit quantum computer by 2023, and we have expanded our suite of quantum computers on which our clients are working today. 
I want to now spend a couple of minutes on a series of significant changes we are making to the company, most since just the beginning of October. We know that a platform-centric strategy requires a fundamentally different way of doing business. This is why our operating model is to be quietly but substantially reshaped. These decisive moves are all aimed at creating value through greater focus on our portfolio, our operating model and the needs of our clients. And as they take hold, they will help us to deliver sustainable, mid-single-digit revenue growth post-separation. 
To drive greater focus on our portfolio, we announced the separation of our Managed Infrastructure Services business in October. As I just mentioned, this month, we appointed Martin Schroeter as this new company's CEO. Martin has a unique understanding of the business, its global talent base and 4,600 clients. You'll hear from him shortly. 
So much remains to be done. We are on track to complete the spin by the end of the year. We are working closely with clients to ensure a smooth transition, while we are also renewing business and signing new deals. We have a comprehensive project management office to establish the new entity and to optimize the business. I can tell you, there's a great deal of excitement among our employees about the opportunities ahead for this new company. 
To strengthen our hybrid cloud and AI portfolio, we have announced 10 acquisitions since I became CEO and 7 acquisitions just since October. This includes 5 in global business services, which add skills to help our clients with their journeys to cloud; Red Hat's first acquisition as part of IBM that add cloud-native security capabilities for OpenShift. Our investments in organic and inorganic growth and in our people will continue to be sharply focused on both hybrid cloud and AI. 
To accelerate consumption of our hybrid cloud platform, we are also rapidly expanding our ecosystem by adding hundreds of new partnerships with global system integrators, independent software vendors and major third-party software partners and also elevating the role of partners. We're investing $1 billion in our ecosystem so that our partners can play a much bigger role in fulfilling the many needs of our clients. 
As an example, we recently teamed up with Salesforce to deliver a new strategic contact-tracing platform for the U.K. National Health Services to help them in their fight against COVID-19. Salesforce and IBM have also joined forces to address key challenges such as vaccine management using IBM's Sterling supply chain solution, and our blockchain-based digital health pass together with Salesforce's vaccine management and CRM capabilities. 
To simplify and transform the way we engage clients, earlier this month, we announced a new go-to-market model. The first aspect is that we have simplified our sales model by adopting a single consistent segmentation which will make it easier for clients to work with us and unlock a great deal of productivity. In addition, we are providing clients with a more technical and experiential approach with investment in presales garages that allow us to co-create with our clients earlier in the sales process. And we're ensuring our sales organization is fully incentivized towards our strategic growth areas. Finally, we're investing in and elevating the role of our ecosystem partners to deliver more value to clients. 
Let me say a few words about the changes we're bringing to our culture. Since I became CEO, I've talked a great length about the importance of culture and the need to instill a growth and entrepreneurial mindset. As part of that, we are encouraging more business risk-taking and ensuring a higher tolerance for failure across the business. This should allow us to more quickly respond to clients, seize more opportunities and drive better business outcomes. 
I'm only scratching the surface of all the actions we have taken to sharpen our focus. As a result, we are running the company differently as we begin 2021. I'm convinced that all these changes will allow us to deepen our client footprint and open up new avenues for growth. 
Now let me speak to our expectations for the next 2 years. All of the actions I've taken are designed to drive growth, and we expect to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth post-separation, with strong free cash flow performance. 
How do we achieve this? First, through the continued strong growth of Red Hat, which has grown 18% on a normalized basis in 2020 and will be an even larger contributor to revenue growth post-separation. Second, with improvement in the Global Business Services trajectory, we expect GBS to return to its pre-pandemic growth rate by the middle of the year. Third, by leveraging our expanded ecosystem to further contribute to both GBS and software. And we'll finally start to see the benefit from the investments we are making, both organic and inorganic. These will all contribute to an improving software trajectory as well. 
In the first half of the year, we expect our results to continue to reflect some of our current challenges as well as our product cycle dynamics. And of course, all year, we'll be working on the separation of Managed Infrastructure Services. But these are not long-term trends in the business, and these headwinds will dissipate. 
In 2021, the significant changes we have made to focus on hybrid cloud and AI will also begin to take hold. The company will look different at the end of the year, particularly with the execution of the spin-out, but also with the operational changes to sharpen our focus. 
At a high level, in 2021, we expect to grow revenues at current spot rates, with better performance in the second half than the first half. This is the first step towards achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth post-separation. And we expect to generate between $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. These are the measures we are focused on. This is where we stand today and how we will operate to achieve our growth goal. Jim will cover all this in more detail. Over to you, Jim.",2148
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297856.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll go through our performance and then wrap up with a perspective on how the actions we've taken in 2020 position us to deliver on these financial objectives. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered $20.4 billion of revenue. We expanded our gross profit margin with a significant charge for structural actions that improve our go-forward position. We reported operating earnings per share of $2.07. We generated free cash flow of $10.8 billion for the year. And we have strong liquidity with a cash position of over $14 billion. 
The fourth quarter is our seasonally largest transactional quarter. And I'll remind you that a year ago, we had a very strong software performance, and our first full quarter of z15 availability. We knew that given our product cycle dynamics and the pressure from the current environment that the fourth quarter of 2020 would be our most challenging in terms of year-to-year revenue performance. 90 days ago, we expected revenue and operating earnings per share to be in line with historical third to fourth quarter seasonality. In 2020, our fourth quarter revenue came in slightly below our typical seasonality, while EPS was at the higher end of the historical range before the charge for structural actions. And we had a good finish to the year in free cash flow. 
The challenging environment we've seen since March continued with the shift in clients' buying behaviors and priorities. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, more clients tended to move towards shorter-duration engagements impacting our software revenue. But we did have a good IBM Z relative to where we're at in our product cycle.
We also continue to see good demand in offerings that support our clients' digital transformations, and we're driving strong adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. Arvind mentioned, we now have 2,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. For perspective, that's more than 1,000 new enterprise clients since we acquired Red Hat. 
Red Hat continued its strong performance with normalized revenue growth of 17%. That's slightly higher than the third quarter rate driven by subscription growth. Strong subscription bookings contributed to over 20% backlog growth, and the Red Hat backlog is over $5 billion for the first time.  
Global Business Services continues to drive adoption of OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks. And over the course of 2020, we accelerated the number of GBS engagements using Red Hat technology with 260 engagements for the year. 
We've discussed the economics of a platform model, with the software and services revenue multiple anywhere from 3x to 8x to platform revenue. Our full-stack cloud capabilities from infrastructure up through our cloud services generated over $25 billion of cloud revenue in 2020, which is up 20% over the prior year. 
IBM is a high-value business, generating ample profit and free cash flow to invest for future growth and support our dividend policy. We again expanded our operating gross profit margin, up 70 basis points in the fourth quarter and 130 basis points for the year, with expansion across software, services and systems. This operating leverage at the gross margin level enables higher investment in innovation, in skills and an ecosystem. 
Our fourth quarter pretax profit also reflects a charge of over $2 billion for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and reinvest the savings to accelerate growth. This charge is $260 million or about $0.25 of EPS less than what we discussed back in October, driven by a few countries, primarily in Europe, with government restrictions on certain employment actions in the current environment. This charge did not have much impact on our fourth quarter cash flow. And we generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $10.8 billion for the year. Our free cash flow performance in 2020 was driven by working capital improvements and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. This was offset by increases in net capital expenditures to scale our cloud infrastructure and workforce rebalancing payments from previous actions. 
We continue to have high free cash flow realization, which was well above 100%, as expected. We ended the year with a cash balance of $14.3 billion, which is up over $5 billion, while our debt was down $1.4 billion, with $4.5 billion of debt maturities in the fourth quarter. 
Now let me turn to the segments, starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software. Revenue was down 7% in the quarter, and gross margin was up 20 basis points. This year has proven to be a challenging transactional environment, especially in the fourth quarter, which is our largest transactional base. As I said, we have particularly strong software performance a year ago, when revenue was up 10%. The fourth quarter of 2019 was the peak of our enterprise license agreement or ELA cycle, which renew about every 3 years on average. With the uncertainty our clients are facing in the current environment, we're seeing many of them opt for shorter-duration ELAs. This dynamic, in combination with the large seasonal volume of ELAs in the fourth quarter, pressured the fourth quarter software revenue performance. At the same time, our renewal rates for subscription and support improved this quarter. In fact, it was the strongest year-to-year increase in some time. This is evidence of our clients extending their commitment to our software solutions. 
In this environment, our hybrid cloud and AI solutions like Red Hat and Cloud Paks are resonating with clients. In Cloud & Data Platforms, revenue was up 6%. Red Hat delivered double-digit growth in both infrastructure and app development and emerging technologies. We continue to gain share in both product areas, instantiating the importance of our hybrid cloud platform and the Linux Foundation to our clients. 
Earlier this month, Red Hat announced plans to acquire StackRox, a leader and innovator in container- and Kubernetes-native security. This further enhances Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's leading enterprise hybrid cloud platform. Within Cloud & Data Platforms, we're also building out our integration offerings, bringing AI-powered automation across the portfolio through key partnerships and new innovation. 
During the quarter, we acquired Instana, an application performance monitoring and observability company. We also expanded our partnership with ServiceNow to develop a joint solution around Watson AIOps, an IBM solution which helps enterprises to self-detect, diagnose and respond to IT anomalies in real time. And we continue to enhance the Cloud Pak for Automation, which grew at a strong double-digit rate this quarter. 
Our Cognitive Application revenue was down less than 2%. We had growth in security, fueled by our modernized Cloud Pak for security and services. This was offset by a weaker performance in solutions concentrated in industries more impacted by the current environment, like TRIRIGA, which is focused on commercial real estate. As expected, our software performance was most impacted by transaction processing platforms. Clients' prioritization of OpEx over CapEx was amplified this quarter, with our strong seasonal mix towards transactional revenue and the ELA dynamics I just described. 
In Cloud & Cognitive Software, we remain focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and we'll continue to invest in our portfolio as we head into 2021. 
In Global Business Services, revenue declined 5%, which was about 1 point of sequential improvement from the third quarter. And we had gross margin expansion of 260 basis points. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was strong, contributing to backlog growth for GBS. While there remains some market uncertainty, clients are looking to accelerate their digital reinventions by leveraging business transformation services built on hybrid cloud. Our offerings are aligned to this high-value opportunity with a clear focus on reimagining workflows using AI and modernizing the underlying application infrastructures through hybrid cloud. 
We see this in our GBS results. First, our GBS cloud revenue grew at a double-digit rate for the quarter and the year and is now almost $6 billion annually. Second, our Global Process Services revenue returned to growth as we deliver efficiency and flexibility to our clients' processes by infusing innovative technology and redesigning workflows. And third, our consulting signings grew 8%, driven by advisory work for application modernization and enabled by our unique and experiential garage methodology. 
In Application Management, our performance reflects a continued shift from traditional on-prem services to building and managing cloud applications. Our incumbency in Application Management creates the opportunity and trust to be the partner of choice for their digital journey. This GBS incumbency plays an important role in driving adoption of Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform. As I mentioned earlier, our GBS Red Hat engagements accelerated through the year. We had 75 engagements in the fourth quarter, with clients including BMW, Humana, Samsung Electronics, IKEA and Costco. And similar to last quarter, approximately 1/3 of our quarterly Cloud Pak revenue resulted from GBS engagements. 
To continue this momentum, we are investing in ecosystems, resources, offerings and skills. Arvind mentioned, we have announced 5 GBS acquisitions in the last few months. Nordcloud and Thales provide cloud-native development, multi-cloud migration and platform engineering solutions that advance our clients' cloud journeys. And 7Summits, a leading SalesForce partner; Truqua, a leading SAP partner; and Expertus, a leading digital payments solutions provider, are collectively at the center of our clients' digital transformations. 
Finally, the investments we have made in our delivery capabilities, such as our innovative dynamic delivery model, have resulted in improved delivery quality, which are reflected in our Net Promoter Scores and our gross margin expansion.  
Turning to systems, revenue was down 19% driven by product cycle dynamics, while our gross margin expanded 380 basis points. We saw the product cycle dynamics play out in IBM Z, power and storage. Power revenue was down at a level consistent with last quarter. And storage revenue was also down, driven by high-end storage tied to the IBM Z cycle. 
IBM Z revenue was down 24% as we've wrapped on a strong growth in the fourth quarter last year, when we were up 63%. 90 days ago, I mentioned that clients and sectors like banking and financial markets made purchases early in the cycle to manage through robust market volatility. While those in select other industries focused on cash preservation, elongating z15 adoption. 
We've made up ground in the quarter, and improved adoption in some of the lagging industries. IBM Z delivered growth for the year despite a second half wrap on the product cycle and within a challenging environment. This reflects the importance of this high-value, secure and scalable platform with cloud-native development capabilities. Based on this performance, we expect z15 to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. And looking back over a longer period of time, our installed base of MIPS is over 3.5x the level of a decade ago, with 60% of our installed base now in new workload areas like Linux. 
The systems portfolio continues to deliver critical and lasting value to our enterprise client base in support of our hybrid cloud strategy. 
Turning to GTS. While revenue was down 8%, we expanded gross margin by 70 basis points. We had strong contract renewals and added a number of new clients. As Arvind mentioned, at the beginning of October, we announced the spin-off of our Managed Infrastructure Services business into a separate public company, which we're referring to as NewCo for now. We are making good progress on that work and remain on track to complete by the end of the year. As we discussed in October, this process is complex and includes working with clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo as the world's leading infrastructure services provider; optimizing the business model to improve its financial profile; and executing upon the necessary financial, legal and regulatory milestones to enable the transaction. I'll give you some additional color on each of these 3 areas. 
First, from a client perspective, we are deeply engaged with our clients that make up the $62 billion of backlog, and they are strongly supportive. We are seeing client confidence in NewCo's long-term value proposition to manage and modernize mission-critical infrastructures. This quarter, we had wins at clients such as Dutch Ministry of Defense, PhoneGroup and Bankinter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 11 new logo deals, which is more than double the prior year and one of the highest in the last couple of years. 
Our renewal rates of existing contracts this quarter were also at the higher end of our historical performance. However, while we had a strong pipeline as we entered the quarter with the announcement, as expected, some negotiations were extended, resulting in some deals moving out of the quarter. 
Secondly, we are optimizing the NewCo business to have a leaner and more efficient operating model. We continue to take a disciplined approach to improving our margins and overall financial profile. As part of this, a considerable portion of the $2 billion charge for structural actions was for GTS. We also have taken steps to restructure existing contracts and further reduce activity and lower-value offerings. These actions impacted our revenue performance this quarter but contributed to the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points. All of this positions NewCo for an improved margin, profit and cash generation profile. 
Lastly, NewCo has an unparalleled operational footprint. It has approximately 90,000 employees and operates in roughly 115 countries. And as you know, Managed Infrastructure Services is an integrated business, not only within IBM but within GTS. We are executing on our detailed plan to achieve the milestones to create a stand-alone company. Today, we are working with works councils on employment terms, establishing NewCo's legal entities across the world, drafting the agreements, which outlined the ongoing relationship between IBM and NewCo and developing audited financials. We expect the Form 10 to be available in the fall, at which time we will conduct investor outreach. We will continue to update our progress as we move through the year. 
This is a good place to pause and turn it over to Martin Schroeter, NewCo's new CEO.",2327

I'm delighted and honored to be briefly speaking with you today on IBM's earnings call as the CEO of NewCo, and yes, we are working on a name. When Arvind and I began talking about this role, he let me speak with all the teams who are working on it. And as I did my due diligence, it became very clear to me that I absolutely wanted to be a part of this. With the outstanding talent in NewCo, the nature of NewCo's work for the leading companies in every industry and the freedom of action or the mandate that NewCo will have, I could not be more excited about the future of this business. 
Of course, as Jim noted, we have a lot of work to do prior to NewCo being a separate publicly traded company. And as we put all of that together, I'll tell you more of the story about what NewCo will look like. In the meantime, we do know what we have to get right in order to realize the tremendous potential we see. 
First, we know that we must continue to serve our clients. These industry leaders, NewCo's clients, trust us to deliver some of their most important workloads in challenging environments, and NewCo will continue to do that. It's what our clients expect and deserve. It's always been NewCo's true north, and will continue to be. And over time, our clients will see our strong investments bring new capabilities into their environments to help their ongoing journey into a more digitized world.  
Second, we must continue to invest and develop our teams. The teams our clients see and need every day. To our clients, our people are the face of NewCo, and they are the people who know how to make these complex systems work. So we'll build the right inclusive culture around client service, innovation and talent so our clients continue to see how our team shine brighter than any other. 
Third, and in support of the other elements of our business, we must establish the financial model for NewCo that ensures our long-term success. IBM has already provided, at a high level, some of the characteristics of NewCo's financial profile when it becomes independent, and we're working on the specifics now in order to give you a complete and clear view of NewCo's profile. But we know that NewCo's long-term success requires the right starting point. And we'll make sure NewCo has launched the right way. 
And of course, we must build a strong relationship with our owners and the broader stakeholder community. To that point, I look forward to discussing the opportunities we see and how we intend to capture them in due course. 
As I said, I was not going to miss the opportunity to be a part of this with a sharper focus and broad freedom of action, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive client value and translate that into a compelling investment thesis. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim.",507
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297858.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Martin. Now before the Q&A, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level with a summary of the actions we are taking and the resulting expectations for 2021. These actions span our portfolio, our operating model and our capital structure. After building a foundation in hybrid cloud and accelerating Red Hat platform adoption, we are now separating Managed Infrastructure Services to better align to our platform strategy and improve the financial profile of both businesses. At the same time, we are increasing investments, organic and inorganic, in innovation, expertise and ecosystems. We're investing in platform capabilities, including security and industry-specific clouds. We're investing in data and AI and in technologies like Quantum to create future market opportunities. 
As we bring these innovations to market, we're adding GBS' skills and expertise. We're making changes to our go to market to engage our clients in a more technical and experiential way. And we're expanding our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and broaden our reach. 
And in the fourth quarter, we executed structural actions to simplify and streamline our business. These actions will improve the EBITDA profile of NewCo, address stranded costs from the separation and generate savings that will be reinvested to extend our position in hybrid cloud and AI and accelerate our growth. 
We have also taken actions to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity resulting in a stronger financial position. We have focused our captive financing business on IBM's hybrid cloud and AI offerings. We've exited OEM commercial financing and have entered into an agreement to sell our IBM commercial financing receivables. As a result, our financing receivables have declined from $32 billion to $18 billion over the last 2 years, reducing our external debt needs. 
Looking at our retirement-related plans, as you know, we have shifted our asset base to a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of the year, our plans remain well funded. Our overall returns in 2020 were well ahead of expected returns, and the funded status of our worldwide qualified plans was consistent with last year. 
Bringing it all together, we feel good about the path we're on moving into 2021. And as Arvind said, we expect an improving financial profile throughout the year. For the full year, we expect to grow revenue at current spot rates. In the first half, we expect our results to continue to be impacted by the shift to shorter-duration software transactions as clients deal with uncertainty, and by our IBM Z product cycle dynamics. At the same time, we expect GBS to return to pre-pandemic revenue growth rates by midyear. 
As I mentioned, we weren't able to execute the structural actions in all countries in the fourth quarter. We anticipate the restrictions will be lifted over the next several months and are planning to execute the remaining structural actions in the first half of 2021, which will result in $260 million of pretax charges. 
Looking at our cash flows, we expect $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2021. This reflects a year-to-year cash tax headwind of about $1 billion. But to be clear, this adjusted free cash flow does not include the cash impact of the structural actions or the transaction cost associated with the spin-off of our Managed Infrastructure Services business. For perspective, at this point, we expect to pay about $4 billion for these items over the next 18 months, with about $3 billion in 2021. As we look to 2022, we expect to build on this with adjusted free cash flow in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion. 
I also want to comment on our balance sheet as we enter 2021. We're in a strong liquidity position with over $14 billion of cash on hand. Our plan is to continue to deleverage, and we expect debt reduction throughout the year aligned with our scheduled maturities. So we'll have further progress in reducing debt since our peak debt balance when we financed the Red Hat acquisition in mid-2019. This, together with the actions to focus our financing business, give us confidence in operating at a single A credit rating, while we continue to delever. 
In sum, we expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company in 2021 with an improving financial profile. So with that, let's go to Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Patricia.",735

Realizing you had a tough compare in transaction processing, you still had Cognitive Apps decline. What specifically is being done to turn that business around to growth as we get into 2022? And what are the assets that will drive the growth there?
And if I could, Jim, could you just bridge the $12 billion to $13 billion in free cash flow in '22 versus the $10.8 billion? It seems if you hit the mid-single-digit growth rate there, that's an incremental maybe $3 billion in revenues versus the $1 billion to $2 billion in incremental cash flow, which seems like very high cash flow margins. So if you could clarify that bridge?",131

Look, we expect to see improving software performance through the year, both in '21 and headed into '22. As Jim said in the prepared remarks, a lot of the shortfall in software came from the TPP segment. And in that segment, as you know, we intend to have very large deals that tend to come in the fourth quarter. So it was somewhat unique in 2020, and that is not something we expect to see at the same scale going forward. So the headwinds in some sense will reduce because of the reduction in that aspect. 
Then on the positive side, we expect to see continued Red Hat growth. We expect to see continued growth from our Cloud Paks. We expect to see continued growth as the sales force changes we have made drive a much greater focus across IBM on this part of the portfolio, both in Cloud & Data Platform, and on the AI applications. 
We also expect to see, as Jim mentioned, that as the security and the IoT assets within the applications become larger and larger with the growth there, they will more than compensate for some of the other pieces that may not be so big because just the law of compounding is going to get us there. 
And lastly, remember, other than all the organic actions, we are also doing inorganic actions. You saw us announce both Instana and StackRox in the last couple of months. And these and other future acquisitions would also drive growth because they help the entire portfolio, not just acquired pieces. Jim?",268

Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Very important as many of our investors have been asking us about the free cash flow generation profile of this company. Why? It's because it's going to be the engine to fuel the investments for that growth that we committed here in 2021. But let me take a step back because I think it's important to understand coming off of a strong finish on free cash flow in 2020 delivering $10.8 billion, 143% free cash flow realization, first, how does that bridge go to 2021 at $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. And then I think you'll see how we then continue to accelerate that to $12 billion to $13 billion overall. 
So as we said in the prepared remarks, first, revenue growth, which is going to be essential here. Second, and I think you've seen this over the last couple of years, we have driven the productivity and operating leverage out of this business with our gross margin expansions, I think, now for about 8 to 10 quarters in a row. So not only are we going to now turn around to revenue growth, we're going to get operating leverage. And that's going to deliver a significant amount of operating profit contribution to free cash flow, coupled with Red Hat being accretive net of interest expense already as we achieve our accretion in third quarter. 
Now what's happening from 2020 to 2021? We're going to get substantial operating profit, but we've got a big cash tax headwind in 2021. So while you're seeing nice growth from $10.8 billion to $11 billion to $12 billion, we're already overcompensating for $1 billion roughly of cash tax headwind. Now when you get to 2022, we're going to get that same level of operating profit contribution that has good leverage, but we have a much more de minimis cash tax headwind in 2022, which makes us very confident in our ability to give guidance at those levels for the next 2 years.",342

The revenue trajectory on GTS, the drop was sort of notable, I think, it went down to 8% decline versus the 4%, 5% trend line for the last few quarters. I'd love to understand from you, Arvind or Martin, what are you hearing from your customers? I mean, do you see this as a reflection that they're perhaps pausing their decision until the spin is done or perhaps picking up calls from your competition as this is going on? I'd just love to understand what's driving that dynamic there. And then, Jim, if you could remind me, when does the Form 10 get publicly disseminated, that would be great.",124

These are really important clients for us. As both Jim and Martin said, they are our most important clients in very important industries for the overall economy.  
As we have talked to all of the clients, we have, by and large, gotten very positive feedback. Over 98% of them are quite satisfied with our description of what will happen, both are in terms of their contracts, the service they'll get from us and the assured guarantee of access to technical resources, both from the new company and from IBM over time. 
As that plays through, we see that. As Jim mentioned, and he touched on it very briefly, we do measure how our clients think of us. We call it Net Promoter Score measurements, and we are seeing that those have gone up, not down. So we feel comfortable that the clients will go through it. 
Now all that said, maybe a few clients are going to pause on certain project elements given their own business. And so in that -- in the GTS business, clients are allowed to dial volumes up a little bit or down a little bit based on their own performance. That is built into these contracts. So given let's say what's happening in the overall economy, you see some of that play through in both directions. And that is the large cause of that. 
The other side of it, which is the new logos, gives us confidence that the performance should be on an improving trajectory going into 2021. So with that, let me give it to Jim, both to sort of add a little bit more color on the financials there and to just to repeat what he said about the Form 10.",316
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297867.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,14,"Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Amit, for the question. Just to put it in perspective, GTS $6.6 billion here in the quarter, to your point, down, what, 5.5% at actual, down 7.5%, give or take, at constant currency. It was though, up 2% quarter-to-quarter. So we saw nice seasonality and by the way, pretty consistent with what our normal 3Q to 4Q would be in GTS. 
Now with that said, in addition to what Arvind had talked about, which is what we've been dealing with for the last 4 quarters or so, give the external economic environment with lower client base business volumes, we actually took, as I said in my prepared remarks, we took proactive actions to restructure some of our contracts to optimize our Managed Infrastructure Services business to get ready for the spin, which is what your second question is. 
As we talked about on October 8, we are going to create value through focus in both IBM and in NewCo. And in NewCo, the focus is on getting the fundamentals of this business in terms of value. That's margin, profit and cash. And with these actions, we will improve on the financial profile as we prepare for the spin-off, leading to, again, an improved EBITDA profile, approaching double digits, post-spin, a solid balance sheet targeting investment-grade rating and a strong free cash flow yield and dividend yield that should be attractive to a financial value-based investor overall. 
Now with regards to your second question on the Form 10, I think I addressed that in the prepared remarks, a lot of work being done. The complexity of this as we learn each and every day, Arvind talked about the client transition, and we're very pleased with where that's going with our new logo signings and very strong renewal rates. But if you think about the legal, regulatory, financial, the carve-out work, right now, I think we're well on track to achieve what we said on October 8, which is the end of the year. And you should see the Form 10 sometime in the fall period.",349

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297869.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,16,"If I just kind of stand back from the results this quarter, typically, your revenues are up $3.4 billion from Q3 to Q4. That's the average of your last 3 years, and there's very little movement off of that average. This year, it was $2.8 billion. So at least in my eyes, it looks significantly worse. And I understand there are some issues around transaction processing. I understand year-over-year comps, but this is a sequential change, which seems to be notably below trend. And I hear your assurances around the current spending environment. 
I guess the question is -- and the elephant in the room is, how do you know that there isn't something more sinister afoot here. That there is an accelerated migration to the cloud that you are not -- IBM is not participating in or your -- particularly some of your software offerings in Cloud & Cognitive are not as competitive as you might think, and that's ultimately what's being reflected here. 
And I guess to that end as well, maybe, Arvind, you can directly address why the confidence in mid-single-digit growth in 2022? It sounds like at constant currency, IBM is going to be flattish or maybe slightly down in 2021. So what drives the 500 basis point improvement, which on a huge company like IBM, is really, really notable? How much of that do you expect to be inorganic?",234
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297870.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,17,"Okay. Toni, thank you very much. Arvind, I'll address the front-end piece, and then you could talk about the second part of Toni's question overall. Toni, you are correct with regards to the last 2 to 3 years, when you look at the sequential normal seasonality of our business top line, it's in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion, $3.4 billion. But I think you know quite well, and many of our investors know quite well, that sequential trajectory has been distorted by a couple of things. One, the Red Hat deferred revenue and acquisition; and two, a major mainframe product cycle, as you know, which is why 90 days ago, I think when you asked the question to me, I answered it on a 5-year CGR, and I was very specific, and that average is about $3 billion. 
Now with that said, we delivered, to your point, $2.8 billion. And I think we've been open and transparent that we fell short against that expectation. And we fell short, specifically in software. If you look at the balance of our portfolio, which is the remaining 65% of the revenue profile of the business, we were pretty much well within and some slightly above, given our strong mainframe finish to the year-end. And that software shortfall, as we talked about, was a culmination of the confluence of the wrap on the peak ELAs from last year. You, I think, all understand our ELA cycle, which has tremendous value to our clients and tremendous value to our financial equation. On average, those are about 3-year cycles. We had the peak cycle in 4Q '19. We grew software revenue 10% off of that. And underpinning that, the transactional volume in that software was up close to 30% overall. 
So we were in a trough year. We knew fourth quarter was going to be the most challenging quarter all year long, and we've been talking about that. Now it's really the confluence of, one, that peak cycle wrap, which we knew about because our volumes came in pretty much what we expected. But what you're seeing to the second part of your question is, yes, is there shifts that are moving to the cloud? Yes. And by the way, I think we're capitalizing on that. We got a $25 billion cloud base of business that's growing 20%. And we've got continued acceleration in our hybrid cloud platform with very good performance in Red Hat, which we could talk about later. 
But the confluence of what happened to software is really given the uncertainty in the environment. Clients are reluctant to commit long-term duration of deals. And that really hurt our -- what you would call an AUR or our deal value size. Now there's some positives to that, which I'm sure Arvind will get into. 
Number one, we got shorter-term durations now, so we have a much higher ELA pool in 2021. Number two, we had a very strong, in fact, record renewal rates, which led to a record deferred income balance, $17.1 billion overall. And even stripping out Red Hat, we had the strongest quarter-to-quarter deferred income and renewal rate in our core software organic business that we've seen in 10 years. I think that's a great instantiation of our clients committing to the value of our software portfolio overall. So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind. You can address the second piece.",572
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297871.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,18,"Thanks, Jim. And Toni, I'll address some of the software pieces, but you asked a question about the mid-single-digit growth in 2022. So Toni, let me try and just deconstruct it a little bit.
Red Hat continues to have very strong performance, mid- to maybe high-teens growth. And as it gets bigger and bigger, that's a bigger contributor to the total. Second, GBS is going to return to pre-pandemic levels by midyear, and we actually expect it to accelerate from there. But into 2022, we'll see better growth from there.
In systems, as you know, we are not going to see the product cycle dynamics as headwinds but as tailwinds going into 2022, albeit the absolute numbers are not necessarily that big. Our ecosystem investments that we are making, they benefit both GBS and software. And by ecosystem, I mean, both small and big partners that we work with who are pulling both services and software.
So when we see, for example, Salesforce, or Adobe, or ServiceNow or Workday, they all tend to pull a lot of our services work. We also partner, by the way, with the other hyperscaling clouds, both Microsoft and Amazon, and that tends to pull a lot of GBS work. On the other side, we are also partnering with a lot of smaller software vendors, and they tend to pull a lot of our software along with it. So that is there.
Now you asked about the inorganic and organic. I'll call it, the business as usual in organic is included in my mid-single-digit assessment. So by business as usual, it's just what we do. You've seen us do this for the last 3 quarters now. So deals like that would be included. And that -- for example, we did Instana and StackRox in software. Now we did 5 others in services. They're not very large, but they do tend to pull the overall business.
That is what gives me confidence that as we get through all of this, we got 1, 2, 3 growth vectors and 1 kind of flat vector going into 2022. And that is what gives us confidence about the overall growth going there.",363

So Katy, why don't I start on why we gave the guidance on revenue and on free cash flow. And then I think Jim will get into the details on your other parts of the question.
Look, I've been sort of clear. I want to measure the company on revenue growth. Revenue growth is the most important metric that I am focused on. And so we talked about the revenue growth, both for this year and for next year, which is unusual for us.
The second part, in order to get revenue growth, we need to be able to do investments. Investments are driven by free cash flow. And on free cash flow, it's a very clean number. So you can see what that is. And we've talked about that with complete transparency, both on what it is going to be and why it will grow also from '21 to '22.
That's also what we're going to measure our people on internally, and that will let then our investors know what we are measuring on. So that's why those are the 2 numbers that we are focused on driving. That's the numbers we're focused there on giving you so you could hold us accountable to those. Jim?",208

And Katy, let's talk a little bit about the revenue profile. I think Arvind just answered the 2 metrics. And by the way, I could tell you, we flipped the whole operational management system, Arvind spent a lot of time about the operating model changes, the actions he's taken on how we drive signpost milestones to deliver on those 2 fundamental objectives, which, by the way, after the third quarter, Arvind and I did an extensive outreach to many of our investors, and we got unanimous feedback on what those 2 measures should be, which is sustainability of revenue and operating free cash flow to fuel the investment overall. But let's talk about revenue.
So we talked about growth at current spot rates. You see in the supplemental charts, you see where the U.S. dollar has weakened. Right now, at current spot rates, we expect the full year somewhere around 2 points of a tailwind overall. Pretty unique position on where we've been for the last 10 years.
But underneath that, we did say that we expect the fundamentals of the business trajectory across our segments to improve, first half to second half. And that is going to be important because to an earlier question, that acceleration has to position us for an exit velocity to get into 2022 around having a credible path for a mid-single-digit growth which is what our objective is.
I would tell you, overall, we expect IBM RemainCo to grow both at actual rates and at constant currency. So that trajectory overall should give you a perspective right off the bat about where we should end go forward. NewCo, given where we ended in our backlog, we see improving trends but not getting back to growth. Because, again, as I said earlier, we are focused on the fundamentals of that business, margin, profit, cash and the strong EBITDA profile to set it up with an investment-grade balance sheet to absorb and deliver a free cash flow yield and dividend yield overall.
Underneath that, you can imagine our 2 growth engines Arvind talked about, software and GBS. And by the way, both of them, we see growth accelerating throughout the year, software being driven by strong Red Hat. Red Hat, as we talked about, we exited over $5 billion of backlog. $2.8 billion of deferred revenue. We already replenished more than what we acquired pre-acquisition. And by the way, that backlog of $5 billion is growing mid-20s. So the acceleration coming off the trough in third quarter up 16. We just posted plus 17. That should continue to accelerate as we move through.
And then GBS. We exited our backlogs up. Our signings of small deals were up nicely and accelerated from 3Q to 4Q. We got acquisitions we're going to continue to scale. Our book-to-bill exiting fourth quarter was 1.3, the strongest it's been in a long period of time. And we've got a nice backlog revenue run out in '21 that shows that acceleration, which gives us confidence that we can get back to pre-pandemic growth as early as the midyear.",518

Thanks, Matt. I'll take this one. To your question, Application Management Services overall is an integral part of our overall hybrid cloud platform thesis. As Arvind talked about already and we shared even the prepared chart, that platform has an economic equation that has a multiplier effect. And we talked about what, for every $1 of platform, we get $3 to $5 of software, we get $6 to $8 of services, both IBM and even as we scale with our ecosystem partnerships, that we've accelerated over the last 6 months, they get into that return also.
But let's talk about AMS. We've been speaking about this for the last few quarters, there definitely is a secular shift we know it. A shift from on-prem enterprise application component. Clients are prioritizing stability of applications in this environment. And we all know the reduce in discretionary spend components. 
But there's a flip side to that shift that's happening overall. And that's exactly where you went, which clients are accelerating their digital transformation and journeys to cloud. And we participate in there. Look at GBS' cloud business. We exited the year with almost a $6 billion book of business, accelerating throughout the year. We finished the year up double digits overall, up 11%. And AMS underneath that is up almost 10%. So a very big component of that is it's essential from a cloud transformation services as part of that hybrid cloud platform.
Underneath that, what's driving it is application modernization work. That's where we participate in the full spectrum from advise to build to move and to manage. The front end of that, advise and build, is predominantly a consulting-based play. Consulting's up nicely, and our backlog, 17%. But as that journey continues, we'll start seeing AMS come back.
And just a few data points for you. Number one, with that secular shift to the cloud, we are capitalizing, as I said, AMS, up 8% in our total cloud book of business. We returned AMS back in total to signings growth in the quarter. Our backlog improved 5 points quarter-to-quarter. And to the heart of your question, 80% of our Red Hat and Cloud Pak placements are AMS incumbency enterprise clients. So it has tremendous value in leveraging that overall, and -- which is why we think it's essential to have a differentiated value proposition for our hybrid cloud platform.",399

I'm not sure if I heard in your answer. Any call-outs on EPS cadence first half versus second half beyond the $260 million in charges and normal seasonality? I know you're not giving formal guidance, but I thought I'd ask anyway. But on the revenue side, just thinking about -- I know you've said a lot again on revenue. But if you're looking at revenue growth for fiscal '21, I know you talked about revenue growth in fiscal '20, but of course, COVID hit and the world changed. So how was your outlook this year for growth different from this time last year in terms of your conviction? I heard some of the drivers, but just really here asking about conviction and visibility.",129
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297881.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"Tien-Tsin. So maybe let me start about the conviction on revenue growth. So look, from what we can see, compared to what we saw last year, which is why we did not provide guidance in 2020, or rather we pulled guidance back in April. We feel that the economy, while there is uncertainty, certainly better than it was last year, so we don't expect to see anything worse compared to last year. 
If anything, we talked about the second half being better because we expect as we get through that -- there is going to be more demand. These projects are going to go forward. And as we look underneath because also in the questions that Matt had about Red Hat and modernization, you can also see that people are signing up for bigger and bigger projects around modernization because they need to move on to their businesses also. There's only so long that you can belt tighten and not come out worse. So they're getting past their belt-tightening, we think, somewhere in the next 6 months.
So that is why we have a lot more conviction. And that is why you heard Jim talk about the color from first half to second half and going forward into 2022, of an increasing trajectory, and he talked about that there is going to be growth for the remaining company at both current -- both spot rates and at constant currency. So that is why we have conviction. 
When we look at our underlying backlogs, when we look at our pipelines and we look at the demand profiles across those parts of the business. Hence, the conviction in the revenue growth. Jim?",281
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297882.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,29,"Yes. I would just add to that, Tien-Tsin. Thank you for the question. Again, as Arvind talked, this is a mindset change on how we want to operate the company. We've defined the strategy all-in, focused, aligned our portfolio, aligned our operating model. Now it's about growth and it's about driving that operating free cash flow, which is going to fuel that investment.
So around that, we talked about the trajectory overall. First of all, I should have mentioned -- I mean, as you could see in the supplemental chart, although we said revenue growth at current spot rates, you see that, that's predominantly a first half discussion. It's about 3 to 4 points of tailwind in the first half, and that dissipates quickly in the second half overall, which is why the fundamentals of the underlying business by segment will have to improve, and we expected them to improve as we move through the year.
The other thing I will tell you, underpinning, because it's a fair question. As I stated, I think we've built the credibility over the last few years that we know how to drive operating leverage within this business. So you can expect, we grew gross margins this year, I think, about 130 basis points, 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. You can expect that we're going to continue to drive operating leverage in this business, and we'll have margin expansion in '21.
And second, the other variable that you always ask me and we talk about and we try to be very transparent underneath it is our tax rate. And while we operate in 100-plus countries around the world, the geographic product mix can impact that dramatically, tax structures, audits, et cetera, can change it. From our perspective, we finished fourth quarter at what, I think, 10.4% from an operating tax rate. Pretty consistent, by the way, of third quarter and pretty consistent last year.
And just given what I said earlier one on a book tax rate, we're going to have a headwind on cash taxes, I would expect our tax rate to go up a few points from that 10.4%. So it gives you a little bit more color underneath the revenue profile, the operating leverage and tax. And again, we're just trying to change a mindset here.",387

And maybe identify what changes you expect to be most impactful and why. And sorry for the 2-part question but Jim, perhaps you could reflect on whether there's -- or how much, if any, free cash tailwind you're seeing in '20 and '21 and '22 from the change in the IGF receivables.",77
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297885.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"David. Look, this is something I'm deeply, deeply passionate about, so I'm happy to talk about this. Look, every model has its time and then it's time to evolve. So we are evolving in reaction to client needs. And we had sort of operated with our, call it, a more homogeneous model that kind of went across all our segments, all our clients for a long time.
So what are we doing? There is a set of clients who do tend to buy, I'll call it, a lot of IBM. Let's call them they need the integrated value of IBM. We're calling that the first segment. So in this first segment, we are also going to make extra investments in them being able to experience IBM technically. So we are using the term garages. We have people who go in there and work side-by-side with the client, well, virtually right now. As well as being able to have a lot of focus on deployment, and we'll pay the people on deployment, not on selling. So this first segment is going to have that attention with extra assisting. So they should see a lot of positive, and we expect to see growth coming out of our garages and our deployment manages.
Then there is a segment which is largely going to be channel ready. So there, we do get, as Jim talked about, operational leverage, you don't need the other people. The channel is quite capable, but rather put more money into the channel and work with them to go after that. That's the other end of the spectrum.
Then there is a set of clients, let's call it, between these 2 spectrums, they tend to buy mostly from 1 or 2 parts of IBM. So they deeply value the specialists but they don't need the generalists who were covering them. So we're going to take that money and then pour it into more specialists who can then cover those clients.
So there is a first segment which does have an integrated value. There is the top half of the second segment, which is going to be much more specialists. You can think of them as being technology-led sales, by and large. And then there is going to be a large part, which is ecosystem-led, whether system integrators, resellers, distributors, et cetera. We believe that this simplicity is going to drive a lot more outcome for us and for our clients.
And by the way, we are also going to ensure that this is the structure that all parts of IBM have. So it's not that different parts of IBM will have slightly different client segmentations. It's completely consistent across all. 
This, we believe, unlocks a few points of revenue growth. So you said impactful. I expect that this will unlock a few points of revenue growth, albeit, let me acknowledge that it probably takes 6 months to flow through the system.",491
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4968.0,2250660.0,87297886.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,33,"David, let me address your good question around the IGF business and the tailwinds overall. First, just taking a step back. Within that overall IGF, consistent with our strategy, we are focusing this part of our portfolio directly aligned to be a captive financing aligned to our hybrid cloud and AI platform strategy overall. And you've seen us take a disciplined approach around both portfolio and financial management.
What am I saying? One, early in '29 (sic) [ '19 ], we started winding down our OEM financing business. Then in 2020, as part of prudent austerity measures, as we prioritized liquidity, we actually announced, and you heard that in the fourth quarter, selling our IBM commercial financing receivables as part of our risk mitigation, cash and liquidity management practices. So now let me bring this all back together because I think these actions that we've taken have resulted in a more focused and healthier financing portfolio with a very much better overall debt level and refinancing requirements that are not going to be needed overall.
So if you look at the strengthening of our balance sheet, our liquidity position exiting 2020, we talked about $14.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We talked about $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We got about $4 billion to $5 billion in 2020 around leveraging and focusing that strategy about IGF. And I would assume probably something very similar to that overall.
So when you take the power of those 3 buckets, $14 billion of cash, which I should tell you is about 2x the operating level that we need to run this company. So the excess cash there, the strong free cash flow generation and the IGF actions of $3 billion to $5 billion, let's call it, you got about $30 billion of firepower.
Now that's a source of cash view. Now we all know in use of cash view. What do we know? One, I talked about the $3 billion, which will be cash out the door with regards to the structural actions and the cash taxes based on the transaction. Second, we are very committed to our secure and modestly growing dividend policy. That's about $6 billion. And then third, we continue to plan to delever, and our normal maturities are a little bit less than $7 billion this year. You add those up, you're about $15 billion plus.
So we've got firepower here that gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, delever to get back to our targeted leverage ratios, and also support that secure and modestly growing dividend.",440

Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to be speaking with all of you again. In our last call, we shared our financial expectations for the year: revenue growth and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While it's still early in the year and a lot remains to be done, we are confident enough to say that we are on track. 
Last quarter, I also talked about how the event of the last year have increased the needs for our clients to accelerate their digital transformations. This is continuing and the overall spend environment is improving, while there are some clear differences by geography and industry.
With that as a backdrop, in the first quarter, we posted revenue growth at actual rates and grew free cash flow. We can see signs of progress in a number of areas. Our results in Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services revenue show they are on an improved trajectory, including a return to growth in Consulting. IBM Z again demonstrated its value as an enduring platform. Meanwhile, we improved margins in our Global Technology Services, led by Managed Infrastructure Services.
As Jim will explain to you, all of this helped to deliver free cash flow improvement, which is a key focus area. As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on the important changes we are making to the company from the acquisitions we are making to the investments to expand our partner ecosystem, to the significant overhaul of our go-to-market model that we announced back in January to the changes we're bringing to our culture to instill more of a growth mindset.
As you know, we're also executing the separation of a Managed Infrastructure Services business, now branded Kyndryl, which is on track to be completed by the end of the year. These changes are all well underway. Though as you would expect, it will take some time to see the full benefit. I have immense confidence in our strategy around the transformative power of hybrid cloud and AI and the decisive moves we are making provide a solid foundation for us to unlock future growth.
As I've told you before, we see the hybrid cloud opportunity at $1 trillion, with less than 25% of workloads having moved to the cloud so far. We are reshaping our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. For us, the case for hybrid cloud is clear. Businesses have made massive investments in their IT infrastructure and are dealing with specific constraints such as compliance, data sovereignty and latency needs in their operations. They need an environment that is not only hybrid, but a hybrid platform that is flexible, secure and built from open source innovation. This gives them a credible path to modernizing legacy systems with advanced cloud services and building cloud-native apps. This is what we have built our platform for and why we have such confidence in our strategy.
IBM's approach is platform-centric. Linux, Containers and Kubernetes are the foundation of our hybrid cloud platform, which is based on Red Hat OpenShift. We have a vast software portfolio, Cloud Paks, modernized to run cloud-native anywhere. Our GBS expertise is a key factor in driving consumption and in helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation journeys. And our systems and industry-specific public cloud provide differentiated infrastructure.
The economics of our platform are designed to drive growth across all of IBM. The platform itself contributes. But then for every dollar of platform spend, clients spend $3 to $5 in software and $6 to $8 in services. IBM together with our growing ecosystem partners are positioned to capture that value.
Let me now turn my attention to some of the progress and proof points we have seen in the past quarter as we execute on our hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. In the last quarter, more companies chose IBM to help them realize the potential of hybrid cloud. That includes PNC Bank, Banorte and EGYPTAIR. We're also helping Siemens replatform MindSphere, their IoT software on top of Red Hat OpenShift. That makes it possible for them to deploy on both public and private clouds. We now have 3,000 clients using our hybrid cloud platform.
We are also focused on helping companies use our rich AI capabilities to drive business outcomes. In the past quarter, we have forged important partnership with companies like Palantir to simplify how businesses build and deploy AI applications across public clouds, private clouds and on-premise. As part of this collaboration, IBM and Palantir are creating a new offering called Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, allowing clients to scale AI with confidence.
In addition to Palantir, we continue to expand our AI ecosystem by building on partnerships with companies like Box, Cloudera and MongoDB. In March, the global research firm Gartner positioned IBM as a leader in 3 Gartner Magic Quadrant AI report, now making IBM a leader in 12 AI Magic Quadrants. This recognition highlights the important work we have been doing to bring new innovations from our research teams in core areas such as natural language processing, trust and automation.
To facilitate our clients' adoption of our focused hybrid cloud and AI solutions, as I said in January, we announced significant changes in our go-to-market model. We drastically simplified our sales model by adopting a single consistent segmentation in providing clients with a more technical and experiential approach and are investing in and elevating the role of our ecosystem partners to deliver more value to clients.
Finally, we have adjusted the incentive structure for our sales teams to better align our reward system with our strategy. While it will take time for these changes to yield results, we are seeing some green shoots from our transformation. We are investing in and scaling what we call presales garages to co-create with our clients a lot earlier in the sales process. We have had around 200 of our top clients experience new use cases for our solutions, and our ecosystem strategy and approach with strategic partners is already opening new areas of growth in GBS.
I want to spend a minute on innovation. We have a strong pipeline of innovation, and some of these are already differentiating our portfolio. As I said earlier, IBM Z again demonstrated its value this quarter. This is thanks to the critical innovations we bring to each new generation of IBM Z, which continue to spur renewed interest and drive client demand. In fact, z15 is now shipping the largest capacity in the platform's history.
Another innovation we recently put on the market relates to Red Hat OpenShift, the cornerstone of our hybrid cloud platform. OpenShift now includes new capabilities around security and scalability, both of which are critical to enterprise needs. Next up, our new Linux and Kubernetes-based innovations that will help businesses extend hybrid cloud to the edge, scale and secure cloud native applications and consume technologies on OpenShift as a managed service.
Let me now turn to other opportunities we are seizing that will play out over the longer term. We announced that we are embarking on a decade-long partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, who will tap into the power of AI, hybrid cloud, high-performance computing and quantum computing to accelerate the process of scientific discovery. As part of this collaboration, IBM will install the first on-premises IBM Q System One in Ohio within the United States. As you know, this is an area of incredible promise. Quantum has the potential to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value for our clients by the end of the decade. To seize this opportunity, we announced a road map to build a 1,000-plus cubit quantum computer by 2023. We remain excited by these developments.
You may also have seen the partnership we announced with Intel to advance next-generation logic and packaging technologies. This collaboration will be key in accelerating innovation and enhancing the competitiveness of the semiconductor industry. As we reshape our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company, we are continuing to use our scale, scope and trust to make an impact on important societal issues. For instance, to help tackle the climate crisis, IBM announced a Net Zero pledge by 2030. We have been transparent in that our efforts are focused on reducing actual emissions without the use of carbon assets. We also intend to use emerging technologies to remove emissions equal to our residual emissions, leveraging IBM Research to help accelerate the discovery of materials for these technologies. 
Fundamental to our business growth is fostering a culture of conscious inclusion where innovation can thrive and individuals progress. Last year, we made a commitment to be more transparent in how we report diversity and inclusion. And last week, we released our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Report. What you will see is that we have increased our diversity representation and achieved best-in-class inclusion scores from our employees. We are leveraging our industry-leading hiring practices, skills development and advancement opportunities to continue our progress. I'm happy to expand on our ESG efforts in the Q&A. 
Before I turn it over to Jim, I will close with a comment on our future. Our objectives are clear: sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth post separation and strong cash generation. We are taking actions investing and aligning compensation to achieve this, and our first quarter results are another step in the right direction towards our future. 
Jim, over to you.",1587
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429946.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the numbers. In the first quarter, our revenue of $17.7 billion grew 1% as reported. We expanded our gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars. We reported operating earnings per share of $1.77. 
Our adjusted free cash flow was up, resulting in $11.6 billion over the last year. And our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. As Arvind said, we made progress, but more to do. You can see this progress in our revenue with an improvement in the trajectory of our constant currency results. 
Our revenue was up in cloud and cognitive software and in systems, and consulting returned to growth. We're capitalizing on clients' digital transformations and journeys to cloud. We take a platform approach to hybrid cloud and AI with capabilities in infrastructure, software and cloud services. 
Across these, our cloud revenue was up 18% in the quarter and over the last 12 months and now stands at over $26 billion for the last year. The fundamentals in our business model also continued to improve. We expanded operating gross profit margin this quarter by 110 basis points. I'll remind you how we manage our business. We manage our services businesses at the gross margin level while we look to capture the value of our product-based businesses at the pretax margin level. 
We had good margin expansion across our segments on those basis. This operating leverage enables a higher level of investment. We're investing in innovation, in skills and in our ecosystem as we execute on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our hiring was up year-to-year with thousands of people hired in the quarter. We closed 6 acquisitions since mid-December. We're building out presales garages, adding go-to-market and delivery capabilities in GBS and technical skills in Red Hat. And we're increasing R&D in areas like AI and quantum to drive innovation. 
Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect this investment, though it was offset by lower workforce rebalancing charges year-to-year and lower travel expense in the current environment. Let me round out the financial highlights with some color on our strong free cash flow and balance sheet and liquidity position. 
We had a good start to the year with $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow and $11.6 billion over the last year. This adjusted view excludes the cash impact of over $600 million for the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter and transaction charges associated with the separation of our Managed Infrastructure Services business. 
This $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow is up $800 million year-to-year, driven by profit growth and continued working capital efficiencies. We had both strong cash collections and renewal rates in software. These software renewal rates drove our total deferred income to over $18 billion, which is an all-time high. Our free cash flow performance in the quarter contributed to our cash balance of $11.3 billion. 
While this is down $3 billion from year-end, our debt was down $5 billion. We've now reduced our debt by about $17 billion from the peak. So we made good progress in deleveraging without sacrificing investments in our business or our solid dividend policy. 
Now let me turn to the segments. Cloud and cognitive software grew 1%, driven by cloud and data platforms and cognitive applications. Our cloud revenue in this segment was up 34%. This reflects the investments and actions we've taken to capture the hybrid cloud opportunity with solutions like Red Hat OpenShift and Cloud Paks. Our cloud software is now $7.5 billion over the last year, which is about 1/3 of our segment revenue. Across cloud and cognitive software, we continue to increase our subscription and support renewal rates, driving the record deferred income levels I just mentioned. 
Looking at our software performance by business area. Cloud and data platforms, which is about half of our segment, revenue grew at a double-digit rate. Red Hat continued solid performance with normalized revenue growth of 15%, led by Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift, both of which continue to gain share. With about 3,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, we've now tripled the revenue base of OpenShift since we acquired Red Hat. I'll remind you, we wrapped on the acquisition of Red Hat in the middle of last year. In this quarter, cloud and data platforms delivered 2% normalized growth. In cloud and data platforms, we also improved the year-to-year trajectory across a number of key areas, including integration, data science and AI ops. 
In Cognitive Applications, revenue grew 2% this quarter, led by strength across security software and services. Our security solutions like Cloud Pak for Security helped enterprises to manage threats and protect their digital workloads, data and identities across hybrid cloud environments. And clients opted for accelerated time to value and ease of operation with QRadar on cloud to rapidly detect cybersecurity tax and network breaches. As expected, our transaction processing platforms revenue declined. We provide flexibility to our clients in how they purchase our software. Clients buying behaviors have been shifting toward more consumption-based models. As a result, we are seeing a continued preference for OpEx over CapEx, putting pressure on perpetual licenses. Though this quarter, we had strong renewals in our TPP software, which I'll remind you, provides mission-critical capabilities to our clients. Looking at the profit for this segment, we expanded pretax margin while continuing to invest in new innovation and our software ecosystem. 
Turning to GBS. Our year-to-year revenue trajectory improved about 4 points, with consulting returning to growth. We're capitalizing on the market trends. Clients are digitally transforming their businesses, using hybrid cloud and AI to capture new growth opportunities, increase productivity and create operating flexibility. Our revenue performance this quarter reflects this. GBS cloud revenue growth accelerated to almost 30%, doubling its growth rate from the prior quarter with strong growth across the portfolio. We see this in consulting where we had strong growth in our advice and build offerings. This reflects expanding practices with ecosystem partners like Salesforce and Adobe and strong momentum in our Red Hat practice.  
In fact, we doubled the number of Red Hat client engagements from the prior year to over 150, working with companies such as HBO, Marriott, Vodafone and Honda. We've now signed $2 billion of business in our Red Hat practice inception to date. Within Application Management, we had growth in offerings which build and move applications to the cloud. This growth was offset by declines in on-premise activity. 
Our application incumbency enables GBS to be the partner of choice for our clients' digital transformation. It is high value to our clients and to IBM and is an important component of IBM's hybrid cloud strategy and platform adoption. For example, GBS continues to drive 1/3 of our Cloud Pak revenue. And of those engagements, roughly 80% are with application management clients. 
We are also capturing the opportunity in business transformation services or what we call intelligent workflows. Within consulting, we had double-digit growth in offerings, which leverage data and AI to transform client processes in areas like finance and supply chain. And in Global Process Services, revenue growth accelerated to 19%. We had broad-based growth in areas such as finance and talent and transformation as clients leverage hybrid cloud to scale their activities to capture productivity and gain insights. 
Turning to profit. We continue to expand GBS gross margin, which was up 100 basis points this quarter. This was driven by our shift to higher value offerings, increased productivity and improving delivery capabilities, which results in better margin realization. In this quarter, we still had some margin benefit from reduced client-related travel. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in GBS organically and inorganically to accelerate the revenue performance. 
We closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter. We are building and expanding practices in support of ISV partners, and we continue to hire adding more sales and delivery capacity, contributing to an increase of more than 5% in our go-to-market resources since last year. 
Systems revenue was up 2%, led by strong performance in IBM Z, while product cycle dynamics continue to play out across power and storage. Our IBM Z revenue was up 49%. That's very strong growth, especially more than 6 quarters into the z15 product cycle. We had traction in areas like financial services, where robust market volatility drove demand for increased capacity. Clients also purchased z15 for its enterprise-grade security and unmatched reliability for regulatory requirements. Simply put, this platform is secure, scalable and reliable. IBM Z is an enduring platform, developed and optimized to support enterprise's most mission-critical applications. 
The IBM Z platform is also an important element in our hybrid cloud strategy, attracting new workloads, integrating cloud native capabilities, including Red Hat, and supporting our industry-specific cloud solutions. And with this quarter's performance, the z15 program to date has now outpaced the strong performance of the z14 program. This further demonstrates the lasting value of the IBM Z platform. With solid gross margin performance in IBM Z and Power, our Systems segment improved gross and pretax margins year-to-year. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 5%, which is about a 3-point improvement from last quarter's rate. Over the last few quarters, we've talked about an impact of GTS revenue from lower client business volumes. This quarter, we saw an improved trajectory in project activity and client-based business volumes, including in some of the industry's most affected by the pandemic, such as retail and consumer products. We're encouraged by this trend. 
Our year-to-year signings performance reflects a difficult compare. Last year, GTS had strong signings growth driven by large renewals at Anthem and Caixa Bank. That said, our midsize deals grew this quarter. Enterprises continue to see the long-term value for GTS to design, run and manage the most modern, efficient and reliable technology infrastructures. We see this in both the renewal rates this quarter, which were consistent with history and in the new logo wins at clients such as Generali and Pitney Bowes. 
Let me now provide an update on the progress we're making to separate Kyndryl, our Managed Infrastructure Services business. Like last quarter, I'll quickly touch on 3 areas: client engagements, actions to optimize the business model, and the execution of the necessary milestones to enable the transaction. From a client perspective, we're continuing to work with our clients to ensure a smooth transition. We have done extensive client outreach, and over 90% have had a very positive reaction. Clients see the long-term value and benefit for Kyndryl to help them build a strong, secure, resilient and adaptive digital capabilities. 
Regarding the business model, we have taken several actions to position the business for an improved margin, profit and cash generation profile. This quarter, we expanded GTS segment gross margin by 60 basis points with contribution from infrastructure services. The project activity and client-based business volumes have a higher margin profile as they utilize existing resources. And so as these volumes recover, we get operating leverage. 
Additionally, the contract and productivity actions we have taken are just starting to contribute to gross margin improvement. Finally, in addition to establishing a name, headquarters location and expanding the leadership team, we continue to make good progress on executing the necessary financial, legal and regulatory milestones to enable the transaction. We remain on track to close by the end of the year and still expect the Form 10 to be available in the fall. 
Now I'll bring it back up to the IBM level with a quick summary of the quarter and our view of the full year. Our revenue trajectory improved in the first quarter, driven by Cloud & Cognitive Software, Global Business Services and strong IBM Z performance late in the product cycle. We continue to improve the fundamentals of our business model with operating leverage enabling a higher level of investment, and we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We're off to a good start. But as we said, more to do over the course of 2021. We're investing in skills, ecosystem and innovation as we execute our hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. 
We've redesigned our go-to-market model and expect to yield benefits as we move through the year. We're executing the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter and are continuing through the first half of this year. Some of this will improve the profit profile of our infrastructure services business, but more of the savings will be reinvested in IBM's remaining business. And as I just mentioned, we'll be working to complete the separation of Kyndryl by the end of the year. 
As we look forward, we're focused on revenue growth and cash generation. For the year, we continue to expect revenue growth at current spot rates and to deliver $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. I'll remind you, adjusted free cash flow expectations exclude the $3 billion of cash impacts this year associated with both structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter and the transaction charges for the spin-off. I'll make a couple of comments on revenue and free cash flow for the next quarter. 
As you've seen, the U.S. dollar has strengthened over the last 90 days, which impacts us by about 1 point of revenue growth for the year. Despite this, the average of analyst revenue estimates for the second quarter look reasonable. And as I said, we're maintaining our expectations for revenue growth for the year. We also had a strong start to free cash flow with good profit and working capital performance. 
Profit growth will continue to contribute to our cash performance. But we also expect over half of the $1 billion full year cash tax headwind I mentioned in January to hit in the second quarter. And looking at our book tax rate in the second quarter, we expect the rate to be similar to second quarter last year or a couple of points higher.  Bringing all of this together, we expect to make incremental progress in the second quarter as we deliver on our full year expectations. 
So with that, let's go to Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Patricia.",2363

Good to see cloud and cognitive return to growth in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in terms of the underlying demand environment in software and just where you are in dealing with some of the issues that weighed on the more transactional side of the business in Q4. And then software going forward, just wondering how we should think about the cadence of revenue for the balance of the year from here?",81

Look, I think that the spend environment overall is improving, Matt. I think I can say that definitely compared to the fourth quarter. And we are talking in the fourth quarter about various pauses in buying. We didn't really see that in the first quarter. Now that said, I do have to acknowledge there are some differences by geography and industry. When you look in the underlying results, you can see the Americas were stronger. There are pockets in Asia that depends very much by country, and we can all guess which ones are doing better, which ones are doing worse. It does depend upon both COVID rates and the pauses that happened then due to business circumstances.
We do sense a bit of caution in Europe, and you can see that in the numbers. So you can sort of expect that. You can also see that there are going to be differences by industry. Those most impacted are the obvious ones, travel, tourism and all others that then get touched by those. So that's the color on what's happening. However, as I've reiterated before, we do see our clients accelerate their digital transformation. And as they accelerate their digital transformation, our hybrid cloud thesis comes to play very strongly. Multi-cloud, which is multiple public clouds as well as private come into play, all the reasons that I mentioned around sovereignty and choice come into play, and you can see that then in our Red Hat results.
So then explicitly addressing the cloud and cognitive software, we expect Red Hat to maintain itself in the mid- to high teens. That will show through in the cloud and data platform results being strong. We expect our applications, our AI applications, to remain in the single digits of growth, and we can see that. We talked about the strong demand for security in there. I do expect to see continued declines in our TPP software, but it doesn't really worry us. I mean those are things where if I look at a 2- or 3-year CAGR, we expect to see mid- to high single-digit declines. But in any given period, it can be a little bit lumpy, and we see that there. And so we expect this to carry on through this year.
Second quarter I would be somewhat optimistic, but we've got to go deliver it, Matt.",401

We saw M&A pick up this quarter. And all of this is meant to drive that mid-single-digit sustainable revenue growth that you've talked about, which I believe you've said that you can achieve next year. Can you just help us at a high level bridge how you get to the 4% to 5% revenue growth? What are the primary sources of growth acceleration at the segment level? How much M&A contribution should we be contemplating? And also in next year's growth rate, are you baking in the revenue benefit that you'll see as some of the internal revenue becomes reported as external post the spin?",117
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429953.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,10,"Thanks, Katy. It's pretty clear. You're a good student of what we say and publish. So let me try to unpack your question. Let me first talk about how do all these investments result in mid-single-digit revenue growth. So if you look at it, we keep saying Red Hat at mid- to high teens, leading to overall software in the mid-single digits. That will include the TPP mild decline, but the overall will be mid-single digit. That could include, I'll call it, any business-as-usual acquisitions. But the current market value, I don't see acquisitions adding a significant amount to IBM's top line. You can do the math with what we can put in, it will be well less than a point overall. We can just -- I think we can say that.
Then if I look at our go-to-market investments, whether that's technical resources, garages, client success managers or segmentation, that is not yet really paying up. You see some early signals in the 200 clients doing these things. I do expect that, that can contribute a couple of points, maybe a bit more for next year. But you'll see that inside our software and our GBS numbers. It's not additive to those. We're also investing about $1 billion in our ecosystem. That will contribute to improving GBS' growth rate to beyond the prepandemic rate. So that then takes me to GBS. Will this year come back to the pre-pandemic growth rates of 2% to 4%? But the mixture of the acquisitions and the go-to-market changes, so take them higher than that by the end of the year into next year.
Now you asked also about will internal revenue contribute to this? Okay, the internal revenue is a onetime change. So we have talked about sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth, not just for 1 year. So while it might help next year, we are not counting on that to be a contributor because that's only once. It's not every year. So hopefully, Red Hat contributing together with acquisitions, the software in the mid-single digits. GBS, with all the changes we're describing, perhaps better than mid-single digit. Systems, if I take a 2- to 3-year view, kind of flattish. But in any given year, it might increase or decrease, but not by a whole lot. It doesn't impact the top line a lot. And that's how sort of we get to the mid-single digits sustainably.
So you might get a 1-year benefit from the -- from internal going to external, but not permanent. So that's why I don't really count on that. Hopefully, that gives you an answer to your different parts of the question.",443

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429956.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,13,"Yes. I guess this is a clarification or maybe 2 clarifications. I'm wondering if you can just comment, I think you said that you think consensus revenue estimates for Q2 are reasonable. They're up about $500 million sequentially from Q1. If I look back at normal seasonality, typically, revenue is up about $1 billion, and it sounds like IT spend is improving. So if anything, one would expect better-than-normal seasonality. So I'm wondering whether you're being conservative or there were some onetime things that happened in Q1, but why wouldn't you underwrite normal or better than normal seasonality, which I have as about a $1 billion sequential increase in revenues?
And then separately, Arvind, could you just clarify, when you talk about IBM as a AI company, what role does Watson play in that? I don't think that name was really mentioned on the call. There's speculation about Watson Health. Maybe you can give us an update on how Watson fits into IBM as an AI company and specifically, what's happening with Watson Health and Watson Financial?",177
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429957.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,14,"Okay, Toni. Thank you for your question, and I'll handle the first part, provide some clarity around our forward-looking guidance and then turn it over to Arvind for your second part of the question.
But as we said in prepared remarks, similar to 90 days ago, in fact, we're even more confident in the position that we put in place with regards to our 2 most important measures: one, revenue growth, and second, adjusted free cash flow, which is going to provide the fuel for the investments needed for us to capture that hybrid cloud $1 trillion TAM. Now we reiterated that we're going to grow revenue overall for the year, and that is despite currency volatility, again, with the U.S. dollar appreciating 90 days ago. We lost about 1 point of revenue for the year. And we lost about 1 point of revenue in the second quarter.
So now going to your math with regards to our historical quarter-to-quarter. Very close. I mean the math I got in my head is somewhere around $900 million, $950 million, give or take, quarter-to-quarter. We see normal historical attainment across 1Q to 2Q in both our software base of business. As Arvind said, we're feeling even more confident given the rebound here in the first quarter. And also in both of our services-based businesses, we see normal historical attainment to that roughly $900 million to $950 million.
Now given our first quarter performance of driving a very strong mainframe cycle, growing 49% in the first quarter and the seventh quarter of the program, which is unheard of, coming off of 60% growth last year, Arvind and I both believe it's very prudent for us as we go forward with our guidance to not count on continued acceleration of our mainframe. We're very pleased with the performance. We're pleased with the value proposition. But I would say, against that $900 million to $950 million, I would take a couple of hundred million off of that number just based on first quarter's very strong performance in Mainframe and that not concluding going forward.
So let me turn it over to Arvind for the second part.",361
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429958.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,15,"Thanks. So Toni, Watson remains critically important to us. To be absolutely clear, Watson is the brand product name for our AI capabilities. You'll see it in the market as Watson conversational agent. But you'll also see it, as for example, our security products with Watson. It is embedded inside our Cloud Pak for data and called out as Watson.
Let me give you a quick example of where we're seeing a huge amount of success. So let me take one of the large entities doing vaccine administration in the United States. When they were -- when they realized in December they could do this, they suddenly began to realize that they could get tens of millions of calls every quarter. And then how will they handle them? Staff up tens of thousands of people or perhaps deploy Watson. And so far, at one of these places, and we have deployed it a lot more than one, 5 million calls handled in the quarter with over 70% handled by Watson. You now think about extrapolating this over the year, that would make a 20 million in 4 quarters. And with the confidence building up on one program, you could imagine it going to others.
This is a lot more straightforward to do and where I think AI excels in handling issues in both improving client satisfaction because you get an instantaneous answer but also in taking cost out, and those are rare in our industry where you get both together. We see lots and lots of opportunities here. We also see a lot of Watson being embedded on how to automate data cleansing, on how to do AI operations, on dramatically improving the resilience of people's IT infrastructure.
So turning -- to net it out, Watson remains really important. AI is in the early part of its journey. Not us. Consultants have estimated $16 trillion of global productivity over the decade, maybe 5% of our way into that journey. Watson will be the tool that unlocks that for our clients, albeit in areas like IT, in data, in conversation, in call handling and in all these areas where we excel and we have a large footprint with our clients.",369

Arvind, you said the go-to-market changes have not yet had an impact. Should we expect to see some benefit in the second half of 2021? And if you could maybe address what the cadence of the benefit would be across the business segments, where would pay out first and later, that would be helpful. And separately, maybe you can just help us think through what's going on with bookings and backlog. The signings numbers were quite weak relative to the confidence you're expressing on consulting growth. Is there a pause given the upcoming spin? Or maybe any -- maybe if you could just dig down into that a little bit, that would be great.",115

Look, go-to-market changes, Wamsi, always have, I'll call it, a bit of a hysteresis loop. They take time to take impact. We rolled them out in the beginning of January, but then you have to -- there's a human part to this. You have to assign people to accounts. There is some level of learning. There's some level of changes. And all of that just takes months to flow through. I wish I could do it quicker, but I got to acknowledge it takes months. That's why you hear me say it will take time for us to see the benefit. 
Where will we see the benefit? We would expect to see improved productivity for our sales teams that cover our large accounts. That will result in better software growth and in better GBS growth. I do expect to see that in the second half. I expect to see even more of it going into 2022. As we're also investing in our -- what we're calling our ecosystem, to be clear, that is investments, whether it's in Schlumberger or Siemens or Palantir, just to name some from this last quarter. But before that, relationships we had with Box and Slack and Adobe and Salesforce and SAP, you expect to see all of those play out in the improved growth, both in software and in GBS. So you kind of sort of unpack those, and you see that. Now when I talk about why would I see more productivity in our top accounts, while the 200 Garage engagements that I mentioned, you expect that all of those will build pipeline oftentimes we might never have had in the past. So that is why you begin to see improved yield in the top accounts.
So I expect to see some definite. You'll see it in our numbers in the second half and then more going into next year. For the second part of the question, I'll hand it to Jim to talk a little bit about signings. Jim?",338
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429962.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,19,"Okay. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Let me unpack some of this for you. First of all, printed numbers, signings down 27% to your point, entirely driven by our large deal renewal comparison the last first quarter in GTS. If you remember, we signed 2 massive deals last year with Anthem and Caixa well in excess of $1 billion a piece in each. But I think this goes to the testament that I've talked about many times on this call, and that is all signings are not created equal. The duration, the mix, the offering, the content all impact how signings translate into backlog and how backlog then translates into revenue realization overall.
So let's talk a little bit about the GTS portfolio because that's where it really centers around here in the quarter. When you look at GTS, I think there's a couple of different dynamics playing out. First, we -- yes, greater than $100 million deals. We were down substantially compared to last year just off of that very tough compare. And I'll remind you, we grew GTS signings north of 40% last year.
So second, though, is our midsized deals, read that kind of $10 million to $100 million, we were up high teens. And embedded in that, we also had another nice quarter of new logos, which means we are out there winning new business, capturing new client value even in light of the announced separation with Kyndryl. The second component at the heart of your question, I think, is are we losing business? Or is business getting paused? I would think, one, with the new logo wins and second, we have consistent high renewal rates in this business. This business is very sticky from a Managed Infrastructure Services perspective. And we have high 90-plus percent renewal rates, and we have not seen that change since the announcement.
Now with that said, are there pipeline that has built up that naturally some clients are pausing so they wait to see what our Form 10 is? Yes. And I don't think we expected anything different overall. But when you take all that together, our backlog position overall in GTS and our backlog runout, we actually see continued sequential improvement, nice improvement off a fourth quarter, 3 points better. And we see that continuing modestly here from 1Q to 2Q, and that's a reflection of those new logos that are going to start ramping up. And that's a reflection of our midsized deals, which, by the way, has changed the duration in that part of the portfolio by 1 month overall, which is impacting the revenue realization. So we still feel very, very good and very comfortable. We've got a very good pipeline in front of us, and we see better revenue realization.",465

And we saw a nice improvement, I think. From what we saw in December quarter, it was still down, but a nice 4 basis points improvement nonetheless. And consulting, I think it was notable that we started to see growth over there. So I was hoping you could just help us understand if you should think about consulting growth as a leading indicator to what GBS can do. And would we expect this to be positive growth for GBS in calendar '21? And then also, have you clarified this for me, as you go through the process of splitting up these long-term contracts between IBM and NewCo, why would customers agree to do this without rebidding the contract or getting a price concession from either IBM or NewCo?",145

Let me take your question, and I appreciate the point. We are pretty pleased with the trajectory improvement overall with regards to our GBS business. We improved by 4 points quarter-to-quarter. And we talked about 90 days ago as we went through the pandemic and Arvind reiterated it here on the call tonight, what we have seen is our clients acceleration in their digital transformations and their journeys to cloud, and we expected to capitalize on that as we move forward.
So if you take a step back and just look at our first quarter performance, and then I'll translate that into what we see with our GBS business going forward. Our first quarter performance really reflects our level and the confidence in the value of our portfolio, our cloud book of business in GBS doubled its growth rate to 28% here in the first quarter. We have over a $6 billion book of business in cloud and GBS alone, leveraging our strength in application modernization and our cloud transformational services built on top of our Red Hat hybrid cloud platform. Our Red Hat engagements, we increased 150 to let alone just in the first quarter overall. And our cloud book of business is up double digits across all 3 subsectors.
Now to your point about consulting, very pleased of that leading indicator. We return back to growth. And we've been talking about the last handful of quarters how the whole journey to cloud with our value proposition about advice, move, build and manage that the front end of that equation as clients go through around application modernization really shows up in our consulting base of business and then translates into our application management business overall and our global processing services business overall, which we saw very nice growth as clients are reimagining how they run their companies, and we're capitalizing on what we call intelligent workflows. So we definitely believe that consulting is a leading indicator.
Now going forward, we are very confident in getting back in second quarter to our prepandemic levels of growth. By the way, our backlog run out in the next 90 days already shows that. But let me give you a little bit of some quantitative components behind why we're so confident.
Number one, our book-to-bill over the last 12 months is well north of 1, led by consulting, to your point, which we believe is the front end of that curve that will lend itself into GPS and into AMS. Second, we continue to have very good momentum in small and midsized deals that you know has immediate revenue realization in the near term, which has led, third, to our overall backlog level of growth. Strong growth in GBS, consulting and GPS and improving trend in our AMS business going forward. And then fourth, we talked about upfront we closed on 5 acquisitions here in the last handful of months. We are very focused on ramping, scaling and driving that business. So we feel comfortable getting back to prepandemic growth here in second quarter. We feel very confident in the full year, GBS delivering growth. And most importantly is that exit velocity in 2021 heading into 2022. GBS is an integral part of that mid-single-digit growth objective that Arvind talked about.",553

Just maybe a stupid question or clarification. Just the strength in system Z at this point in the cycle. What -- can you maybe go through that a little again? What's changed? What's different? Is it a different buying or selling motion? Just trying to understand that a little bit better.
And then just on the ecosystem strategy, Arvind, opening new areas of growth. Is there a pipeline for more deals like a Palantir and others? I'm just curious where the effort is there today and how close you are to adding more partners there? Or if that's more of a midterm expectation for us to manage or watch for?",111

Thanks, Tien-Tsin. I'll handle the IBM Z discussion and then turn it over to Arvind for the ecosystem.
We're very pleased. Seven quarters into a Z cycle, growing 49% on a 60-plus percent growth here in the first quarter of last year, a very strong comparison overall and really kind of breaks the cycle from what we've typically seen. But we saw growth. When you look at it: one, are we capitalizing on the overall encouraging trend from a macroeconomic perspective? Yes. We're also capitalizing on robust trading-based volumes in our traditional FSS space industry. So capacity needs are driving some parts of our industry consumption. But I'll tell you, we're also seeing changing regulatory requirements, clients needing backup, and recovery is very essential right now. We saw that play out in the first quarter. 
And then beyond the FSS industry, we start seeing some good adoption. And we talked about this in prior calls, where we see elongated cycles just given some industries are more impacted by the pandemic, but we see now our value proposition of cloud-native applications where we have Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift that runs on our mainframe platform and also pervasive encryption. Security is at the top of every CIO and CTO's priority list and the mainframe by definition is the most secure, most scalable, most reliable platform out there. And I think you're seeing all of that play out.",239

On your second part of your question, Tien-Tsin, on ecosystem, yes, we have a long pipeline. I expect this number to go into the high 10s, maybe not 100, but definitely into very many more. But let me caution though, when you say midterm, it's not multiple years. Each of these takes about 6 months to become real and then another few months to become into real revenue. So I would not expect that new ones we announced now will have an impact much before the end of the year. However, they will have a big impact at the very end of this year and into next year. So I'll sort of position it like that. But expect that we should be announcing these at a regular cadence.",129

And I think most of us will all understand the reasons for that. That said, in the past, there have been some criticisms that the company has prioritized returns to shareholders at the expense of growth. And I know you've talked a lot about reinvestment, cost savings among several other actions. However, in software, cloud and services, you're going out getting some pretty big companies that really don't return capital at your rate. So how do you want us to reconcile that dynamic as you look to reaccelerate and sustain growth in 2022 and beyond?",114
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429972.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,29,"So David, this is Jim. Thank you for your question. Let me -- I'm not going to talk to other competitors, but I would go check some of those about how much share buyback that they're all doing overall. But with that said, I'm only going to talk about IBM. And we feel very confident in our capital allocation process and our disciplined financial management system overall. Let me remind you 90 days ago how we entered the year. We entered the year, I think I talked about the sources and uses of our cash. We think entering the year, we had 14 -- over $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
We said we were going to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11 billion to $12 billion in the year. And that we were going to continue to optimize our IGF portfolio and set of offerings to be a captive aligned to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and that would give us another $3 billion to $5 billion. So we had, from a source perspective, about $30 billion overall. When you take that against the uses in the year, we talked about a $3 billion charge for the structural actions in 2021 and our onetime charges for the separation that goes against that $30 billion. We talked about $8 billion of debt maturities against that. And we talked about our dividend being $6 billion overall.
So that comes up to be about, what, $16 billion, $17 billion. So we think from a cash source and use perspective that we've got flexibility to continue to invest and compete in the market, both organically and inorganically while delevering to support a very strong balance sheet overall with a single A rating and also deliver given our investor base, deliver a secure and modestly growing dividend overall. And what you've seen in the first quarter, I think, only strengthens that position. We still ended the quarter with over $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And I'll remind you that we took into account $5 billion of debt maturity, $1.5 billion of dividend in the quarter, roughly $600 million on the onetime charges and another $1 billion plus in acquisitions and still ended with $11 billion overall.
So we feel very confident, and we will capitalize whether there's any inorganic opportunities. And you've seen, what, 11 acquisitions since Arvind has taken over. And we'll continue to capitalize where it makes the right client value and the right IBM value at the right economic equation going forward. But we're not constrained by sources and uses of cash.",438

If you could talk a little bit about the drivers of the change in underlying cash flow for this year. What are the key metrics? And how should that make us think about your ability to generate cash in the next fiscal year? Obviously, I'm eliminating the charges associated with the separation. If you could just talk about that. And then Arvind, since I am last, I wanted to sneak in one more. 
You've talked repeatedly about GBS growing in mid-single digits. If I just talk about -- pick a number like 5%. If you could just clarify how much is M&A within that kind of number? And in particular, when you talk about application maintenance, are you assuming that application maintenance grows within GBS? Because it's -- I think it's pretty clear that the industry is struggling for growth. And if you're assuming that application maintenance can grow within the envelope of GBS, I'd like to understand why when I think the industry faces challenges.",175
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429976.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,33,"Thanks, Keith, for the question overall. So let me handle the free cash flow and then Arvind can talk about GBS. As we said 90 days ago, which we reiterated here tonight on the call, we feel confident in the forward-looking guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in '21. And if you remember, 90 days ago, to give the investor a perspective of the sustainability, just given the $3 billion worth of charges we will have from the structural actions in the fourth quarter and the upcoming spin separation charges, we gave a perspective of 2022 that, that would accelerate to $12 billion to $13 billion of adjusted free cash flow. When you look at the underpinnings of both '21 and then 2022, I think you start seeing the fundamentals of our business model, and that is returning back the revenue growth, the operating leverage that this business can generate with some level of sustainable level of revenue growth, the underlying mix contribution of that and the continued productivity that this business drives. You will see profit growth. And also, I remind you, Red Hat, which we achieved being free cash flow accretive in the first year will continue to drive improvements.
Now we've been making great progress on working capital efficiency. And I would tell you our collections rate, we didn't talk about it, although in the prepared remarks, I talked about our record deferred income, given the strength of our software renewal position overall, all of those will continue to generate improvements going forward. But that is going to be needed in 2021 because we got about $1 billion cash tax headwind with all of that in front of us. I would say probably 60% to 70% will hit in the second quarter. So once we get through that cash tax headwind here, we feel pretty comfortable and confident in that cash generation machine, leveraging sustainable revenue growth and operating leverage in the business on our way to $12 billion to $13 billion next year.",343
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,4205.0,2253389.0,87429977.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,34,"Thanks. And Keith, you asked one of my favorite questions, how is GBS going to grow and how much will it grow? So when you look at the mid-single-digits, that's actually our nearer-term forecast. Our goals certainly are to make it grow even above that. If you look at the M&A component, look, I mean, M&A could contribute at most a couple of points to that growth. It's just would be -- that would be sort of the upper bound, and we won't necessarily see all of that even this year, but who knows? Because it's hard to predict how much those properties can grow once they're inside IBM as well. But you shouldn't expect more than that. But that's part of our path to make GBS grow faster even than the mid-single digits.
Now in terms of AMS, AMS is really important for a number of reasons. And it all depends on how you define it. If you define it as this is application management and maintenance of those applications that were in place 5 years ago. By definition, that will shrink because everybody expects massive productivity and they don't expect those to grow. And you kind of see that in the numbers. But why is that incumbency relevant? As you have knowledge of that application base and you now help the client on their cloud transformation journey, then what was that older application estate now becomes a brand-new application estate and you get growth because you're helping them transform it using AI, using workflows, using cloud. And so that contributes to growth, whether that shows up in consulting near term and then AMS long term, whether that shows up as global processor business services in the medium term, that's the kind of mix that goes on, but that is why AMS is critical to giving GBS its kind of fuel in order to grow. But that is why we are confident in the mid to single -- mid- to high single-digit growth in the longer term for GBS.
So Keith, thanks. But since we are well past over the hour, let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We had a good start to the year. We expect to continue our progress over the course of the year as we execute our strategy and realize benefits from the investments and actions we are taking. We will exit 2021 in a stronger position than we started the year, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.",424

Thank you for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be speaking with all of you again. We continue to make progress this quarter. Our revenue growth improved to 3% as reported, led by Global Business Services and our Software business, and we grew adjusted free cash flow for the first half. 
Across every industry, enterprises are using technology to redesign business processes, whether it's automation in manufacturing, telemedicine in health care or omnichannel in retail. These digital transformations are enabled by a hybrid cloud environment. The technology and services we provide to our clients enable their business growth and productivity increases and improved customer experiences. This is why our strategy is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. 
At the same time, the overall spend environment continues to improve. With the economy reopening in many parts of the world, many markets and industries are getting back on track. We see this in North America and in select industries. 
Jim will delve deeper into our performance across the different parts of our business. But I want to be clear upfront that with our results over the last 2 quarters, we remain on track to achieve our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth at actual rates and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. 
We continue to take decisive steps and make the investments required to execute on our strategy. This includes making acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio, offering new innovations and digital capabilities to our clients, expanding our partner ecosystem, accelerating changes to our go-to-market model while also instilling more of a growth mindset among our teams and building a more client-centric culture. We are executing the separation of Kyndryl, which is still on track to be completed by the end of the year. 
The recent announcements within our senior team also support and reinforce our strategic priorities. While there have been a number of changes, I'll comment on Jim Whitehurst will step down as President but remains as a senior adviser to me and the rest of the leadership team. Jim worked on many parts of our strategy, including the integration of Red Hat. Nearly 3 years since we announced the acquisition, there is no doubt this integration has been successful. Jim remained a strong believer in IBM and our strategy. Given his background, I understand his desire to become an investor. 
Going back to the execution of our strategy, we are pleased with the early signs of progress on the significant changes we are making. But as you would expect, it will take time before we realize the full benefit of these changes. Our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI is resonating among our clients and bears repeating. 
Hybrid cloud is more than a strategy. It's the reality for our clients today. They have multiple public clouds, private clouds, on-premise workloads and are dealing with stringent regulatory and security requirements. Our hybrid cloud platform gives clients the ability to flexibly deploy and manage data and applications across any environment. With hybrid cloud, clients can derive 2.5x more value in comparison to other approaches. 
Our strategy is platform-centric. Linux Containers and Kubernetes are at the heart of our hybrid cloud platform, allowing clients to write once, run anywhere. Our software portfolio, including Cloud Paks built on Red Hat OpenShift, runs cloud native. Our GBS experts work with clients across every industry to accelerate their digital transformation journeys through hybrid cloud and AI. Our systems and industry-specific public clouds provide differentiated infrastructure. This platform approach drives compelling economics to IBM and our ecosystem partners. 
This quarter, we continued to make progress in the execution of our strategy. More and more clients have chosen our technology and services as a lever for business growth. We now have over 3,200 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. That's almost 4x the number of clients just prior to our announcement of the Red Hat acquisition. GBS is helping to drive this platform adoption as we modernize and manage our clients' applications in a hybrid cloud environment. This work is accelerating, and we have now grown to 700 GBS, Red Hat-based client engagements since the acquisition. 
Our hybrid cloud platform is proving to be of immense value across industries. One example is telecommunication companies, which are amongst the largest technology spenders each year. We recently announced that major telco clients, including Verizon and Telefonica, have chosen IBM's hybrid cloud platform to transform their core networks and bring to life the era of 5G and edge computing. 
Moving on to AI. We fundamentally believe that core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to use AI to unlock real-time value from their data wherever the data resides. Our efforts are focused on bringing our AI technologies to horizontal processes. GBS helps our clients build intelligent workflows and transform their core business process, whether that be a supply chain, talent management or customer service. This allows them to boost productivity and improve the customer experience. 
An example of this is the work we are doing with CVS Health. As COVID vaccines began rolling out in the United States, IBM built in just a few weeks an AI-powered assistant to help CVS Health deal with the massive influx of calls. Watson Health handled more than 10 million calls in 3 months, improving the customer experience and reducing costs. Keep in mind, this is for one vaccine and one use case. As use cases expand, the benefits will grow. This is a compelling value proposition, and we've recently deployed Watson Assistant to other clients, ranging from York University to DFW Airport to PayPal. 
These examples and others reflect our ability to build powerful AI capabilities for business, for which we are also externally recognized. IBM was again ranked #1 in IDC's artificial intelligence market for 2020 market share. And IBM has been named a Leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms. 
Since we announced our new go-to-market model in January, we have made significant changes to our sales model and are providing clients with a more technical and experiential approach. Every client I have spoken to sees the value of this approach. They are pleased to co-innovate with IBM, leverage our Garage methodology and derive value more quickly from our solutions. Of course, we expect the return on these investments such as improved renewal rates and client expansion to take time, but time measured in months, not years. 
We've also been building and expanding a powerful ecosystem of partners who are playing a larger role in helping our clients move along their transformation journey. We're expanding the scope of our partnership with EY. To help financial institutions accelerate digital transformation, IBM and EY recently created the Financial Services Center of Excellence and launched the IBM TechHub@EY to strengthen EY's capabilities in hybrid cloud. We also built EY Diligence Edge, an AI platform hosted on the IBM Cloud using Watson to drastically decrease the time it takes to do due diligence during mergers and acquisitions. 
Another partnership that has grown stronger is with Schlumberger. Building on the partnership we announced last year, we've recently launched a new data management platform that clients can leverage to unlock value from the massive amount of data produced by the energy industry. 
We are seeing growing momentum in our IBM Cloud for financial services. Banks have stringent needs driven by compliance, security and resiliency. Launched last year, the IBM Cloud for financial services includes key control and security features built right into its very core. It makes it easier for banks to collaborate with ecosystem partners and vendors. In the second quarter, we reached a milestone of more than 100 ecosystem partners in support of clients like Bank of America and BNP Paribas. 
While we invest to expand our ecosystem, we are also investing to enhance our portfolio. In the second quarter, we announced a series of products to further differentiate our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. This includes AutoSQL that automates the management of data without having to move it, CodeNet that teaches AI systems on how to translate code, Watson Orchestrate that augments the personal productivity of professionals, Cloud Engine to simplify how developers build cloud-native apps and Mono2Micro to help companies decide which apps should move to the cloud and to transform monolithic apps into microservices. Red Hat launched new managed services on OpenShift, including API management, Apache, Kafka and data science services that make it easier than ever to build next-generation applications on OpenShift. 
Meanwhile, we continue to complement our organic investments with acquisitions. Turbonomic is an ARM provider that helps optimize the performance of any application or resources. It builds on the recent acquisition of Instana for APM and observability and the launch of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps to automate IT operations with AI. We are reinforcing our ecosystem play in GBS with the acquisition of Waeg, a leading Salesforce consulting partner in Europe. These are near-term opportunities. 
At the same time, we are focused on emerging and longer-term opportunities such as quantum computing. Quantum is an area of incredible promise slated to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value for our clients by the end of the decade. To help business and society reap the benefits of quantum computing, we have put a road map in place to build 1,000-plus qubit computer by 2023. We are forging a series of major partnerships to advance the business and science of quantum computing and post quantum encryption. This quarter, we have announced we'll join forces with the University of Tokyo in Japan, the STFC Hartree Centre in the United Kingdom and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany. This builds on the partnership we announced last quarter with the Cleveland Clinic.
Before I close, I'd like to quickly comment on some of our initiatives around societal issues. This month, we released our 2020 CSR Report. In it, you will see our efforts to apply the power of our technologies to advance societal progress such as applying supercomputing resources in support of COVID-19 research. We have made the important commitment to reach 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 without the use of carbon offsets. We are taking a series of actions to increase our diversity representation, and we are being transparent in our diversity and inclusion scores, as you can see in our report.
To close, let me reiterate my confidence in our strategy. Our second quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making towards achieving our 2 financial objectives: sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth post separation and strong cash generation. 
Jim, over to you.",1780

As always, I'll start with the financial highlights and then comment on our revenue performance, business model dynamics and cash and liquidity position before getting into the segments.
In the second quarter, we grew revenue over 3% as reported to $18.7 billion. We expanded our operating gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars 4%. We reported operating earnings per share of $2.33. Our adjusted free cash flow was $3.8 billion through the first half, and we generated $11 billion over the last year. And our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. 
We continue to make progress in our revenue performance, led by 7% growth in Global Business Services and 2% growth in Software, both at constant currency. As Arvind mentioned, the spending environment is improving. We see this in markets where reopening is progressing like the United States and Canada and in several countries in Western Europe. From an industry standpoint, we saw a meaningful improvement in some of the areas that have been more impacted by the pandemic like travel and transportation, automotive and industrial products. 
Globally, we're helping enterprise digitally transform, leveraging our platform approach. IBM's cloud revenue over the last year across software, services and infrastructure is now $27 billion, which is up at a double-digit rate. This continues to be led by Global Business Services and Cloud & Cognitive Software, whose cloud revenue this quarter was up 30% and 25%, respectively.
As our revenue performance improves, the fundamentals of our business model remains solid. We expanded operating margins with gross margin up 30 basis points and pretax margin up 70 basis points. 
We've taken actions to streamline and simplify our operating model. As I've said in the past, roughly 1/3 of the structural actions are to improve Global Technology Services profit profile ahead of the separation of Kyndryl. We're realizing these savings, and our GTS gross and pretax margins are up this quarter. The other roughly 2/3 of the targeted actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility, which we are investing for future growth. 
We're ramping investments in skills, innovation and in our ecosystem. Over the last couple of quarters, we've been aggressively hiring, adding delivery resources in GBS, technical skills in Red Hat and go-to-market capabilities across the board. We're scaling our garage footprint and skills to provide a more experiential approach to selling and consulting services. We're increasing research spend in areas like quantum, hybrid cloud and AI. We're accelerating our ecosystem investment. We also completed several acquisitions in the first half of the year to add hybrid cloud and AI software capabilities and skills in strategic GBS ecosystem partners.
Now turning to our free cash flow and balance sheet and liquidity position. We generated $3.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow in the first half. This adjusted view excludes $1.2 billion cash impact for the structural actions initiated late last year and transaction charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl. These first half charges are consistent with our expectations from the beginning of the year. This $3.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow was up slightly year-to-year with growth in our underlying business performance offset by about $700 million of the $1 billion full year cash tax headwind we discussed last quarter. 
With solid cash generation and disciplined financial management, we continue to delever while investing in the business and paying a secure and modestly growing dividend. Our cash balance at the end of June was $8.2 billion. This is down about $6 billion from year-end, while debt was down about $6.5 billion. We've now reduced our debt by about $18 billion from the peak in mid-2019.
In the first half, we also used cash to acquire businesses and return capital to shareholders, roughly $3 billion each. In the second quarter, we also increased our dividend per share for the 26th consecutive year. 
So now I'll turn to the segment results, starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software, where revenue growth improved to 2% this quarter. This performance was led by growth across both cloud and data platforms and cognitive applications, which are our software growth vectors. These were offset by declines in transaction processing platforms, our value vector. 
Stepping back, growth factors reflect key areas of importance and investment for our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, including Red Hat, automation, data and analytics and security. Our success is reflected in our software cloud revenue, which was up 25% this quarter. Transaction processing platforms as our value vector drives profit and cash while supporting mission-critical solutions for our enterprise clients. In cloud and cognitive software overall, we again had strong subscription and support renewal rates, and our software deferred income was up over $1 billion year-to-year.
Moving into the business areas. Cloud and data platforms grew 8%, led by strength in our hybrid cloud platform and Cloud Paks. Red Hat had good performance with normalized revenue growth of 17%. With consistently strong performance in Red Hat and the value of bringing IBM and Red Hat together, we've now achieved our objective of operating earnings per share accretion in 2 years, so an important acquisition milestone.
In the quarter, both RHEL and OpenShift continued to deliver strong growth and take share in their respective markets. Cloud Paks, which are built on OpenShift, continued their momentum with our enterprise clients. This quarter, we had strength in Cloud Pak for Integration, which delivers rapid and cost-saving solutions for integration development. Cloud Pak for Business Automation also had strong growth as clients leverage AI-powered automation to solve operational challenges. The acquisition of Turbonomic further extends our automation offerings.
In Cognitive Applications, revenue was up 8%. The growth was fueled by horizontal solutions, including security, software and services, Maximo asset management, weather and Sterling Supply Chain. With the acceleration of cybersecurity attacks, clients are increasingly looking for modernized security platforms to detect and respond to ransomware and other attacks. This quarter, we had strength in our integrated software and services offerings, including Cloud Pak for Security, data security and X-Force security services. IBM security offerings are employed in over 2/3 of the world's 500 largest companies.
In the area of supply chain, we are working with several new clients this quarter as demand for omnichannel solutions have accelerated requirements for Sterling Order Management in industries like retail. Our transaction processing platforms revenue declined. We provide flexibility to our clients in how they purchase this mission-critical software. Since early last year, we've seen a preference for OpEx over CapEx, putting pressure on perpetual licenses in favor of more consumption-like models. This continues, though clients remain committed to our products as we again had strong renewals in our transaction processing platform software.
Looking at Cloud & Cognitive Software profit. We grew profit dollars with operating leverage from revenue growth, while we continue to invest in new innovations and our ecosystem. 
Turning to GBS. Revenue of $4.3 billion returned to pre-pandemic levels, and revenue growth improved to 7%. Clients are accelerating the rate and pace of digital transformations using cloud and AI to gain operational insights, increase productivity and create new growth opportunities. We are capturing this market growth through our differentiated offerings in hybrid cloud, including Red Hat and intelligent workflows. We have seen signings and revenue momentum in both business transformation services, which leverage our combined consulting, BPO and core ERP capabilities as well as the application modernization and management services we provide around the hybrid cloud platforms of our clients. This is reflected in our performance this quarter. 
For example, our book-to-bill in this strong revenue quarter was greater than 1, driven by growth in digital transformations across key practice areas such as Salesforce, SAP, Workday as well as in application modernization and hybrid multicloud management. And we continue to see momentum in our small deals, which historically convert to revenue in a shorter time frame. Small deal signings grew at a high-teens rate.
Moving to revenue. We had continued momentum in GBS cloud revenue, which was up 30% in the quarter with growth across consulting, application management and GPS. Our Red Hat practice, which now contributes over 1/3 of our cloud revenue growth, again, had strong results. This quarter, we added over 170 Red Hat client engagements. The 700 engagements since the acquisition have generated over $2.5 billion of signings.
In Consulting, revenue was up 11%, driven by the investments we are making in building skills in third-party cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS and in expanding our practices with ecosystem partners such as SAP, Salesforce and Adobe. Clients are also finding value in our differentiated Garage methodology as we work with them to co-create solutions. This unique and scalable approach to innovation and execution is now embedded in the majority of our value propositions across ERP implementation, BPO and application modernization.
We also had strong growth in our intelligent workflow offerings. These are end-to-end offerings, which leverage hybrid cloud and AI to transform client processes. They connect consulting and BPO in areas such as finance, supply chain, customer service and talent transformation and contributed to our Global Process Services revenue growth of 25%.
Lastly, within Application Management, revenue was up 1% as we continue to transition from managing applications on-premise to those that run in hybrid multicloud environments.
Turning to GBS profit. Our gross profit margin declined 60 basis points this quarter. We are investing to expand on the skills and practices to continue to capture the market opportunity. We are making significant investments in both delivery and go-to-market resources, where we increased our capacity by 10%. We are adding skilled practitioners in high demand areas such as Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, Microsoft, AWS and Red Hat. And we are investing to integrate and scale our recently announced acquisitions.
Turning to systems. Revenue was down 10%, reflecting product cycle dynamics across IBM Z, power and storage. IBM Z revenue was down 13%. And I'll remind you, that compares to a very strong performance last year when we were up 68%. 
Throughout the last 8 quarters, the z15 client value has been apparent. And the program continues to outpace the strong z14 program, another proof point of IBM Z as an enduring platform. This quarter, financial services continue to drive IBM Z, given capacity requirements to address robust market volatility. With security top of mind, purchases were also driven by clients looking for capabilities such as pervasive encryption and hyper protect to secure mission-critical applications and data, both on-premises and in the cloud. The value proposition is clear, z15 is secure, scalable and reliable.
Product cycle dynamics also played out across power and storage. Power revenue was down 5%, an 8-point improvement over last quarter's rate. Storage revenue also declined, driven by high-end storage tied to the IBM Z cycle.
Looking at Systems profit. Pretax profit margin was down, reflecting a mix headwind given where we are in the z15 product cycle.
Moving to Global Technology Services. We remain focused on improving the financial profile as we position Kyndryl to be a stand-alone company by the end of the year. You will recall last year, we initiated actions for an improved margin, profit and cash generation profile upon separation. We are seeing the results of these actions in the GTS profit performance this quarter with profit dollar growth and margin expansion. Gross margin expanded 110 basis points and pretax margin 190 basis points. GTS revenue declined 4%, a modest improvement from first quarter performance driven by improving trends in client-based business volumes and project activity. 
Our current clients continue to value partnering with Kyndryl to modernize and manage their mission-critical workloads and services, as evidenced by our strong and improving renewal rate of 95%, which is up 2 points quarter-to-quarter. These renewals include 6 deals with a contract value greater than $100 million. One of these is an extension of our relationship with AT&T to provide support for data center migration and consolidation and IBM Z infrastructure management.
I'll mention we also extended our software relationship with AT&T. As an IBM strategic global networking provider, AT&T business is playing an important role in the separation of Kyndryl, using their expertise for network separation. While our performance with existing clients remain strong, as we would expect, the sales cycles for new logo clients is elongating as they await further information related to Kyndryl.
With that, let me give you a quick update on where we are in the separation process. We are continuing to build out the management system and support structure. At the same time, we are making solid progress executing on the necessary financial, legal and regulatory milestones to enable the transaction. We still expect the Form 10 to be available in the fall and remain on track to close by the end of the year.
To wrap up, let me bring it back to the IBM level. In January, we said we expected an improving financial profile throughout 2021. As I look back on our first half results, our revenue performance improved in the first quarter and then again in the second. And our adjusted free cash flow grew in the first half. Our business model fundamentals are solid. Operating margins are improving, and we're driving profit dollar growth. 
Importantly, as you've heard today, we've been taking a number of actions to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. This includes strengthening our portfolio, expanding our ecosystem and implementing go-to-market changes. And we continue to have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. 
We've been clear on the metrics we're focused on: revenue growth and cash flow. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth at current spot rates. We've maintained this view since January, though I'll remind you, since then, we've lost about 1 point of revenue growth from the dollar strengthening. We also continue to expect $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. This adjusted free cash flow excludes about $3 billion of cash impacts for structural actions and the transaction charges for the spin-off. As we look to the third quarter, we expect second and third quarter revenue dynamics to be in line with the average of the last 3 years. 
Looking at the revenue profile. More year-to-year growth should come from the underlying business performance mitigated by moderating currency benefits. We're continuing to ramp our investments. As I mentioned, we're reinvesting much of the savings from our structural actions. And as a result, this will keep expense levels higher. Our operating tax rate will also be up year-to-year, though I expect the third quarter rate to be fairly consistent with the second.
To sum it up, we made progress in the first half. While there's more to do, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2021 expectations and our financial model post separation.
So with that, let's go to Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Patricia.",2488

Cloud & Cognitive Software as well as GBS PTI margins are down year-on-year. I imagine a lot of that is coming from the investments that you walked through. But can you talk about any other factors like mix that are playing into the margin performance in those groups? And also, are you seeing any impact from labor shortages and wage increases, particularly in the services business?",71
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720608.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,7,"Sure, Katy. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, those 2 very important segments that you chose, GBS and Software, are 2 of our growth vectors within our business model. As we've said, entering the year, we guided both on revenue and on cash flow. And we said that we were going to continue to invest significantly within those growth vectors as we move forward. 
And I see -- and I think what you see playing out here in the second quarter is that investment starting to ramp up from the first quarter into the second quarter going forward. We are investing in front of demand because of what we said in the remarks, is that we see an encouraging macro and demand profile playing out. And you see that with the strong acceleration in our software base of business quarter-to-quarter and in our GBS base of business. GBS, by the way, exceeded our expectations and actually got back to pre-pandemic revenue levels overall. 
But just to really bring it home: one, we're investing; two, we have high margins in our software base of business already. And the dynamics between Red Hat and the deferred revenue dissipating as we move through the year is really what you see play out in the second quarter overall.
We feel very comfortable at the margin level in Software. We're going to continue to invest in innovation, ecosystem and skills, and we feel very good about our GBS business overall. Labor pressures, yes. There is a war for talent going on. We are investing significantly. We're bringing thousands and thousands of GBS practitioners in through the first half, and we feel pretty good about what the profile of that business is going forward.",290

You had very strong Consulting growth and GBS growth, as Jim just alluded. But gross margins compressed 60 basis points year-on-year in GBS. It would be nice to see the full leverage in the model come through with both revenue growth and margin expansion to amplify that gross profit dollar growth. So my question is really, how much longer would you need to be in investment mode in GBS? And is it possible that we see in the coming quarters or years? When do we actually see both revenue growth and margin expansion come into the model in GBS?",115
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720611.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,10,"Wamsi, thanks for the question. So just building on Katy's question upfront, we are and we'll continue to invest in this business as GBS is an essential part of our hybrid cloud platform-centric strategy. It is both the tip of the spear, if you want to call it, in driving the demand from an architectural point of view to our platform that then creates that flywheel effect that we talked about for every dollar that we land on the platform, we get $3 to $5 of software and $6 to $8 of services revenue. So we're going to invest significantly.
Now with that said, we rebounded off of second quarter. Second quarter last year, when the pandemic hit, we dropped 7 points quarter-to-quarter. We posted down 6% last year in GBS. We returned back to pre-pandemic revenue levels and exceeded growth expectations. But we're going to continue to invest in this part because of the importance GBS plays in that hybrid cloud platform, and we'll get that profit dollar contribution. 
And more importantly, you see it play out in our second key metric that we give guidance on, and that's our adjusted free cash flow. And we feel very good about where our adjusted free cash flow is through the first half, it's up year-to-year, really taking into account most of the cash tax headwind we talked about 90 days ago is pretty much behind us going forward. So our [ attainment-wise ] on adjusted free cash flow, which is really going to be a reflection of both top line revenue acceleration and operating leverage and margin as we move forward.",271

I think over the last year, you spent $3.2 billion on acquisitions. And Arvind, you said that you expect the acquisitions on a sustained basis to contribute about 100 to 150 basis points of inorganic growth per year. So is that what we should be thinking about, about $3 billion in acquisition spend, generating $600 million to $900 million that's 100 to 150 basis points of RemainCo? Is that sort of the mental model framework we should think about? And then could you comment specifically on how much acquisitions impacted GBS' reported growth rate and Cognitive Apps' reported growth rate in the quarter? Or just give us a dollar figure for the inorganic acquisition contribution to each of those businesses, please.",134
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720614.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,13,"Thanks, Toni. Great question. So let's just start with the first part. So we are generating last year, if I remember correctly, $10.8 billion of free cash flow for the year 2020. We have said $11 billion to $12 billion this year. So if you do the math between dividends, acquisitions and capital expenditures, you get to the $3 billion to $3.5 billion. If you now say that we are going to increase our free cash flow by $0.5 billion to $1 billion in a given year, then you can expect that number on inorganic activities to go up year-over-year. So the $3 billion to $3.5 billion is a fair number for this year. It would -- it could go up as we begin to increase our cash flow. We've already said next year, we expect to generate $12 billion to $13 billion, not $11 billion to $12 billion. So that gives you one sense, Toni, just on the absolute number. 
The second question you had in there on the GBS. So as we have said and I've said before, 100 to 150 basis points of growth from acquisitions. I would say that GBS is right in the top end of that number if you look at the second quarter. And if you look at Cognitive Applications, actually more cognitive software all in because I think Cognitive Applications, there was a knit, if any, from acquisitions, the number would be at the very, very low number. I mean maybe a few tens of basis points, nothing significant yet.
Now the GBS acquisitions give you an immediate return and then grow at a nice number but obviously contributing a lot less there. Think of it in the software side, the model is they come in, they do because of deferred revenue, begin to give you some acquisition but over -- revenue over 12 months. But those acquisitions grow very fast. So the contribution actually goes on for multiple years, not just for a single year from those acquisitions to the overall growth rate. And so that's quite different. GBS immediately, about 150; software, much smaller, a few tens. But imagine that all of those build up over time, and it provides a pretty nice tailwind then over 2 to 3 years.",380

And I think most investors would really agree that hybrid cloud is a reality. But maybe if you could touch on, a, why do you think IBM is better positioned to enable your customers to get there versus some of your peers? And then secondly, what does hybrid cloud mean for your profitability and free cash flow? Because I think to some extent, there's a perception, perhaps misperception that the shift from on-prem to hybrid is negative for IBM's margins.",105
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720617.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,16,"Amit, thanks. And look, so as you correctly have pointed out, I mean, I want to repeat you, but I obviously believe it. Hybrid cloud is the reality for our clients. Now to get into the more meaty parts of your question. If you look at why would people prefer us for hybrid cloud, if I look at a given large hyperscaler, they'll do hybrid as in their own public cloud and maybe some on-premise means. But the goal is to drive workload onto the public cloud. Who has the credibility to go across multiple public clouds? And that's why you hear me always say both Microsoft and Amazon are our partners, not only our competitors. And that is an important play that IBM has done for many, many decades, where we integrate across the environment that our clients operate in. So that's one part.
On a bit more of a technical level, that was the primary reason for the Red Hat acquisition. Red Hat gave us both the platform and the assets to be able to bring a hybrid cloud platform to bear because we would all agree, I think all of your listeners and all of your audience would agree that Linux is a de facto operating system. Red Hat Linux is a de facto for on-premise and private environments. Containers is the standard, which people are going to move on to. So if you say you begin really strong on-premise and private, you can take that same exact environment to multiple public. That gives us, we believe, an advantage.
Now let me acknowledge to the point you're making. If hybrid cloud is the reality that everyone is going to start having a play in hybrid. But we believe that our play is advantaged for the industries that we serve. That doesn't mean they'll use us exclusively, but they will use us to a large extent. And that is where we are headed there.
The second part now for your question, which I think actually plays right in on profitability and cash flow. The way we look at it, over 2/3 of where we get our revenue is going to lie in software. If that is the case and software comes at software margins, I'm not going to debate whether you get a difference in model from on-premise licensing to as a service licensing to term license model. All of those even out and pretty much on awash over 2 to 3 years. They are different in any given 6 months. But if I take a 2- to 3-year view, and that is what we're really fixed on driving, then all of that evens out. And you begin to get gross margins back up in the 70s and 80s, and you begin to get the profitability and cash flow associated with that. And so that is the answer to that question. 
By the way, the services based on helping our clients go there, you can begin to see that. And I know that there were a couple of questions earlier on the GBS margin. Look, we are very fixed on driving investments. So we drive investment a little bit ahead. I'm not going to tell you years ahead, but maybe 1 or 2 quarters ahead of the revenue or the revenue growth comes. We'll keep doing that, and that will impact maybe percentages, but by tens of basis points. But it shows up in absolute profit and absolute cash flow even in that part of the business.",589

I would just add one thing to that, Arvind, to build on your point. When you look at the IBM company post separation of Kyndryl, the IBM company is going to be roughly around 45% to 50% software as far as composition and mix. That carries with it a high EBITDA profile already today. 
And just as one example, when you look at our Red Hat base of business today, as CFO, I love that. That subscription model that has growth in ARR built into it overall, it's already running well north of the Rule of 40 today. So as we shift more and more to software-based contribution, that mix effect will help us bottom line in cash also.",120

And going forward, just the contribution from Cloud Paks on the financial performance of the Software segment from here.",80

So Matt, thanks for the question. Let me answer the first part of your question on the, I'll call it, the architectural elements and the use cases. And then I'll give it to Jim to answer it on the financials, this thing. So if you look at the maturity of Cloud Paks, I would tell you that every Cloud Pak we have been selling this year and deploying this year is on OpenShift. We made the move from other Kubernetes platforms onto OpenShift starting in October of '19. 
And so yes, of course, let's acknowledge that people who might have purchased prior to '19 would have bought other Kubernetes platforms. And so by last year, 2020, it was all going on to OpenShift. So I think that maturity is complete. Now if some people have prior versions of software deployed, we observed typically within 3 years from day 1, they do move to the new versions. So I would expect by the end of this year, even the prior deployed would have fully moved, and that's done. 
If you look at customer adoption, CapEx are a very strong contributor to the 3,200 clients that we mentioned. Well over half of them come through Cloud Paks. And so what are the use cases? Look, the work we're doing with Palantir is a great example. Palantir runs on top of the Cloud Pak for data, and that's a great example of what we're doing. When you hear us talk about Watson Assistant as in the CVS use case, which handled over 10 million calls in a quarter for COVID-19 vaccines, that was an assistant runs on top of another Cloud Pak. 
So these are great examples of how mature the technology is. I will tell you the OpenShift maturity is complete, and it really helps reinforce both the adoption of OpenShift as well as then clients get very comfortable with deploying OpenShift for other use cases. It's a workload at the end of the day for OpenShift, and as clients get comfortable, they might deploy it for other purposes as well.
In terms of the financials, I'll pass it to Jim.",360

Just quickly, Matt, thank you very much for the question. Taking a step back, first of all, we're very pleased with our overall progression within our software portfolio. More work to do, but we're making progress. And C&DP, which I'll remind everyone on the call and our investors, is about 50% of our overall software portfolio, and that's where the lion's share of our Cloud Paks sit. 
Now when you look at our C&DP performance, when we look at it on the way we manage the business on a historical normalized basis, we see acceleration. We returned back to growth. In first quarter, we accelerated that growth of 4% here in the second quarter. And that is really attributed to the nice momentum we're seeing in Cloud Paks. We announced Cloud Paks 18 months ago, 2 years ago. Given our ELA historical client base, that takes time to churn through that client base. And as you know, last year was the trough of our ELA renewal cycle. We started to improve on that later in the second half. And really, that ELA cycle plays out in 2022. 
But we actually had a very nice inflection here in the second quarter. Our Cloud Paks on an NRR, net revenue renewal, we're north of 100%. So we've said all along, Arvind and myself, that there's going to be a shift with Cloud Paks and there's going to be lift with Cloud Paks. And now we're starting to see a higher mix contribution of Cloud Paks, and we're starting to see where we do have shift, we're getting north of 100% on an NRR perspective. And that's an encouraging trend.",278

You had -- signings were pretty strong here. Do you feel like from a backlog and pipeline perspective that you're starting to reach a little bit of inflection to get some better growth overall out of the services unit given what you see plus some of the investments that you're making? And then separately, forgive the follow-on question, Patricia. But just on the TPP front, Transaction Processing Platforms. Is it just the comp issue that we should look for that -- the performance there to get better? Or are there other areas that we could be potentially monitoring to see some better performance there? Or is it just waiting for that transition?",122
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720625.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,24,"I'll take that, Arvind. Tien-Tsin, thank you very much for the question. When you look at our services base of business, we delivered $9.2 billion of signings in the quarter. It's up double digit at actual rate. We did see improvement in our backlog overall. It's really very different dynamics playing out here, as we tried to say in the prepared remarks. We see very strong momentum in our GBS base of business. 
When you look at our signings in the quarter, we had strong performance. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill is 1.2. Through the first half, we have roughly double-digit growth in signings across all 3 subsegments, very good growth this quarter in large deals, and we have continued momentum in small deals. And we saw improvement in our revenue, in our backlog and our revenue realization moving forward. And that gives us comfort. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect about a normal quarter-to-quarter seasonality overall. We actually see GBS accelerating growth probably about another point from the second quarter overall.
In GTS, really what we're seeing is a good performance overall, leveraging our incumbency position and driving strong renewals. We're seeing with that incumbency position, finally, a turnaround with an encouraging trend on client-based business volumes and project-based services, that they're engaging in project-based services. And our incumbency accounts were up 20% here in the second quarter. But as expected, the new logos, while we have a very healthy pipeline and new logos out there, the sales cycles are elongated, as we said in the prepared remarks. 
So we see some nice acceleration continuing in GBS overall. But again, with GTS, it's a focus on the fundamentals of the business profile of that. That means margin, profit and cash. And what I think you've seen in the second quarter, we made some very good progress overall with margins up 110 basis points, pretax margins up 190 basis points and profit dollar growth both in gross profit dollars and in pretax profit dollars.
Lastly, on TPP, yes, as we talked about many times over the last year or so, we do see the transition happening in this portfolio with regards to a shift back more and more to consumption-based, annuity-based purchasing versus in 2018 and 2019, we had a much healthier macroeconomic environment, a very cash-rich environment. Clients then shifted to more perpetual licenses. We're seeing that come back. And that's going to play as it played out where we saw the revenue upside in '18 and '19. In '20 and '21, you're going to continue to see the headwind as we've been saying. We expect that to come back in 2022, back to normal market trend growth rates overall.",455

Thank you very much. Cloud Paks are definitely an essential part as we've invested significantly to containerize our software and optimize it on top of OpenShift, our hybrid cloud platform overall. When we take a look at our Cloud Paks, we measure and manage. 
Arvind and I have a dashboard that we look at all of our large enterprise top clients overall, our deployment penetration within each of those clients. And we're able to see as we transition a client from a traditional middleware to a cloud-based containerized solution, not only can we track the deployment and how that progresses over time. We could see the dollar of yesterday versus the dollar of today as they transition to Cloud Pak. And we measure the net revenue retention, not only how much come in, whether we're able to upsell, cross-sell with multiple Cloud Paks as we move forward. 
And like I said in the second quarter, we're making progress, much more to do, but we're making progress on the mix composition of moving more and more to Cloud Paks. And we're also making progress on capturing more of our clients' wallet share dollar for that same dollar of traditional middleware overall. Hopefully, that helps, David.",206

And the particular reference point to my question is this quarter, you generated roughly 2% revenue growth. And it was -- you had the benefit of compare, particularly on some of the line items within cognitive. And so not particularly -- it's good growth but still a ways to go to reach your longer-term targets. So what happens to change that improves cognitive. And Part B of the backdrop is if I think about Red Hat, and we remain pretty positive on Red Hat even over the next couple of years, but you still face the uphill battle of the longer-term trends within cognitive. Db2 is probably a declining market. And as you've talked about in the past, Transaction Processing Platforms is also a declining, I think, revenue stream over the arc of time. So if you could just revisit on how do you reach your longer-term growth rates within cognitive.",171
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3862.0,2347766.0,89720633.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,32,"All right. Thanks, Keith. Important question and an important element of our thesis going forward. So we've been clear that our Cloud & Cognitive Software will grow mid-single digit going forward. And you're questioning, Keith, how is that going to be possible? So first and most important element, Red Hat today is sitting at about, in rough numbers, 25% of the business, growing at about 17% this quarter, let's call it, 15% in the medium term. But as opposed to being 25%, it's going to go up and up to become 35% of the total and over a longer term, even more. So 15% for 1/3 of the business, you kind of get the contribution from that, which is quite significant. 
Also, as we are both innovating organically, example in Cloud Paks, and we are acquiring businesses that are going to turbocharge [ a bit of -- upon ] Turbonomic, our business there on both management as well as on cybersecurity, we expect to see very high growth rates there, high single digit, that is well above the mid, maybe into the low double digits. 
Will we see declines in some parts of the portfolio? We've been very transparent. We expect TPP to be between mid- and high single-digit decline in the mid to long term. But it becomes a smaller and smaller portion of the total. So it has a drag from there. Cognitive Applications, we expect to be right in there, but it's the smallest part of the portfolio. It's not the biggest part of the portfolio.
And so to just recap on that, number one, Red Hat, growing in the mid-teens. As it becomes bigger, a bigger absolute contributor to the total. The rest of the cloud and data platform with a mixture of both organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions is going to then contribute to growth at or above the mid-single digits in the medium term. TPP, mid-single-digit decliner. Cog Apps, probably right in line with the model. So hopefully, Keith, that gives you a breakdown into a lot of pieces. By the way, the Db2 that you mentioned declining is very much inside the TPP. So those are not really different questions. Db2 mainframe and TPP are one and the same.
So let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We again made progress in this quarter, but we acknowledge we still have more to do. As we move into the second half, we are continuing to invest and execute on our actions, which include the separation of Kyndryl. All of this positions IBM to exit the year in a strong position on a path of sustainable growth, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.",458

This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation.

[indiscernible] prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.
I'll remind you the separation of Kyndryl is expected to be completed at the beginning of December. And as a result, our third quarter performance reflects IBM, including the managed infrastructure services business and our pre-separation segment structure.

At our recent investor briefing, we laid out our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and our approach to delivering strong free cash flow and sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022.
For the last 1.5 years, we've been taking actions and investing to execute our strategy. This quarter, we reported modest revenue growth and delivered solid free cash flow, generated over $11 billion of adjusted free cash flow over the last year. We also made tangible progress in our key growth areas of software and consulting.
With that, I will acknowledge that in other areas of the business, we fell short of our expectation; systems during the end of the z15 cycle and Global Technology Services lines pausing ahead of the public filing of the Form 10 and separation of Kyndryl. We have made further progress in the Kyndryl separation in the last 2 weeks and announced the distribution date of November 3, which is ahead of our original schedule.
We've done a lot to prepare Kyndryl for this moment. We took structural actions to improve the profit profile. The management team is in place. Employee transfers and the vast majority of client contract innovations are complete.
We are now even more certain that separating this business creates value through focus. That said, the people of GTS have been a part of IBM for a long time. Hence, it is with mixed emotions that we are reporting on this segment for the last time.
And just yesterday, you heard from Martin and his management team improved strategy and value proposition. The separation is just one of the many actions we are taking to focus our business on hybrid cloud and AI and improve our financial profile.
To give you some color on IBM's performance excluding Kyndryl, we delivered 2% revenue growth this quarter. That compares to 1% in the second quarter and minus 1% in the first quarter. These results reflect the strong demand for technology products and services that help our clients advance their digital transformation.
Our software revenue growth was led by Red Hat, security, automation and Cloud Paks across our software. Global Business Services, soon to be IBM Consulting, accelerated revenue growth to a double-digit rate. Software and consulting are our 2 main drivers of growth, and this was certainly true this quarter.
I will now expand on the progress we made in the third quarter toward our future. As I have described in the past, we have a platform-centric approach, trying to meet clients wherever they are in their journey. The platform we have built is open, secure and flexible and continues to gain traction in the marketplace. We now have more than 3,500 clients using our hybrid cloud platform, not only fuels our Red Hat revenue performance but also provides a solid base for the multiplier effect across software and services.
IBM Consulting is helping to drive this platform adoption and this quarter, had over 180 new Red Hat engagements. Our teams work alongside our clients to co-create business products and solutions. So far, we have done more than 4,000 IBM garage engagements. In the last quarter, more clients are leveraging our platform capabilities and our expertise to unlock business value. Announced DISH is using IBM software and services to help automate their cloud-native 5G network; Cloud Pak for Network Automation, which is used with AI, automation and orchestration capabilities used by DISH to fine-tune speed levels or coverage areas depending on the needs of specific clients.
Building on our partnership spanning half a century, we announced Crédit Mutuel is creating an IBM technology and skills hub in France. The new hub will help Crédit Mutuel leverage AI, data, cloud and IBM Z.
Also announced a new agreement with CaixaBank, one of the largest banks in Europe, to boost its digital capabilities with IBM Cloud for Financial Services and the new IBM Cloud Multizone Region in Spain. CaixaBank will leverage IBM Consulting industry expertise to move to a hybrid cloud approach for modernization.
This quarter, we continued to leverage our ecosystem to drive what we described at our investor briefing as a flywheel of growth. That is the more we grow, the more our partners grow and vice versa. We're partnering with select GSIs to bring joint solutions to market. This quarter, Atos announced the setup of the Atos Cloud Center of Excellence to help financial services customers with their digital transformation journey.
Also have continued momentum and revenue growth from our partnership with industry-leading ISVs and hyperscalers. [ Quarter ], we are partnering with Adobe to help the British pharmacy chain, Boots, transform their e-commerce platform and deliver new digital customer experiences.
While we invest in partnerships, we also invest organically and inorganically to deliver innovation. We made 16 acquisitions since April 2020, including BoxBoat and Bluetab in the third quarter. These will strengthen our hybrid cloud consulting capability.
In the same manner, we are organically developing new innovations that matter to our clients. I'll mention a few new introductions starting with our innovations in software. In the quarter, Red Hat introduced a new re-architectured version of the Red Hat Ansible automation platform. Red Hat also launched a new version of its advanced cluster management of Kubernetes. These 2 products are now more tightly integrated, which helps drive hybrid cloud automation. 
In addition, the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift became generally available. IBM Cloud Paks run anywhere that OpenShift runs. They use common services such as logging, metering, monitoring and security and are infused with innovations and capabilities from IBM Research to deliver much more value than containerized code. In this quarter, we launched Cloud Pak for Security, SaaS as well as new versions of Cloud Pak for Integration, Cloud Pak for Network Automation and the Maximo application suite.
Also recently announced, our Environmental Intelligence software suite. Product based on our Cloud Pak for Data and leveraging our weather capabilities is designed to help companies measure, monitor and predict environmental outcomes but also to help simplify ESG reporting. As you know, we made a commitment to be net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We will leverage this solution to inform management as we take action to reach this goal.
Our Systems business, we recently launched Power10. Power10 has unique hardware innovations, including a processor specifically optimized for data-intensive workloads such as SAP S/4HANA. 
During the quarter, we also announced a Telum processor. This 7-nanometer microprocessor is engineered to help clients gain insights from their data at the speed of the workload. At the same time, we've continued to see quantum computing as a promising area of opportunity that will play out in the longer term. Our teams are hard at work to move this exciting field forward. Investors will have an opportunity to learn more about this within the next month.
Let me quickly highlight one ESG announcement we made recently. To help protect the rights and privacy of cloud clients, we have joined other major companies in the tech industry, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and SAP, to establish the trusted cloud principles. This initiative is consistent with our long-standing focus on trust and transparency.
Before I transition to Jim, let me reiterate 3 messages we conveyed during our investor briefing. First, we are optimizing our portfolio to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022. Second, we are increasing our focus and agility to better serve clients. Third, we are generating strong free cash flow that enables our investments while providing attractive shareholder returns. This quarter, we took another step towards this future. While much remains to be done, we are confident we can achieve our midterm objectives.
Jim, over to you.",1299
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626521.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. Over the last year, we have been very clear on the 2 most important measures of success, revenue growth and free cash flow generation. I'll start with these key metrics.
In the third quarter, our revenue of $17.6 billion was up as reported and down modestly at constant currency. Excluding the content that will go to Kyndryl, IBM's revenue grew 2% with an improving trend over the last 3 quarters.
Our cash generation was up for the quarter, year-to-date and trailing 12 months. This excludes the cash charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl and the structural actions initiated at the end of last year.
Looking at our revenue from a segment perspective, Global Business Services growth accelerated to 11% and our software revenue was up 2%. [ Businesses ] will be our growth drivers into the future and together represent over 70% of our post-separation revenue profile. Systems declined this quarter by 12%, reflecting product cycle dynamics.
Across our segments, IBM's cloud revenue was up 11% over last year, and it's up 17%, excluding the cloud revenue going to Kyndryl. This is led by Global Business Services and Cloud & Cognitive software, which are up 27% and 28%, respectively, over that period.
Moving on to the profit dynamics. Pretax margin is up 10 basis points sequentially but down 100 basis points year-to-year. As we saw the demand environment improving in the fourth quarter of last year, we have been increasing investments in skills, innovation and our ecosystem, organically and through acquisition.
In the third quarter, we continued to aggressively hire, bringing in technical talent in Red Hat and highly skilled expertise in Consulting. We're scaling resources in our garages to provide a more experiential consulting and sales approach. We're adding client success managers to help clients get the most value out of their IBM solution, and we're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovations in our hybrid cloud platform, AI and emerging technologies like Quantum.
The structural actions we initiated at the end of last year are funding some of these investments. Roughly 2/3 of the savings from these actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility to be reinvested for growth. The other 1/3 address the Global Technology Services profit profile ahead of the separation, and we're seeing improvement in the GTS gross margin.
Our third quarter operating tax rate came in about 5%, which is lower than what we talked about last quarter. This was due to discrete tax benefits that occurred earlier than we previously expected as we prepare for the Kyndryl separation. It's important to note that our view of the full year operating tax rate has not changed since January.
I'll comment on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. We generated $5 billion of adjusted free cash flow year-to-date and $11.1 billion over the last year. Both exclude cash impacts of about $1.8 billion for the structural actions initiated late last year and transaction charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl. Our adjusted free cash flow over the last year is up about $300 million with growth in our underlying business performance mitigated by a cash tax headwind.
Our cash balance at the end of September was $8.4 billion, up slightly from June but down about $6 billion from year-end. Over the same period, our debt is down $7 billion.
In addition to debt reduction year-to-date, we've used $3 billion for acquisitions and over $4 billion for shareholder returns through dividends. Our solid cash generation and disciplined financial management provides the fuel to invest in our business and pay an attractive dividend.
Turning to the segments. Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue grew 2%. We have a strong recurring revenue base in Software. Renewal rates for subscription and support were up again this quarter, contributing to the increase in our software deferred income balance over the last year.
By business area, Cloud & Data Platforms revenue was up 9%, while Cognitive Applications declined 1%, and Transaction Processing platforms was down 9%. We recently shared plans to provide new software revenue categories starting in the fourth quarter. We will combine our 2 Software growth vectors, Cloud & Data platforms and Cognitive Applications and within that, provide greater transparency into performance and trends by business area.
Looking across these growth vectors, Red Hat, security and automation fueled revenue growth this quarter. Red Hat revenue was up 17% on a historically normalized basis and 23% all-in. Going forward, we will focus on this all-in growth given these views will converge over the next year as the impact of the deferred revenue impairment dissipates. Red Hat revenue growth was driven by double-digit growth in both infrastructure and application development and emerging technology. And we had more than 40% growth in OpenShift recurring revenue. Growth in automation was led by key solutions like Cloud Pak for Integration, and Cloud Pak for Business Automation as well as a strong start to our recent Instana and Turbonomic acquisition.
Our data and AI revenue was down modestly. We had strength in Cloud Pak for Data, Weather and Maximo and declines in on-premise data ops portfolio and supply chain as it wrapped on a strong third quarter last year. 
Security remains a key strategic focus area as we're helping clients adopt zero trust architecture with Cloud Pak for Security and export services. Growth in security revenue continued this quarter, led by threat management software and services as clients respond to the evolving cybersecurity environment.
In the spirit of transparency, I'll provide a couple of additional metrics into our performance. Our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, across these software growth vectors grew 7%. This is a good indication of the progress in our hybrid cloud and AI client adoption. And we now have over $8 billion in software cloud revenue over the last year, which is up 28%.
Turning to our software value vector, transaction processing platforms. We provide flexibility to our clients and how they purchase this mission-critical software. Over the last 18 months, we've seen a preference for OpEx over CapEx. This continues to pressure perpetual licenses in favor of more consumption-like model. But importantly, we again had strong renewal rates in our transaction processing platform software. This is a solid indication that clients see long-term value in these offerings.
Looking at profit for the Software segment. We expanded pretax margin sequentially, while we continue to invest in new innovation and our ecosystem.
Moving to Global Business Services. Revenue growth accelerated to 11%. Even with the strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1. Our GBS value proposition is aligned to our clients' priorities. We're helping our clients capture new growth opportunities and increase operational flexibility and productivity with hybrid cloud and AI. We leverage our incumbency, IBM technology and strategic partnerships to modernize their applications and digitally transform their businesses at scale.
GBS revenue growth is led by our cloud offering. GBS cloud revenue now represents more than $7 billion of revenue over the last year and is up 27%. This performance reflects the continued investments we are making in our Red Hat, Microsoft and AWS practices. 
As Arvind said, we added over 180 Red Hat client engagements this quarter. This contributes to total Red Hat-related signings of close to $3.5 billion since the acquisition.
Within our 11% revenue growth, consulting was up 16%. There's solid demand here. We're leveraging our skills and ecosystem partners to transform our clients' business processes and modernize applications based on OpenShift.
Global processing services revenue was up 19%. Our offerings in finance, procurement and talent and transformation all grew at double-digit rates. More and more, we're connecting consulting and BPO to transform client workflows using hybrid cloud and AI.
Lastly, in Application Management, revenue growth accelerated to 5%, off a prior year that was impacted by the pandemic. Growth this quarter was driven by management of applications in a multi-cloud environment.
I'll shift to GBS profit profile, where our strong revenue performance drove gross and pretax profit dollar growth. Our gross and pretax margins improved sequentially but were down year-to-year. With the market opportunity we see, we are making conscious decisions to invest ahead of revenue. We are investing in strategic partnerships, new offerings and practices and integrating and scaling out our acquisition.
As I mentioned earlier, we are investing in skills for GBS. In the last several months, we have increased our go-to-market resources and scaled our practices built around our ecosystem partners and Red Hat. With a competitive labor market, this is putting some pressure on our labor costs, including higher acquisition and retention costs, which is not yet reflected in our current pricing. We expect to capture this value in future engagements, but it will take time to appear in our margin profile. 
So now turning to the Systems segment. Revenue performance was down 12% driven by product cycles in IBM Z and Power, mitigated by growth in Storage. In IBM Z, revenue declined 33% in the ninth quarter of z15 availability. While z15 program to date continues to exceed the strong z14 cycle, the magnitude of that overachievement has come down a couple of points this quarter. 
IBM Z is an enduring platform given market needs for scalability, reliability, security and more recently, cloud native development. These characteristics, together with our newer flexible consumption offerings, further demonstrate the value of IBM Z platform within our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. 
Our revenue was down. Late in the quarter, we began the rollout of our next-generation Power10 starting with high-end system. As always, new Power technology is introduced over time, and the mid-range and low-end Power10 systems will be available during 2022.
Storage delivered 11% revenue growth driven by demand from hyperscalers for our tape products and growth in entry-level all-flash storage following our product refresh earlier this year.
Looking at profit in this segment. Profit margin was down, reflecting where we are in the IBM Z and Power10 product cycles.
So now let me turn to Global Technology Services. Revenue was down 5%, which is a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The year-to-year trajectory of revenue generated from the backlog has been improving over the last few quarters. In the first half of the year, we also had modest improvements in client-based business volumes and project activity, which contributes to in-period revenue. However, this quarter, clients paused on new project activity as the separation was imminent, resulting in the revenue deceleration.
At the time we decided to separate our managed infrastructure services business, we undertook a series of actions to improve the margin, profit and cash generation profile of the business, including a substantial charge in the fourth quarter of 2020. The results of these actions can be seen in the margin improvement over the last several quarters. And this quarter, we again expanded gross margin, up 120 basis points. Kyndryl will take this improved profit profile into the separation.
I'll wrap up with a view of our progress year-to-date and then talk about some of the fourth quarter dynamics. As we enter 2021, we laid out our expectations for the year for our 2 most important measures: revenue and free cash flow. We expected to grow revenue for IBM at actual rates with underlying constant currency performance stronger in the second half than the first. We expected to grow revenue for IBM, excluding Kyndryl, at constant currency. And we expected to generate $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. That, of course, excludes the cash impacts of the Kyndryl transaction costs and the structural actions I'd mentioned earlier.
Now we're 3 quarters into the year, and we just completed the last full quarter of IBM on a pre-separation basis. It's a good time to take a snapshot against those objectives. Through the first 3 quarters, our revenue at actual rates is up 2%. Our revenue growth trajectory at constant currency has been improving throughout the year. And excluding Kyndryl, our third quarter revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and our adjusted free cash flow over the last 12 months is $11.1 billion.
Since the beginning of the year, we have streamlined our go to market. We have increased investments and closed 10 acquisitions these actions and investments will help drive revenue growth, but it takes time to fully realize the benefit.
Overall, our results over the first 3 quarters of 2021 reflect progress we've been making toward our midterm model. During the fourth quarter, we will complete the separation of Kyndryl, which is on track for November 3. The fourth quarter, therefore, is a major milestone as we transition to the future IBM.
Now let me provide some color on 3 areas for the fourth quarter: first, the revenue trajectory of the new segments; second, I'll comment on our tax rate; and third, the impact of the separation of Kyndryl to IBM's consolidated results for November and December on an operating basis.
I'll start with the revenue trajectory of our segments as we report them in the fourth quarter. As always, I'll talk about it on a constant currency basis. But I'll remind you, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen and would be a 1 to 2 point headwind to growth based on current spot rates. To provide a better view of trends, I'll focus on the growth rates before the revenue from incremental sales to Kyndryl.
We see continued momentum in our growth vectors in Software and Consulting. We expect our Software revenue growth rate to improve versus the third quarter. And in IBM Consulting, we again expect double-digit revenue growth. In infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect fairly consistent performance with the third quarter, which was a high single-digit decline.
Second, tax. I mentioned the timing of discrete tax benefits occurred earlier than we previously anticipated as we prepared for the Kyndryl separation. We still expect our full year tax rate to be in the low teens range, in line with what we indicated back in January. That's our all-in rate including discrete tax items and applies a fourth quarter tax rate in the high teens.
And then finally, IBM's fourth quarter consolidated results will reflect the Kyndryl separation. I'll frame the revenue and earnings per share implications based on the last couple of years. Kyndryl historically represented just under $5 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, with about $3.5 billion of that in November and December. At the same time, we estimate we'll get about $350 million from incremental sales in those 2 months from the new commercial relationship.
The net impact to IBM consolidated results is a reduction of about $3 billion of revenue for November and December due to the separation. And for those 2 months, we estimate an impact of $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share including the new commercial relationship.
At the time of separation, Kyndryl will be presented in discontinued operation, with the balance of IBM in continuing operation. We will provide a historical restatement of continuing operations before the end of the year.
We are on the threshold of the future IBM. We expect to exit the fourth quarter in a position to deliver our mid-term model, a mid-single-digit revenue growth and cumulative free cash flow of $35 billion in 2022 to 2024.
So with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
I'll turn it back to Patricia.",2572

You noted on this call that you saw some hesitation or pause in spending. Do you feel -- given the changes that you have put in place also with sales comp, do you feel comfortable about the trajectory of the business once you get past this threshold of near-term disruption that you highlighted?
And if I could, Jim, you noted about $2.5 billion onetime bump from Kyndryl in 2022. Can you maybe calibrate that number for 2021 as well? That would be helpful.",101
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626525.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,7,"Wamsi, thanks for the question. Look, I'd like to be very clear. I think that any -- and I would not use the word disruption, Wamsi. I would use the word that there may be a slight pause, which is the words that I used in the -- my prepared remarks. I think there's a slight pause, and it'll be the end of third quarter, maybe the beginning of fourth quarter. And we see that fall mostly in hardware and in Kyndryl itself.
By the way, just to add some color, why do you see that? There has been a lot of hardware that actually does flow through Kyndryl. And many people, many of our clients think of that as being an alternate way that they have procured infrastructure in the past. So it's not a surprise given the size of the relationship with all of those clients that we see a pause in some of them. By the way, I think that that's the complete nature of it.
When I look at our pipeline, I look at our sales compensation, I look at our executive compensation, I am completely confident that this will be well behind us by the beginning of '22, meaning by January, well behind us.
And as we also get into a new product cycle on some of the hardware in the first half of '22, I think that'll put it completely behind us. And so my view is that we hold firm to our '22 and forward projections. And this has actually got no long-term or systemic issues that I see, both in the numbers, in the pipelines and in the actual behavior of clients and our people.",283

To your second question, remember back at -- on October 4 at our Investor Day we talked about the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl going forward, of which I think, at that time, we shared about $2.5 billion of annualized business predominantly structured around our high-value mission-critical recurring revenue of software and also some in our infrastructure segment around hardware purchases and around our infrastructure support. That was a full year annualized view.
If you look at fourth quarter, we're going to have 2 months' worth of that in 2021. And we estimate that, that's about $350 million to $400 million overall. So if you go back to what I said on October 4, the 2022 compared to 2021, 12 months versus 2 months is, give or take, about a little bit over $2 billion. And that translates into the 3 points of incremental growth 1x above our mid-single-digit model in midterm.",156

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626528.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,10,"Yes. And I think, Arvind, you touched on this in the first question, but perhaps let me ask it a little more directly. So this quarter, IBM grew at 1.9% for RemainCo versus the comparison of constant currency at minus 3.5%. The comparisons get about 2 or 3 points more difficult looking into next year, and you have to accelerate your growth rate to get to mid-single digit growth by 2 or 3 points. So effectively, adjusting for compares, the growth rate has to improve about 5 percentage points relative to what you did this quarter to hit that mid-single-digit target.
Beyond a product cycle in mainframe and UNIX, given you talked about sort of taking time for investments to pay off, what is going to seemingly pretty suddenly change the growth profile adjusting for comps by potentially 4, 5 or 6 points over the next few quarters? And do -- how long do you continue to expect to invest, i.e., have pressure on operating margins, particularly in Software and GBS going forward?",173
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626529.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,11,"Okay. Thanks, Toni. I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll look at Jim for the second part of the question. So Toni, there's 3 parts of it. First, let me acknowledge, yes, our growth rates have to improve, so no question about it. We are not saying we are done.
The 3 elements that will contribute to the growth rate -- and I think a lot of what you were pointing to was towards the software growth rate. I'll say it comes from 3 things. One, we are seeing improvements in our organic, meaning the software we already have. We continue to see that. We expect that, that will improve the software growth rates by a few points. I won't actually say the upper band because I don't expect that the 3 elements I mentioned, all of them, will all return at their upper band. So let's say, 1 or 2 points from the organic growth rate.
Two, we will continue to make acquisitions. So not only do the ones we have made keep contributing because they are growing well into double-digit growth rates or the new ones we make will also contribute to that. Think of that to be in the same range.
The third one, as we're making a lot of changes in our sales compensation as well as in the makeup of our sales team, we talk about the garages. We talk about client success managers leading to more experiential and more technical selling. We believe that'll drive greater deployment and hence, quicker purchases in that segment. And so all of those together will contribute towards a much improved growth rate in the Software segment up to the mid-single digit as I think you're pointing out in some of your math.
I'm not going to debate is it 3%, 4% or 5%. Happy to do that when we have a bit more time. And I'll pass it over to Jim for the second part of the question.",333
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626530.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,12,"To that point, I can't resist but go into the numbers. So let's just -- Toni, great question. Thank you very much. Let's talk about this quarter. Again, IBM ex Kyndryl delivered about 2% growth. By the way, that's an accelerating trend as we talked about in the prepared remarks from about flat through the first half to now growing 2%. Yes, off an easier compare, we acknowledge that.
But let's take a look at the revenue contribution analysis of what contributed to that 2 points, and now I'll tie it back to what we said on October 4 as our mid-single-digit growth rate model. We said across our 3 segments, first, we have an improving growth profile as we shift to higher value, higher growth markets over 70% of our business in Software and in Consulting, which, by the way, also carries a higher value recurring revenue stream, that those 2 segments will contribute all 5 points of IBM's growth, by the way, with improving operating margins, which I'll get into at the end. 
The infrastructure segment, which is high value, mission critical covering our mainframe business and infrastructure support business, was projected to be flat over time as it follows innovation cycle. So as we bring out innovation next year, we firmly believe and confident that we're going to grow there. But over a 3-year period, that's about flat but a significant cash generator. So you got 2 growth vectors, 1 value vector, 2 delivering growth, 1 delivering cash generation.
Now let's look at how the third quarter played out. Against that 70-plus percent of our 2 growth vectors that targeted a 5-point contribution, we delivered 4.5 points of revenue growth to IBM. We fell about 0.5 point short, and that's in the software area because we overachieved in GBS. We have a strong book of business in GBS, now IBM Consulting, and we see that continuing to play out. We got work to do on Software, but we're making underlying business performance because, as you all know, you see the data. Our deferred revenue tailwind dissipates over time. And we lost about 1 point of growth in Software just due to the deferred revenue tailwind, which means that the underlying business of our pro forma IBM Software continues to improve.
Why do we feel confident moving forward? Just adding to some of the points of Arvind, number one, we've been 5 quarters in a row now with strong renewal rates. 80% of our Software business is recurring revenue, high-value recurring revenue. And you see that in our deferred income and deferred revenue balance up $800 million year-over-year.
Number two, we see nice acceleration in ARR. And by the way, NRR north of 100% again for the third consecutive quarter. And we're starting to see nice acceleration in Cloud Paks. And most importantly, as we talked about 3 quarters ago, we are now starting to enter the early parts of our ELA cycle. That will continue into 2022 and the first half of 2023. So we feel pretty confident about the 2 growth vectors.
Where we missed is, based on being on the back end of a very successful mainframe cycle, the infrastructure segment took 2.5 points of growth away from IBM ex Kyndryl. So plus 4.5 points against the target of 5%, we lost 2.5 points in infrastructure. And that will moderate out over time as we bring new innovation.
And then finally, just wrapping up, on your operating margin comment, we said entering this year, 2 most important measures, revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We're achieving on both of those. We said that free cash flow generation was going to be important because we needed to fuel investment in innovation and in IBM Consulting because we saw robust demand.
We're playing that out consciously. We'll see that improve as we get into 2022, but we're still driving that cash. And I'll wrap up, year-to-date through third quarter, growing revenue, growing revenue ex Kyndryl at constant currency. We're growing gross and pretax dollars. We're growing pretax margin, and we're growing trailing 12 months free cash flow. So that's the model that we put in place, and we feel pretty confident as we enter 2022.",708

So can you talk about what drove the shortfall in Cloud & Cognitive Software and where you see opportunities for better execution within that Software business?",46

Thanks, Katy. Yes, certainly, as actually, even Jim acknowledged that we fell maybe 0.5 point short of our own expectations, and we could have done better. Here is where I see it doing better.
First, the one that performed exactly according to what we wanted was Red Hat. Red Hat gave us 17%, which is pretty much what we wanted and expected. 
If I now look at our Transaction Processing Platform, it was a little bit below what we would like because we have been saying that, in a long-term model, that should be more mid-single-digit decliner. But this quarter, it was a high single-digit decliner. We think that as we get past, because that is coupled, I wouldn't call it identical, but it is coupled to some of the infrastructure cycles, I expect that to come back starting in early '22 or maybe late in '21.
Then on our category that is today called AI applications, we were minus 1%. There, I would expect us to get back to mid-single-digit growth.
Now you sort of say, if I put it all together, do we expect to see a tiny bit -- I call it a tiny bit of pausing from people because of everything going on? Yes.
Two, we are turning our incentive models. I spoke on it on the prior question very briefly. Our incentive models for our sales teams are going to be very heavily tuned towards software going forward in '22. That, I believe, will result in better -- much better performance because the only way that they will get anywhere near the target incentives is to make their software number. That is probably for the first time that, that's been true in a long, long time at IBM.
So Katy, that's sort of my view on what happened there and how we will improve going forward.",312

I wanted to ask on the GBS side. So that did accelerate double-digit revenue growth. Sounds like fourth quarter, you expect that, too, but it did come at a higher cost. So I'm just curious on the gross margin percentage front. So I'm curious some of the confidence that you can reprice to offset the higher cost of delivery. Is there risk that those costs could persist here given all the demand side that you're seeing?",84

Tien-Tsin, this is Jim. I'll take that as we move forward. As I stated earlier and Arvind commented in the prepared remarks, we do see a very robust demand environment out there. We called it -- as we were going through fourth quarter, we called a very conscious strategy. GBS, now IBM Consulting, again, plays a very integral role to our hybrid cloud platform-centric business model. Why? Because it drives scale and adoption to our platform, and it also pulls IBM technology while taking advantage of the ecosystem and partnership and skill and capability.
So we started aggressively adding skill, capacity, expertise, ecosystem partnerships and scaling acquisitions. I think we just announced today our eighth GBS acquisition in the last 12 months overall. So it was a conscious strategy. And we believe that, that flywheel effect of GBS that turns into the multiplier of driving our platform, pulling our software and driving a very robust economic equation for our ecosystem partners is essential in our long-term strategy.
Now with that said, we saw margins down 310 basis points. We saw pretax margins down 110 basis points. Within that, though, we grew gross profit dollars and we grew pretax dollars. We're about generating growth in top line and around generating cash contribution. And GBS delivered that today.
I would also mention that GBS accelerated their margins quarter-to-quarter tremendously. Pretax margins were up 5 points quarter-to-quarter, and they've been accelerating their gross margins sequentially every single quarter this year. So we delivered over 13 points of pretax margin in the third quarter; and our model, as we said on October 4, was low teens.
So we feel pretty comfortable. We see a very good book of business, and we continue to see, in fourth quarter, IBM Consulting delivering double-digit revenue growth and margin dollar and profit dollar and cash dollar contribution while pulling our software and hybrid cloud platform.",318

No matter where you look, labor costs are going higher. And I do see that in your prepared slides that you did give that your signings were up 3%.
So should we think about, as time rolls forward, you'll implement more labor costs that escalate and go higher? Or are they actually material enough so we should be modeling some adjustments into your cash flows? Or how should we kind of think about that as you work through the business because it's a pretty dynamic and fluid situation with labor costs?",116
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3820.0,2408386.0,91626539.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,21,"So Jim, great question. And by the way, I would tell you that I don't think that this year is unique. Maybe there's a touch more issues going on, but I don't think it's unique. I remember 2001 really well. I remember 2007 just before the financial crisis. This is a continuous movie in the technology industry.
Now you said the 3% signings growth. I wouldn't look at the 3%. I would look at our book-to-bill ratio, which is 1.1. And so book to bill gives a much better signal of what the demand is for our forward-looking revenue and demand in our IBM Consulting business.
Now look, labor has to be managed. We have a global labor model. We put people everywhere. And as Jim just mentioned in answers to the prior question that, yes, when you do have inflation in your labor cost, there is an element of it that's going to price through for that side of the business.
In all the rest of the business, actually, I'm not so worried about labor cost. I'm worried about getting the right talent maybe, but that is always a worry that I have, and I've been paranoid about that for 30 years. That's not unique. And I think it's similar to many of your businesses, Jim, like not just yours but all of your colleagues here on this call. 
The right talent is far more important, and our labor cost is important. In the end of the day, it's maybe 15%, 20% of the total cost and expense that is sort of critical towards the other businesses because you can manage the rest.
So net answer to you is, no, it's not something that needs to be modeled in. I don't believe so. But we always have to worry about it in terms of how do we price, how do we get the labor pools, where do we put the labor pools and all of those elements.",328

And I was hoping you could explain a little bit why Cloud Paks because it sounds very similar to bundling, which IBM and many companies have been doing for years. So want to try to understand a little bit why Cloud Pak is different from the historic bundling that IBM has been doing.
And then second, if I could just ask, Jim, a question I've asked before is on software maintenance. A good quarter on easy compares and I just wanted to get your thoughts on the durability of the software maintenance, not whether it's important. But is it, in fact, a growth category as we look out within GBS over the next 2 years, 3 years?",148

So Cloud Paks are not just bundled. They're not just containerizing software. I'll tell you right away, if all you do is bundled software, you'll actually get a price deflation. If all you do is containerized software, there will be no plus or minus. It's just a different way of delivering it.
So I'll take one of the Cloud Paks and maybe use it as a quick example. If I take our Cloud Pak for Data, if I now turn around and tell you that whether we take some of our integration software or whether we take a database software like Db2, and that's all you provide through that, you're right, that's neither plus nor minus. I think it will stay where it is.
However, it's not just putting those in as options. A lot of the Cloud Pak for Data is actually new innovation. It includes methods around data fabric. It includes methods around how do you federate data both from public clouds and from other repositories that are probably not IBM's inside the client's on-premise environment. It contains the data catalog. It contains these ways to be able to do some competition without even moving the data.
That new content added to some of the existing content, so we take advantage of our incumbency, but we get lift because there is more usage overall for these technologies than there was before, is why we are so excited about Cloud Paks and where it gives us both. Yes, some of it is just going to be a movement, but a lot of it is actually increased usage. And hopefully, that sort of made the example clear on how we are driving innovation into the portfolio with that one example.
So Jim, I'll give it to you to address the -- I don't know whether to raise maintenance in ARR or NRR.",325

If I'm not answering the right question, please get back to Patricia, and we can move forward from there.
But AMS, as we've talked about for a handful of quarters, we got back to growth, up 5%, accelerated that growth, albeit, as we said in the prepared remarks, off a much easier compare during the height of the pandemic last year in third quarter. But it was up this quarter as we had growth in offerings, which modernize the client's applications and as we move them to a hybrid cloud.
We talked about our application management having a tremendous incumbency value in a hybrid cloud platform-centric model. Why? Because what we've seen and learned over the last 2-plus years after the acquisition of Red Hat is that, one, we've built up a $3.5 billion book of business around our Red Hat practice in GBS from a dead start during the acquisition. And we built that up. Of that $3.5 billion, over 3/4 of that book of business is in AMS accounts.
Second, AMS -- excuse me, GBS driving that flywheel effect I talked about earlier is actually -- delivers over 1/3 of our cloud revenue -- Cloud Pak revenue growth each quarter, and within that, 80% are AMS accounts. So there is a causality and a correlation here between our strong incumbency base, us having industry business process knowledge and the technical expertise to be the client's trusted partner. To move them along their journey to cloud, AMS is a very integral part. So we saw good growth.
And by the way, our penetration of AMS cloud activity, remember, we talked about in the past this predominantly being an on-prem enterprise application concentration issue. We continue to make progress. We're -- about close to 40% of our AMS business is now cloud, and we're capitalizing on Red Hat. We're catalyzing on application modernization. And we're capitalizing on very strong ecosystem partnerships with SAP S/4HANA to name one, as we move forward.",363

First, how much, if any, of the revenue with Kyndryl is activity-based, which may be dependent on their own execution? And then secondly, Jim, you mentioned the ELA cycle starting up, I think, early 2022.  Perhaps you could share with us just how much of a headwind it's been and which segments it's impacted most.",60

I think I'll take both, and then Arvind can wrap it up here overall.
First, around Kyndryl. So if you go back to October 4 at the Investor Day, which we were pretty transparent, and we said we're going to continue that transparency into 2022 around the external sales with the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl, we said about, on a full year basis, $2.5 billion, give or take. And in 2022, when you got 12 months versus 2 months in 2021, it'd be about $2 billion of incremental or about 3 points.
Within that, David, the majority of that is in software. And a majority of that is annuitized-based high-value, mission-critical-based recurring revenue. So if you're thinking about do we have any deflationary impacts around that $2-plus billion on the software side, which carries the majority of it, no.
The second component is we have about -- annualized about $0.5 billion with regards to our infrastructure support and hardware. On the infrastructure support, it's again an annuitized-based business overall. And with regards to hardware, in our strategic relationship, as we set Kyndryl up, we've given them a pretty aggressive and component of a aged inventory refresh program, so we have very little hardware purchases over probably the next 18 months to 2 years given we just went through a big asset refresh. So long answer to your question, but I don't think we have a lot of impact moving forward against that.
Second, around the ELA cycle, you know this quite well. It's typically a 3-plus year. The dynamics of client buying behaviors change over time, but we feel very confident. The good news is here is we have a lot of headroom. We're just starting the early part of that in fourth quarter. That will predominantly play out in 2022 and then will also extend early into 2023 as we move forward.
And if you look at our transactional-related activity, we've been making strong performance improvement in our annuitized-based business with the renewal rates, and our on-prem transactional business has struggled, especially during the pandemic. This will bolster that as we move forward. And most importantly, we feel confident in the investments in innovation and what we're bringing to market with our modernized and containerized Cloud Pak offerings optimized on top of our hybrid cloud Red Hat platform that we're good.
So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind.",413

Look, first, I'd like to thank all of you for your questions. I thought they were really getting into the details; and hopefully, it helped -- our answers helped you understand our business a lot better.
Let me just make a couple of comments to wrap it up. I hope you took away is that we continue to make this progress this quarter in the key areas. Both myself and Jim highlighted them in our key areas of growth and in our value vectors as we go forward, especially looking into '23. But we'll also acknowledge that we always have more to do.
Importantly, we are on the threshold of the IBM of the future, and we expect to exit the year in a position that delivers on our mid-term model starting in 2022. That is the sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth and the increasing free cash flow that fuels all the investments.
So with that, I look forward to speaking to all of you again.",167
