We had a solid close to 2023 with growth across our businesses and strong cash generation. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and sustainability of our revenue growth. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2023, delivering revenue growth of 3% and over $11 billion of free cash flow. 2/3 of the way through our mid-term model, I am proud of our achievements. 
Since 2021, we delivered average revenue growth for IBM and for each segment at or above our model. The overall trends we are seeing reinforce our views of the future. We are confident in achieving our mid-term revenue model and the strength of our diversified business model allows us to make progress each quarter. 
We entered the year intent on enhancing our software portfolio and strengthening our Consulting position. We have done both. Mid last year, we launched watsonx, our flagship AI and data platform, and we are excited by the traction we are seeing. Consulting has delivered durable revenue growth through the year despite an uneven macro environment. Our expanding ecosystem, skills and technical expertise, global reach and co-creation approach not only set us apart but also contributed to our Consulting performance outpacing that of our competitors. This year also underscored the enduring nature and relevance of our zSystems platform. 
Before getting into the execution of our strategy, I'll make a few comments about what we see in the current environment. I expect many macro trends to be similar to 2023. Technology demand will continue to be strong and serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth. It allows businesses to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. 
Every client I speak with is asking about how to boost productivity with AI and how to manage their technology stack, much of which is deployed across a hybrid environment, public, private and on-premises. These trends continue to fuel demand for both hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. 
I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy, starting with AI. Our approach to AI for business is resonating. Earlier in '23, we introduced watsonx, IBM's core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We believe AI will be multimodal with our clients leveraging a combination of models: IBM's, open source, their own proprietary models and those of other companies. Flexibility of deployment is key. Simply put, we meet clients where they are and allow clients to deploy AI models across multiple environments. 
In the fourth quarter, we released watsonx.governance to help clients and partners govern and instill trust in generative AI. This toolkit helps organizations manage and monitor their AI and prepare for compliance with future AI-related regulations. IBM was recently named a leader in generative AI for governance platforms by IDC. As I have mentioned before, IBM was one of the first companies to announce the indemnification of all our models. Additionally, IBM and Meta announced in December the formation of the AI Alliance, a group of 70 industry and academic leaders joining together to advance open, safe and responsible AI. 
We continue to believe our Consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI. We are the only provider today that offers both the technology stack with our watsonx platform and Consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI. The early work for clients around data architecture, security and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here. 
Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful practice around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are on a similar trajectory with generative AI. Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients. 
Last quarter, I shared with you that our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI and watsonx was in the low hundreds of millions. Since then, demand continues to increase and our book of business in the fourth quarter is roughly double the third quarter amount. We continue to have thousands of hands-on client interactions, including an acceleration in pilots that were completed during the quarter. 
Software transactional revenue and SaaS ACV was approximately 1/3 of our book of business related to generative AI in the fourth quarter and 2/3 was Consulting signings. There was a balance of both large and small transactions across both segments. 
Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor continue to offer meaningful near-term benefits to clients. We've been collaborating with numerous clients using watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible. This includes a successful pilot with Citi, where initial results point to substantial developer productivity and code quality improvements that have led to plans for a rapid expansion focused on scaling for enterprise-wide outcomes. 
This is just one of many examples. In other industries, we have done work with clients such as NatWest, Lockheed Martin and Boehringer Ingelheim. We are working on an interesting use case with the Sevilla FÃºtbol Club, using watsonx to find the right players to sign by describing attributes across the database of more than 200,000 scouting reports. 
As clients build out their AI strategies and focus on driving ROI and productivity, the importance of optimizing IT spend and consumption is magnified. Apptio, our virtual command center for managing technology investments, comes up in nearly all of my client discussions. The value proposition is clearly resonating. 
Looking beyond AI, we had a number of important client wins in the fourth quarter. For example, we're helping NATO strengthen their cybersecurity posture and build out a customized solution to have greater visibility into cyber threats and respond to them more quickly. We are working with Riyadh Air to help them drive their digital and technology strategy and establish their hybrid cloud integration platform. 
We also saw meaningful Consulting renewals, which combined with new wins, highlights the focus and unique strengths of our capabilities. Our strategic partnerships with companies such as SAP, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe continue to expand and thrive. For instance, we are working together with Adobe to embed watsonx into their platform. We also continue to deepen our partnership with SAP through further collaboration across watsonx and Quantum. 
We also have several new watsonx ISV partners. What we see is clear: many ISVs are eager to work with us as a trusted provider that understands enterprise needs. We continue to invest and bring new innovations to the market in other areas as well. In the quarter, Red Hat enhanced its Ansible Automation Platform, introducing new offerings like Ansible Lightspeed and Event-Driven Ansible. We announced the availability of Red Hat Device Edge to manage your workloads and deliver automation at the edge. In quantum computing, we introduced Heron, the most advanced quantum processor; and the System Two, a modular quantum computer. 
Focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We completed 9 acquisitions this year, including Apptio, and we recently announced the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG, which we expect to close midyear. With respect to divestitures, we announced the sale of our Weather assets, which we expect to close in the first quarter. We also announced the Enterprise AI Venture Fund, a $500 million fund with the goal of partnering with the start-up community to tap into the latest AI innovations in the market and help them scale. 
In summary, I believe that the changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years position us for the evolving technology landscape. As I reflect on our performance since we presented our mid-term model in October of 2021, I am pleased with the progress we have made internally and with our clients. We have delivered average revenue growth for IBM in line with our mid-term model. And this is true for all our segments. Software has delivered average growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model. Consulting delivered average growth in line with the high single-digit model. And Infrastructure is well ahead of expectations. This performance gives me confidence as we move into the new year. 
For 2024, we expect performance in line with our mid-term model with mid-single digit revenue growth and about $12 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us firmly on a path of sustainable growth. 
Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter and our expectations for 2024. Jim, over to you.",1423
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818973.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $17.4 billion in revenue, $4.2 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $3.87, and we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. This wrapped up another solid year, where we continue to deliver durable growth in our repositioned business, aligned with client priorities of digital transformation and driving productivity. 
Taking a step back, let me touch on a full year before I go into additional details of the quarter. Our revenue for the year was nearly $62 billion, up 3% and in line with our expectation 90 days ago. We generated $10.3 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $9.62. Our free cash flow was $11.2 billion, our strongest level of cash generation since 2019. 
Revenue performance for the year was again led by Software and Consulting. Software grew by over 5% with good growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. Consulting revenue was up over 6% with solid growth every quarter and broad-based growth across all 3 lines of business, highlighting the durability of our results and differentiated client offerings. 
Infrastructure was down 4%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our revenue growth and productivity initiatives led to margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. For the full year, we expanded operating gross profit margin by 130 basis points with every segment growing margin across every quarter. Our operating pretax margin expanded by 40 basis points, in line with our expectations and driven by strong productivity gains and operating leverage. And this includes a 110 basis point headwind from currency dynamics. 
Now turning to a deeper dive on the quarter. Our revenue was up over 3%. Software revenue was up 2%. Our fourth quarter performance reflects continued growth in our recurring revenue and a wrap on last year's seasonally strong transactional performance. Consulting had another solid quarter with 5.5% revenue growth, which is a sequential improvement in the growth rate. 
We had good signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio over 1.15. This continued momentum in Consulting is reflective of how we work with clients, the investment we are making in skills and talent, velocity in our strategic partnerships and our integrated value proposition. 
We had great Infrastructure performance this quarter. Revenue was up 2% with growth in both zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure. This performance is particularly notable given it's the seventh quarter of the z16 cycle and in our seasonally largest quarter, again, highlighting the innovation we are bringing to this mission-critical platform. 
Looking at our profit metrics. We expanded operating gross margin by 140 basis points and operating pretax margin by 110 basis points, inclusive of 150 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. Currency impacted operating pretax profit growth in the quarter by over $200 million. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives, which allowed for continued investments to drive innovation in our portfolio. You can see this in our higher R&D expense. 
Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year. And our operating earnings per share of $3.87 was up 8%. We remain laser-focused on our productivity initiatives as we digitally transform our business processes and scale AI within IBM. This includes simplifying our application and infrastructure environments, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, reducing our real estate footprint and enabling a higher value-added workforce through automation and AI-driven efficiencies. 
Against a target of $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, which I mentioned back in April of last year, we have already achieved over $1.5 billion. Our productivity initiatives have allowed us to increase our investments in innovation, technical and industry skills and go-to-market capabilities, including our ecosystem. And we have accomplished this while simultaneously growing our profit margin and free cash flow, which in turn has increased our financial flexibility. This remains our playbook going forward. And given our success to date, we now believe we can achieve at least $3 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. 
Overall, the combination of our revenue and margin performance resulted in 9% growth in our operating pretax profit for the quarter. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the year, we generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this growth comes from $900 million of adjusted EBITDA. For better transparency, we have included a view of our adjusted EBITDA performance in our supplemental slides. 
Our free cash flow growth also reflects benefits of about $400 million from working capital efficiencies, which is consistent with what we've been suggesting throughout the year. CapEx was also down about $400 million, reflecting actions to optimize our real estate portfolio. These actions reduced our net CapEx although had limited benefit to our profit performance. 
In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested over $5 billion to acquire 9 companies, and we returned just over $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with a strong liquidity position with cash of $13.5 billion, which is up $4.6 billion year-over-year. Total debt is up $5.6 billion over the same period. And our debt balance ended the year at $56.5 billion, including approximately $12 billion of debt associated with our financing business. Our retirement-related plans remain in a strong financial position. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 111% with the U.S. at 123%. 
Turning to our segments. Software grew 2% with growth across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This quarter's performance, again, reflects growth in our high-value recurring revenue base, which is up mid-single digits. I'll remind you this comprises about 80% of our annual software revenue. Transaction Processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms like zSystems. 
This, together with price increases, contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in Transaction Processing for the year. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 1%. Within this performance, Red Hat revenue was up 7%, Automation was flat, Data & AI was up 1% and Security declined. 
Looking across Hybrid Platform & Solutions, the strength of our recurring base of business is evident in our ARR, now $14.4 billion and up over 7% since last year. We also faced a tough compare here in the fourth quarter, wrapping on seasonally strong transactional performance, including strength in ELAs, as we discussed at the start of the year. What played out in the fourth quarter reflects just these dynamics. And while transactional revenue overall was significant, it was down year-to-year a little more than expected. 
In Red Hat, revenue performance was similar to last quarter as we continue to see dampened growth in consumption-based services. Our future growth indicators are encouraging. Red Hat annual bookings were up 17%, including double-digit bookings growth across all 3 key offerings: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Renewals have been strong this quarter with our NRR up well over 100% and up 6 points over last year. And OpenShift continued its strong performance with annual recurring revenue of $1.2 billion. 
Beyond OpenShift, our platform-based approach is resonating with clients. We're seeing growing interest in our generative AI platform, watsonx, as Arvind touched on earlier. And we've been investing to both extend and expand our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities and software from new offerings in Ansible to the launch of watsonx.governance, to the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods. 
Looking at Software profit. Gross profit margin expanded and pretax margin was flat with the latter reflecting key investments in innovation and about 2 points of currency impact in the quarter. In Consulting, our revenue in the quarter was up 5.5%. We continue to see solid demand for data and technology transformation projects with a focus on AI and analytics. 
Clients are also prioritizing cloud modernization and cloud-based application development projects. This focus on digital transformation and AI initiatives to drive productivity and cost savings has been consistent throughout the year. 
Our ability to address these client demands drove signings growth of 8% with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. That caps off a solid year where signings grew at a high-teens rate. And with this, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. There has been significant interest this year regarding our Consulting outperformance relative to competitors. 
Let me give you my thoughts on what differentiates us. Our integrated value, investments in skills and strategic partnerships and focused execution. First, we are the only technology company with the Consulting business at scale. This unique integrated value proposition helps our clients implement digital transformations and generative AI solutions. 
Second, we reposition our portfolio to address our clients' top priorities through investments in skills, capabilities and strategic partnerships. Consulting is even more powerful when working in collaboration with our partners. Our strategic partnerships now make up over 40% of our Consulting revenue and delivered double-digit growth in both signings and revenue for the full year. Within this performance, our AWS and Azure practices each grew revenue more than 50% for the year. 
Finally, our solid results throughout the year demonstrate our focus on execution. When you look at our 3 lines of business in Consulting, we have consistently delivered solid revenue performance. Business Transformation, revenue grew 5% for the third consecutive quarter, again, led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to growth. 
Technology Consulting revenue was up over 4% with growth in cloud modernization projects and cloud-based application development. Application Operations revenue grew 6% driven again by cloud application management and platform engineering services with both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements contributing to growth. 
Moving to Consulting profit. We expanded gross margin 30 basis points and delivered pretax margin of 11.5%, which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. Our pretax margin performance continues to reflect the pricing and productivity actions we have taken, offsetting increased labor costs and nearly 1 point of currency impact. 
In our Infrastructure business, revenue was up 2%, Hybrid Infrastructure revenue grew 7%, and Infrastructure Support declined 9%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 8%. Now 7 quarters into the product cycle, z16 revenue performance has significantly outperformed prior cycles, including the successful z15 cycle. 
The z16 program incorporates a number of key innovations for our clients, including cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum safe cyber-resilient security, energy efficiency and strong reliability and scalability. Clients are increasingly leveraging zSystems for more and more workloads, and that translates to demand for more capacity, which we described in terms of MIPS. In fact, installed MIPS have roughly doubled over the last 2 cycles. Putting this all together, zSystems remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. 
Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 7% with growth across both Power and Storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10, and Storage traction was aligned to the success of the z16 cycle we just mentioned. Infrastructure support revenue declined given our successful hardware performance. 
Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered gross profit and pretax margin expansion. Pretax margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. 
Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. As Arvind mentioned, we are now 2/3 of the way through our mid-term model. And so I'd say it's a good time to reflect on what we have accomplished over this period. Let me start with the actions we've taken to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. 
We aligned our business to a platform-centric model focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Our go-to-market is based on more technical and experiential selling. We opened IBM's ecosystem and strategic partnerships to give our clients greater choice and technical depth and give IBM multiple ways to win across our portfolio. We have invested in innovation and skills and pursued strategic M&A. And we presented a simplified reporting structure to give increased transparency into our performance. These actions resulted in a fundamentally different company with an improved business mix and a higher-value recurring revenue base. 
Today, our growth vectors of Software and Consulting represent 75% of our revenue base, up from about 55% in 2020. And our stable recurring revenue stream represents about half of IBM's revenue. As Arvind said, our 2-year average revenue growth is in line with our mid-single-digit model, and our segments have delivered at or above the revenue models. 
With this backdrop, let me turn to 2024 guidance and our 2 key measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. We expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we start the year, I think it's prudent to assume the low end of that model. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion. 
Our revenue expectations are underpinned by solid growth in both Software and Consulting. In Software, given our pipeline of business, investment in innovation and the contribution of acquisitions, we expect revenue growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In Consulting, our solid signings and book-to-bill ratio support revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% with acceleration throughout the year. Given this growth profile, coupled with our productivity actions, we expect to see well over 1 point of pretax margin expansion in each of these segments. 
And then in Infrastructure, as we are entering the year 7 quarters into the z16 cycle, we expect 2024 Infrastructure revenue to decline. This should drive over 1 point impact to IBM's overall revenue growth. And given the z cycle dynamics, we expect Infrastructure pretax margin to be lower year-over-year. 
Bringing it all together with these segment dynamics, we expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point, consistent with what we delivered in 2023. Our tax rate for the year should also be fairly consistent with 2023. And as always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion in 2024 driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We will have lower cash requirements driven by changes in our retirement plans, which will be offset by higher CapEx and other balance sheet dynamics.
Let me comment on a couple of items that are included in our guidance. First, we are seeing increased productivity in our business, which will lead to workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with 2023 levels. And second, as we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we expect to close the sale of the Weather Company assets in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we expect this to impact revenue growth by over 0.5 point, and any pretax gain from the transaction will be partially offset by foregone profit. In the first quarter of 2024, the company will realign its management structure to manage these assets outside of the Software segment within other divested businesses, which will provide comparability within Software on a year-over-year basis.
Looking into the first quarter, I'd expect our revenue growth rate to be similar to the full year. For profit, we expect the first half to second half skew of net income to be fairly consistent with history and first quarter to be a couple of points better than last year's skew.
In summary, we have a durable growth business with strong free cash flow generation. We have made a lot of progress this past year and feel good about our position as we enter 2024. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.",2672

I appreciate the question overall. We're obviously very pleased. The team has executed extremely well in 2023, our strongest free cash flow since 2019, $11.2 billion, $1.9 billion year-to-year.
I think it's important, to your point, before we get to '24, to take a step back a year ago and talk about how we guided the year. And by the way, we've been consistent every quarter about our guidance of about $10.5 billion. The reason I think it's important because it goes right at the heart of your question, which is the quality and sustainability and why we here at IBM had the confidence in the guide of about $12 billion.
We said a year ago about $10.5 billion. It was predominantly going to be driven by the improving fundamentals of our business, read that sustainable revenue growth, operating leverage. And that, by the way, is our model $750 million year-to-year. On top of that, remember, we had an opportunity gap coming out of fourth quarter 2022. We said we would get working capital efficiency of $400 million, and then we would have modest structural action tailwind offsetting modest cash tax headwind. That kind of brought it all together, $750-ish million from improving fundamentals of the business, $400 million.
Now how did we -- how did 2023 play out? Number one, the improving fundamentals of our business, we had a very strong second half both on our top line revenue, our portfolio mix, our productivity. And we delivered $900 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA year-to-year, which, by the way, we gave you as far as increased transparency. On top of that, we got the $400 million worth of working capital efficiency, very consistent.
Then we've got -- and we capitalized on all of the productivity actions that we have done. We capitalized on being opportunistic on some real estate rationalization. That's why our CapEx was down about $400 million. By the way, full transparency, that's a timing. That was a 2024 item. We got that in 2023, so let's put that aside.
And then we've got about $100 million worth of cash tax that came in a little bit better. So I would say, against that, very strong high-quality sustainability. That sets the baseline for '24. '24 really is simple as we said in the prepared remarks.
One, we see very consistent growth in the fundamentals of our business around revenue profile, margin and productivity that we will get a similar level of growth year-to-year in adjusted EBITDA. By the way, that's above our model again as I'll state, so that we did $900 million last year, we'll get it again. With that, we will also have benefits from the changes in retirement plans that many of you have written about.
But offsetting that, we got higher cash taxes year-to-year, and we've also got CapEx that we are going to continue to invest for the long-term sustainable leadership of this company. So it's really in 2024 entirely driven by the business model of our adjusted EBITDA growth. So thank you, again, Wamsi, for the question.",518

Let me do some of the financial bridges year-over-year then turn it over to Arvind and talk about the portfolio, the competitiveness, the innovation and why we feel very confident overall. When you look at our guide, by the way, an acceleration from 2023, I would first start with full year last year, we were very pleased with our software performance, over 5% growth year-over-year. And on a 2-year CGR against our mid-single-digit model, we're at the high end of that model.
So when you look at our guide, we feel confident in the level of innovation we've been bringing in, but I would break that guide down mathematically into about 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, I think we've proven over the last 2 years that we have rebuilt and repositioned our portfolio, and we now have a high-value recurring revenue stream that can grow in this business, offer the innovation and the success of our hardware platform business. That's about 2 points of growth of slightly above the mid-single digit model of Software. So 2 points based on credibility of our sustained growth in the high-value recurring revenue.
Number two, you talked about acquisitions. We are going to continue to invest and fuel investment into our software portfolio to improve the innovation, the synergistic value, the strategic fit, the hybrid cloud and AI. You saw we closed very excited off to a great start with Apptio, and we announced the acquisition of webMethods and StreamSets. Acquisitions will probably give us a little bit less than 2 points of that growth in 2024. So 2 points from high-value recurring revenue, a little bit less than 2 points of acquisition and then Red Hat, to your point.
We actually delivered about what we said in fourth quarter. We said high single digit. We still got impacted by consumption-based services. By the way, we'll start wrapping on that later in 2024. But we're extremely excited about the acceleration of demand in our single-year bookings in our subscription book of business, 14% growth in third quarter, 17% growth in fourth quarter. Red Hat will give us about 2.5 points of growth year-over-year. And then the remaining 0.5 point is our continued growth of our Transaction Processing, and that's about 0.5 point. You add those up, you're over 6% growth. And I think we feel pretty good. But let me turn it over to Arvind.",407

And Amit, the second part of that is all of the innovation that we are delivering. When we play it up against the demands in the marketplace, our AI platform is going to be a part of what fuels innovation. And as I think you all understand when people like one part of the portfolio, they tend to also leverage other parts of the portfolio.
Other than the AI portfolio automation, which really helps our clients with productivity, Jim mentioned Apptio or Apptio, Turbonomic, the whole category called AIOps in the market, we believe, is going to be a big driver of demand for us. And on the mainframe, let's remember, TP does get driven by increased MIPS, and Jim talked about the increased MIPS that are out there. Those MIPS, coupled the innovation we do in that part of the portfolio, drive the growth.
So it's very well balanced. You have M&A, you have Red Hat innovation, you have AI innovation, automation innovation and TP innovation. And that is really what comes together to give us that growth and give us the confidence of being able to deliver all of that growth.",195

So just on the free cash flow, Jim, I'm wondering, can you give us a bridge from net income, which I think The Street is expecting is about $9 billion or a little over for fiscal '24 and how you get to $12 billion in free cash flow, not from 2023 levels but from net income levels?
And maybe in that, can you just clarify how much do you expect depreciation expense to be? And how much do you expect CapEx to be and how big a contributor is that? And then secondly, on the AI book of business, I think you said low hundreds of millions that doubled. So should we be thinking $300 million to $400 million? And it sounds like 1/3 was in Software. Was that revenue recognized during the quarter? And then the other couple of hundred millions were Consulting signings? Can you just elaborate specifically on exactly what the book of business means?",166
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818984.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,14,"Okay, Toni. Let me take the first piece, and I appreciate the question as always, and then Arvind can talk about the AI overall. For increased transparency -- by the way, coming out of third quarter, where we delivered free cash flow of $1 billion up year-over-year, Arvind and I and many other of the senior leaders, we've spent a tremendous amount of time with our investors. And our investors were actually guiding us, coaching us around giving increased transparency about the drivers right at the heart of your question. That's why we put in both the press release and in the supplemental earnings chart a bridge down from operating pretax income down to adjusted PTI.
Why? As I stated in Wamsi's question, for depicting the quality and sustainability of our free cash flow. So when you look at 2024 -- so to your point, I'll leave '23 aside. When you look at '24, it's entirely going to be driven and more by the growth in adjusted EBITDA. And when you look at net income and you break it down, there's not that much difference between net income overall and the adjusted EBITDA overall. So the $900 million is purely a function of the confidence we have in the portfolio, the mix, the scale, the operating leverage and the productivity, which you heard on the prepared remarks, we took up to $3 billion here as an annual exit run rate by the end of 2024.
So it's an entirely driven balance sheet. We'll have dynamics going one way or the other, cash tax, modest headwind. But those all kind of wash out. It's going to be entirely driven by the business fundamentals.",282
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818985.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Jim. So Toni, on the AI book of business, this is not all revenue in the quarter. I would just begin with that statement to set it straight. At this stage, we wanted to start looking at what is our momentum, what is the sentiment from our clients. So we went to a measure that is more reflective of, I'll use the word signings. What is the commitment the clients are making to us?
Consulting is straightforward. It is the signings. Consulting signings are anywhere from 12 to 24 months on average is how much time they play out over there. And on Software, it's what they're committing to. And we are using SaaS ACV. So it's a 12-month commitment, which is typical for as a Service as well as, since we do offer our portfolio both ways as license or as a Service, it includes the license piece as well.
Now over long term, let's call it a couple of years or more, yes, the book of business should turn into an amount of revenue in a quarter, but that's going to take a bit of time to catch up. But we felt that this gives the better indicator right now of what is our traction and what is our acceleration in that part of the business.",219
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818986.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,16,Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.,10

And Jim, you mentioned and disclosed high single -- high teens, sorry, bookings growth in 2023 and just at 8% off a pretty difficult comp. I was wondering how that's going to play out in terms of revenue yields in '24 and into '25. Does that give you more confidence that the second half of '24 is going to have a pickup in Consulting revenue reported?
And then for Arvind, if I could just sneak more on Consulting. Your -- one of your top competitors -- your top competitor has much easier comps in terms of bookings and revenue over the next 12 months. Do you think you could continue to outperform them in the next year?",122
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818988.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,18,"Thanks, Ben. Really appreciate your question -- Consulting-based question. I think the team is executing extremely well in the marketplace. And as we talked about in prepared remarks, there's real synergistic value of consulting in a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. I think you've seen that play out.
When you look at it, yes, we had a very strong year, relatively speaking, in the marketplace around Consulting in 2023. Signings growth 17%, book-to-bill over 1.15, our absolute backlog is up 8%, the strongest we've had in quite some time, by the way, stable erosion and duration is up slightly, which we expect as clients do more and more application modernization, those are long tails.
So when you look at that profile and you look at how we enter 2024, we take a look at that backlog. We do our backlog runouts. We look at how much of that comes out of our waterfall of the backlog realization and how much actual sell and bill activity you got to do in the year. And that gives us confidence. We guided full year to 6% to 8%. We also said that we expect, just based on those backlog realization trends, albeit a lot of work still to get done in '24. But based on those backlog realization trends, we see an acceleration growth path throughout 2024.
And that tailwind into 2025, we're well in front of our skis now. But when you just look at backlog -- and by the way, backlog, when you look at 2025, the predictor indicator is only about 1/3 of that backlog sits in '25. As we enter right now in '24, about 2/3 is backlog-driven. So -- and that still looks pretty healthy growth compared to what our model looks like. So we feel pretty good about our book of business and the strategic partnership velocity, the Red Hat velocity. So I would leave it at that. Let me turn it over to Arvind.",329
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818989.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,19,"Thanks, Jim. So Ben, as opposed to trying to directly compare with 1 other or 2 other people, can I take it back to the market, if you don't mind. The overall consulting market seems to be in the 4% to 6% range. So we benchmark there to make sure that we're trying to take share and that we have the offerings which appeal to clients, which also allow us to keep a healthy margin in the business.
So when we look at it from those 2 lenses, we are going to be absolutely focused on taking share, which is why we are guiding to a higher 6% to 8% number is where we feel it will be. Then we go back to do we have the bookings that justify that? Yes, the booking is justified. But as you all know, that is some but not all of the revenue in the year. So we feel it's prudent to then guide it into the 6% to 8%, not higher. So you combine it with the offerings we have, we are also very, very focused compared to many of the players out there who are much larger. We are very focused on our strategic partners, and we are very focused on digital transformation and data and AI as opposed to a much broader swath of offerings that other people have. That gives us confidence in our growth rate, as Jim pointed out, for our Consulting business.",245

And I'm just curious if you're hearing and seeing the same thing that we're seeing in our work.",60

So let me address that. I'll begin by saying I see '24 playing out quite similar to '23. While there has been a lot of talk about reduced software budgets and reduced technology budgets overall, we are not seeing that. We are seeing that people are a bit more discriminating in what they're spending on. But that is as is spending more on AI, more on digital transformation, and I'll come to why, it might mean that they are sort of focusing less on some other areas.
So why is that? We see that there is a remarkably resilient economy. We can see that across South Asia from India to Japan, to the Middle East. Europe has kept remarkably resilient despite the conflict in Eastern Europe. Then when we come to North America, the economy here is resilient. Latin America, despite some early predictions, has actually done quite well.
You put that all together -- look, we don't forecast GDP. We just look at what other people forecast, and all of them are forecasting in the 2% range, 2%, 2.3%, same difference from our perspective. Then if you look at some of the pressures our CEO clients face, whether it's interest rates, whether it's inflation, whether it's supply chain, whether it's the demographic shifts on population, whether it's geopolitical conflicts or uncertainty, one answer that lets them grow without taking on fixed costs of either labor or physical infrastructure is technology.
So we see every one of them leaning into technology as a potential answer that helps them against all of those potential headwinds. And so we feel pretty good that technology budgets should stay in line with 2023 going into '24.",284

And that was if we maybe set aside Red Hat, which we've spoken about, some of the other businesses continue to decelerate, especially looking at something like Data & AI or automation, especially in this climate of AI and a focus on spending there.
I'm just curious, what is driving the confidence that those businesses reaccelerate? Is it customer conversations? I'd love if you could just give a bit more detail, one on, again, what happened in 4Q and kind of how you parse through some of that deceleration across those businesses? And then two, again, what's underscoring the confidence that some of these businesses then reaccelerate into next year?",121
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818995.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,25,"Yes. Let's start with the bigger picture. Overall, we laid out a mid-term model. We said our Software portfolio would grow mid-single digit, by the way, coming from a prior cycle that we were very low single digits overall. And we finished this year up over 5%. We finished a 2-year CGR already 2/3 into our model at the high end of the model at 6%. Is that our aspiration? Absolutely not. It's what -- Arvind has the entire team focused on. And that's why we continue to fuel investment into new innovation both organically, inorganically.
But let's take a step back how we set the year up. We set the year up, we said the year was going to be predominantly driven by the strength of our recurring revenue annuity portfolio, which, by the way, high value, 80% of our Software revenue. That's our subscription-based models, our SaaS models, our TP software, et cetera. And we said that was going to grow mid-single digit. We actually delivered on that.
We said then, second, prudently coming off of a peak ELA cycle, and you understand our ELA cycle extremely well in 4Q '22 that we expected a headwind. Now let's go back 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we were sitting year-to-date 6.5% total Software segment, which gave us the confidence of taking up our guidance to the high end of the mid-single-digit model. What was driving that? Both HP&S was up 7%, TP was up 6%. And underneath that, we were seeing very solid growth in our transactional business, both volume and NRR with new clients.
Now we get the fourth quarter and the ELA rep hit us. By the way, the ELA cycles give or take, they're in these ranges. They're on average about 3 years. They get probably somewhere around 40 to 50-plus percent in year 1, and then it tails off. So it's the biggest impact we'll see. We got through that in the fourth quarter, and we still delivered over 5% on a 2-year CGR. We're at the high end of the model.
Now when you look at full year performance, Red Hat up 9%; automation, I'm directionally correct, 4% or 5%; Data & AI, 4% or 5%; security, yes, we got an execution gap on security. We got an opportunity to go fix in 2024. So I think it's actually glass half full. The innovation we're fueling in organically, the M&A portfolio, which is scaling nicely with a strategic fit, that gives us the confidence on why we're actually taking up and accelerating our growth in light of Brent's question in 2024.",438

Maybe focusing even more so on the Software side and just thinking solely on that 2.5 points of growth that's expected to come from the Red Hat. I mean you've talked about the Consulting strength that you're hearing around both cloud and application modernization. Are there any other signs you're hearing specifically from like pipeline or customer conversations about an improving demand environment for Red Hat specifically? And then maybe just as like a caveat, how maybe some of the cloud cost optimizations impacted Red Hat in 2023?",107
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3936.0,3003161.0,109818998.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,28,"Yes. Matt, let me take that. So when we look at Red Hat, while there are many products in the portfolio, 3 are the valves that drive the forward performance. So Red Hat Linux, as we look at the overall usage of Linux, as we look at customers being even more concerned about patching, security and making sure that hackers can't break into their infrastructure and we look at the sheer volatility that happens, I'll call it, in the unfettered open source world, it drives a lot of demand for Red Hat. And we're beginning to see not just enterprise customers but even many ISVs begin to embrace that.
As we look at OpenShift, I go back to a fundamental. I think most of our clients have now acknowledged that a hybrid environment is their reality, meaning multiple public clouds and their own data centers are private. In that environment, OpenShift is the leading platform that gives them the flexibility to take an application and run it across all of those. And in this day and age when people have thousands of applications and the ones they're ready to deploy without having thousands of people, Ansible give them the platform to go do that. Those 3 combined roll up into the 17% increase in bookings that Jim referenced on the call. So that's not a leading indicator that is actually already done.
Now with 14% in the previous quarter, that tells us the acceleration happening on that side. And we feel confident given the client conversations that these are all going to lead to Red Hat growth, putting aside the innovation that's coming from the edge platforms, from embedded Red Hat and from other markets that as the edge opens up or create yet again another additional market that has to come. So this gives us confidence that Red Hat will grow and provide that 2 to 2.5 points of overall software.",322

I appreciate that, Brian. Thank you very much. I mean, I think Arvind has been very clear for the last 3.5 years, 4 years since he's come on. First of all, let's talk criteria, right? We always get asked size this, size that. Size is not a criteria. It is entirely -- and I complement him and the entire team, he's very focused on strategic fit to a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. Those targeted areas are always centered around hybrid cloud, data, automation, security and oh, by the way, both software IP asset and consulting expertise on both sides. So strategic fit.
Second, we run this platform-centric model to create a synergistic multiplier effect in our business. So when we look at every single week a set of targeted candidates, we're looking at the synergistic effect because as a CFO, when we deploy $1, we're looking for a multiplier of hardware, software services on top of that.
And then third, financial attractiveness. It has to be high growth, recurring revenue, highly profitable and free cash flow accretion in a quick period of time. That will vary based on software, it will vary based on consulting. But I think you're going to continue to see us be opportunistic in the marketplace. We've got the right capital structure. We've got the right FINFLEX. We ended with, what, $13.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel pretty good about our position, and we will capitalize on that to the extent it hits and fits those criteria. So thank you for the question.",266

In the first quarter, we had solid performance across revenue and cash flow. These results are further proof of the quality of our portfolio and our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We had good performance in Software, at the high end of our model; continued strength in Infrastructure, above our model; while Consulting was below model. On a relative basis, Consulting outperformed the market. 
Our cash flow generation is the strongest first quarter level we have reported in many years. This performance speaks to the strength of our diversified business model.
Before we get into more detail on the quarter, let me address the announcement of our agreement to acquire HashiCorp, a company we have partnered with for a long time and believe is a tremendous strategic fit with IBM. Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure applications across public and private cloud as well as on-prem environments, making this the ideal time to pursue this acquisition. 
As generative AI deployment accelerates alongside traditional workloads, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies. HashiCorp has a proven track record of helping clients manage the complexity of today's infrastructure by automating, orchestrating and securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp is a great strategic addition to our portfolio, extending Red Hat's hybrid cloud capabilities to provide end-to-end automated infrastructure and security life cycle management. 
HashiCorp's technology is foundational to enabling the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud, and Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure automation for these environments. With security top of mind for every enterprise, Vault is a powerful secrets management offering to automate identity security across applications. The combination will also bolster our leading IT automation platform to address the sprawling complexity of AI-driven application and infrastructure growth. 
HashiCorp's products have wide-scale adoption in the developer community, highlighting the pervasive nature of their technology used by over 85% of the Fortune 500 and downloaded over 0.5 billion times. The acquisition of HashiCorp builds on IBM's commitment to industry collaboration, the developer community and open source hybrid cloud and AI innovation. 
Today's acquisition is consistent with our M&A strategy. We have taken a disciplined approach to M&A, and HashiCorp aligns well across all our key criteria to continue to focus and strengthen our portfolio, on hybrid cloud and AI, deliver synergies with the rest of IBM and be near-term accretive to free cash flow. 
I will now turn it to Jim to discuss the financial implications.",416
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950395.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Arvind. Let me start with the details of the transaction. We have agreed to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion in enterprise value to be funded by cash on hand. The transaction was approved by HashiCorp's Board of Directors. Closing is anticipated by the end of 2024, subject to approval by HashiCorp's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
We have been executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and the acquisition of HashiCorp meets all of our criteria, including strategic fit, as Arvind just walked through, synergies across IBM and financial accretion. 
Let me start by addressing synergies. We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp. Product synergies span across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible automation platforms configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. 
We are well positioned to drive growth for HashiCorp by leveraging IBM's enterprise incumbency and global reach. With 70% of the revenue today coming from the U.S., the opportunity to scale HashiCorp across IBM's operations in 175 countries is significant. 
We also believe we can accelerate HashiCorp's adoption with IBM clients. To put this in perspective, only about 20% of the Forbes Global 2000 are HashiCorp customers and just 25% of HashiCorp customers result in more than $100,000 annual recurring revenue, underscoring the opportunity to better monetize and upsell their products. 
Bringing it all together, the acquisition allows us to deliver a more comprehensive hybrid cloud offering to enterprise clients, enhancing IBM's ability to capture global cloud opportunity. This will drive a higher growth profile over time. 
Finally, we expect to realize operating efficiencies and expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA within the first full year post close and to free cash flow in year 2. Significant near-term cost synergies underpin the financial profile of the transaction, while product synergies represent further upside. We are very comfortable with our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile and solid investment-grade rating and remain committed to our dividend policy. 
I'll now turn it back to Arvind.",366

Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. 
We expect the global economy to behave similarly to last year, albeit with some uncertainty due to persistently high interest rates. There are reasons to believe technology will be even more important in 2024 as clients focus on productivity improvements and customer experience. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. 
I will now provide some details on the execution of our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI. 
Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. This year, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity. We are pleased with the solid progress of our AI offerings. Each quarter, we are winning more clients, expanding partnerships and introducing new innovations. 
Inception to date, our book of business related to watsonx and generative AI is greater than $1 billion with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Similar to last quarter, this remains weighted towards Consulting. 
We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. We developed our watsonx platform for clients to build their AI solutions, spanning from foundation model training to data preparation and governance. This includes both IBM/Red Hat models and third-party models, giving our clients variety as well as efficiency and focus on enterprise domains that IBM brings. 
We have leveraged watsonx to build AI assistance through our software portfolio. Our consultants are helping clients navigate the AI landscape. And finally, we are seeing our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Let me touch on these infrastructure dynamics briefly. 
As AI becomes widely adopted, IBM Z is uniquely advantaged. We believe a lot of AI inferencing will happen where the data is for security, efficiency and latency reasons. Our full-stack focus, from on-chip AI processing to AI accelerator cards, to watsonx platform support, allows models to be built and trained on any platform and easily deployed on IBM Z. 
The Telum chip is a unique differentiator, enabling real-time AI inferencing. Generative AI is also driving lift for our storage offerings where industry-leading performance and scalability is utilized for data curation, model building and fine-tuning. 
For enterprises to deploy AI at scale, AI is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It requires tuned, domain-specific models trained with quality data to maximize its impact. Clients value the flexibility of our approach. They appreciate having the ability to leverage a combination of AI models, whether they're IBMs; their own models; open source models, such as Llama from Meta and Mixtral from Mistral. And they can deploy these AI models across multiple environments. The flexibility we offer is resonating as our use cases are both large and more efficient models. 
We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. 
We see early parallels to Linux in making open source AI models performant for enterprise use. We believe that IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open source AI. As you know, we have done a lot of work with AI models and recently released a family of state-of-the-art open source code models from our Granite series. Red Hat and IBM also recently launched Instruct Lab to evolve and improve AI models through incremental community contributions, much like open source software. This open strategy is resonating around the world. We recently announced a collaboration with the Spanish government to leverage IBM's investments across their entire AI stack and open source to build the world's leading suite of foundation models proficient in the Spanish language. 
Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor remain top of mind for our clients. This quarter, we signed a multiyear contract with Providence Health to reimagine talent and HR workflows with AI from IBM and partners. We're also providing data-driven insights and enabling Spanish language narration for this year's Masters golf tournament. 
Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth. This quarter, we progressed strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders. Consulting joined forces with NVIDIA to accelerate clients' AI journeys. ServiceNow will embed watsonx AI capabilities into the ServiceNow platform to accelerate enterprise digital transformation. We also expanded our relationship with Adobe around OpenShift and watsonx as it relates to the Adobe Experience Platform. 
We continue to invest in emerging technology as well, bringing new innovations to the market. Since we put the world's first Quantum system on the cloud in 2016, we have deployed over 80 Quantum systems, and our users have run over 3 trillion programs to date. We just installed a Quantum System One at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is the first IBM Quantum system on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy storage, material science and financial modeling. 
As always, focusing on our portfolio remains a key priority. We closed the sale of The Weather Company in the first quarter and expect to close the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG by midyear. 
Overall, we had a positive start to the year, which gives us confidence in our next quarter and full year expectations. 
Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.",916
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950397.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue; $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA; $1.7 billion of operating pretax income; $1.68 operating earnings per share; and we generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up approximately $600 million year-over-year. 
Our revenue for the quarter was up 3% at constant currency. We saw an impact to our top line performance from the closing of The Weather Company earlier than expected in the quarter. 
Software grew by 6% with growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing and continued strength in our recurring revenue base. 
Consulting was up 2%, reflecting organic growth. We continue to have solid signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of over 1.15. 
Infrastructure had strong performance, delivering growth across all of our hardware offerings. 
Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points and operating pretax margin by 130 basis points over last year, inclusive of about 100 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. 
At the end of January, we closed on the divestiture of The Weather Company, generating a pretax gain of $241 million in the quarter. Mitigating that benefit, we took charges of $374 million to address workforce rebalancing. 
Operating pretax margin was up 50 basis points, excluding the year-over-year impacts of workforce rebalancing and divestiture dynamics. We are pleased with this performance, in line with our guidance of roughly 50 basis points of operating pretax margin improvement in 2024. 
Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. This allows for continued investments to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense. The timing of discrete tax items this quarter resulted in an operating tax rate of about 6%. We are still expecting a full year operating tax rate consistent with last year. 
Overall, the combination of our revenue and operating margin performance resulted in 7% growth in our adjusted EBITDA. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $600 million year-over-year. This growth reflects the performance of our underlying business, with adjusted EBITDA up $200 million year-over-year and about $400 million from timing of balance sheet dynamics and CapEx. 
Over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $11.8 billion. This puts us on track to deliver about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, with the growth largely driven by adjusted EBITDA. 
Since our acquisition of Red Hat, excluding 2021 when we spun off Kyndryl, our operating net income to free cash flow realization averaged 120%. Two factors drive this. One is stock-based compensation, which today represents 15 points of realization. And two, given the shift in our portfolio to a growing software business, deferred income also contributes to our realization. 
In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $19.3 billion, up from $13.5 billion at year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $59.5 billion, including $9.9 billion from our financing business. 
Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6% with good performance across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. As mentioned in January, the Software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, acquisitions, strong recurring revenue and transaction processing. And this is just how the first quarter played out. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%. Let me spend a minute on the various elements. 
Red Hat revenue grew 9%, reflecting solid performance across the 3 key solutions: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Annual bookings growth was again in the mid-teens, with OpenShift up over 40% this quarter and RHEL and Ansible each up double digits. 
Beyond Red Hat, recent acquisitions contributed to the growth profile of Hybrid Platform & Solutions as did new innovation areas, including watsonx. The combination of Apptio, acquired mid-last year, and our IT automation portfolio has delivered strong results, unlocking the full benefits of a fin op solution for technology investments across hybrid cloud environments. In fact, just this quarter, we partnered with Microsoft to bring Apptio to Azure and we'll co-sell to our joint customers, and Microsoft has agreed to adopt Apptio's capabilities in parts of their organization. 
Our revenue performance continues to reflect growth in our high-value recurring revenue base. Our ARR, after removing The Weather Company and security services, is now $13.9 billion, up over 8% since last year. 
Transaction Processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms. And there's an increasing interest in generative AI application modernization capabilities, like watsonx Code Assistant for Z. 
Software segment profit was up 80 basis points while absorbing both key investments in innovation and about 1 point of currency impact in the quarter. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance this quarter. 
Our Consulting revenue was up 2%. We continue to see clients prioritizing large data and technology transformation projects focused on driving productivity with AI and analytics. These results reflect the organic performance of our business. 
Solid demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 4%, our highest absolute first quarter signings in recent history, and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. 
Our overall backlog remains healthy, up 7% year-over-year, and backlog erosion levels remain stable. At the same time, we saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large-scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tightened discretionary spending. 
Contributing to growth across the business this quarter, our strategic partnerships continue to make up over 40% of our Consulting revenue, with both AWS and Azure practices growing double digits. Additionally, our Red Hat practice grew revenue double digits. Expanding upon our partnerships, we are leveraging Microsoft Copilot to drive productivity for our clients. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful book of business around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are ahead of pace at this stage with our generative AI book of business. 
Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 3% led by supply chain and finance transformations. Customer experience transformations also contributed to growth. 
Technology Consulting revenue was also up 3% with double-digit growth in cloud modernization projects, and both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements delivered double-digit growth. 
Application Operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management projects, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. 
Moving to Consulting profit. We delivered over 8% of segment profit margin, which is flat year-to-year. Our segment profit margin was impacted by about 1 point of currency, offsetting improvements in pricing and productivity actions we have taken. 
Moving to Infrastructure. Revenue grew, reflecting growth in Hybrid Infrastructure of 6% and declines in Infrastructure Support of 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, growth was broad-based with strong demand from our hardware offerings across IBM Z, Power and Storage. 
In IBM Z, revenue was up 5% in the eighth quarter of z16 product availability. Now 2 years in, this product cycle continues to resonate with clients and surpassed z15 revenue performance. IBM Z is uniquely positioned for AI with the first processor design with on-chip acceleration for real-time AI inferencing. In fact, we're working with over 100 clients on the application of AI on z16. Use cases range from fraud detection to anti-money laundering, to anomaly detection. This remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. 
Distributed Infrastructure delivered 7% revenue growth with strength in both Power and Storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads. Storage delivered strong double-digit revenue growth, including demand for high-end storage tied to the Z16 cycle. And clients are also looking to our storage offerings for data curation, model building and fine-tuning and support of generative AI. 
Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered both gross profit and segment profit margin expansion. Segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing about 1 point of impact from currency. 
Now let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. More than 2 years into our midterm model, we are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. Over this time, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. 
Our first quarter performance is another proof point of this progress with constant currency revenue growth, operating gross margin and operating pretax margin expansion, and the strongest first quarter free cash flow in many years. 
Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on our 2 primary metrics: revenue and free cash flow. We see full year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
On the segments. In Software, we had a solid start to the year and continue to expect growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations. Though, as I said, we are seeing some pressure on smaller, more discretionary projects. We now see mid-single-digit revenue growth in Consulting with acceleration throughout the year. Given our ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in innovation, we expect to see about 1 point of segment profit margin expansion in both of these segments. And in Infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect revenue to decline, driving about a 0.5 point impact to our overall growth. 
Given IBM Z cycle dynamics, we expect segment profit margin to be lower year-over-year. With these segment dynamics, we continue to expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, consistent with our view 90 days ago, and we are maintaining our view of operating tax for the year to be consistent with last year, in the mid-teens range. 
We took a workforce rebalancing charge this quarter. And as I mentioned 90 days ago, we continue to see the overall amount this year consistent with last year. We expect this to pay back by the end of the year. 
On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 150 to 200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year, which is about 1 point worse than 90 days ago. 
For the second quarter, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be consistent with the full year. Our tax rate is expected to be in the high teens. And for profit, we expect the first half skew of net income will remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance to start the quarter. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit margin and grow free cash flow for the year.

So I'm hoping you'd touch on the near-term side, what are you hearing from your customers? What are they telling you around the duration of this pause? Because I think the expectation of mid-single-digit growth would imply this business will recover rather quickly. So I'd just love to get a sense on what are customers' view on Consulting, in terms of the duration of the pause? And then longer term, what does the opportunity look like given the AI-centric backlog appears a lot more robust versus what I think folks have expected beyond '24?",139

I appreciate the question. Let's take a step back because I think you're seeing some interesting dynamics in the consulting industry overall. And let's bifurcate it between how you asked the question. Let's look at real demand that's being measured in bookings, and then let's talk about what's happening with the revenue realization. 
On demand, we continue to see and capitalize on solid demand in key areas around digital transformation, application modernization and Gen AI. Our signings in the quarter, up 4%, the strongest absolute first quarter signings we've had as far back as I can go. We have a strong book-to-bill, over 1.15 on a trailing 12 months. Our backlog dynamic is in a very strong position, 7% overall with stable erosion, but our duration has been going up the last 2 quarters. It's been up a couple of months. 
But let's talk about the underpinnings of what's driving demand because I think that's what's most important around the key growth focus areas. You talked about Gen AI. Gen AI for IBM, Arvind indicated, inception to date, over a $1 billion book of business. Consulting in the first quarter, the book of business on Gen AI was 2x all of last year, so I think we're winning in the marketplace. We're taking share. And by the way, we're well above that ramp we saw with regards to Red Hat. 
Our strategic partnerships still have great velocity, book-to-bill well north of 1.2. Our Red Hat book business is now $2.8 billion ARR around hybrid cloud. And we're seeing very nice acceleration in Gen AI and digital transformation around core workflow use case areas of finance, supply chain, HR and talent. So I think in the key focus areas, is our demand profile still continues to be good. 
Now let's translate that to revenue. Revenue, first of all, in the first quarter, as we indicated, it was all organic. We ramped on our acquisitions. We continue to operate a very disciplined M&A process and we continue to be opportunistic, but that 2% revenue growth was all organic quarter-to-quarter. Second, in this marketplace, you look at competition, we're taking share still. 
So when you look at it, 90 days ago, we talked about the year. We talked about the year was going to play out accelerating throughout the year. Why? Because, one, we knew we had a strong backlog and that backlog realization showed us that it was going to play out throughout the year with sequential improvement. But second, Easter. Easter, we knew calendar was there, it was at the end of March. That does impact a human capital-based business on a number of billing days. 
So when you look then at first quarter, that backlog duration extending out a couple of months. We also saw, though, less revenue backlog yield, and that really played out if you look at our subsegments, in Application Operations. That's centered around custom AMS applications which, by the way, many of that, as you know quite well, is volume-based business. And that volume, like I said, backlog is stable overall. We're not losing the business. That is moving out to the right. 
So with all that said, what are we focused on? We're focused on capturing new client demand in areas around our key growth areas. Two, we're continuing to focus and we are gaining share in the marketplace. Three, we're driving that economic multiplier of consulting and technology across our hybrid cloud and AI platform. 
So in light of all that, that's why you see the mid-single-digit growth. I think that's prudent just given what every other consulting competitors come out with. By the way, that still drives 1.5 points of growth to IBM for the full year. And as I stated earlier, we see an accelerated growth profile as we move through the year.",643

I mean I know Jim mentioned the tightened discretionary spending in some areas. How do you think about the risk of that sort of filtering more broadly as you go through the course of the year, especially given your guidance calls for an accelerating trend here? 
And if I could, quickly, Jim, the synergies relative to HashiCorp on the cost side, is there any way you can dimensionalize that given that, when you're defining accretion on EBITDA basis, I get that, but can you also help on the net income basis or from a free cash flow how much it might be dilutive in year 1 and accretive on year 2?",127
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950404.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,12,"Thanks, Wamsi. So let me address your thought about the demand profile globally. So if I look at where we are right now and where we project for the rest of the year, demand is actually quite strong. I would put it as very similar to 2023. This is backed up by IMF GDP estimates, which are now north of 3% for the global business.
If I look at it by geography, Japan remains very strong. I think that they are taking this opportunity to refresh the technology across their enterprise and government base. If you look at South Asia, extremely strong; even the Middle East, U.A.E., Saudi, very strong; Europe has remained consistent to last year; North and South America. So on a geography basis, we're seeing very, very strong demand. 
Now interest rates are higher than people were expecting. I think we should acknowledge that. That means you get two effects going on. One, there is even stronger demand for software and infrastructure because people believe technology helps you in those environments and helps in an environment of increased labor costs and increased supply chain costs. Then when you look at the discretionary side, Jim answered this in the previous question, we are seeing a little bit, not across the board, not in all of the offerings in consulting, but where there is a little bit of discretionary labor, that is where we sense that pressure. 
What we are going to do is pivot into the areas around helping people become more productive, take more cost out, digital transformation, work with our partners where there is very strong demand in the market. And as you pivot there, we believe that our growth rate in Consulting will continue to accelerate. 
So I hope, Wamsi, that, that gave you a flavor on the demand vectors we have, both in Software and Infrastructure and in Consulting and on a geography basis. 
Jim, over to you for part 2.",327

Thank you. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As Arvind indicated in the prepared remarks, we couldn't be more excited about the powerful combination of HashiCorp with IBM and Red Hat together. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've been very disciplined in our set of criteria around M&A. And this fits strategically. It has tremendous synergistic value to our hybrid cloud and AI portfolio and it has an attractive financial return overall. 
And Hashi meets all three: One, it's a higher revenue growth profile company, so it accelerates IBM's revenue growth over time; two, to your question, adjusted EBITDA accretive in the first 12 months; and three, levered free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. We think there are a potential for meaningful synergies overall and, when we look at it, significant near-term operating efficiencies, cost synergies. And to put that in perspective, we see this business profile moving from about a mid-single-digit free cash flow margin business to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business in a handful of years, free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. 
Now the multiple we paid on that, fully supported by, one, the stand-alone revenue growth and the cost synergies that come out. All of the IBM revenue synergies around Red Hat, around data security, around watsonx, around consulting and IT automation are all upside potential. 
So let's talk and conclude on the cost synergy. Cost synergies are where you would fully expect. IBM runs a global operations in 175 countries. We run a very disciplined G&A-efficient structure. We see significant G&A operating efficiencies that we're going to go capitalize on. Second, running the playbook on how we expand it globally, our go-to-market model that we did with Red Hat, and that has both global incumbency, global scale, global breadth and ecosystem leverage overall. And when you look at that, those significant synergies allow us to invest in product, R&D, innovation and capability that's built into our case and also deliver our financial returns, so we feel pretty good about it.",350

I think that's about 60 basis points to company growth. Is there anything offsetting that? Or is that just kind of a rounding error, in the low single-digit guidance? 
And then my question is, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on the AI book of business, maybe just help clarify exactly how you define that. I think it's both revenue recognized and your bookings. And maybe partner bookings, maybe you could just help define that? And last quarter, you said it doubled sequentially. This quarter, you just commented that it grew sequentially, maybe you could add a little color. Was that double digits or 20% or 30% or 40%? And at least when I do the math, it sounds like it's less than 5% of your Consulting backlog, AI backlog. Could you help to mention that as well?",160
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950408.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,16,"Okay, Toni. Many questions here, let me see if I can get through them quick. You look at full year, full year, as Arvind indicated, we're maintaining our guidance on our model mid-single digit, I think, prudently just coming out of a first quarter. We've got a lot of work to do in the next 3 quarters, but I think prudently, at the low end of that model. By the way, that was very consistent with what we said 90 days ago. 
Now let's unpack that. When you take a look at full year, first of all, we are dealing with a stronger U.S. dollar. So we've given you supplemental chart, now we've lost basically about 1 point more of headwind on currency. 
Well, let's talk about the underlying fundamentals of our business across our segments because I think that's at the heart of your question. When you take a look at our growth at mid-single digit, one, we said software would grow slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. We are very pleased with our Software performance in the first quarter. We've accelerated growth from fourth quarter to 6% overall. We have a very strong recurring revenue base. We accelerated Red Hat to a very strong 9% with our third consecutive quarter of mid-teen booking growth, which positions our business extremely well for double-digit growth for the full year, and we're getting nice scale and leverage on acquisitions. 
Software for the year will deliver over 3 points of that IBM mid-single digit by itself. Based on that Red Hat momentum, acquisitions, solid recurring revenue; TP, by the way, nice start, up 4%; and new innovation like watsonx. Consulting, we said for the full year, appropriately, in light of the market and still gaining share, would be mid-single digits. That will deliver about 1.5 points of growth to IBM. Why did we feel good about that? One, solid book-to-bill, winning in key focus areas, strategic partnerships, Gen AI scale overall. But like first quarter, we're going to continue to monitor that backlog realization to see how that plays out. 
But between Software and Consulting, over 3 points in Software, about 1.5 points, now you get to Infrastructure. We started out well above what we expected here in the first quarter. Mainframe, eighth quarter in, grew 5%. Our Distributed Infrastructure, Power and Storage, both grew double digits as we're capitalizing on Distributed Infrastructure and demand requirements for Gen AI. Full year, that's a little bit better than what we thought 90 days ago off our first start, so we expect about a little bit less than 0.5 point impact to IBM. You throw on top of that, we executed the closure of The Weather Company, that would be about 0.5 point. So that's kind of how we build up our full year overall. 
So AI book of business, I think you nailed it in your question. It's, one, on a Consulting perspective, it's our signings book of business overall. And on our Software, it's our subscription, our SaaS and perpetual licenses. Again, as you know, we offer clients flexibility on how they want to purchase that overall. 
And Consulting backlog, yes, 5% overall. I would tell you, let's put it in perspective, it's probably mid- to high single digits. But we've got, give or take, about a $30 billion book of business on backlog with Consulting. So coming from where we started, less than 9 months ago, I think that's a very good ramp. And let's put it in perspective. When we drove the hybrid cloud platform-centric play with Consulting, which has done extremely well, over the first 4 quarters, we did a $1 billion book of business. Right now, through less than 3 quarters, we're very damn close to that $1 billion book of business.",637

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950410.0,Question,Benjamin Reitzes,,Analysts,18,"I wanted to ask about Red Hat. You accelerated it to 9% in the quarter from 7%. What is your confidence level you get to the mid-teens, which kind of equals your bookings growth? And then on Red Hat, the follow-up would be, how much can HashiCorp augment that growth rate? And can you clarify the synergies a little bit more between Red Hat and Hashi? And was Hashi needed to help grow Red Hat? Or is it a bonus? How do you see that?",85
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950411.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,19,"Ben, let me take the first part of those questions. We are very, very pleased with Red Hat. If I look at Red Hat now, we have had mid-teens or better bookings growth for the last 3 quarters, third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter. That, combined with the growth we are seeing in OpenShift as well as in both Ansible and RHEL, OpenShift growing almost 40%, gives us a lot of confidence. So bookings growth plus OpenShift plus what we're seeing in the revenue now at 9% tells us that we should see that Red Hat growth continue or accelerate through the year. 
Two, let me just address the macro point. Hashi is a nice add for the Red Hat portfolio. But it's not inside Red Hat, let's just be clear. So when we talk about Red Hat growth numbers in line and accelerating, that is Red Hat as is. Hashi will be measured in software, but in IBM software, not in Red Hat. Where the synergy comes is, we believe, there will be added demand because if a combined portfolio is more interesting, we think even more clients will talk to us. That is how Hashi will help Red Hat. It's not that the Hashi revenue counts at all for the numbers we just mentioned. So we kind of want to be clear on that. 
Hashi to us is an accelerant for IBM strategy and for software strategy, and Hashi helps in being offensive in terms of giving us an overall better portfolio. So even more clients want to do business with us in the environments they're going to. That's kind of how I'd pitch it. And people know Hashi really well for their infrastructure management, but the security pieces of Hashi are also very, very interesting and really important as people navigate these very complex environments with all the worries about people losing secrets and keys and that resulting ransomware or hacking attacks. And that's kind of how I would paint the picture on that side.",339

As you and I and many of the investors have talked about since first quarter earnings, we've kind of bifurcated this business when we saw the slowdown happen in second half last year between our subscription-based business within Red Hat versus our consumption-based services and offerings, the former being about 80% of our portfolio, the latter being about 20%. 
If you look at first quarter, as Arvind indicated, we're very pleased. Coming off of a 2-plus point acceleration positions us extremely well, even more confident in that double-digit for the year. But the reason why we're even more confident is that 80% of that portfolio, that subscription business, we accelerated 3 points quarter-to-quarter in revenue and we were above double digits. 
On the consumption base, we finally saw a stabilization. We didn't see acceleration, we saw stabilization. But remember, we start ramping on that in the second half, so that provides us a tailwind in the second half. But our subscription business today, the 80%, 3 points acceleration, double-digit in the first quarter, all 3 major lines broad-based double-digit bookings; Red Hat OpenShift, over 40% booking strength; $1.3 billion ARR book of business, growing 25-plus percent; Ansible taking share, we feel even more confident as I said.",216

If we include the Software AG assets and now HashiCorp, I think you spent about $16 billion on acquisitions since your 2021 Analyst Day. Back then, you talked about kind of having $20 billion to $25 billion of M&A firepower you could leverage through 2024. Just curious, as we sit here today, your willingness or desire to go after more M&A for the rest of this year, would you be willing to go kind of above and beyond that total that you had laid out almost 3 years ago? And just as we think about the potential targets in the future, where do you believe you have gaps that you can still fill within your portfolio?",123
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950415.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,23,"Erik, let me just maybe address the macro points on it, and I'll let Jim talk to some of the numbers here. We are going to remain incredibly disciplined on our M&A strategy. We kind of said it, but I just want to repeat, we've got to find things that meet our strategy, we've got to have some synergy opportunities at IBM, and it has to be financially accretive within the second year. So if we find things that meet that and we are committed, I'll say, to both our dividend and our investment-grade ratings, then that is kind of the picture we go in. Now within that, we believe we have some level of flexibility and that is what we will operate in. So that gives you a sense there. 
By the way, while we've got these 2 yet to come, we've got Software AG that we hope to close midyear and HashiCorp which will come near the end of the year, we also have to look at what is our overall internal dynamics of making sure that we can succeed on these businesses as we proceed down the path. We need to build consulting practices. We need to have synergy plays in other parts of the portfolio. We have to enable our sales teams globally. As we say, a big part of our synergy is getting the amplification from our global footprint that is there with clients all around the world. Jim?",244

Arvind, just building on your point, we are very confident in the capital structure of this company. We are committed to maintain a very solid investment-grade balance sheet.

Many have asked, it seems like the overall market is growing faster. What's going to take to unlock this incredible portfolio you've built to effectively maybe monetize at the rate the industry is growing out? Is there something that's causing friction to unlock that true potential of the Software business? Or are we just being too focused on the short term? What do you think unlocks that value in getting you to your closer TAM of the growth?",95
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950419.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,27,"So Brent, as you can imagine, we are very, very focused on that question. If I just want to lay out a 4-year trajectory, if you'll indulge me with just a minute, we began with a software portfolio that was, let's call it, flat, it would be a kind way of putting it, about 5 years ago. We've gone from flat to, as you said, some volatility. But we are now seeing that we can be north of 6% for this year, whether you want to call that 6.5% or 7%, and we are very confident in that. As we do organic innovation and as we do M&A, we will find that, that number will keep improving year-over-year. And I'm pointing to a very consistent 4-year trajectory of having achieved that. 
By the way, within that, we do find there are a couple of slower growing pieces, but they're incredibly important to our overall profile, both for incumbency with clients and for the cash flow that we produce. We would never expect our mainframe software, the TPS piece, to be growing in the high-single digits or in double digits. So as that mix also changes over time, then we find that we're going to get closer and closer. And we do want to, over time, get software to grow above where we are right now. So right now, we are at the upper end of the mid-single-digit model. I think you can conclude what would be the next step we will go at, and then we'll go from there.",259

Maybe, Arvind, if you could maybe give us a little bit of sense of what's going on in the pipeline there and whether or not you're seeing a substantial benefit in the Red Hat pipeline from the VMware acquisition, both on the consulting side as well as the software side. Are you seeing a lot of migration? And how much of an opportunity do you think might be there longer term to capture more share of that market?",82
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950422.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,30,"Brian, great question. So let me talk to some of the Red Hat dynamics. It's not so much directly related to VMware per se, but clients are all beginning to say, they're asking the question, which is the platform they want to bet on for the next 10 to 20 years on which they will write their applications, deploy them both in their own data centers and on public cloud. We find an incredible amount of interest in that question. And as we have built out the Red Hat portfolio not just for containers, because many people know OpenShift as a great container platform, but also for virtualization with both container-native virtualization and with the KVM hypervisor, we are finding a lot of interest around those topics. 
Then as we layer in, by the end of the year, the HashiCorp advantages of managing the infrastructure across all these environments, we do believe that, that will be an accelerant to the Red Hat portfolio. So first, RHEL has got its place as the primary place where people want to deploy, OpenShift as a platform for both containers and virtualization, Ansible and HashiCorp helping increase automation and reduce the complexity. We think all of this plays in. And Brian, I think the best number is the mid-teens bookings growth on the subscription side of the business. That speaks to the demand in terms of not only is there demand but we are realizing that demand in the book of business that we are getting clients to commit to on Red Hat.",259

And I think just we see so much of the news feed being around kind of the hype cycle, and obviously, growing $1 billion book of business shows you're monetizing it. Can you just talk about maybe the pain points that enterprises are looking to address when they first come to you or when those consulting relationships start? Like, how much of a plan is in place versus how much they're looking to you to kind of hold their hand in terms of this gen AI journey?",102
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2024",2024-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3914.0,3095608.0,111950425.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,33,"I think, Matt, that's a great question. So let me maybe take that, and I'll address it from both the consulting side and the software side. If we look 12 months ago, I would say that there was a lot of excitement and there was a lot of experimentation that we're starting, and people were not thinking through what does this mean for my overall ROI, what are the economics of running gen AI, how do I get the people changes done so that the ROI can actually be realized. 
What is happening in all of my conversations this year, in the first quarter of 2024, is a lot of people have woken up that those issues need to be addressed as well. So when they talk to our consulting team, they are spending energy on, but can you help my people also do the transformation it takes, what is the change process through which you can recognize those things. They then go to immediately asking, in these models, how expensive is it to run them. And they begin to do the math, wait, if I run this model just for this one business process, the infrastructure costs alone could be $300 million a year. That doesn't close the ROI, can I do it in a much more cost-effective way but an equally good answer, and that is where you begin to see some of the models that IBM has produced. Our Granite series play very strongly into helping them recognize their ROI by reducing the economics. 
And then lastly, and this is advice that I gave to the C-suite usually, and it resonates, don't take lots of little experiments, try to pick a few use cases which can scale. And by scale, meaning that they actually do impact a large fraction of their employees or their clients' customers and they begin to have a large impact in how business is done by either improving revenue or by making the enterprise significantly more productive. That's kind of a conversation shift from simply, oh, this is a neat new tool, let me try out to see what I can do, not what I should do, but what I can do. And I think that, that is a big change in terms of helping the organization scale. 
So let me now wrap up the call. In the first quarter of 2024, we have executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation, allowing us to invest organically and through strategic acquisitions like HashiCorp. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.",455

We delivered a strong quarter, exceeding our expectations driven by solid revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow generation. We had strong performance in software and infrastructure above our model as investment in innovation is yielding organic growth while consulting remained below model. Our results underscore the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and the strength of our diversified business. 
Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. Technology spending remains robust as it continues to serve as a key competitive advantage, allowing businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, and fuel growth. As we stated last quarter, factors such as interest rates and inflation impacted timing of decision-making and discretionary spend in consulting. Overall, we remain confident in the positive macro outlook for technology spending but acknowledge this impact. 
It has been a year since we introduced watsonx and our generative AI strategy to the market. We have infused AI across the business, from the tools clients use to manage and optimize their hybrid cloud environments; to our platform products across .ai, .data, and .gov; to infrastructure and consulting, you can find AI innovation in all of our segments. For example, in software, our broad suite of automation products like Apptio and watsonx Orchestrate are leveraging AI, and we expect to do the same with HashiCorp once the acquisition is complete. 
Red Hat is bringing AI to OpenShift AI and RHEL.ai. In Transaction Processing, we are seeing early momentum in watsonx Code Assistant for Z. In infrastructure, IBM Z is equipped with real-time AI inferencing capabilities. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and implement AI strategies. Our Enterprise AI strategy is resonating as we evolve to meet client needs. 
Let me start by discussing IBM models. Choosing the right AI model is crucial for success in scaling AI. While large general purpose models are great for starting on AI use cases, clients are finding that smaller models are essential for cost-effective AI strategies. Smaller models are also much easier to customize and tune. IBM's Granite models, ranging from 3 billion to 34 billion parameters and trained on 116 programming languages, consistently achieved top performance for a variety of coding tasks. To put costs in perspective, these fit-for-purpose models can be approximately 90% less expensive than large models. 
Hybrid cloud remains a top priority for clients as flexibility of deployment of AI models across multiple environments and data sovereignty remain a key focus. We believe in the power of open innovation and recently announced at IBM Think that we open-sourced IBM's Granite family of models now available under Apache 2.0 licenses on both Hugging Face and GitHub. We see parallels to Linux becoming dominant in the enterprise server space, thanks to the speed and innovation offered by open source. We are confident that the same dynamic will play out with AI as we benefit from developer mind share and community innovation. 
We also recently launched InstructLab, a tool for more rapid model tuning through synthetic data generation, allowing our clients to more efficiently customize models using their own data and expertise. The last 12 months of AI pilots has made it clear that sustained value from AI requires truly leveraging enterprise data. 
In summary, our AI strategy is a comprehensive platform play. RHEL AI and OpenShift AI are the foundation of our Enterprise AI platform. They combine open-source IBM Granite LLMs and InstructLab model alignment tools with full stack optimization, enterprise-grade security, and support and model indemnification. 
On top of that, we have an Enterprise AI middleware platform with watsonx and an embed strategy with our AI assistants infused through our software portfolio and those of our ecosystem partners. In addition, our consulting services are critical in helping clients build their AI strategies from the ground up. We also continue to see our Infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. 
Our book of business related to generative AI now stands at greater than $2 billion inception-to-date. The mix is roughly 1/4 software and 3/4 consulting signings. We believe these strong results highlight our momentum and traction with clients. Our early leadership positions us for long-term success and this transformational technology, which is still in the initial stages of adoption. 
As clients build out AI strategies, the IT landscape is becoming increasingly complex. Labor demographic shifts further emphasize the importance of optimizing IT spend and automating business processes. We continue to innovate and invest and have created a leading automation portfolio to capture this opportunity, which you can see in our results. This includes Apptio for cost management, capability for observability and resource management, and with the announced acquisition of HashiCorp, the automation of cloud infrastructure. 
The powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible and Terraform will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The latest addition to this portfolio is IBM Concert, also announced at Think, a GenAI-powered tool, which helps clients get end-to-end visibility across business applications. We also recently completed the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management, and data ingestion. 
Let me now spend a minute on the continued strength we are seeing in infrastructure. IBM Z, our mainframe solution, is an integral part of our clients' hybrid cloud environments, driving their most secure and mission-critical workloads. 
Our latest cycle, z16, is uniquely tailored to offer clients security, scalability, and resilience, which help clients address both cybersecurity threats and complex regulatory requirements. z16's Talum processor is a unique differentiator, driving real-time in-line AI inferencing at unprecedented speed and scale for applications like real-time fraud detection. 
Our storage offerings are also benefiting from generative AI as clients address data readiness and need high-speed access to massive volumes of unstructured data. We continue to invest in innovation and make great progress in emerging technology like Quantum computing. 
This quarter, we expanded Qiskit, IBM's Quantum computing software into a comprehensive stack aimed at optimizing performance on the utility-scale Quantum hardware. These updates aim to enhance the stability, efficiency, and usability of Qiskit, supporting advanced Quantum algorithm development and fostering broader adoption across various industries. 
The strong momentum and innovation across the portfolio manifests itself in client adoption. In virtually all industries and geographies, clients leverage IBM's solutions to help them transform their operations and create better experiences for end users. 
Names like Virgin Money, CrÃ©dit Mutuel and Panasonic all turned to IBM in the quarter. We also continue to strengthen our ecosystem. At our Think event, we announced a series of new AI partnerships with industry leaders like Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Mistral, Salesforce, and SAP. 
In May, IBM and Palo Alto Networks announced a partnership to deliver AI-powered security solutions using watsonx. As part of this, Palo Alto is acquiring IBM's QRadar SaaS assets, and we are partnering to offer seamless migration for QRadar customers to XM. IBM will train over 1,000 security consultants on Palo Alto Network products to drive a significant book of business with them. 
In summary, we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Given our first half performance, we are raising our expectations for free cash flow to greater than $12 billion for the year. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.",1243
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960645.0,Presenter Speech,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Arvind. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion of operating pretax income, and $2.43 operating diluted earnings per share. Our 4% revenue growth at constant currency, combined with greater than 200 basis points of operating pretax margin expansion, drove 17% operating pretax income growth and 11% operating diluted earnings per share growth, highlighting our strong execution. And through the first half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow generation is the strongest first half level we have reported in many years. 
We are pleased with these results, exceeding our expectations for revenue, profitability, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Revenue growth was led by software and infrastructure. It is clear that our investments in innovation are yielding results and driving strong organic growth across these segments. 
Software grew by 8% with solid growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing and strong transactional performance. Infrastructure had great performance, up 3%, delivering growth across IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure. Consulting was up 2% and continue to be impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. 
Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 190 basis points and operating pretax margin by 220 basis points over the last year, inclusive of about a 30 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. 
Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives. Driving productivity is core to our operating and financial model. This includes enabling a higher-value workforce through automation and AI, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, and reducing our real estate footprint. These actions allowed for continuing investment in innovation with R&D up 9% in the first half. This includes investments in both AI and hybrid cloud as well as infrastructure ahead of our next Z program in 2025, which we expect to accelerate our organic growth profile over time. 
Our results this quarter reflect broad-based growth and the strength in the fundamentals of our business, with revenue up about $300 million, operating pretax income up about $400 million, adjusted EBITDA up more than $350 million, and free cash flow up about $500 million. 
For the first half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this first half growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $550 million year-over-year, and timing of CapEx. We are a few points ahead of our 2-year average attainment levels through the first half. 
In terms of cash uses, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $16 billion, up $2.5 billion since year end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was flat with year end 2023 at $56.5 billion, including $11.1 billion from our financing business. 
Putting this all together, our business fundamentals remain solid with continued revenue growth, margin expansion, cash generation, and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business. 
Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing grew as clients leveraged the capabilities of our AI and hybrid cloud platforms. 
This performance reflects the investments we've been making in software, both organically, which drove more than 6 points of the growth as well as acquisitions. As mentioned in January, the software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, the combination of innovation, recurring revenue, and Transaction Processing as well as acquisitions. 
Let me spend a minute on each of these elements. In Red Hat, annual bookings growth accelerated to over 20% this quarter. Within that performance, OpenShift annual bookings were up over 40% and RHEL and Ansible growth was double digit. The strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions, including app modernization, management automation, generative AI, and virtualization. 
In the subscription-based business, the majority of revenue is under contract for the next 2 quarters. Think of it as our CRPO for the next 6 months. This metric is growing in the mid-teens and accelerated more than 5 points versus the first half of the year. 
We continue to bring new innovation to our portfolio and it's contributing nicely to our software performance. Our new innovation includes generative AI offerings like watsonx, our AI middleware, watsonx Assistant, the recently announced IBM Concert and others, which contributed about $0.5 billion to our AI book of business inception-to-date. And we delivered good growth across our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of the annual Software revenue. This is evident in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, where our ARR is now $14.1 billion and up 9% since last year. 
Transaction Processing delivered 13% revenue growth. This performance demonstrates the innovation and value of our mission-critical hardware stack across IBM Z, power and storage. The combination of growing demand for capacity, good client renewals, and strong large deal performance fueled our results. And notably, our new generative AI portfolio innovation, watsonx Code Assistant for Z is resonating well with clients. Together, these dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue growth again this quarter. 
Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from our focused M&A strategy, including synergies realized across the portfolio. This included the recent Apptio acquisition. Less than 12 months since closing, we have accelerated annual bookings and are seeing an uptick in ARR growth already in the mid-teens. The synergy between Apptio's FinOps offerings and our broader automation portfolio helps clients manage, optimize, and automate technology spending decisions. 
Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG and expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by year end. Looking at Software profit, gross profit margin expanded and segment profit was up over 350 basis points year-to-year, with the latter reflecting operating leverage driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our Consulting revenue was up 2%, consistent with last quarter and largely reflecting organic growth. In April, we discussed that we were seeing solid demand for our large transformational offerings as clients continue to prioritize driving productivity with AI and analytics. 
At the same time, we saw a pullback on discretionary projects as clients prioritized their spending. The second quarter buying behavior played out much in the same way. Signings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, driven by solid demand for large engagements across finance and supply chain transformation, cloud modernization, and application development. This contributed to backlog growth of 5% year-over-year and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remaining over 1.15. Meanwhile, continued discretionary spending constraints impacted our small engagement performance and backlog realization in the quarter. 
As Arvind mentioned, our book of business in generative AI inception-to-date is greater than $2 billion, and about 3/4 of it represents Consulting signings with strong quarter-over-quarter momentum. Our extensive industry and domain expertise has placed us in an early leadership role, which is crucial at the onset of a technology shift. IBM has both technology and consulting, which is a unique and powerful combination to help clients navigate this technology transition. 
Similar to previous technology shifts such as the advent of the Internet, globalization, and cloud computing, generative AI is driving the next wave of growth. In a human capital-based business, signings represents clients reprioritizing spend on this technology transition, while there is some potential for lift as the total addressable market expands. 
We are delivering value in 2 ways: first, partnering with our clients to design and scale AI solutions, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination. 
Second, we are developing new ways of working, driving productivity, and improving delivery, all with our Consulting Advantaged platform. In summary, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to grow revenues, cut costs and change the ways they work, creating a significant opportunity for us. 
We are seeing this already as IBM is the strategic partner of choice for clients using this technology, including WPP, Elevance Health and the U.K.'s Department of Work and Pensions. 
Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 6%, led by finance and supply chain transformations. Data transformation also contributed to growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth was driven by application modernization services. Application Operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management, partially offset by strength in cloud-based Application Management offerings. 
Looking at Consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margins by 40 basis points, driven by productivity and pricing actions we have taken. Segment profit margin was modestly down, reflecting continued labor inflation and currency. 
Moving to Infrastructure. Revenue was up 3%. We're capitalizing on the strong and broad-based demand for our hardware platforms, especially IBM Z. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, IBM Z revenue was up 8% this quarter. We're now more than 2 years into the z16 cycle and the revenue performance continues to outperform prior cycles. 
Our clients are facing increasing demands for workloads, given rapid business expansion, the complex regulatory environment, and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z addresses these needs with the combination of cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability. 
Increasing workloads translates to more Z capacity or MIPS, which are up about threefold over the last few cycles. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving both hardware and related software, storage, and services adoption. 
In Distributed Infrastructure, revenue grew 5%, driven by strength in both power and storage. Power growth was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10 led by SAP HANA. Storage delivered growth again this quarter, including growth in high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and solutions tailored to protect, manage, and access data for scaling generative AI. 
Looking at Infrastructure profit, we delivered solid gross profit margin expansion, and segment profit accelerated quarter-to-quarter to the high teens. Segment profit margin was down 230 basis points in the quarter, reflecting key investments we're making in the business across areas like AI, hybrid cloud, and Quantum and almost 1 point of impact due to currency. 
Now let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our performance in the first half, with revenue growth reflecting the investments we've been making both organically as well as acquisitions. Our focus on execution and the strength in the fundamentals of our business resulted in strong performance in the quarter across revenue, margin expansion, and growth in profitability and earnings. 
Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on revenue. We see full year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. 
For free cash flow, given the strength in our performance in the first half, we feel confident in raising our expectations to greater than $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. This also includes a modest contribution resulting from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, largely offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. We continue to expect to curate our transaction to close by the end of the third quarter. 
On to segments. In Software, we had solid first half performance, up more than 7%. This performance reflects strength in our recurring revenue base and early traction in GenAI. With this performance, we are raising our view of growth in Software to high single digits for the year. And given ongoing productivity initiatives and operating leverage, we now expect Software segment profit margin to expand by over 1 point. 
In Consulting, given the continued pressure we have seen on spending related to discretionary projects, we now expect low single-digit growth for the year and segment profit margin to expand by about 0.5 point. And given the strength in Infrastructure in the first half, we now expect it to be about neutral for the year with segment profit margin in the mid- to high teens. 
With these segment dynamics, we are raising our expectations of operating pretax margin expansion to over 0.5 point year-to-year. And we are maintaining our view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range, consistent with last year. 
On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 100 to 200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year. For the third quarter, we see revenue growth consistent with the full year. For profit, we expect our net income skew through the third quarter to remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year, driven by the strength of our business. And again, we expect a gain in the Palo Alto QRadar transaction will be offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and for the first half, driving confidence in our updated expectations. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit, and grow free cash flow for the year.

How should we think about the trajectory of that in 2024 and maybe in 2025? I know, Jim, you noted a few different things, including solid client renewals and some strong large deal performance. Was there anything very episodic or unusually large within that mix as well?",72

I appreciate the question overall. Very important. If you take a step back, we continue to be very pleased with our Transaction Processing performance overall. If you dial back to when we laid out our midterm model, we said we converted this to a growth vector, low single-digit overall. And if you look at the last couple of years, we've been averaging mid-single digit or better overall. We shifted this now to a growth contributor. And why is that important?
One, high source of profit and cash to fund investment flexibility; and two, it provides a very solid incumbency base for the IBM or multiplier effect. But if you take a look at it, we are capitalizing on the strength that we've seen over the last 3 programs of our mainframe cycle. It's really instantiating the enduring value of that platform. Our MIPS over the last few programs are up 3x from an install perspective, and over 80% of our clients are growing MIPS on the mainframe.
I think that was a very different picture when you dial back 5, 7 years ago already. So we've taken that portfolio. We've invested now significantly, which I'll come to around watsonx Code Assistant for Z, but we've taken that from a down mid-single-digit portfolio to now capitalizing on the stack economics of our mainframe execution and moved that to low single digit. Now for the year, as you heard, we are taking up our guidance, just given the strength of first half to mid-single digit.
When you get into 2025, we'll talk about our guidance going forward, but we feel very confident that we can continue growing this, and that's why we're investing in bringing out new capabilities like watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which is resonating extremely well.",299

And part of the reason I asked the question is if I -- it looks like your AI book of business was up about $1 billion sequentially. You're saying 3/4 of that is Consulting so that's $700-plus million in Consulting signings in the quarter.
If I take that out, your book-to-bill in the rest of your business is actually down. And despite the strong signings, you're lowering your consulting expectations for the year. So I'm just wondering, do you think AI investments in Consulting are a shift in spending? Or do you think they're accretive? Or do you actually think they could even be cannibalistic to Consulting spend and more broadly, IT spend?",140
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960652.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,10,"So Toni, let me start and then Jim will add more color on this topic. First, it's a great question and he laid out some of the dynamics that were going on in there. If we just step back and just look at our comments on the macroeconomic environment, we kind of stated that there is discretionary spend pressure in consulting. When you do have that pressure but there is a demand for AI, I would look you in the eye and say, probably the bulk of that demand, not all, but the bulk is indeed a shift from other areas of consulting.
We don't actually believe it's cannibalistic to the point you're pointing out. Now as time goes on and as people move from early experimentation and proving out the value to wanting to scale and really get the full benefits of generative AI, we do actually believe at that point even for consulting, these will turn into accretive and additive. But we are still some time away from when that will happen. That is just to give you some color and acknowledging that the bulk but not all is a shift. Jim?",194
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960653.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,11,"Yes. Thanks, Toni, for the question. Just building on what Arvind said, I mean, first of all, we're very pleased with the early momentum that we've gotten with our book of business around GenAI, both on the technology side with our watsonx platform and now with our open innovation strategy around RHEL AI, OpenShift Granite models, InstructLab, et cetera.
But let's just deep -- dive a little deeper into your question about Consulting. Because I think when you look at Consulting, first of all, why is it so important right now in an early part of the cycle? It's important because it's got to establish IBM Consulting as the strategic provider of choice for enterprises as they're going through what we like to call Digital Transformation 2.0 with GenAI. Everyone is looking for who is going to be their strategic provider and partner. And I think $1.5 billion, over $1.5 billion book of business in the first 12 months which, by the way, is in excess of the ramp we saw play out with hybrid cloud and Red Hat, we're off to a pretty good start.
Now to Arvind's point, in every technology shift, very different dynamics between a human capital-based business and a product IP business. Human capital-based business, we do see and we expected clients will shift and reprioritize spending. They're doing that now as they're driving large enterprise transformation projects, which is what our portfolio has been able to capture. And that's why you see nice acceleration in growth in our backlog up healthy at 5%.
But to Arvind's point, we do think once you get through the early cycle, this is a incremental expansion of TAM that drives a long-tail growth vector over time that has multiplier opportunities for us. So when you look at our Consulting book of business, let's dive into the subsegments, you see Business Transformation services, which a lot of the GenAI plays out too early right now. That is how do you transform the way you operate, HR, finance, supply chain. We've doubled and accelerated our growth quarter-to-quarter.
What you're seeing is a reprioritization in dynamic spending decisions by clients because our AO where we have a lot of short-term discretionary staff augmentation work, there's a lot of trade-offs between those 2. So it's important for us strategically with our client base. But I think you see how it plays out.
Now just to wrap up full picture. Software, I think, is fundamentally different. Our Software book of business now, $0.5 billion through the first 12 months. I think inception-to-date right now, we're about 2/3 subscription, SaaS, 1/3 perpetual. I think that's contributing nicely about 1 point of growth. And by the way, that's 1 of the 2 components of why we took our Software up for the year. So I think that's predominantly all lift.",475

112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960655.0,Question,Amit Daryanani,,Analysts,13,"My question is really on the Consulting side. And when I think about this business growing low single digits for '24, if I take out some of the M&A contribution, also some of the revenues from the AI book of business that you have at $1.5 billion, is it fair to think that maybe the non-AI Consulting piece actually gets worse in H2 versus H1 for you? If you could just talk about the puts and takes on the back half Consulting expectations versus front half, that would be really helpful. .
And then I'm curious, if you talk to your customers, what is your sense on the duration of this weakness in Consulting? And when do you think, its time to come back?",124
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960656.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,14,"Right. So Amit, let me just start and maybe address the second part of your question first and then -- I actually do not believe there's any secular macro trend around weakness. I think that this is temporal based on a number of factors we have. The geopolitical uncertainty has gone longer than most people expected, and that weighs into people's heads about what that might happen and specifically the war in Europe as well as the war in the Middle East.
Second, inflation has gone longer than people expected, which has the unfortunate consequence of higher interest rates and that begins to bear on people. If I look at those 2 altogether and that then at the moment, you have higher interest rates and inflation, you have wage inflation, which does impact the bottom line of our clients. You put all of that into perspective and is this going to go on for another 6 months? Likely. Is it going to go on for another year? I'm not so sure, but we got to get through the second half to be able to go there.
So that is why we are optimistic about the medium- and long-term vector on Consulting. And as Jim answered in the prior question, we do see that this is going to become a tailwind over time, at least for us. Now in the short term, for the next 6 months, we do think it holds up a little bit. In terms of answering the specifics and sort of decomposing some of the numbers that you laid out in the first part of your question, I'm going to turn that over to Jim.",278
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960657.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,15,"Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Amit, for the question overall. Let's put this in perspective, right? You go back 90 days ago. How did we see the year playing out with Consulting? 
We said at that point in time, we had backlog growing nicely mid-single digit, albeit we did talk about durations going up because large-scale transformations were really where the spend was moving to. But we had a solid book-to-bill trailing 12 months over 1.15.
We had GenAI momentum that was going to continue throughout the year, early in the cycle. We had strategic partnerships, Red Hat growth profile. And we had future acquisitions as we're going to continue to be opportunistic around our M&A criteria and the synergistic value of how Consulting plays to our portfolio. 
If you look right now, 90 days later, as we look to the second half, many of those are still playing out. You got GenAI, which arguably we're above our own expectations right now, doubling by the way, in Consulting.
Our GenAI book of business quarter-to-quarter, strategic partnerships, especially hyperscalers, Red Hat still growing nicely. What you're seeing at the end of the day, those are large-scale transformations, lower yield. That's why Arvind and I are saying, these are longer-term growth vectors and tails that will play out into '25, '26, and beyond as we get that strategic provider of choice. 
But in the interim, what you're seeing is that spending reprioritization around short-term discretionary that I think everyone in the industry is talking about and we're all dealing with this.
The key is we have to win that strategic provider of choice in GenAI. And I would argue we're off to a great start. If you look at competitor numbers overall, we got $1.5 billion, over $1.5 billion book of business doubling quarter-to-quarter right now. I think we're in pretty good shape. That's what we're focused on because that will provide the future revenue multiplier effect as we move forward.",329

And do you believe you have sufficient scale in open source and DevOps software in particular? And can you maybe comment on the attractiveness of multiples in the public market today relative to the private market?,71

Look, on overall M&A, I just want to begin with that our strategy has not changed. We are disciplined and we are focused. By focused, I mean, we stick to the areas that we are investing in, hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. And by disciplined, I mean, it has to be not just aligned to our strategy, but we expect synergy from the acquisition, especially the multiples are higher as you pointed out.
And it has to be accretive to free cash flow. If it's larger, definitely within 2 years at the other end of the range. So having said that, if I look at it right now, we have HashiCorp out there so we've got to get through that. We expect that to happen in the second half of this year. We just finished StreamSets and webMethods. And we've done a couple of smaller ones in the Consulting space and in other technology tuck-ins.
What do we see going into the space? Our valuation is rich, they're reasonably rich. They're not outrageous, I would say, like they had become in parts of late 2020 and 2021. So I would say that they are more reasonable than then, but they're richer than they were about 18 months ago. 
There are different dynamics in both the public and the private markets. Public markets are quite variable. I mean, as we can see, some of the multiples, and if you look at multiple to revenue, which is not a great metric, let me just acknowledge that. But it is one that's out there.
If you look at 6, 7, 8, maybe 9 or 10 times, we can see our way there for a large deal as long as we have sufficient synergy. Now for very small deals, that's not even a fair multiple. Very small deals are all about technology and people. 
In the private markets, we were very pleased with what we got done on StreamSets and webMethods. I would call that a private market deal, not a public market deal. And there, I think it all depends upon what's the property, what is its growth profile? What is the attractiveness of it to the seller versus the buyer, in this case, us? All of that play into those multiples.
I do expect that on the private side, valuations will be slightly less, but then the risk of going public or some other exit is also taken away. And in some sense, you get a discount for taking that risk off the table. People who are venture-backed, that's different. They are looking at IPO versus a strategic exit and those are different multiples.
But putting all of that together, we remain in the market M&A is an important part of our growth methodology. We maintain a strong balance sheet for that purpose and we've kind of been clear of that. All that said, this year, we got a big one coming. So we want to wait and get that done because part of the discipline is also making sure that we kind of digest them at the right rate and pace and put them into our global go-to-market distribution engine.",538

So while I appreciate that you guide to free cash flow and you've raised it a little bit, do you anticipate us being able to flow through the $0.25 of upside on the EPS line? And can -- does that mean earnings is sustainable in the back half?
And then I was just wondering if you have any more info on HashiCorp. In terms of the revenue contribution, Street was looking for about $750 million in revenue next year, and on the dilution, there should be a loss of around $0.30 in interest income. So just wondering if you have any further views on the net effect to 2025 on that deal.",137
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960663.0,Answer,James Kavanaugh,,Executives,21,"Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Very good question overall. But let's take a step back on your first part of the question around free cash flow. Yes, we're very pleased with the start of the year. Free cash flow of $4.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year-to-year, 4 points above historical attainment. It's our largest first half free cash flow generation as far back as I can go and count. So we're off to a pretty good start, and that gives us the confidence overall of how we're positioning second half.
But the second half and why we took the guidance up is entirely driven by the strength of the fundamentals of our business and flowing through the adjusted EBITDA overachievement. So read that, although we don't guide on EPS, the strong overachievement of the $0.25 of EPS, we're flowing that through to adjusted EBITDA, and that flows through to our guide take-up on free cash flow. The rest of the free cash flow dynamics we've been talking about all year long around, yes, we got benefits of change in retirement plans and cash tax that's going to be a headwind and other balance sheet items, none of that changes.
One thing I will bring up, and we said in the prepared remarks but just so there's absolute clarity, we do expect to close the Palo Alto transaction here in the third quarter around certain assets of our QRadar business that will obviously generate a gain. We're excited about the new strategic relationship between our 2 great companies overall, but we will take structural actions to offset that gain to address stranded costs.
And oh, by the way, to your second part of your question, to accelerate our productivity initiatives in 2025. So you get to HashiCorp. First of all, the strategic transaction stands on its own. Arvind went through our M&A criteria. I think there's a very compelling strategic fit around an end-to-end leadership hybrid cloud platform. There's a lot of synergistic value both on product technology and go-to-market, but there's a very attractive financial profile that we talked about 90 days ago, higher revenue growth profile, adjusted EBITDA accretive in 12 months, free cash flow accretive, to Arvind's point, by 2 years.
And we do see potential significant near-term cost and operating synergies that lead to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business over a handful of years. Now when you look at dilution, we understand dilution. I mean, M&A has been an integral part of our financial model for decades. So underneath that, we understand the purchase growth of those transactions, the synergies of those transactions, the balance sheet capital structure implications of those.
And with all that said, our model is to grow mid-single-digit revenue and grow operating leverage so we grow free cash flow quicker than revenue. We don't see that changing in 2025. We see growth profiles around revenue, around operating leverage and around free cash flow overall. And that speaks to the diversity or diversification, I should say, of our business model around productivity. 
We entered the year, raised it to $3 billion. We're getting out ahead of that again. And you see that play out in our margins through the first half, what, up 180 basis points on pretax. So we've got many levers to deal with this overall. We know how to handle it.",565

Over the last few quarters, you've talked about some very healthy bookings growth numbers ranging anywhere between, call it, 15% and 20%. But we did see growth obviously decelerate by about 1 point this quarter despite expectations that it would be flat to maybe increasing for the rest of the year. So can you just kind of double-click on exactly what you're seeing with the Red Hat business today? What's the offset to the strong bookings numbers? And how should we think about Red Hat growth now in constant currency for 2024?",111
112350.0,"International Business Machines Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2024",2024-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,International Business Machines Corporation,3790.0,3195168.0,113960666.0,Answer,Arvind Krishna,,Executives,24,"Great question, Erik. So let's just look at the Red Hat business in terms of how the dynamics function between our clients and ourselves. So clients come in, create demand. We fulfill that. That shows up as bookings, not as revenue because the Red Hat business model is a pure consumption business model. Clients pay for what they're consuming and so the bookings then play out. Now those bookings are a signal of further demand. And typically, they're anywhere from 1 to 3 years' worth of revenue that the client is pre-committing to.
So when we enter a year, about half the revenue, we can look at the bookings of the previous year and say that, that gives us. The other half has to come over the quarter. Now that we have a year, not longer, but a year of the double-digit demand that you're talking about, if I remember right, it was 14%, 17%, 14%, 20% in terms of those demands. Now that, that full year is there, that points to that for the portion that we can see.
And as we get into a quarter, it climbs up from the 50% to 60% to 70% to 80%. And Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks what he called CRPO or the revenue performance obligations. We see those sitting around mid-teens for the second half of the year, to answer your question. 
Now if that's about 80% then that will translate into low double digit is what we can look at and feel quite comfortable on. By the way, we see these early signs of the demand continue into this quarter and likely the half, which means that we expect to continue now in the low double digits going forward.
So I hope that, that gives you a sense. But I'm also excited by the underlying product capabilities. We see OpenShift, which is extremely important. It plays into containerization. It plays into virtualization. It's an important element of how our clients exercise hybrid. It has been growing, and the demand there grew again at about 40% this past quarter. But we also saw acceleration in Linux and in Ansible, where both of those demand vectors grown through the low double digits. That, given the size of the Linux business, is very good news for us going forward.
So I hope that, that gives you some color on those pieces. And a vector that we have not talked about that will play but probably into '25 and '26, we are very excited by our 2 open source AI projects inside the Red Hat business, RHEL AI as well as OpenShift AI. And as people begin to deploy at scale but not only on public cloud but also on-premise, leveraging their hybrid environment, we expect that both of those will also contribute into the Red Hat business. But that will take more time.",481

So I'm sorry we didn't get to it fully. We'll get to it now in this question. Look, the whole question comes down to, there was a thesis out there about 1.5 years ago that maybe 1, maybe 2 extremely large models are going to run away with the bulk of the market share. We always felt that was both technically and economically infeasible and I'll describe why.
If you run an extremely large model on public cloud, the model by its nature is going to be expensive because a very large model needs a lot more compute, a lot more network, a lot more storage, a lot more memory. And we can see some of those dynamics play out. If you can drop the model size, you can drop all of that by 90%. I would actually tell you, 99% reduction in the compute and memory and network cost, but let's call it 90% just for the sake of argument.
So if you are running a -- like one of our clients was describing to me, they run a couple of billion transactions through their internal systems each day. If they had to go service those out to a large public cloud, the bill per day would have come back to be a couple of hundred million dollars. You multiply that by 250, that's kind of an infeasible cost. If you can drop it by 90%, you're now bringing it down to the $10 million to $20 million a day. If you can actually run it using some of our Red Hat technologies on-premise, you can drop it by another 50%. You're now talking $5 million to $10 million. For what it can do, that is a very attractive proposition.
So now getting back to the models. If you have no idea what you're going to do, if you have no idea what you might be looking for, you go to a very large model because it contains all the possible elements. If you have a sense of what you need to do, I need to summarize e-mails. You need an English-language model if you're sitting here in the United States. If you are going to go change your Java or C++ or Python program has to be more productive, you don't need a model that can write poetry and draw images. You need a model that understands programming languages.
So we are very, very proud of what our team has done. We can produce models that can do these things. So these are 2 distinct models: 1 for programming, 1 for business language. They are 1/10 or less than that of the size of the extremely large models. But you can look on the leaderboard, they perform quite as well as the largest models. So that is what our strategy is. However, if our clients want other models, we are also happy to work with other models, and we have had that perspective.
So why open source, since that was part of your question. Why open source is, because often we find that clients want to increase the model's efficacy by adding their own unique language. People might want to write e-mails in a certain way. They might want a program in a certain way. They like comments in a certain style. I call that refining the model. We have a technique called InstructLab but then clients get concerned. ""Wait, if I add my data, I don't want to give that away and back into a more public format. Can I keep that to myself?""
So open sourcing our models under the Apache license gives our clients the freedom that what they add on to our underlying open model, they can keep to themselves. Now to the developer point, putting all of that machinery into Red Hat Linux now gives us an avenue to open it up to developers as they can go experiment and play. 
By the way, I'll turn around and tell you that for a developer who's not running production, who's just playing with things, like how people do it on a MacBook, you can begin to play around with models that are in the low tens of billions of parameters. That's a massive market that opens up.
They get the freedom and flexibility that they don't have to give it back to us unless they want to. I am not actually concerned about this gives away the IP. As we have found through whether it's Red Hat Linux or whether other people have found through Mongo or other people have found through Hadoop, enterprises do look for, and the last few days have certainly shown us, people look for patching, people look for security, people look for password compatibility. There's a lot of enterprise reasons why people will still do business with us.
But the open source nature of what you asked, and I'm so glad you did, allows us to expand that market into the millions of developers who do run Linux on their home machines or their corporate machines or their laptops. And they can go experiment, add their innovation and either give it back to the community or actually reserve it for their enterprise. So that's how we tap into the whole developer ecosystem.
So let me now wrap up the call. In the second quarter of 2024, we executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation. We saw strong performance across our portfolio. We're excited about our early traction in generative AI. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year. Thank you, all.",964
